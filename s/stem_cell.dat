Beginning in 2004, she favored what many {{consider to be}} the Democratic Party's position, and urged President George W.

Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his campaign for a second term.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v.

Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research itself.|$|E

5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and roan horses. Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect {{only a portion of}} the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented skin and hair.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

The cellular compartment includes hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{and some}} other stromal cell types, while the acellular compartment is composed of scaffold proteins known as the extra cellular matrix. Direct cell-cell contact as well as cytokines secreted by mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> during coculture of hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{play a critical role}} in hematopoiesis, and determines the fate of hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Several studies have demonstrated the impact of mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> on self-renewal, expansion, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro, which have shown different and contradictory results.

In addition, to explore the possibility of establishing a unique phenotypic fingerprint of these <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by identifying the unique markers {{that can be used}} to isolate these <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> This, in future will help in developing better techniques and markers for identification and utilization of these <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> for regenerative therapy...|$|R
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> donor is available.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> can {{be derived}} from the embryo (embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> ESCs), from adult tissues (adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> ASCs), and by {{induction}} of fibroblasts (induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> iPSs). Ethical problems, immunological rejection, and difficulties in obtaining human tissues limit the use of ESCs in clinical medicine. Induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are difficult to maintain in vitro and carry a greater risk of tumor formation. Furthermore, the complexity of maintenance and propagation is especially difficult in the clinic. Adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can be isolated from several adult tissues and present the possibility of self-transplantation for the clinical treatment of a variety of human diseases. Recently, several ASCs have been successfully isolated and cultured in vitro, including hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (HSCs), mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (MSCs), epidermis <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> neural <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (NSCs), adipose-derived <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (ADSCs), islet <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> and germ line <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> originate mainly from bone marrow, cord blood, and placenta, but epidermis-derived MSCs have not yet been isolated.
