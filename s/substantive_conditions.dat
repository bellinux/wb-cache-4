It first {{appeared}} from Global Health Governance via [URL] Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) represents a significant opportunity to realize the right to health globally. However, in order to succeed the FCGH must be carefully considered: it must take a new evidence-based approach that departs meaningfully from past shortcomings in realizing the right to health. Central to this approach is recognizing, formally incorporating, and operationalizing the right to adequate food. This right should be correctly interpreted as a right to a standard of nutritional quality and not as a right to a minimum number of calories. Because nutrition is critical to the achievement and maintenance of good health, particularly for the most deprived populations, this right is an indispensable <b>substantive</b> <b>condition</b> of achieving the right to health. In addition to helping the FCGH to be effective, the right to adequate food will help it achieve comprehensiveness, legitimacy, and efficiency. There are several ways the right to adequate food can be operationalized in tandem with the right to health, including through formal enshrinement in health and other policies, and through the enactment of several types of measures to improve dietary behaviors and health outcomes. Incorporating a broadly conceived right to adequate food into the FCGH acknowledges and formally takes steps to address nutrition’s critical role in realizing the right to health, particularly for the most deprived populations. It will strengthen the FCGH and improve its chances of success...|$|R
40|$|For {{over two}} decades, Industrial Relations (IR) {{has been under}} {{challenge}} both as an academic field (especially in terms of teaching) and as a term to describe work-related policies. This challenge has coincided with a decline in collective regulation of working conditions, associated efforts to re-orientate both academic and policy discourse, and substantial changes to work organisation. While IR journals continue to flourish, {{it is not clear}} to what extent the field has confronted these challenges. In particular, to what extent has the field sought to chart the consequences of these changes for <b>substantive</b> working <b>conditions</b> (SWC) ? This paper seeks to answer this question by reviewing 1349 publications in eight major IR journals (2002 - 2008). This review finds that SWC (such as wages and OHS) were the primary focus of only 20 percent of articles. More detailed analysis revealed systematic analysis of SWC in 23 percent. We argue that in order to renew itself as a discipline and a major contributor to policy debates over work employment, IR must engage more directly with changes in SWC. <b>Substantive</b> working <b>conditions</b> can provide a measure of inequality at work which has consequences not only for workers but the wider community. Our paper points to research in other fields that IR scholars should seek to engage with and to contribute to.

30|$|In this paper, I {{develop an}} {{approach}} {{that is based on}} procedural political theory. The underlying thought is that people do not have to agree on <b>substantive</b> <b>conditions</b> which tell when a person is responsible as long as they agree on the procedure for distributing the responsibilities (given that they have a shared understanding of what responsibility means. The latter is important to prevent people from talking at cross-purposes). If such a procedure, or its outcome, is accepted by all people involved as representing the “fair terms of cooperation,” this might help reconcile the pluralist responsibility conceptions and, ultimately, alleviate the problem of many hands. In order to test the applicability of political theory to responsibility distributions, the model of procedural justice is applied to a real case. The guiding question is whether a procedural approach contributes to reconciling the pluralist responsibility conceptions.|$|E
40|$|Within Shī ͑ī {{works of}} Sharī ͑a legal theory (uṣūl al-fiqh) {{there is a}} {{theoretical}} space for reason as an independent source of normativity alongside the Qur’ān and the Prophetic tradition. This space stems from a meta-ethical moral rationalism considered fundamental to Shī ͑ī theology. The position holds that unmediated reason is capable of understanding the morally praiseworthy and the morally blameworthy independently of revelation. Describing themselves as ͑Adliyya (literally the people of Justice) this meta-ethical position allows the Shī ͑a to attribute a substantive rational conception of justice to God, {{both in terms of}} His actions and His regulative instructions (aḥkām). Despite the Shīʿī adoption of this meta-ethical position, and the jurisprudential space held for independent rationality that implies rational morality must be a condition for the validity of any Sharī ͑a precept attributed to a Just God, independent judgements of rational morality play little or no role in the actual inference of Sharī ͑a norms within mainstream contemporary Shī ͑ī thought. As part of a search for an ʿAdliyya reading of Sharī ͑a, this study examines the theoretical reason for why this moral rationalism plays no substantive role in the actual inference of Sharī ͑a precpets through a close examination of the notion of independent rationality as a source in modern Shī ͑ī uṣūl al-fiqh. The obstacles preventing the ͑Adliyya moral rationalism from impacting the reading of fiqh in modern Shī ͑ī thought are shown to be purely epistemic. In line with the ‘emic’ approach adopted through the study, these epistemic obstcales are revistsed with the view of identifying scope for allowing a reading of Sharī ͑a that is consistent with the fundamental theological moral rationalism of Shī ͑ī thought. It is argued that judgements of rational morality, even when not definitively certain, can not be ignored {{in the face of the}} apparent meaning of texts that are themselves also not certain. A move towards an ͑Adliyya reading of Sharī ͑a demands that the strength of independent rational evidences be reconciled against the strength of any other apparently conflicting evidences such that independent judgements of rational morality act as a <b>substantive</b> <b>condition</b> for the validity of precpets attributed to a Just and moral God. ...|$|R

However, there is increasing skepticism {{about the importance of}} contagion and, as has long been known, S-shaped diffusion curves can also result from heterogeneity in the propensity to adopt. To gain insight into the role of these two differentâ€”though not mutually exclusiveâ€”mechanisms, we present <b>substantive</b> conjectures about <b>conditions</b> under which contagion and heterogeneity are more pronounced, and test these conjectures using a meta-analysis of the q/p ratio in applications of the Bass diffusion model. We find that the q/p ratio is positively associated with the Gini index of income inequality in a country, supporting the heterogeneity-in-thresholds interpretation. We also find evidence that q/p varies as predicted by the G/SG diffusion model, but the evidence vanishes once we control for national culture. As to contagion, we find that the q/p ratio varies systematically with the four Hofstede dimensions of national culture, and for three of them in a pattern theoretically consistent with the social contagion interpretation. Furthermore, we find that products with competing standards have a higher q/p ratio, which is again consistent with the social contagion interpretation. Finally, we find effects of national culture only for products without competing standards, suggesting that technological effects and culturally mediated social contagion effects may not operate independently from each other. income heterogeneity;innovation diffusion;meta-analysis;national culture;social contagion...|$|R

In the subsequent part of the thesis, the author discusses the sources of patent law in general and in relation to biotechnological inventions. The chapter is divided into three parts - international, European and national sources. Discussion regarding European sources is split into two subsections dealing with EPC and EU law. The author examines in particular the complicated legislative procedure for the adoption of the Directive 98 / 44 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 6 th July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions and its impact on European patent law.

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether the so-called reasonably affordable {{requirements of the}} public remains a valid condition under TRIPS on which World Trade Organisation members can grant compulsory licences. This article frames its analysis around Section 84 of the Indian Patent Act 1970 {{in relation to the}} compulsory licencing case between Bayer vs Natco. The author argues that despite the reasonably affordable requirements of the public not one of the common grounds on which members normally pursue for granting compulsory licences the fact that India has used similar provisions under its TRIPS-compliant patent regime in granting a compulsory licence to Natco significantly validates the affordability requirements of the public as an independent condition that is consistent with TRIPS on which members can grant compulsory licences. This conclusion is premised on the understanding that no member state has even attempted to challenge the legality of India's decision before the WTO, under the dispute settlement understanding system and that paucity is more supportive of the thesis that, nothing in the light of TRIPS would, in fact, preclude the possibility of other developing countries amending their patent laws to demand that as <b>substantive</b> <b>conditions</b> patentees must satisfy the reasonably affordable requirements of the publi...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{significant}} cardiovascular effects of exogenous apelin administration, including the potent activation of cardiac contraction. However, {{the role of}} the endogenous apelin-APJ pathway is less clear. To study the loss of endogenous apelin-APJ signaling, we generated mice lacking either the ligand (apelin) or the receptor (APJ). Apelin-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and showed normal development. In contrast, APJ-deficient mice were not born in the expected Mendelian ratio, and many showed cardiovascular developmental defects. Under basal conditions, both apelin and APJ null mice that survived to adulthood manifested modest decrements in contractile function. However, with exercise stress both mutant lines demonstrated consistent and striking decreases in exercise capacity. To explain these findings, we explored the role of autocrine signaling in vitro using field stimulation of isolated left ventricular cardiomyocytes lacking either apelin or APJ. Both groups manifested less sarcomeric shortening and impaired velocity of contraction and relaxation with no difference in calcium transient. Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenous apelin-APJ signaling plays a modest role in maintaining basal cardiac function in adult mice with a more <b>substantive</b> role during <b>conditions</b> of stress. In addition, an autocrine pathway seems to exist in myocardial cells, the ablation of which reduces cellular contraction without change in calcium transient.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} {{ways in which}} our rational credences are constrained: by norms governing our opinions about counterfactuals, by the opinions of other agents, and by our own previous opinions. In Chapter 1, I discuss ordinary language judgments about sequences of counterfactuals, and then discuss intuitions about norms governing our credence in counterfactuals. I argue that in both cases, a good theory of our judgments calls for a static semantics on which counterfactuals have <b>substantive</b> truth <b>conditions,</b> such as the variably strict conditional semantic theories given in STALNAKER 1968 and LEWIS 1973 a. In particular, I demonstrate that given plausible assumptions, norms governing our credences about objective chances entail intuitive norms governing our opinions about counterfactuals. I argue that my pragmatic accounts of our intuitions dominate semantic theories given by VON FINTEL 2001, GILLIES 2007, and EDGINGTON 2008. In Chapter 2, I state constraints on what credence constitutes a perfect compromise between agents who have different credences in a proposition. It is sometimes taken for granted that disagreeing agents achieve a perfect compromise by splitting the difference in their credences. In this chapter, I develop and defend an alternative strategy for perfect compromise, according to which agents perfectly compromise by coordinating on the credences that they collectively most prefer, given their purely epistemic values. In Chapter 3, I say how your past credences should constrain your present credences. (cont.) In particular, I develop a procedure for rationally updating your credences in de se propositions, or sets of centered worlds. I argue that in forming an updated credence distribution, you must first use information you recall from your previous self to form a hypothetical credence distribution, and then change this hypothetical distribution to reflect information you have genuinely learned as time has passed. In making this proposal precise, I argue that your recalling information from your previous self resembles a familiar process: agents' gaining information from each other through ordinary communication. by Sarah Moss.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the theory of}} ‘Revisioning Service Ideals and Client Realities’, which emerged from a classic grounded theory study of health care practitioners working within Condition Management Programmes. As part of a UK government initiative, Condition Management Programmes provided back to work support for incapacity benefit claimants. Practitioners’ main concern was identified as being person driven within a service driven organisation. While the diverse needs of individual clients could not be met by a ‘one size fits all’ approach, practitioners were aware that the service could not be so individualised as to deconstruct its purpose. The theory emerging from this PhD study offers a conceptual explanation of the means through which this concern is resolved, explaining {{the way in which}} practitioners make situational adaptations to their practice in order to deviate from or retreat within service boundaries. By cycling iteratively between deconstructing and reinstating service ideals, practitioners are able to create a reverberating equilibrium between the expectations and realities of practice, negotiating a person driven approach without compromising service structures completely. The theory was developed using the full complement of classic grounded theory procedures and is based on interviews with 35 practitioners and observations of 26 client sessions. Informal observations, programme documentation, case notes and extant literature were also included as data. Although developed within the <b>substantive</b> area of <b>Condition</b> Management Programmes, by offering a conceptual explanation of the behaviour of service workers at a ground level, the theory has relevance to wider areas, most notably to theories of bureaucracy, organisations and policy implementation...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} claims of Optimality Theory is that by varying the rankings of universal constraints, different grammars result (Prince & Smolensky 1993). Just as the ranking A » B should define an occurring language, so should the ranking B ≫ A. In this paper, we examine this claim {{in the domain of}} tongue root harmony systems, specifically with respect to the behaviour of low vowels. We examine cases where the relative ranking of faithfulness conditions and alignment conditions is varied with respect to <b>substantive</b> <b>conditions</b> governing low vowels. Our primary conclusions are twofold. First, we find that the types of typological variation expected to occur do occur; six different types of harmony patterns are presented. Second, we note that a large degree of variation is attested in a very narrowly defined area of the phonology. This paper begins by a basic discussion of the formal constraints assumed to govern vowel harmony, followed by a discussion of a case where low vowels harmonise in a manner comparable to other vowels (Degema). We then turn to six cases (five languages) where we observe asymmetric behaviour. First, we discuss cases involving constraints against feature "insertion" and feature "spreading ", constraints of the faithfulness family (Yoruba, Konni, Ngbaka-Ma'bo). Second, we turn to cases involving constraints of the alignment family, cases where harmony exhibits directional asymmetries (Ngbaka-Ma'bo, Emalhe, Maasai) ...|$|E

It is quite liberating, really, to abandon the idea of a rule of recognition.

Based on Directive No. 98 / 71 /EC, the Council Regulation (EU) No. 6 / 2002 of 12 December 2001 on community designs and patterns has been issued, being compulsory in all its elements and applying directly to all member states. Thus, a special legal protection has been provided, which is meant to encourage individual creators to bring forward innovation, the development of new products and investments in their manufacturing. In order to implement the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 6 / 2002, the Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2245 / 2002 of 21 October 2002 has been adopted.

In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, there may be procedural unconscionability when consent is only the result of fear of deportation or imprisonment, and <b>substantive</b> unconscionability when <b>conditions</b> after return include no access to basic necessities or persecution. At the same time, many asylum seekers and refugees do wish to return, despite conditions in the country of origin or because of conditions in the host country. Ethical issues regarding consent are therefore central. Yet, it is unclear how one would ensure consent under such conditions. While {{it may be possible to}} apply principles of paternalism and hypothetical consent in such cases, this may undermine the rights of those who wish to repatriate, and remove an option they otherwise would not have. This article argues that Parfit's Principle of Consent (CP) and Rights Principle (RP) may address these concerns and applies these principles to test for the unconscionability of two policies of repatriation of refugees and failed asylum seekers in Israel back to countries in Africa between 2009 and 2013. One policy was implemented by an NGO that repatriated failed asylum seekers to countries deemed safe, although returnees had no legal status to stay in Israel and were therefore at risk of deportation. A second NGO returned individuals to South Sudan, even though this was considered dangerous, but only returned South Sudanese who had the legal status to stay in Israel, as this was considered criteria for true voluntariness in the decision to return. By attempting to apply CP and RP in a test for unconscionability, this article addresses both the ethical dilemmas of repatriation of failed asylum seekers and refugees, as well as possible ways in which contracts, more generally, can be tested for unconscionability...|$|R

Classic liberalism views human freedom generally as the absence of governmental restrictions, maintaining that happiness, prosperity and progress can be achieved only by limiting government. The dissertation challenges these traditional assumptions by showing that the protection of fundamental rights depends on both restraint and intervention of the state. Therefore, the realization of freedom, equality and justice should not be left to market forces but requires active governmental participation. The state assumes positive as well as negative obligations under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This means that governmental authorities, legislatures and courts must respect, protect and promote Charter guarantees. The Charter makes space for economic, social and cultural fights, which presuppose a cooperative and dialogical relationship between the three governmental branches (executive, legislative, and judicial bodies). The thesis also grapples with another issue in the current Canadian constitutional debate. It is widely believed that federalism is antagonistic to liberal values, in particular the guarantees of the Charter; that the nature and purpose of the Charter imply a superior role of Ottawa vis-a-vis the provinces because cultural diversity and decentralization of power undermine its effectiveness. The dissertation recasts the debate and proposes ways to reconcile human rights with federalism and its underlying objective [...] -the preservation of cultural diversity. It offers an analytical framework {{that allows us to}} view fundamental rights and cultural pluralism as interdependent and indivisible values protected by the Canadian Constitution. The thesis concludes with a proposal for a multicultural interpretation of the Charter on the basis of which cultural differences can be identified and accommodated. It stipulates that a pluralistic constitutional discourse is possible insofar as the Charter is seen as a document establishing <b>substantive</b> and institutional <b>conditions</b> for Canadians to engage in deliberative democracy and, thereby facilitating communicative actions by citizens from all walks of life...|$|R
