5|$|On {{the night}} of 30 January Mubarak's <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> holiday villa was guarded by a small force of armed and loyal police who turned away all {{approaching}} vehicles. <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> had seen no deaths and minimal trouble. Military aircraft were visible from the local airport's perimeter fence, although the airport was frequently used by the armed forces for operations. It {{was also one of}} the hubs for private air travel in and around Egypt, but most light aircraft had departed earlier that day.|$|E
5|$|As {{the protesters}} started marching onto the Presidential Palace in the morning, Mubarak {{and his family}} {{reportedly}} left the Palace by helicopter which {{took them to the}} nearby Almaza Airbase, where they boarded the Presidential jet and headed to <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh.</b> Former Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali fled to Beirut.|$|E
25|$|After {{numerous}} skirmishes on {{the outskirts}} of <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> Yoffe ordered an attack on the port around midnight on 4 November. After four hours of heavy fighting, Yoffe ordered his men to retreat. On the morning of 5 November, Israeli forces launched a massive artillery barrage and napalm strikes against Egyptian forces defending <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh.</b> At 9:30am on 5 November, the Egyptian commander, Colonel Raouf Mahfouz Zaki, surrendered <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh.</b>|$|E
25|$|To outflank <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> Dayan ordered paratroopers to {{take the}} town of Tor in the western Sinai. The Egyptian forces at <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> had the {{advantage}} of holding one of the most strongly fortified positions in the entire Sinai, but had been subjected to heavy Israeli air attacks {{from the beginning of the}} war. Yoffe set out for <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> on 2 November, and his major obstacles were the terrain and vehicle break-down. Israeli Navy ships provided support to the 9th Division during its advance.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, several shark attacks {{occurred}} off the South Sinai resort of <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|By 3 November, {{with the}} IDF having {{successfully}} taken the Gaza Strip, Arish, the Hedgehog, and Mitla Pass, <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> {{was the last}} Israeli objective. The main difficulty faced by Colonel Abraham Yoffe's 9th Infantry Brigade was logistical. There were no good roads linking Ras an-Naqb to <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh.</b> After taking the border town of Ras an-Naqb on 30 October, Dayan ordered Yoffe to wait until air superiority was ensured.|$|E
25|$|The 2005 <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> {{attacks were}} {{a series of}} bomb attacks on 23 July 2005, {{targeting}} the Egyptian resort city of <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> located on {{the southern tip of}} the Sinai Peninsula. 88 people were killed and over 150 were wounded by the blasts, making the attack the deadliest terrorist action in the country's history. The bombing coincided with Egypt's Revolution Day, which commemorates Nasser's 1952 overthrow of King Farouk.|$|E
25|$|Since the Israeli–Egyptian peace treaty, Sinai's scenic spots (including {{coral reefs}} offshore) and {{religious}} structures have become {{important to the}} tourism industry. The most popular tourist destination in Sinai are Mount Sinai (Jabal Musa) and St Catherine's Monastery, which {{is considered to be}} the oldest working Christian monastery in the world, and the beach resorts of <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> Dahab, Nuweiba and Taba. Most tourists arrive at <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> International Airport, through Eilat, Israel and the Taba Border Crossing, by road from Cairo or by ferry from Aqaba in Jordan.|$|E
25|$|Operation Kadesh {{received}} {{its name from}} ancient Kadesh, located in the northern Sinai and mentioned {{several times in the}} Hebrew Pentateuch. Israeli military planning for this operation in the Sinai hinged on four main military objectives; <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> Arish, Abu Uwayulah, and the Gaza Strip. The Egyptian blockade of the Tiran Straits was based at <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> and, by capturing the town, Israel would have access to the Red Sea {{for the first time since}} 1953, which would allow it to restore the trade benefits of secure passage to the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> Fact-Finding Committee (an investigatory {{committee}} {{set up to}} {{look into}} the causes behind the breakdown in the peace process, chaired by George J. Mitchell) published its report in May 2001.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest city}} of Sinai is Arish, {{capital of the}} North Sinai, with around 160,000 residents. Other larger {{settlements}} include <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> and El-Tor, on the southern coast. Inland Sinai is arid, mountainous and sparsely populated, the largest settlements being Saint Catherine and Nekhel.|$|E
25|$|Following Cousteau's visit, {{the site}} was {{forgotten}} about except by local fishermen. In the early 1990s, <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> began to develop as a diving resort. Recreational diving on the Thistlegorm restarted following the visit of the dive boat Poolster, using information from another Israeli fishing boat captain.|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, Mubarak hosted an {{emergency}} summit meeting at <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> {{to discuss the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In attendance were: U.S. President Bill Clinton, P.L.O. Chairman Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, King Abdullah of Jordan, NATO Sec. General Javier Solana, and U.N. Sec. General Kofi Annan.|$|E
25|$|Ayalon was {{a member}} of the Israeli {{delegations}} to <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> (1997), Wye Plantation (1998) and Camp David (2000) summits. From 1993–1997, he served as the Director of the Bureau of Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations in New York City. He was Israel’s Ambassador to Panama from 1991–1992.|$|E
25|$|In early October 1973 Nachumi {{was among}} two F-4 Phantom crews on quick {{reaction}} alert duty at Ofir air force base, near <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> at {{the southern tip of}} the Sinai. Neither pilots were qualified as pair leaders, but on the morning of October 6, {{when it became clear that}} war was imminent, Nachumi was promoted on the phone by squadron leader Yiftah Spector.|$|E
25|$|The task {{of taking}} Shadwan was {{assigned}} to the IDF's Paratroopers Brigade under the command of Haim Nadal. Its 202nd Battalion, commanded by Lt. Colonel Ya'acov Hasdai, and the brigade's elite reconnaissance company (Sayeret Tzanhanim), commanded by Captain Motti Paz, were to land on the island. These were to be assisted Shayetet-13 operators, while additional paratroops were to be at hand at <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> and on nearby Israeli Navy vessels.|$|E
25|$|As the paratroopers {{were being}} {{dropped into the}} Sinai, the Israeli 9th Infantry Brigade {{captured}} Ras al-Naqb, an important staging ground for that brigade's later attack against <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh.</b> Instead of attacking the town by a frontal attack, they enveloped the town in a night attack, and negotiated their way {{through some of the}} natural chokepoints into the rear of the town, surprising the Egyptians before they could ready themselves to defend. The Egyptians surrendered, with no Israeli casualties sustained.|$|E
25|$|Many {{consider}} the <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> Summit on 8 February 2005 {{to be the}} end of the Second Intifada, when President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon agreed that all Palestinians would stop all acts of violence against all Israelis everywhere and, in parallel, that Israel would cease all its military activity against all Palestinians everywhere. They reaffirmed their commitment to the Roadmap for Peace which began at Madrid. However, the violence did not stop in the following years, though suicide bombings decreased significantly.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{off from}} <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> {{the task force}} flew along the {{international}} flight path over the Red Sea, mostly flying at a height {{of no more than}} 30m (100ft) to avoid radar detection by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces. Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned south and passed south of Djibouti. From there, they went to a point northeast of Nairobi, Kenya, likely across Somalia and the Ogaden area of Ethiopia. They turned west, passing through the African Rift Valley and over Lake Victoria.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Egypt and Israel {{signed a}} peace treaty in which Israel agreed to {{withdraw}} from the entirety of Sinai. Israel subsequently withdrew in several stages, ending in 1982. The Israeli pull-out involved dismantling almost all Israeli settlements, including the settlement of Yamit in north-eastern Sinai. The exception was the coastal city of <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> which the Israelis had founded as Ofira during the period of their occupation. The Treaty allows monitoring of Sinai by the Multinational Force and Observers, and limits the number of Egyptian military forces in the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, he hosted two summits at <b>Sharm</b> <b>El-Sheikh</b> {{and one at}} Taba in {{an effort}} to resume the Camp David {{negotiations}} suspended in July 2000, and in June 2003, Mubarak hosted President George W. Bush for another summit on Middle East peace process. Another summit was convened in Sharm El Sheik in early 2005, which was attended by Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan. The Egyptian Chief of Intelligence, General Omar Suleiman, has played a substantial role in negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and is highly respected on both sides.|$|E
25|$|MP platoons {{were present}} in the ten major combat brigades, and {{accompanied}} them into combat in the Sinai Peninsula. Outposts were erected in Gaza, Mount Libni, Abu Rudeis, el-Arish, Qantarah and <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh.</b> From the moment an area was captured, MPs were ordered to make Hebrew road and direction signs, an operation which was completed ten days {{after the end of the}} war. A POW camp was built next to Mishmar HaNegev, through which about 5,000 Egyptian POWs were moved to the permanent camp in Atlit. In total, 6,748 POWs were captured by Israel, of them 5,237 Egyptian, 899 Jordanian and 572 Syrian. The corps was also responsible for preventing the rampant Arab looting within the Gaza Strip.|$|E
25|$|Following {{international}} pressure and Israeli threat of wide military {{operation in the}} Gaza Strip, Abbas ordered Palestinian police to deploy in the northern Gaza Strip to prevent Qassam rocket and mortar shelling over Israeli settlement. Although attacks on Israelis did not stop completely, they decreased sharply. On 8 February 2005, at the <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> Summit of 2005, Sharon and Abbas declared a mutual truce between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. They shook hands at a four-way summit that also included Jordan and Egypt at Sharm al-Sheikh. However, Hamas and Islamic Jihad said the truce is not binding for their members. Israel has not withdrawn its demand to dismantle terrorist infrastructure before moving ahead in the Road map for peace.|$|E
25|$|On 28 February 2011, the General Prosecutor of Egypt {{issued an}} order prohibiting Mubarak {{and his family}} from leaving Egypt. It was {{reported}} that Mubarak was in contact with his lawyer in case of possible criminal charges against him. As a result, Mubarak {{and his family were}} placed under house arrest at a presidential palace in the Red Sea resort of <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh.</b> On 13 April 2011, a prosecutor originally appointed by Mubarak ordered the former president and both his sons to be detained for 15 days of questioning about allegations of corruption and abuse of power amid growing suspicion that the Egyptian military was more aligned with the Mubaraks than with the revolution. Gamal and Alaa were jailed in Tora Prison; state television reported that Mubarak was in police custody in a hospital near his residence following a heart attack. Former Israeli Cabinet minister Benjamin Ben Eliezer told Israeli Radio that he had offered Mubarak refuge in the southern Israeli city of Eilat.|$|E
25|$|The ending {{date of the}} Second Intifada is disputed, {{as there}} was no {{definite}} event that brought it to an end. Some commentators such as Sever Plocker consider the intifada to have ended in late 2004. With the sickness and then death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004, the Palestinians lost their internationally recognised leader of the previous three decades, after which the intifada lost momentum and lead to internal fighting between Palestinian factions (most notably the Fatah–Hamas conflict), as well as conflict within Fatah itself. Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, announced in June 2004 completed in August 2005, is also cited, for instance by Ramzy Baroud, as signalling {{the end of the}} intifada. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas vowed in the days leading to the <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> Summit of 2005 that it would mark the end of the intifada. The summit resulted in Abbas declaring violence would come to an end, and Ariel Sharon agreeing to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw from West Bank towns, some consider this to be the official end of the Second Intifada, although sporadic violence still continued outside PA control or condolence. On February 8, 2005 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced the cease-fire. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) refused to be parties to the agreement, the cease-fire being the position of the Palestinian Authority only. Five days later Abbass reached agreement with the two dissenting organisations to commit to the truce with the proviso that Israeli violation would be met with retaliation. Schachter addressed the difficulties in deciding when this intifada ended. He reasoned that suicide bombing was the best criterion, being arguably the most important element of second intifada-related violence, and that according to this criterion the intifada ended during 2005.|$|E
500|$|According to Sadat, it {{was only}} when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian {{garrison}} at <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> that Nasser became aware of the situation's gravity. After hearing of the attack, he rushed to army headquarters to inquire about the military situation. The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into [...] "a nonstop shouting match". The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser–Amer rivalry and Amer's overall incompetence. According to Egyptian diplomat Ismail Fahmi, who became foreign minister during Sadat's presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt's consequent defeat was a result of Nasser's dismissal of all rational analysis of the situation and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions.|$|E
500|$|Ever {{since it}} {{occupied}} the Sinai in 1967, Israel had openly declared it {{would remain in}} <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> to ensure the sea lanes to the port of Eilat through the Straits of Tiran remained opened (the closing of the Straits to Israeli shipping in 1967 {{was one of the}} causes of the Six Day War). Egypt aimed to nullify Sharm el-Sheikh's importance to Israel by imposing a naval blockade at the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, almost [...] from Israel. To this end, arrangements were made with Pakistan to receive Egyptian vessels for repair early in 1973. Approval was sought, and obtained, from Sudan and Yemen to receive the submarines on their way to Pakistan in Port Sudan and Aden as a friendly visit. Pakistan's approval to receive Egyptian vessels for repairs were made public. On 1 October, a force containing several submarines, destroyers and missile boats set sail on a route planned to ensure their arrival at Bab-el-Mandeb on October 6. The fleet was fully equipped for combat, and the force was ordered to maintain complete radio silence; which meant there was no way of recalling the submarines. The commanding officers, unaware of their real mission, were issued sealed envelopes detailing their orders and mission, and were instructed to open the envelopes on 6 October, only a few hours before the war was to begin, whereupon they would break their radio silence. Once the fleet had set sail that day, 1 October, [...] "the war had effectively begun".|$|E
2500|$|These explosions {{followed}} other bombings {{elsewhere in}} the Sinai Peninsula in previous [...] years: in <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> on 23 July 2005 and in Taba on 6 October 2004.|$|E
2500|$|This {{support has}} {{continued}} to the present, with former President Hosni Mubarak often intervening personally to promote peace negotiations. In 1996, he hosted the <b>Sharm</b> <b>El-Sheikh</b> [...] "Summit of the Peacemakers" [...] attended by President Bill Clinton and other world leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Commenters have however {{pointed out}} that Israel had already promised to release these same 104 Palestinians, back in 1999 under the <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> Memorandum, but never did. Critics also worry that Israel will simply quietly re-arrest the {{potentially}} released Palestinians, and state that Israel is using the slow release to hold the negotiations hostage and that the main goal of the release is to bolster Israel's image. According to the <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> Fact-Finding Committee Report, Israel's decision not to release the prisoners {{at the time was}} due to significantly increased violence against Israel by their partner in the memorandum, the PLO, leading up to the Second Intifada. In the time leading up to the planned release, Israel perceived [...] "institutionalized anti-Israel, anti-Jewish incitement; the release from detention of terrorists; the failure to control illegal weapons; and the actual conduct of violent operations" [...] as a sign that [...] "the PLO has explicitly violated its renunciation of terrorism and other acts of violence, thereby significantly eroding trust between the parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paz's troops, {{attempting}} to flank the Egyptian {{forces from the}} west, met with resistance on the defensive perimeter's western side, only to enter a minefield. One officer, Lt. Israel Bat-Lev, was killed and several injured, and the force withdrew, leaving the posts codenamed [...] "Dafna" [...] and [...] "Dvora" [...] in Egyptian hands. At 10:30 the reserve force at <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> led by Lt. Colonel Amos Yaron was therefore dispatched to the island.|$|E
2500|$|On November 2, Simhoni led {{his troops}} in the {{occupation}} of Gaza which ended with the surrender of the local governor and commander {{of the armed forces}} in the Gaza Strip. During these operations, which lasted eight days with minimal number of casualties, they were mainly successful in attaining their immediate military objectives: [...] successfully capturing the Gaza Strip, Arish, the Hedgehog, and Mitla Pass, <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> was the last Israeli objective. On November 6, in <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> the chief of staff Moshe Dayan, Simchoni and brigade commander 9 division, and Avraham Yoffe, surveyed the conclusion of the war. During his command, in certain events, Simhoni led the restructuring of the IDF combat doctrine whereby the Armored Corps is the main decisive force in land. That move was directly contrary to the wishes of the Chief of General Staff Moshe Dayan. However, it was aligned with the opinion of David Ben-Gurion at the time. Additionally, following the lesson from the War in Sinai, the IDF combat doctrine has since been based entirely on the element of surprise, rapid movement and maneuvering, concentrated efforts, and quick operations. This doctrine led to further success it was applied to later wars.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-October, Clinton and {{the parties}} held a summit in Sharm El Sheikh, {{resulting}} in a [...] "Sharm memorandum" [...] with understandings aimed at ending the violence and renewing security cooperation. From 18 to 23 December they held negotiations, followed by Clinton's presentation of his [...] "parameters", in a last attempt to achieve peace in the [...] Middle East before his second term ended in January 2001. Although the official statements stated that both parties had accepted the Clinton Parameters with reservations, these reservations in fact meant that the parties had rejected the parameters on certain essential points. On 2 January 2001, the Palestinians put forward their acceptance with some fundamental objections. Barak accepted the parameters with a 20-page letter of reservations. A <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> summit planned for 28 December did not take place.|$|E
2500|$|According to The Christian Science Monitor, {{concern about}} the {{possible}} use by terrorist organizations of the Sinai desert with the aid and cooperation of Sinai Bedouin has been growing in 2010. [...] Although in the past concern {{has focused on the}} use of the Sinai by international Islamist organizations believed to operate there in cooperation with Sinai Bedouin, but the rise of Hamas in Gaza has increased concern about an expansion of Hamas terrorist infrastructure into Sinai. [...] In April 2010, 26 members of an alleged Hezbollah spy cell were convicted by an Egyptian court on charges including planning attacks on tourist sites and smuggling weapons form Sinai Hamas in Gaza. [...] Earlier terrorist attacks on Egyptian beach resorts in Sinai including <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> and [...] southern Taba are thought to have been the work of international terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda, in cooperation with Sinai Bedouin.|$|E
2500|$|On November 6, 1956, Upon {{completion}} of the victory parade in <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh,</b> Simhoni took off in a small plane to El-Tor to visit other units. His plane took off from El-Tor at dusk toward Ramat David Airbase. His intention was to visit his family in Tel Yosef and Geva. However, because of severe weather conditions and poor visibility the plane veered off course and crashed in {{the grounds of the}} crusader fortress, Ajlun Castle, in Jordan (About 25km southeast of Beit She'an). Asaf Simhoni, then [...] a colonel, Head of Southern Command, and the pilot Benjamin Gordon ( [...] ) died in the crash. According to some accounts, Simhoni had a meeting with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to prove to him, using secret documents, that contrary to the allegation of the chief of staff, he did not violate an order when he ordered Armored Brigade into Sinai.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of June, Palestinian factions {{intensified}} bombardment over the city of Sderot with improvised Qassam rockets. Palestinian attacks resulted in 2 Palestinians and 1 Chinese civilian killed by a Qassam, and 2 Israelis were killed. The wave of attacks lessened support for the disengagement plan among the Israeli public. Attacks on Israel by the Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades increased in July, and on 12 July, a suicide bombing hit the coastal city of Netanya, killing 5 civilians. On 14 July, Hamas started to shell Israeli settlements {{inside and outside the}} Gaza Strip with dozens of Qassam rockets, killing an Israeli woman. On 15 July, Israel resumed its [...] "targeted killing" [...] policy, killing 7 Hamas militants and bombing about 4 Hamas facilities. The continuation of shelling rockets over Israeli settlements, and street battles between Hamas militants and Palestinian policemen, threatened to shatter the truce agreed in the <b>Sharm</b> <b>el-Sheikh</b> Summit of 2005. The Israeli Defence Force also started to build up armored forces around the Gaza Strip in response to the shelling.|$|E
