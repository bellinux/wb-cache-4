40|$|The {{adequacy}} of the <b>shelflist</b> count for estimating {{the size of a}} library’s holdings in a discipline was tested by determining the percentage of titles in five disciplines which were classified in Dewey or LC classes reflecting those disciplines. For some disciplines, the percentage of titles which were not classified in the relevant class letters or numbers ran as high as 70 and 80 percent. Two methods for correcting inaccurate <b>shelflist</b> counts are presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{rudiments of}} a {{strategy}} for assessing the appropriateness of using an expert system in a given domain are presented. The assessment process involves comparing {{the characteristics of the}} domain with various suitability criteria and identifying potential benefits from an expert system in the domain. Two library technical service functions, descriptive cataloging and <b>shelflisting,</b> are used as models illustrating this assessment process. Based on organizational factors specific to the Library of Congress, series work (a subset of descriptive cataloging) and <b>shelflisting</b> appear to be suitable and beneficial candidates for expert system development efforts. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

We study the computational complexity of the corresponding product arrangement problem when consumers are either rational maximizers, use a satisficing procedure, or apply successive choice. The complexity results we report are shown to crucially depend on the size of the top cycle in consumers' preferences over products and on the direction in which alternatives on the shelf are encountered.

With the <b>shelflist</b> as a source, punched cards were pro-duced {{for each of the}} volumes in the collection. After the cards were inserted in volumes in the collection, approximately one-tenth re-mained without matching books. Investigation uncovered that, of this total, 27 percent proved to be keypunching errors, 1 percent were labeling or typing errors, 11 percent were books that were subsequent-ly located, and 61 percent (representing 6 percent of the total collec-tion) were judged to be lost.

Supply and demand proportions are then analyzed for both 207 and 21 Library of Congress divisions, and the correlation between demand percentages is discussed.

It is noted that the job responsibilities of these clerks fall into four areas with specific duties relating to each: maintenance of the collection; the circulation of materials; {{the maintenance of a}} pleasant and orderly environment; and the provision of a variety of direct services to support the instructional program. Specific duties described include materials selection and processing, organization, check-out, shelving, repair, and card catalog and <b>shelflist</b> maintenance. The manual concludes with a glossary and 20 appendices. The latter include an IMC clerk self-evaluation form, bills of rights from the American Library Association and the American Association of School Libraries, and a variety of library procedural forms.

40|$|In December 1997, {{the authors}} {{completed}} an in-depth collection assessment {{project at the}} University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Libraries. The purpose {{was to develop a}} framework for future collection assessment projects by completing a multifaceted evaluation of the libraries' monograph and serial collections in the subject area of drug resistance. Evaluators adapted and synthesized several traditional collection assessment tools, including <b>shelflist</b> measurement, bibliography and standard list checking, and citation analysis. Throughout the project, evaluators explored strategies to overcome some of the problems inherent in the application of traditional collection assessment methods to the evaluation of biomedical collections. Their efforts resulted in the identification of standard monographs and core journals for the subject area, a measurement of the collections' strength relative to the collections of benchmark libraries, and a foundation for future collection development within the subject area. The project's primary outcome was a collection assessment methodology that has potential application to both internal and cooperative collection development in medical, pharmaceutical, and other health sciences libraries...|$|E

40|$|The Statewide Assessment {{project was}} begun in 2000 and used an {{automated}} assessment tool called ICAS (Interactive Collection Analysis Service). ICAS uses data {{from either the}} OCLC records in an individual institution???s online catalog or the OCLC WorldCat database. ICAS provides information and reports at the levels of individual libraries, and different combinations of libraries. Our report analyzed the Illinois collection and individual library collections based on the call number ranges (quite similar to the National <b>Shelflist</b> Count ranges). The analysis was done by division (50 large subject areas such as Language and Literature), by category (500 call number ranges), by age, by subject (5, 000 descriptors), and by 32 languages. The counts are done by title, not item, which gives a more accurate picture of the holdings in a library by eliminating multiple copies of a title in an individual library. Studies were done by age, by uniqueness and by overlap to identify those subjects, which contain {{a large number of}} unique items and conversely by the gaps in materials present in the libraries and in the state. The project was funded by the ICCMP and by contributions from participating libraries. The final reports were delivered in the Fall of 2004.

The Seven Years War (1756 - 1763) when Britain was challenging France for control of the American colony had already resulted in the loss of one French city. Since 1663 Quebec had been the capital of New France and the center of the fur trade in North America. The city had been unsuccessfully attacked by the English in 1690 and 1711. But in June 1759 English and American forces under General James Wolfe besieged the walled city. Eventually the French openly attacked on the Plains of Abraham but the British/American force defeated the French under Montcalm and captured Quebec. On 18 th September 1759 the Governor of Quebec surrendered the city to Britain. The taking of Quebec {{was the beginning of the}} end of French rule in Canada.
