We focus on two performance measures, i. e. <b>sales</b> <b>margin</b> and earnings to average total asset (ROA). Firms recognizing impairment losses experienced the decrease in ROA before. After the recognition of impairment losses, ROA was improved. That time-series movement is consistent with the conventional view. However, profit margin did not change in such a clear manner. Although, some firms with impairment losses smoothed earnings, we can find only weak evidence on earnings increasing management. On the other hand, we detect the strong evidence of "big bath" accounting. Our results imply the defects in accounting standards of impaired assets, which permits the large room of managerial discretion. ...|$|E

40|$|Macroeconomists have {{traditionally}} ignored {{the behavior of}} temporary price markdowns ("sales") by retailers. Although sales are common in the micro price data, they {{are assumed to be}} unrelated to macroeconomic phenomena and generally filtered out. We challenge this view. First, using the 1996 - 2012 data set of the U. K. CPI monthly price quotes, we document a roughly twofold increase in the frequency of sales during the Great Recession. We also present evidence of countercyclical sales in the United States. Second, we build a New Keynesian macroeconomic model in which temporary sales arise as a pricing mechanism that allows retailers to price discriminate across consumers with different opportunity costs of time. In line with our empirical evidence, the model predicts that firms react to macroeconomic shocks by varying the frequency of sales. In response to a monetary contraction, firms facing costs of decreasing regular prices post more sales, and households spend more time looking for sales. The resulting fall in the aggregate price level can be significantly larger than if sales were ignored. When the model is calibrated to match the behavior of sales in the data, it implies that the <b>sales</b> <b>margin</b> leads to a much smaller response of real consumption to monetary shocks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study an {{extension}} of a two-period inventory management problem with positively correlated demands in which the manager’s compensation is partially based on an external, market-based assessment of the firm’s value. As typically the “real ” demand is only observed internally in the firm, the manager may ship more than the real demand to downstream customers and report higher than real sales revenues to influence the external firm valuation, which is known as “channel stuffing. ” As it is costly and {{does not reflect the}} real demand, channel stuffing destroys the firm’s value. We identify three factors that drive the manager’s incentives for channel stuffing: the marginal effect, the boundary effect and the carryover effect. The marginal effect, analogous to those earnings management incentives revealed in the literature (e. g., Stein, 1989), is independent of the inventory problem, while the boundary and carryover effects arise from the nature of the inventory problem. The boundary effect occurs when the real demand realization is high, but, still less than the available inventory: reporting a “sold out ” situation censors the upper tail of the demand distribution, and hence, leads to an increase in market valuation that the manager would like to cash in with channel stuffing. The carryover effect occurs when the real demand realization is low. In this scenario, channel stuffing would make the firm’s future performance look more rosy because of positively correlated future demand and high future <b>sales</b> <b>margin</b> as the firm will be able to satisfy the future demand from the large current inventory. When examining the initial inventory decision, we find that under rational market valuation, both over- and under-investment may arise in presence of channel stuffing incentives. Based on our model analysis, we derive empirically testable hypotheses for channel stuffing...|$|E

Therefore, it is now necessary to assess the annual efficiency performance of white leg shrimp farms {{in order to improve}} Vietnam’s aquaculture policy. This paper based on a character sample of 61 white leg shrimp farmers in Khanh Hoa province, representing about 13. 2 % of such farmers in Khanh Hoa, Vietnam. Using an output-oriented VRS Data Envelopment Analysis, the standard efficiency was measured and then regressed to the farmer characteristics and production environment to identify the determinants of technical efficiency for those farms. The empirical results suggest that socio-economic factors such as education and experience are positively related and experience more significance than education, to the efficiency of white leg shrimp farmers. Some environmental factors, such as more distance from a channel, imply worse results for efficiency in white leg shrimp production. Financial factors, such as the proportion of total costs relative to total income, the proportion of variable costs relative to fixed costs, <b>sales</b> <b>margin</b> and return on asset {{have a positive effect on}} efficiency of the farmers. In addition, comparing the technical efficiency results of planned farms and unplanned farms, groups near to the channel and far from the channel, farmers who have a water keeping pond and those who do not have a water keeping pond, it was seen that the unplanned, far from the channel, and non-water keeping pond farms were less efficient than their counterparts. Therefore, this study suggests that there is a strong incentive for planned aquaculture. As it was seen that water sufficiency is necessary for efficient farming, additionally, it is better for a farm to be near the channel. If, however, it is far from the channel, a water keeping pond without culture is recommended. Moreover, having more experience in a cultured system was also suggested as a way to have the desired increase in productivity.

Online business decision systems are at the core point of an SMEs management and reporting activities. But, until recently, these efforts have been rooted in advances in computing technology, such as cloud computing and big data mining, rather than in newfound applications of scientific principles. In addition, in previous approaches big data mining solutions were implemented locally on private clouds and no SME could aggregate and analyze the information that consumers are exchanging with each other. Real science is a powerful, pervasive force in retail today, particularly so for addressing the complex challenge of retail pricing. Cloud Computing comes in {{to provide access to}} entirely new business capabilities through sharing resources and services and managing and assigning resources effectively.

In this paper we describe a method to provide the mobile retail consumers with reviews, brand ratings and detailed product information at the point of sale. Furthermore, we present how we use Exalead CloudView platform to search for weak signals in big data by analyzing multimedia data (text, voice, picture, video) and mining online social networks. The analysis makes not only customer profiling possible, but also brand promotion in the form of coupons, discounts or upselling to generate more sales, thus providing the opportunity for retailer SMEs to connect directly to its customers in real time. The paper explains why retailers can no longer thrive without a science-based pricing system, defines and illustrates the right science-based approach, and calls out the key features and functionalities of leading science-based price optimization systems. In particular, given a cloud application, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different sensor signals and data from online social networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing retail problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between environment and consumer related behavior faster and better than trivial mining of sensor data.

The two main businesses, on-grid and off-grid gas, are studied {{in order to}} find the fundamental differences in value creation and management control that ultimately lead to different performance management practices. The objective of this thesis is to develop target-oriented performance management practices for both businesses. The researcher was employed by Gasum Oy during the writing of this thesis. Analysis is based on semi-structured interviews of the key personnel, a workshop and personal observations about the everyday business and management practices in the company. In addition, the researcher was allowed to participate in a management reporting development project to gain more insight into the current performance management practices. The analysis is structured as follows. First, the business environment and current performance management practices are studied. Second, the businesses and their value chains are examined to determine the relevant key performance indicators (KPIs). Third, the businesses and their KPIs are compared. Finally, suggestions for overall improvement of performance management practices are provided. On-grid gas business is mature business and its overall strategic theme is, thereby, effectiveness. The suggested strategic level KPIs to be followed include cash flow (CF), EBITDA, take-or-pay limits and capital structure efficiency. These are cascaded down to tactical and operational level KPIs. The control, especially cost control, must be tight. Clear target levels must be set, and if they are exceeded, corrective actions must be taken. Cash flows generated from this business should not be used in expansion investments of the grid network as they are needed to finance both the day-to-day operations of the company and its new emerging businesses. Off-grid gas business is an emerging liquefied natural gas (LNG) business with high growth expectations. Thus, its overall strategic theme is growth. The suggested strategic level KPIs to be followed comprise <b>sales</b> <b>margin,</b> portfolio balance, inventory turnover and capital expense efficiency. These are also cascaded down to tactical and operational level KPIs. IN LNG business performance management and management control should support growth and not restrict the operations with tight controls. Agile organization and management as well as innovative mindset are needed in new business development. Encouraging examples in LNG business and changed mindsets could lead the way to a change in the organizational culture of the whole group. Suggestions for overall performance management practices involve improvements in modelling practices, such as, cash flow models, volume forecasts and LNG supply chain modelling. Other key issues are target setting and the linkage between strategy and operations. The business controllers should shift towards delivering analyses and strategy-related information.

More importantly, the EAR strategy returns are concentrated in the earnings announcements in the four quarters after the surprise, which contrasts with the gradual return drift observed for strategies based on SUE. In particular, around subsequent earnings announcement dates the EAR strategy earns a three-day abnormal return of about 3. 3 %, more than five times higher than that obtained for the SUE strategy. Moreover, the EAR and SUE strategies appear to be independent of each other. A strategy that exploits both pieces of information generates abnormal returns of about 11 % on an annual basis. ...|$|R

They also offer a different mix of products, with a relatively high portion of sales coming from meat and private-label products.
