[...] Didn't see that coming—and I can't wait to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> terrific TV series has coming next." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "the episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action-adventure… but the finale wasn't as mind-bending as [...] season's farewell, during which we received the show's first flash-forward." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's No Place Like Home", but ranked {{it in the middle of}} his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's No Place Like Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this." [...] He also found the special effects [...] "looked much shoddier than usual" [...] and praised the score. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press thought that [...] "it might be the most rewarding, deliciously challenging episode in the history of this mystical ABC serial." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "Part 2" [...] "was perhaps the most action-packed, meaningful episode of television I've watched all year. [...] The pace was excellent, and the revelations were plentiful." [...] Compora also wrote that [...] "though the pace was considerably slower, the finale delivered in a big way … it was [...] well written and well directed in its own right." ...|$|E

And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me.
