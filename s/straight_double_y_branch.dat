Using the novel triplexer chip, a 1310 nm channel is multiplexed and 1490 nm and 1550 nm channels are demultiplexed for FTTH using. The asymmetric <b>Y</b> <b>branch</b> waveguide is used to separate the 1310 nm channel from the 1490 nm and 1550 nm channels. Then the multimode interference is used to demultiplex the 1490 nm from 1550 nm channel. The simulated spectra show the bandwidths of three response wavelengths are 100 nm, 20 nm and 10 nm, respectively, which can meet the demand of ITU. 984 completely. The isolation for 1310 nm is more than 48 dB, and the isolation between 1490 nm and 1550 nm is more than 37 dB...|$|R

40|$|Incorporation of fillers {{with high}} thermal {{conductivity}} to base materials {{has been recognized}} as {{an efficient way to}} increase the thermal conductivity of composite materials. In this study, the effects of the prismatic filler arrangement and cross-sectional shape on the thermal conductivity of the composites were investigated. This research addresses these problems by solving the heterogeneous two-dimensional heat conduction problem in the composite materials. A validated commercial software-FLUENT and finite volume method was used in the analysis. The close-packed, directional and random filler arrangements were considered. It was found that the prismatic filler arrangement and cross-sectional shape have great impacts on the thermal conductivity of the composite materials. <b>Double</b> <b>Y</b> shaped, I shaped, T shaped, elliptical, rhombic and rectangular cross-sectional fillers can greatly increase the thermal conductivity only in directional arrangement. The effects of circular, square, triangular and Y shaped cross-sectional are similar in directional and random arrangements. The close-packed arrangements for all cross-sectional shapes have small thermal conductivity. The <b>double</b> <b>Y</b> shaped, Y shaped and I shaped cross-sectional were found to be the best choice for composite materials regardless of the filler arrangements...|$|R
