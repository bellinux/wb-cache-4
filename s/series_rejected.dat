5000|$|In 2006, the American comedy program South Park, {{which had}} {{previously}} depicted Muhammad as a superhero ("Super Best Friends)" [...] and has depicted Muhammad {{in the opening}} sequence since then, attempted to satirize the Danish newspaper incident. They intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to Family Guy character Peter Griffin ("Cartoon Wars Part II"). However, Comedy Central who airs the <b>series</b> <b>rejected</b> the scene and its creators reacted by satirizing double standard for broadcast acceptability. In April 2010, animators Trey Parker and Matt Stone planned to make episodes satirizing controversies over previous episodes, including Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad following the 2005 Danish controversy. After they faced Internet death threats, Comedy Central modified their version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad. In reaction, cartoonist Molly Norris created the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, claiming that if many people draw pictures of Muhammad, threats to murder them all would become unrealistic.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} unit root {{properties}} of electricity {{consumption per capita}} for the 67 developed and developing countries for 1971 - 2007 period. To examine the stationary properties of electricity consumption per capita, we have adopted Lee and Strazicich (2003, 2004) test of unit root {{that allows us to}} test for at most two endogenous breaks and uses the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistics. Results show that 65 country <b>series</b> <b>reject</b> the unit root null hypothesis except for 2 country series. Thus, our empirical findings provide significant evidence that electricity consumption per capita is stationary in almost all countries considered in the study. The stationarity of electricity consumption per capita indicates that it should be possible for the series to forecast future movements in the energy consumption based on the past behaviors of the series. ...|$|R

In this paper we analyze ETA activity in Spain during the last 30 years by means of examining its degree of dependence across time, using fractional integration or I(d) techniques. The {{results show that the}} activity of ETA is persistent to some extent, with an order of integration of about 0. 40, implying stationarity, but also long memory behavior. We argue that this strong degree of dependence between the observations might be explained by the historical background underlying the political conflict in the area. In addition, the results indicate that the most significant factors contributing to a reduction of violence are those related to political pacts among the political parties in the Basque region. In order {{to put an end to}} ETA's violence, these accords should involve both nationalist and non-nationalist groups. Terrorism, ETA, Fractional integration, Long memory,...|$|R

This is analyzed from two recent robust unit root tests proposed by Cavaliere and Georgiev (2009) and Lima and Xiao (2010), for which critical values are adapted to the small sample size. The former is improved by selecting optimally GLS detrending parameter to make the test in small samples powerful. We obtain mixed results on the full sample (1869 [...] 1993). However, the post- 1929 GNP and GNP per capita <b>series</b> <b>reject</b> the unit-root null hypothesis, whereas for the pre- 1929 GNP data, i. e. the period where the GNP series have been reconstructed, the unit-root hypothesis is not <b>rejected</b> for GNP <b>series</b> proposed by Balke-Gordon and Romer but this hypothesis is rejected for the same series in per capita form.

40|$|Using {{concepts}} {{from the}} theory of chaos and nonlinear dynamical systems, a time-series analysis is performed on four major currencies against the Creek Drachma.

Correlation dimension and related tests, as well as Lyapunov exponents, gave consistent results, which did not rule out the possibility of deterministic chaos for the two possibly fractal <b>series,</b> <b>rejecting</b> though the occurrence of a simple low-dimensional attractor, while the other two series seemed to have followed a behavior close to that of a random signal. SVD analysis, used to filter away noise, strongly supported the above findings and provided reliable evidence for the existence of an underlying system with a limited number of degrees-of-freedom only for those series found to exhibit fractality, while it revealed a noise domination over the remaining two. These results were further confirmed through a forecasting attempt using artificial neural networks...|$|R
