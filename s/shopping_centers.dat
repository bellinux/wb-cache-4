The Marketplace Mall and South Town Plaza, the two largest <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in the area, are both located in the vicinity of this intersection. NY252 intersects NY15A and meets Interstate390 (I-390) at an interchange prior to intersecting Winton Road.|$|E
5|$|The city added 19 public schools, a {{regional}} mall, <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and parks between 1970 and 2000 {{in response to}} rapid population growth. The construction of the Sawgrass Expressway in 1986 brought even more growth. A museum and a theater opened in the 1990s. The city reached residential build-out in 2003 and {{is very close to}} a commercial build-out.|$|E
5|$|During 1976, {{construction}} of a new shopping center directly across the street from Southdale occurred. The construction resulted in the Galleria Edina, an upscale shopping center; the new shopping mall increased competition with neighboring <b>shopping</b> <b>centers.</b> In 1987, Donaldson's announced the discontinuation of their chain of stores, which would shut one of the mall's original anchors. Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.|$|E

5|$|After {{she earned}} her degrees, Pritzker joined the Pritzker {{organization}} encouraged by her cousin Nick Pritzker. In 1987, she founded Classic Residence by Hyatt, later renamed Vi, upscale housing for seniors {{as an alternative}} to nursing homes. The project struggled at first, losing $40million in the first 18months, but turned around after changes in marketing and management. In 1991, Jay Pritzker, Penny's uncle and head of the Pritzker family businesses, named Penny {{as the director of the}} Pritzkers' non-hotel landholdings. With that appointment, Penny created the Pritzker Realty Group, which developed apartment buildings, <b>shopping</b> <b>centers,</b> and the Baldwin Park neighborhood in Orlando, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E

The main entrance to Saginaw Valley State University is located on M-84 at Pierce Road just south of the Saginaw–Bay county line.|$|E
5|$|With new {{suburban}} developments beckoning, {{many white}} middle-class residents {{moved out of}} the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the postwar era independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> drew off retail business from Granby Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} Big Three television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have a}} camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and by staying on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and <b>shopping</b> <b>centers.</b> Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{connected}} by road on a north-south axis reaching Viana do Castelo and the Spanish border to Porto by the A28 motorway. In Greater Porto, the A28 {{has the most}} popular suburban commercial areas of Northern Portugal with suburban <b>shopping</b> <b>centers,</b> large stand-alone stores, retail parks and outlets and reaches Porto's major thoroughfares and ring roads, including the VCI inner orbital motorway. Póvoa is also reached by the A7 (from Guimarães and Vila Nova de Famalicão) and A11 (from Braga and Barcelos) motorways on an east-west axis, through the south and north of the city, in that order, and both cross the A28. With these motorways, Póvoa de Varzim is accessible within minutes and central in the Northern Littoral Urban-Metropolitan Region of Northern Portugal, with 2.99 million inhabitants (2001 census).|$|E
5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in the area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the bypass of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
5|$|As Stone & Webster {{began work}} on the {{production}} facilities, {{it became clear that}} building the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design and build the township. The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction became known as the East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three <b>shopping</b> <b>centers,</b> three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. The emphasis was on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, fiberboard and gypsum board were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete. The work was completed in early 1944.|$|E
