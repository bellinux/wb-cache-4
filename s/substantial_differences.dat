5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed <b>substantial</b> <b>differences</b> between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is {{distinguished}} from other Oryzomys species by its short rostrum, {{the form of}} its incisive foramina, the absence of sphenopalatine vacuities, and the near absence of a subsquamosal fenestra. Within the species, the Colombian specimen differs from the Venezuelan animals in being larger in some measurements, but having smaller teeth, and in having oddly shaped wear facets of the incisors. The Colombian animal was probably kept in captivity for some time after it was caught, which would explain its large size and odd wear facets. There are no <b>substantial</b> <b>differences</b> between mainland O.gorgasi and material from Curaçao.|$|E
5|$|There {{are often}} <b>substantial</b> <b>differences</b> between the remiges and rectrices of adults and {{juvenile}}s {{of the same}} species. Because all juvenile feathers are grown at once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted {{over a longer period}} of time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E

5|$|In a 2009 {{revision}} of the Oryzomys of western Mexico, M.D. Carleton and J. Arroyo-Cabrales noted <b>substantial</b> <b>differences</b> in coloration and measurements between highland populations (albiventer) and lowland populations (mexicanus) in Jalisco. On {{the basis of these}} differences, they recognized O.albiventer as a species separate from the lowland populations, which they classified under O.couesi. They confirmed that Eliot's molestus was based on a large example of O.abiventer, but left the status of the three forms Goldman had associated with albiventer—crinitus, aztecus, and regillus—open, noting that there was no convincing evidence that these represented the same species as O.albiventer. The identity and exact provenance of fulgens (supposed to be from the Valley of Mexico), and consequently its relationship to O. albiventer, remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also <b>substantial</b> <b>differences</b> in shape. The {{hindbrain}} and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is {{the part of the brain}} that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with <b>substantial</b> <b>differences</b> between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called Elfin in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a continuous process, Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning of a word, but he almost never discarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E

5|$|There are {{primarily}} two feeding guilds in Lepidoptera – the nectarivorous who obtain {{the majority of}} their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are <b>substantial</b> <b>differences</b> between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices. Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode of nutrition – lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tinospora crispa (brotowali) is an {{advantageous}} herbal. Tinocrisposid, {{the most}} important substance on its stem used as antimalaria, hoped can reduce the parasite level of Swiss mice infected by Plasmodium berghei. The aim: To compare the effect on parasite level of Swiss mice infected by Plasmodium berghei between giving Tinospora crispa and chloroquine. Method: Research design, Pre and Post Test Control Group Design with 18 mice, divided into 3 groups, K (Control), P 1 (given chloroquine), P 2 (given Tinospora crispa). All were infected by 104 Plasmodium berghei at a 1 st day. At 3 rd to 5 th day, P 1 and P 2 each were given chloroquine and Tinospora crispa. From the 1 st day post infection until 1 day post therapy, some peripheral-blood samples taken for making the preparat. Analyzed data with Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test Result: A <b>substantial</b> <b>difference</b> in the parasites amount between K and P 1 on 4 th to 7 th day. A <b>substantial</b> <b>difference</b> between K and P 2 on 5 th to 7 th day. There is no <b>substantial</b> <b>difference</b> between P 1 and P 2. Conclusions: There is no <b>substantial</b> <b>difference</b> of parasite amounts in the Swiss mice infected with Plasmodium berghei between given by Tinospora crispa stem’s extract and Chloroquine.
