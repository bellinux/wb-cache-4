Typically, these approaches {{can be classified}} into two categories, seed-based de-anonymization [4, 5, 19 – 22] as well as <b>seed-free</b> de-anonymization [23]. A seed-based de-anonymization approach usually consists of two stages [4]. The first stage is to identify some common (seed) users between the anonymized social graph and the auxiliary network graph; the second stage is to conduct de-anonymization propagation iteratively according to social graph structural properties. Nilizadeh et al. proposed community-level-based de-anonymization [19] {{that can be used}} to improve other existing seed-based de-anonymization mechanisms [5, 20 – 23]. <b>Seed-free</b> de-anonymization approaches utilize figure (nodes or edges) properties as the fingerprints and conduct graph matching to de-anonymize the sanitized graph data [23].

Our main contributions include: new De-Anonymization (DA) attacks, comprehensive anonymity, utility, and de-anonymizability quantifications, and a secure graph data publishing/sharing system SecGraph. New DA Attacks. We present two novel graph DA frameworks: cold start single-phase Optimization-based DA (ODA) and De-anonymizing Social-Attribute Graphs (De-SAG). Unlike existing seed-based DA attacks, ODA does not priori knowledge. In addition, ODA’s DA results can facilitate existing DA attacks by providing more seed information. De-SAG is the first attack {{that takes into account}} both graph structure and attribute information. Through extensive evaluations leveraging real world graph data, we validated the performance of both ODA and De-SAG. Graph Anonymity, Utility, and De-anonymizability Quantifications. We developed new techniques that enable comprehensive graph data anonymity, utility, and de-anonymizability evaluation. First, we proposed the first <b>seed-free</b> graph de-anonymizability quantification framework under a general data model which provides the theoretical foundation for <b>seed-free</b> SDA attacks. Second, we conducted the first seed-based quantification on the perfect and partial de-anonymizability of graph data. Our quantification closes the gap between seed-based DA practice and theory. Third, we conducted the first attribute-based anonymity analysis for Social-Attribute Graph (SAG) data. Our attribute-based anonymity analysis together with existing structure-based de-anonymizability quantifications provide data owners and researchers a more complete understanding of the privacy of graph data. Fourth, we conducted the first graph Anonymity-Utility-De-anonymity (AUD) correlation quantification and provided close-forms to explicitly demonstrate such correlation. Finally, based on our quantifications, we conducted large-scale evaluations leveraging 100 + real world graph datasets generated by various computer systems and services.

40|$|As an {{important}} anthropogenic {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC), m-xylene has attracted numerous attentions due to its potential in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. In this study, effects of aluminium dust seeds (boehmite and alumina) on SOA yield and aerosol size in m-xylene/NOx photo-oxidation were investigated in a 2 m(3) smog chamber at 30 degrees C and 50 % relative humidity. Compared to the <b>seed-free</b> system, the presence of aluminium seeds resulted {{in an increase in}} the SOA yield, and also enhanced the O- 3 concentration in the chamber. The photolysis of O- 3 is a major source of OH radical, which is the most important oxidant of m-xylene. The increase in O- 3 concentration could result in the generation of more OH radicals, and finally contribute to the SOA formation. Seed particles influence the SOA size mainly by acting as condensation nuclei. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) were condensed onto these nuclei, resulting in the increase in SOA size. However, when aluminium seeds with high concentrations were introduced into the system, SVOCs that had been condensed onto each particle were dispersed by these seeds, leading to the reduction in aerosol size...|$|E

40|$|The {{polymorph}} of alumina hydrate from Al-H 2 O reaction crystallization is hard {{to control}} due to its complexity. In this study, seeding is adopted to control the polymorphism by changing the metastable zone width (MSZW) which provides {{the easiest way to}} quantify the system stability. First, the influence of seed amount on the MSZW and polymorph was investigated. The MSZW declines with the increase of seed loading, and the critical seed loading for obtaining single gibbsite phase products is determined to be 15 g/L. Then the effect of seeding time on the polymorph indicates that the seed should be added before nucleation occurrence in order to control polymorphism effectively. The MSZW and polymorph of both <b>seed-free</b> and seeded Al-H 2 O reaction crystallization is controlled by changing the temperature and alkali concentration. It is found that if the critical concentration is lower than the saturation solubility curve of bayerite in the diagram, single gibbsite phase crystals can be obtained. Besides, the mechanism for polymorph control by changing the MSZW mainly includes the epitaxial growth and secondary nucleation which dominates the process under 90 and 60 degrees C, respectively...|$|E

The NW networks are hexagonal phase and the morphologies are changed {{by adjusting the}} pH of precursor solutions. Growth mechanism of WO 3 NWs is also extensively discussed. The designed porous film exhibits remarkable enhancement of the electrochromic (EC) properties. In particular, a significant optical modulation (57 % at 632 nm), fast color switching speed (bleaching: 7 s and coloration: 21 s), high coloration efficiency (120. 3 cm 2 C− 1 at 632 nm), high Li+ diffusion coefficient (2. 14 × 10 − 9 cm 2 s− 1), and excellent cycling stability (87 % after 1000 cycles) are achieved for the 3 -D NWs film. The improved EC properties are mainly attributed to the highly porous film, which makes the Li+ diffusion becomes easier and provides larger specific surface area for charge-transfer reactions.

40|$|Background: High-throughput {{tools for}} pan-genomic study, {{especially}} the DNA microarray platform, have sparked a remarkable increase in data production and enabled {{a shift in}} the scale at which biological investigation is possible. The use of microarrays to examine evolutionary relationships and processes, however, is predominantly restricted to model or nearmodel organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study explores the utility of Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) in evolutionary studies of non-model organisms. DArT is a hybridization-based genotyping method that uses microarray technology to identify and type DNA polymorphism. Theoretically applicable to any organism (even one for which no prior genetic data are available), DArT has not yet been explored in exclusively wild sample sets, nor extensively examined in a phylogenetic framework. DArT recovered 1349 markers of largely low copy-number loci in two lineages of <b>seed-free</b> land plants: the diploid fern Asplenium viride and the haploid moss Garovaglia elegans. Direct sequencing of 148 of these DArT markers identified 30 putative loci including four routinely sequenced for evolutionary studies in plants. Phylogenetic analyses of DArT genotypes reveal phylogeographic and substrate specificity patterns in A. viride, a lack of phylogeographic pattern in Australian G. elegans, and additive variation in hybrid or mixed samples.

40|$|Summary Hybridization is an {{important}} evolutionary force in plants, but the mechanisms underlying it have not been well studied for many groups. In particular, the drivers of non-random patterns of interspecific gene flow (asymmetrical hybridization) remain poorly understood, especially in the <b>seed-free</b> vascular plants. Here, we examine patterns of asymmetrical hybridization in two widespread fern hybrids from eastern North America and study the role of gametophyte ecology in the determination of hybridization bias. We characterized the maternal parentage of> 140 hybrid sporophytes by sequencing a c. 350 -bp region of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA). To identify factors contributing to patterns of asymmetrical hybridization, we cultured gametophytes of the parental species and evalu-ated critical aspects of their reproductive biology. We found that asymmetrical hybridization was prevalent across the populations of both hybrids. Reproductive traits varied across species and suggest that selfing potential, antheridi-ogen responsiveness, sperm dispersal capacity and gamete size all contribute to the mediation of the direction of hybridization in this group. Our findings suggest that asymmetrical hybridization in ferns is driven by an array of repro-ductive traits. This study helps to sharpen and define a mechanistic understanding of patterns of hybridization in this group and demonstrates the importance of considering gametophyte biology when studying evolutionary processes in ferns...|$|E
40|$|Early {{cysteine}} labeled (E-c) proteins are plant metallothioneins, {{which were}} first identified in wheat embryos and {{are thought to}} be seed-specific. An exhaustive analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) entries reveals that homologs are expressed in embryos of both classes of flowering plants (monocotyledons and dicotyledons), but also occur in conifers (gymnosperms) and <b>seed-free</b> spike moss (lycophyta). Mass spectrometric and elemental analysis results indicate that, contrary to the widely propagated number of five, Ec binds predominantly six zinc ions in at least two zinc-thiolate clusters. H- 1 and Cd- 111 NMR experiments suggest that, in contrast to the majority of previously characterized metallothioneins, two conserved histidine residues participate in metal binding. The collected data is con- sistent with the presence of clusters unprecedented in metallothioneins so far. This novel cluster composition is accompanied by metalbinding properties that are substantially different from other metallothioneins; thus wheat EC binds zinc less strongly than either mammalian or cyanobacterial MTs. The unique biochemical properties of wheat Ec render it ideally suited for a role in zinc donation to nascent proteins during seed development, a role that has been suggested {{based on the fact that}} EC is induced by the plant hormone abscisic acid, but not by heavy metals. Our results provide a step further toward developing a property/function relationship for metallothioneins. ...|$|E
40|$|Smog chamber {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the hygroscopicity of particles generated from photooxidation of alpha-pinene/NOx with different sulfate seed aerosols or oxidation conditions. Hygroscopicity of particles was measured by a tandem differential mobility analyzer (TDMA) in terms of hygroscopic growth factor (Gf), with a relative humidity of 85 %. With sulfate seed aerosols present, Gf of the aerosols decreased very fast before notable secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation was observed, indicating a heterogeneous process between inorganic seeds and organic products might take place as soon as oxidation begins, rather than only happening after gas-aerosol partition of organic products starts. The final SOA-coated sulfate particles had similar or lower Gf than <b>seed-free</b> SOA. The hygroscopicity of the final particles was not dependent on the thickness but on the hygroscopicity properties of the SOA, which were influenced by the initial sulfate seed particles. In the two designed aging processes, Gf of the particles increased more significantly with introduction of OH radical than with ozone. However, the hygroscopicity of SOA was very low even after a long time of aging, implying that either SOA aging in the chamber was very slow or the Gf of SOA did not change significantly in aging. Using an aerosol composition speciation monitor (ACSM) and matrix factorization (PMF) method, two factors for the components of SOA were identified, but the correlation between SOA hygroscopicity {{and the proportion of}} the more highly oxidized factor could be either positive or negative depending on the speciation of seed aerosols present...|$|E
40|$|Ferns {{are a very}} divers group exhibiting various habits (e. g. aquatic, epiphytic, herbaceous, arborescents), and {{together}} with the group of lycophytes, represent the oldest lineages of vascular plants among the terrestrial plants. Despite its ancient origin, this lineage accounts with much more extant species (~ 11. 000) than the more derived gymnosperms (< 1. 000 species). In recent classifications of land plants, vascular plants have a basal dichotomy separating the lycophytes (vascular plants presenting lycophylls or leaves with an intercalary meristem, without leaf gaps and a single medium vein), from the euphyllophytes (vascular plants presenting euphylls or leaves with marginal or apical meristems and an associated leaf gap in the vascular stele and branched veins). This dichotomy occurred in the early-mid Devo-nian, ca. 400 million years ago (Stewart & Rothwell 1993, Kenrick & Crane 1997, Pryer et al. 2004). Within the euphyllophytes, two signif icant clades diverged from a common ancestor thought to be within the extinct Trimerophytes group (Bateman et al. 1988, Stewart & Rothwell 1993) : spermatophytes (seed plants com-prising the extant gymnosperms and angiosperms and few extinct groups, being the Pteridosperms the most pro-minent one) and monilophytes (ferns sensu stricto). Lyco-phytes and monilophytes are all <b>seed-free,</b> and because of this, historically they have been considered together under various terms, such as: “pteridophytes ” (ferns sensu lato) and “ferns and ferns allies ” (Smith et al. 2006).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{relative}} humidity (RH) on aerosol formation by the semi-volatile oxidation {{products of the}} α-pinene/O_ 3 system has been comprehensively studied. Experiments were performed {{in the presence of}} ammonium sulfate (aqueous, dry), ammonium bisulfate seed (aqueous, dry), and aqueous calcium chloride seed aerosols to ascertain their effect on the partitioning of the oxidation products. The yield of organic aerosol varies little with RH, and is not affected by the presence of dry inorganic salt aerosols. Aqueous salt aerosols reduce the yield of organic aerosol compared to that under <b>seed-free</b> or dry seed conditions. The degree of reduction is electrolyte dependent, with aqueous ammonium sulfate leading to the largest reduction and aqueous calcium chloride the smallest. Hygroscopic growth of the organic aerosol from < 2 % to 85 % RH was also monitored, and could be satisfactorily represented as the sum of the individual contributions of the organic and inorganic fractions. The implications of the growth factor measurements for concentration/activity relationships of the condensed phase organic material (assuming a liquid solution) was explored. The formation of the organic aerosol was investigated using a simple two component model, and also one including the 12 product compounds identified in a previous study. The experimental results for < 2 % and 50 % RH (without salt seed aerosols) could be satisfactorily predicted. However, the aqueous salt seed aerosols are predicted to increase the overall yield due to the dissolution of the organic compounds into the water associated with the seed aerosol—the opposite effect to that observed. The implications of two distinct phases existing the aerosol phase were investigated...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{fertilizers}} {{are crucial}} for ensuring crop production. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer are often complemented or replaced (e. g. in organic agriculture) by exogenous organic matter (EOM) to limit {{environmental impacts of}} mineral fertilization (e. g. reduced carbon storage, nitrate leaching to groundwater, biodiversity erosion). EOM can though cause new problems as it comprises pest propagules, particularly weed seeds. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the impact of EOM on grass-weed dynamics, combining EOM analyses and model simulations. The first step analyzed seven EOM types for their chemical properties (e. g. nitrogen, carbon) and weed seed contents (using germination tests). The tested EOMs were of agricultural or urban origin (e. g. co-compost of green waste and sewage sludge or organic fraction of municipal waste). The most infested EOMs were composted farmyard manure and cattle slurry while fresh manure contained few weed seeds. Urban and green waste composts were nearly <b>seed-free.</b> In total, nineteen weed species and one crop species (Triticum aestivum) were identified with cattle slurry comprising the highest species number (thirteen). Weeds were mostly grass species (Lolium sp., Bromus sterilis, Echinochloa crus-galli, Festuca sp., Poa annua), except for Trifolium sp. In the second step, an existing model (AlomySys) which quantifies the effects of cropping systems on the dynamics of an autumnal grass weed similar to Lolium sp. was amended to account for EOM applications, considering both weed seed addition to the native soil seed bank and additional nitrogen. Finally, the amended model was used to simulate the effects on grass-weed dynamics of applying composted farmyard manure, using the observed EOM characteristics. Simulations focused on {{a small number of}} factors potentially interacting with EOM, i. e. EOM application frequency and seed content, tillage strategies, mineral nitrogen fertilization, and initial weed infestation. These simulations showed that for autumnal grass-weed species, adding weed seeds via EOM only increased multi-year weed infestation if fields were initially weed-free or if the simulated weed species was highly dormant in summer. Conversely, the additional EOM nitrogen reduced the fitness of the newly produced grass-weed seeds by affecting their dormancy and germination pattern, having more of them emerge in summer and thus unable to flower. Burying manure by mouldboard ploughing decreased or even cancelled the EOM effec...|$|E
40|$|Amyloid fibrils are self-assembled protein homopolymers {{that play}} central {{roles in the}} {{pathology}} of several human diseases, most notably in progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In AD, fibrils are formed by the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, an enzymatic cleavage product that is naturally produced in human brain tissue. The fibrillar Aβ accumulates in deposits known as senile plaques in the diseased AD brain, and the processes by which this occurs are postulated to be primary causes of the neuronal loss {{that is associated with}} AD progression. As such, it is of great importance to understand how Aβ fibrils are formed, and why they exert neurotoxic effects in AD patients. In pursuit of this goal, {{there is a need for}} more effective and precise methods of analysing amyloid material. In this work, the aim was to improve the read outs of techniques that are currently used, and to develop novel methods for amyloid detection. The main focus has been on small molecules that work as light-switch molecules in presence of amyloids, i. e. they exhibit greatly enhanced fluorescence intensity upon binding to amyloid fibrils. I have characterised the classic amyloid stain thioflavin-T (ThT), and showed how it can differentiate between different amyloid samples based on their morphological attributes, particularly upon detection of its fluorescence lifetime. I have also characterised the binding and fluorescent properties of YOYO- 1; a traditional DNA stain that proved to be an attractive alternative to ThT and that therefore may function as a novel amyloid stain, extending the amyloid recognition toolbox.

30|$|The single {{crystalline}} ZnO NR arrays were synthesized on p+-Si (111) substrate without {{seed layer}} using the simple, low-cost, and low-temperature hydrothermal method. The p+-Si (111) substrate was employed {{due to its}} lattice constant (3.84 Å) which is close to that of ZnO (001) (3.25 Å). Also, it possesses a hexagonal lattice structure. In this study, the substrate resistivity is below 0.01 to 0.05 [*]Ω cm, and the doped density is about 1018 cm− 3. The substrate surface was light etching by hydrofluoric (HF) acid for 10 min at room temperature after standard cleaned process to prepare -H terminals on the substrate. Water contact angle increased from about 41 ° to 63 ° measured by a contact angle meter showing that the substrate surface was covered by -H terminals. Subsequently, it was then rinsed with deionized (DI) water and dried in N 2 gas flow. The Si substrate was placed together into a teflon pressure cooker {{with a cup of}} 0.2 ml octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODS) and sealed with a cap. The cooker was placed in an oven at 150 °C for 1 h to form ODS self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the Si substrate surface. Water contact angle of ODS SAM surface increased to 81 °, indicating that almost the entire substrate was covered by ODS. ZnO NRs were grown on the SAM/p+-Si substrate surface in a mixture solution consisting of DI water, 0.08 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O), and 0.08 M hexamethylenetetramine (C 6 H 12 N 4, (HMT)) for 1 h at 95 °C. Subsequently, each sample was thoroughly rinsed with DI water to remove any residual chemicals and salts, and dried at 45 °C for many hours in the cooker. The crystalline grains were formed on the SAM, firstly. Zn 2 + was continuously supplied from Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O solution. There is almost no gradient of concentration mean that the concentration of zinc precursor is uniform from the roots to the top of rods, which results in the formation of ZnO nanorods with flat tops. After the reaction is finished, the highly oriented ZnO rods have been successfully prepared on <b>seed-free</b> Si substrate. Finally, n-ZnO NRs/p+-Si heterojunction was obtained. ZnO NRs grown on Si substrates were annealed in nitrogen gas with 1 [*]×[*] 102 Torr for 20 min at various temperatures (200 °C to 800 °C) in a rapid thermal annealing furnace. The photoresist (PR) was used as an insulating layer to fill up the space between the ZnO NRs by spin coating. The extra PR was remove by the oxygen plasma treatment in plasma striper; the etch power is 450 W acting for 40 min. ITO film was sputtered onto the top of ZnO as anticathode. The working pressure was 1.5 [*]×[*] 10 − 2 Torr with a sputtering power of 30 W and the sputtering time was 1 h. The thickness of ITO layers was about 30 nm.|$|E
40|$|Dragon fruit (Hylocereus spp.), {{also known}} as pitaya or pitahaya, is {{increasingly}} gaining interest in many countries, including Thailand which is {{a country with a}} climate ideal for breeding different varieties of tropical and subtropical fruits in general, and dragon fruit more specifically. The benefits of dragon fruit for human health can be explained by its essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, complex carbohydrates, dietary fibres and antioxidants. Dragon fruit is also an essential source of betacyanin which serves as a red/purple pigment with antioxidative properties. In Thailand, most of the fresh dragon fruits are consumed domestically, while some are traded globally as fresh fruit and processed products as juice or puree. As it is, dragon fruit peel and seeds are often considered as waste or by-products from fruit processing and have been less successful at adding value to the fruit. Currently, there is limited literature on dragon fruit properties, its processed products and constituents as well as potential utilization. Therefore, the main objective of this doctoral research was to gain deeper insight in the characteristics of dragon fruit and its derived products and components, specifically of two species of dragon fruit, i. e. white-flesh dragon fruit (H. undatus) and red-flesh dragon fruit (H. polyrhizus). The characteristics of these two species of dragon fruit and their possible application are extensively discussed in the doctoral thesis/research. Chapter 1 provides a state-of-the-art of current and relevant research on dragon fruit with respect to botanical classification, cultivation, economic aspects and chemical composition (particularly nutrients, pigment and antioxidative components) as well as an overview of techniques to process fruits (processing), i. e. freeze-drying and thermal processing. The impact of these processes on quality attributes (e. g. physicochemical and rheological properties) of different fruits is critically reviewed. The review also aims at giving a summarized overview of the most important aspects of seed oil (e. g. chemical composition and lipid oxidation) and cell wall polysaccharides (e. g. structure of pectic and hemicellulosic substances). In Chapter 2, the properties/characteristics of the whole fruit, peel, pulp (<b>seed-free</b> flesh) and puree (flesh containing seeds) of the two species of dragon fruit were performed. Results demonstrated that the peel of both dragon fruit species as well as the pulp and puree of the red-flesh species contained large amounts of betacyanin. As it is, they have the potential to be utilized as a natural colouring agent. Dragon fruit pulp and puree also exhibited significant antioxidative activities. This was even more pronounced for the red-flesh species due to the presence of betacyanin. The pulp and puree showed shear-thinning behaviour due to the presence of mucilaginous components. Throughout this doctoral research, these characteristics of dragon fruit, for example, pigment, antioxidative activities and rheological properties, provide a deeper insight with regard to further valorization of the fruit components and optimization of the fruit processing. Chapter 3 describes the characterization of the freeze-dried pulp and peel of the two species of dragon fruit to be further utilized of dragon fruit’s pigment (betacyanin) as a food additive. It was found that freeze-drying could satisfactorily preserve colour and pigment concentration. The freeze-dried red-flesh pulp and the freeze-dried dragon fruit peel from both species contained high contents of betacyanin. The freeze-dried dragon fruit pulp was well-soluble in water, whereas {{this was not the case}} for the freeze-dried dragon fruit peel. Additionally, due to the pH-sensitivity of betacyanin, the influence of pH (1 - 11) on the colour shift of the freeze-dried dragon fruit peel and pulp was monitored. The colour of the freeze-dried peel was stable within a pH range of 3 - 7, whereas the freeze-dried red-flesh pulp had high colour stability over a pH range of 1 - 11 and is available in a convenient form making it suitable for the use as a food colourant. In order to gain insight into the effects of thermal treatment on the characteristics of the white-flesh and red-flesh dragon fruit purees, the antioxidative, rheological, physicochemical and microbiological properties of the purees were investigated at different process conditions (between 50 and 90 °C for 60 min). The results are presented and discussed in Chapter 4. It is interesting to see that the antioxidative properties of the heated dragon fruit puree increased during heating treatment probably because of the superior antioxidative attributes of the dragon fruit seeds present in the puree and the formation of Maillard reaction products. During thermal processing, the L* value (lightness) and b* value (yellowness) of the processed dragon fruit puree can be used to control the quality online. Total colour change (TCC), which is an indicator of different colour between the unheated and heated puree samples, of the red-flesh dragon fruit puree showed a strong negative correlation with betacyanin content. The kinetics of colour changes and betacyanin degradation in the heated dragon fruit puree followed a second-order models. The apparent viscosity of the heated dragon fruit puree increased with heating time and temperature. The rheological data fitted very well with the power-law model, showing shear-thinning behaviour. Thus, the heated dragon fruit puree, particularly the red-flesh puree, offer possibilities to be applied in foodstuffs due to their interesting attributes after thermal treatment. The dragon fruit seeds are considered to have a high antioxidative potential. As it is, oil was extracted from the white-flesh and red-flesh dragon fruit seeds with petroleum ether as cold extraction. The characterization of the seed oil is described in Chapter 5. Dragon fruit seeds contained significant amounts of oil, which accounted for about 32 - 34 % of the dried seed weight. The predominant fatty acids of both dragon fruit seed oils were linoleic acid (C 18 : 2, 45 - 55 %), oleic acid (C 18 : 1, 19 - 24 %), palmitic acid (C 16 : 0, 15 - 18 %) and stearic acid (C 18 : 0, 7 - 8 %), respectively. Dragon fruit seed oil is interesting from a nutritional point of view as it contains a high amount of essential fatty acids, amounting to 56 %. The triacylglycerol (TAG) composition in the seed oil was also analyzed. It was shown to contain mainly triunsaturated and diunsaturated TAGs. A significant amount of tocopherols in the dragon fruit seed oil was clearly observed in which α-tocopherol was the most abundant tocopherol in the oil (72 % of total tocopherol content). In addition, a storage assessment of 3 months was performed, monitoring the oxidative and tocopherol stabilities in the dragon fruit seed oil. A low oxidation rate of both dragon fruit seed oils was obtained, while tocopherol content decreased on storage. However, the concentration of tocopherols in the dragon fruit seed oil after 12 weeks remained high content compared to the initial state. Thus, the dragon fruit seed oil could be considered as a good source of essential fatty acids and tocopherols, with a high oxidative stability. In Chapter 6, the activity of pectic enzymes, i. e. pectin methylesterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG), of the pulp and peel of white-flesh and red-flesh dragon fruits as well as inactivation of pectic enzymes by thermal treatments (30 - 90 °C for 10 min) were examined. The untreated white-flesh dragon fruit had a higher PME activity compared to the red-flesh dragon fruit, whereas PG activity was absent in all dragon fruit samples. Results also demonstrated that no significant effects of PME activity at temperature below 70 °C for 10 min in either the pulp or the peel of dragon fruit were observed, while a moderate heat treatment (80 and 90 °C for 10 min) could efficiently inactivate PME. In the last part of this doctoral study, the polysaccharides (pectic and hemicellulosic substances) from cell wall materials of the pulp and peel of white-flesh and red-flesh dragon fruits were isolated and structurally compared, as described in Chapter 7. Prior to cell wall polysaccharide isolation, blanching at 80 °C for 10 min allowed PME inactivation. Subsequently, cell wall material was extracted and sequentially fractionated using various solutions to obtain three different pectic fractions, a hemicellulosic fraction and a remaining residue fraction which could not be solubilized by the procedure used. These polysaccharide fractions were chemically characterized in terms of galacturonic acid (GalA) content, degree of methoxylation (DM), neutral sugar composition, molar mass distribution and affinity towards some specific anti-pectin antibodies. Results showed that the cell wall polysaccharides in the pulp and, to an even greater extent, in the peel of both white-flesh and red-flesh species contained significant amounts of pectic substances. The pectic substances in the dragon fruit peel as well as in the dragon fruit pulp were shown to be lowly methyl-esterified pectin (DM < 39 %) and highly water-soluble pectin (38 - 47 %). A higher contribution of pectic homogalacturonan (HG) region in the peel samples was observed compared to the pulp samples, whereas there were no large differences between the pectic substances of both dragon fruit species. Despite the low average DM value of the pulp and peel pectins, pectic substances in both pulp and peel samples showed an affinity for anti-HG antibodies with different specificities, indicating that a wide range of epitopes (including long blocks of unesterified GalA residues as well as a few consecutive esterified GalA residues) was present. In this doctoral research, the key findings of the experimental work are clearly shown and summarized in Chapter 8. Dragon fruit is an excellent source of bioactive compounds such as betacyanin and tocopherol which both have high antioxidative properties and health-promoting functions. Dragon fruit also provides many valuable products and components that could have high potential of being applied in food industry. For example, the freeze-dried dragon fruit pulp could be used as a red/purple colouring agent (betacyanin) as well as an instant juice powder. The heated dragon fruit puree with significant antioxidative activity could serve as a semi-processed product, the dragon fruit seed oil, on the other hand, was defined as a high-value oil. The extracted cell wall polysaccharide from dragon fruit peel demonstrated to be a low methyl-esterified pectin. Thus, the dissemination of the research findings may significantly increase the value of dragon fruit, resulting in an increased revenue for growers and producers...|$|E
