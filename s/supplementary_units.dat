The dependence of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of different supplementary communicative units {{on the type of}} the article and on the language is discussed. The article proves that the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> in opinion columns in Russian and in English has more common features than in analytical articles. The highest frequency of occurrence of these units is registered in Russian analytical articles, the lowest – in English articles. In Russian newspapers analytical articles and columns demonstrate more similar characteristics than in English materials. Supplementary communicative units with organizing functions occur more frequently in Russian articles, in English articles and columns they are equally rare. Regulative <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> are used equally often in all analyzed newspaper texts.
