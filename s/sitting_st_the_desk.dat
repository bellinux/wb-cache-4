2500|$|The second {{modification}} {{was done}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. [...] The first time a base was made for <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk</b> was during <b>the</b> John F. Kennedy Administration. [...] This base was made of pine and did not match <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> very well. [...] That base is very visible in the famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk.</b> In January 1977, President Carter requested <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{be sent back to}} the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. [...] Photos from January–February 1977 show <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk</b> being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> being used without a base. President Reagan requested that <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> be raised higher since he was hitting his legs {{on the top of the}} knee hole. The White House's earliest image of <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> in 1986, and that base has remained with <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> since that time.|$|R

50|$|Like <b>the</b> rolltop <b>desk,</b> {{which was}} invented much later, <b>the</b> {{cylinder}} <b>desk</b> usually has a fixed work surface: the paperwork {{does not have}} to be stored before <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> is shut.

2500|$|<b>The</b> candy <b>desk</b> {{is not a}} {{specific}} <b>desk</b> in <b>the</b> Senate Chamber, but rather {{a specific}} seating within the chamber, and any <b>desk</b> that <b>the</b> senator seated in that position chooses to use becomes <b>the</b> candy <b>desk.</b> <b>The</b> <b>desk's</b> location has remained static {{since at least the}} 97th Congress (1981–1983). It is next to the eastern door to the senate chamber. Most senators enter the chamber through this door, which is adjacent to elevators leading to one of the stops on the United States Capitol subway system. <b>The</b> <b>desk</b> is <b>the</b> first <b>desk</b> on <b>the</b> right, or Republican, side, and is in the last row of <b>desks.</b> Traditionally, <b>the</b> candy <b>desk</b> is always on the Republican side of the Senate Chamber and is used by a Republican senator.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>desk</b> which Hobart bought {{remained}} in the Vice President's Room and continued {{to be used by}} each Vice President until 1969, including the future presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and by Nixon himself. When Nixon became president <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> was placed on loan to the White House, and became <b>the</b> Oval Office <b>desk</b> for his presidency. Nixon took a liking to <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> during his terms as Vice President because he was under the incorrect impression that it was used by Woodrow Wilson during his term as President.|$|R
25|$|Replicas of <b>the</b> Resolute <b>desk</b> have {{appeared}} in many movies. <b>The</b> <b>desk</b> was a key plot device in , in which a secret compartment in <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> contained pieces of {{a clue to the}} location of treasure.

25|$|When {{president}} Lyndon B. Johnson {{took office}} in 1963, he found he was too large for <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used <b>the</b> Wilson <b>desk,</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> from <b>the</b> Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and believed {{to be that of}} former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used <b>the</b> Wilson <b>desk</b> throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought <b>the</b> Resolute <b>desk</b> back to <b>the</b> Oval Office, where it remained until George H. W.

40|$|A {{retracting}} {{keyboard and}} monitor platform is provided.
