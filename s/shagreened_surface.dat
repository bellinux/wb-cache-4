Within the same family some species are provided with these organs, and some are quite destitute of them. This diversity is intelligible, if we suppose that originally various species made a shuffling or hissing noise by the rubbing together of the hard and rough parts of their bodies which were in contact; and that from the noise thus produced being in some way useful, the rough surfaces were gradually developed into regular stridulating organs. Some beetles as they move, now produce, either intentionally or unintentionally, a shuffling noise, without possessing any proper organs for the purpose. Mr. Wallace informs me that the Euchirus longimanus (a Lamellicorn, with the anterior legs wonderfully elongated in the male) “makes, whilst moving, a low hissing sound by the protrusion and contraction of the abdomen; and when seized it produces a grating sound by rubbing its hind-legs against {{the edges of the}} elytra.” The hissing sound is clearly due to a narrow rasp running along the sutural margin of each elytron; and I could likewise make the grating sound by rubbing the <b>shagreened</b> <b>surface</b> of the femur against the granulated margin of the corresponding elytron; but I could not here detect any proper rasp; nor is it likely that I could have overlooked it in so large an insect. After examining Cychrus and reading what Westring has written in his two papers about this beetle, it seems very doubtful whether it possesses any true rasp, though it has the power of emitting a sound.|$|E

50|$|Adult males measure 17 - 19 mm in snout-vent length. The head is {{as long as}} it is wide. The snout is subovoid in dorsal {{view and}} rounded in lateral view. The {{tympanum}} is distinct. The fingers and toes have expanded disks but lack lateral fringes and webbing. The dorsum has low pustules whereas the venter is <b>shagreen.</b> The upper <b>surfaces</b> of the body are light yellow with dark dots, sometimes forming blotches by aggregation. The venter is white and the throat is cream. The upper surfaces of thighs are pinkish orange and have dark dots, while the lower surface of thighs are uniformly pinkish orange. Males have single external vocal sac and vocal slit.|$|R
