40|$|Scrapie is a {{neurodegenerative}} {{prion disease}} of sheep, goats and mouflons, belonging {{to the group of}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which affects humans as well. Even though classical scrapie has been known for over 250 years, the 1985 BSE crisis related to the advent of new forms of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans imposed the implementation of rapid coercive legal measures of prevention, control and eradication of TSEs. According to the prion hypothesis, the transmissible agent is the pathological isoform (PrPSc) of cellular prion protein (PrPC). Specific polymorphisms of the gene that encodes cell prion protein (PrnP) in sheep have been associated with resistance / natural susceptibility to the development and progression of the disease. Combinations of alleles at three adjacent codons (136 [A/V], 154 [H/R], 171 [H/Q/R]) underpin the classification of 15 possible genotypes in risk classes, applicable in selection schemes where the maximum resistance is conferred by ARR allele, and the minimum by the VRQ allele. Although, after applying these programmes, the genetic structure of sheep populations has changed favourably, genotype association studies showed that no genotype is completely resistant to the infection, including homozygote ARR / ARR. With the discovery of atypical scrapie (Nor 98), it became evident that the connection between the genetics of prion protein gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to the disease must be re-evaluated individually for each breed. In <b>scrapie</b> <b>monitoring</b> and control programmes, three diagnostic categories of the disease are observed: classical scrapie, atypical scrapie and BSE scrapie in small ruminant. This review shows the chronology of progress in the fight for the eradication of TSEs in sheep, 30 years after the BSE epidemic outburst, focusing especially on the link between the molecular diagnostic forms and the genetics of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The exact {{role of the}} {{lymphoreticular system}} in the spread of {{peripheral}} prion infections to {{the central nervous system}} still needs further elucidation. Against this background, the influence of the regional lymph node (Ln. popliteus) on the pathogenesis of <b>scrapie</b> was <b>monitored</b> in a hamster model of prion infection via the footpad. Methods Surgical lymphadenectomy was carried out at different time points after infection, or prior to inoculation, in order to elucidate the impact of the lymph node on lethal neuroinvasion. Results The Ln. popliteus did not show an influence on pathogenesis when a high dose of infectivity was administered. However, it was found to modulate the interval of time until the development of terminal scrapie in a subset of animals lymphadenectomized after low-dose infection. In additon, lymphadenectomy performed four weeks before inoculation prevented cerebral PrP TSE deposition and development of disease during the period of observation (314 days) in the majority of hamsters challenged with a very low dose of scrapie agent. Conclusion Our findings suggest the regional lymph node as a potentially facilitating or even essential factor for invasion of the brain after peripheral challenge with low doses of infectious scrapie agent. The invasive in vivo approach pursued in this study may be applied also to other animal species for further elucidating the involvement of lymphoid tissue in the pathogenesis of experimental and natural TSEs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Scrapie of sheep/goats and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) of deer/elk are {{contagious}} {{prion diseases}} where environmental reservoirs are directly {{implicated in the}} transmission of disease. In this study the effectiveness of recommended scrapie farm decontamination regimes was evaluated by a sheep bioassay using buildings naturally contaminated with scrapie. Pens within a farm building were treated with either 20, 000 ppm free chorine solution for one hour, or were treated to same but were followed with painting and full re-galvanisation or replacement of metalwork within the pen. Scrapie susceptible lambs of the PRNP genotype VRQ/VRQ were reared within these pens and their <b>scrapie</b> status was <b>monitored</b> by RAMALT. All animals became infected over an 18 -month period, even in the pen that had been subject to the most stringent decontamination process. This data suggests that recommended current guidelines for the decontamination of farm buildings following outbreaks of scrapie do little to reduce the titre of infectious scrapie material and that environmental re-contamination could also be an issue associated with these premises...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether plasminogen may feature in scrapie infection, we inoculated plasminogen-deficient (Plg−/−), heterozygous plasminogen-deficient (Plg+/−), and wild-type (Plg+/+) mice by the intracerebral or intraperitoneal (i. p.) route with the RML <b>scrapie</b> strain and <b>monitored</b> {{the onset of}} neurological signs of disease, survival time, brain, and accumulation of scrapie disease-associated forms of the prion protein (PrPSc). Only after i. p. inoculation, a slight, although significant, difference in survival (P < 0. 05) between Plg−/− and Plg+/+ mice was observed. Neuropathological examination and Western blot analysis were carried out when {{the first signs of}} disease appeared in Plg+/+ animals (175 days after i. p. inoculation) and when mice reached the terminal stage of illness. At the onset of symptoms, PrPSc accumulation was higher in the brain and spleen of Plg+/+ and Plg+/− mice than in those of Plg−/− mice, and these differences were paralleled by differences in the severity of spongiform changes and astrogliosis in the cerebral cortex and subcortical gray structures. Immunohistochemical analysis of the spleens before inoculation did not show any impairment of the immune system affecting follicular dendritic or lymphoid cells in Plg−/− mice. Once the disease progressed and mice began to die of infection, differences were no longer apparent in either brains or spleens. In conclusion, our data indicate that plasminogen has no major effect on the survival of scrapie agent-infected mice...|$|R
