The government is committed to promoting participation of local communities in managing forests. Recent policy changes for ameliorating some of the degrading factors have resulted in increased pressure on secondary forests due to rampant illegal logging and use claims by local communities and land speculators. While the largest proportion of post <b>extraction</b> <b>secondary</b> forests has been maintained as part of the permanent forest estate, substantial areas have been converted for swidden agriculture, industrial tree and estate crop plantations and transmigration areas.

The remaining stranded oil can only be recovered via various enhanced oil recovery methods. Chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) uses specialty chemicals to extract trapped oil in rock layers by generating in-situ microemulsion {{in the presence of}} reservoir brine and oil. In this case study, phase behavior tests are conducted for microemulsion formation between the surfactant solution and the oil. The phase behavior tests model reservoirs with low temperature and low salinity. In order to narrow the selection of surfactants for testing, phase behavior tests and interfacial tension experiments were used to determine the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of the oil in this reservoir. Along with phase testing, extensive interfacial tension measurements were carried out with the model oil and the reservoir fluid at various salinities. The reservoir sample oil was determined to have an EACN of around 12, which effectively models the hydrocarbon part of the multicomponent crude oil similar to a dodecane system. These results facilitate in method development for EACN determination and in the selection of the surfactants that will create optimum emulsion for high efficiency oil recovery in low temperature and low salinity reservoirs typical to the Illinois basin in the United States...|$|E

It consists of the remaining pulp of olive processing, after the extraction of oil, {{as well as the}} cracked seed of the olive fruits, containing thus mainly lignocellulose and residual oil. The commonly used practice for OMSR management is combustion, after having extracted the residual oil by <b>secondary</b> <b>extraction</b> using organic solvents. Other proposed ways of OMSR management are their exploitation as substrate for edible fungi production and compost, and as feedstock for biofuels generation such as bioethanol and methane. In the latter case, the complex carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose) of the lignocellulose of OMSR have to be degraded towards their simple sugars and further fermented via microorganisms. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of thermochemical pre-treatment of OMSR, on the final ethanol yield from the yeastPachysolentannophylus. Nine different types of OMSR-based substrates were tested i. e. raw OMSR, hydrolysates generated from pretreated OMSR with NaOH (0. 5 %, 1. 5 % w/v) and H 2 SO 4 (0. 5 %, 1. 5 % v/v), and pretreated OMSR with NaOH (0. 5 %, 1. 5 % w/v) and H 2 SO 4 (0. 5 %, 1. 5 % v/v) whole biomass.

40|$|After {{the primary}} {{extraction}} in oil reservoirs up to 60 % {{of the oil}} remains trapped in the reservoir (Sen, 2008). Therefore, different mechanisms {{have been developed to}} get the oil out to the reservoir. One of these techniques is Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) which is a technique used to produce more oil in a <b>secondary</b> <b>extraction</b> by using microbes in the reservoir. The main effects caused by microbes in oil recovery is the reduction of the interfacial tension between oil and water, wettability change of the rock and bioclogging caused by the growth and development of biofilm. Among these mechanisms, interfacial tension reduction and biclogging is thought to have the greatest impact on recovery (Sen, 2008). In this work, we describe the growth of biofilm, the growth of the microbial population and the transport of nutrients using a pore network model. We follow the previous models of Thullner et al. (Thullner, 2008) and Ezeuko et al. (Ezeuko, 2011) in which the biofilm is considered as a permeable layer. We consider the biofilm and the bacteria separately. Additionally, we assume that once a tube is full with biofilm, this biofilm can spread to the neighboring tubes. Finally, we study the changes in the hydrodynamic properties of the medium caused by the plugging of the pores and we study the flow diversion of water caused by plugging of the high permeability zones. </p...|$|E

Due {{to the ability}} of PVP to complex azo dyes and inorganic ions, covalent coupling of the ligands was not essential. Cibacron Blue F 3 GA was used as the ligand for {{extraction of}} lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from porcine muscle, while copper ions were used for extraction of B. stearothermophilus LDH with a fusion tag of six histidine residues (His(6) -LDH) from recombinant Escherichia coli homogenate. The binding strength of the enzymes to their respective ligands was only slightly reduced in the presence of PVP. The partition coefficient of Cibacron Blue and Cu(2 +) ions in the two-phase systems composed of different concentrations of PVP and Reppal was in the range of 20 - 30, with maximal partitioning being observed in the 17 % (w/w) PVP 40 - 10 % Reppal PES 100 system. Only a minor leakage of the ligands to the bottom phase was observed with time. The partitioning of porcine LDH to the PVP phase was increased 100 -fold, and a maximal recovery of 89 % was obtained in the two-phase system loaded with 0. 2 % (w/w) Cibacron Blue.

40|$|This thesis gives a {{detailed}} {{evaluation of the}} integration of power plants and post-combustion CO 2 capture based on absorption. The study looks at natural gas combined cycles and pulverized coal power plants. Also the absorption process has been evaluated separately, aiming at reducing energy requirements in the capture process. In {{the first part of}} the thesis a theoretical part was given on fundamentals of CO 2 capture by absorption, power generation, and process integration. Based on this theory, several case studies were defined for each of the three main processes. Simulation models were built accordingly and investigated. Simulation results from the capture process showed that there was a reboiler energy saving potential of 29 % and 27 % for NGCC and PC plant, respectively, when including vapor compression and absorption intercooling in the capture process. Another interesting observation made was reduced cooling duty in the overhead condenser of the stripper when applying vapor compression. Analysis of steam extraction from the NGCC plant showed it was possible to cover 1 MJ/kg CO 2 directly from the HRSG. This steam can be provided directly from the LPB. For duties above 1 MJ/kg CO 2 a <b>secondary</b> <b>extraction</b> point was required. In this study the IP/LP crossover was considered the most appropriate point to extract the remaining steam. The efficiency penalty when integrated with the different CO 2 capture cases ranged from 7 - 8 %, giving a net plant efficiency of 49. 6 - 50. 5 %. At part load it was shown that the LPT should be throttled in order to secure constant pressure at the extraction point. For the PC plant the feedwater heat system showed potential in terms heat recovery in the return stream from the capture process. By integrating the return stream with FWH 2, energy savings of 11. 9 % compared to the base case plant were found. Also it was found that the IP/LP crossover pressure should be set to 4. 5 bar, since the IPT has the highest efficiency and therefore power production in this unit should be maximized. The final results for the PC plant efficiency range from 30 - 31. 7 % and the percentual efficiency penalty was 10 - 11. 7 % for the four capture case studies. As was the case for the NGCC plant, the LPT should be throttled when operating at part load...|$|E
40|$|This file {{contains}} three final reports: 1. ion detector CoMA: Within {{the developmental}} {{frame of the}} CoMA-experiment which was planned to fly on the CRAF mission an ion detector was developed for the Design Verification Unit (DVU). It was shown that an ion detector with sufficient time resolution (2 ns) could be realized. The detector system consists of 2 units which are mechanically integrated: Dual Multichannelplate Detector; Nonlinear Preamplifier Unit. Among others, the following topics especially important under space flight aspects have been covered: finalizing investigations on the problem area of multiple pulses, development of an ESD protection circuitry, investigations on lifetime and of redundancy concepts, pulse-width coding of double pulses. 2. ion optics of the primary ion source: The COMA (Cometary Matter Analyzer) - instrument is a high mass resolution time - of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. The DVU (design verification unit) has been constructed and the TOF - section has been tested successfully using an external pulsed ion gun. In the DVU, the principal direction of the primary beam is parallel {{to that of the}} secondary beam due to mechanical design constraints. Therefore, the primary beam has to be deflected out of the main direction in order to hit the target in front of the <b>secondary</b> <b>extraction</b> lens. As in all high resolution TOF - SIMS, the primary beam pulse length should be of the order of a few nanoseconds. In addition, the COMA design goal for the primary beam spot size is 10 - 20 #mu#. The pre-target primary beam deflection therefore has to be designed for local and temporal beam crossover at the target position. Two basic deflection geometries have been suggested for this purpose: (a) a 'symmetric reflectron loop' consisting of two symmetrically situated parallel - plate condensors as 'ion mirrors' separated by drift spaces; and (b) an electrostatic sectorfield preceded by a transversal buncher, compensating to first order, the energy dispersion of the sector. 3.

40|$|The {{future of}} coal mining in the Witbank Coalfield {{over the next}} 30 years and beyond depends on {{effective}} and responsible utilization of the remaining reserves, both within unmined and previously mined areas. Similar to all mineral resources, coal is also non-renewable and the current resources will not last forever. Unlike most other resources coal resources {{have to be considered}} in long term strategic planning for energy supply. It has therefore become very important to use the remaining resources and reserves to their full potential. This has prompted mining companies to re-mine or do <b>secondary</b> <b>extraction</b> of areas mined during the previous 50 years. Reliable and internationally accepted valuation techniques and reporting standards are well established for virgin areas. The challenge is now to develop an equally robust and reliable system for remaining resources and reserves in previously mined areas. A number of established operations already exist in South Africa and internationally which are utilizing such reserves. Due to numerous factors affecting the viability of this type of operation a system or matrix is proposed for defining such resources and reserves. This classification scheme caters for the obvious geological, mining and beneficiation factors, and also for the multitude of lesser known but equally important factors. The effects of some of these factors on a future mining operation are demonstrated in a case study of such a previously mined area. Factors affecting the Run of Mine (ROM) tons and saleable tons are: a) derating percentage b) percentage mining extraction c) percentage dilution and contamination d) percentage fines generated e) spontaneous combustion Numerous pitfalls are identified such as top coaled areas, water accumulations, no access to old areas to verify existing information and the time lapsed since previous mining occurred. Another complicating factor is the lack of a method for the quantification of the impact of spontaneous combustion on remaining reserves. The financial viability of mining these areas are especially sensitive to the coal price, R/$ exchange rate, change in production and capital expenditure. The information generated during the investigation is processed in a financial model which is used to evaluate different scenarios and risk sensitivities. It is demonstrated that in evaluating previously mined areas, it is not the obvious factors that often determine the financial viability of a project, but rather the not so obvious financial factors.

This paper examines the characteristics and dynamics of secondary forests in the country. In the last century, the country lost 50 % of its natural tropical forest cover. At present, the major land cover types in terms of areal coverage are upland farms, secondary forests, protected forests, brushlands, grasslands and tree plantations. The two most dominant types of secondary forests are post <b>extraction</b> <b>secondary</b> forests and swidden fallow secondary forests.

However, there are very limited quantitative data available on these forests, including areal coverage.
