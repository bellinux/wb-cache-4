25|$|Bordeaux {{has five}} road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre {{built in the}} 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, {{just south of the}} Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a <b>suspended</b> <b>bridge</b> {{downstream}} from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the bridges}} that he {{designed}} is the Mosteirô bridge, a continuous truss frame beam, and the S.João railway bridge, a continuous structure one thousand metres in length. He made portico-shaped <b>bridges</b> and <b>suspended</b> <b>bridges</b> over the Zambezi River and Save River in Mozambique, and trussed beam bridges, over the Mondego river in Figueira da Foz, over the Kwanza river in Angola, over the Limpopo river in Xai-Xai, and in Macau. His big span concrete arcs, {{as on the}} Arrábida bridge (Porto), and in re-reinforced concrete porticos, as on the S. João railway bridge, achieved world records for that time. Since trussed beam bridges, as the Figueira da Foz bridge, the first Portuguese trussed beams <b>bridge,</b> until <b>suspended</b> <b>bridges</b> without rigidity beam, stabilized by the suspended cable and the inclination of kingpost whole rigidity, as in Zambeze bridge, Edgar Cardoso branded by the difference the structures engineering evolution.

5000|$|In some {{contexts}} {{the term}} [...] "simple suspension bridge" [...] refers not {{to this type}} of bridge but rather to a <b>suspended</b> deck <b>bridge</b> that is [...] "simple" [...] in that its deck is not stiffened. [...] Although simple suspension bridges and [...] "simple" [...] <b>suspended</b> deck <b>bridges</b> are similar in many respects, they differ in their physics. On a simple suspension bridge, the main cables (or chains) follow a hyperbolic curve, the catenary. This is because the main cables are free hanging. In contrast, on a <b>suspended</b> deck <b>bridge</b> (whether [...] "simple" [...] or not) the main cables follow a parabolic curve. This is because the main cables are tied at uniform intervals to the bridge deck below (see suspension bridge curve). The differences between these two curves was a question of importance in the 17th century, worked on by Isaac Newton among others.|$|R
