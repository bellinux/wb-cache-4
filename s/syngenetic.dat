50|$|The first {{process that}} captures carbon and stores it is <b>syngenetic</b> {{permafrost}} growth. This {{process is the}} result of a constant active layer thickness and energy exchange between permafrost, active layer, biosphere, and atmosphere, resulting in the vertical increase of the soil surface elevation. This aggradation of soil {{is the result of}} aeolian or fluvial sedimentation and/or peat formation. Peat accumulation rates are as high as 0.5mm/yr while sedimentation may cause a rise of 0.7mm/yr. Thick silt deposits resulting from abundant loess deposition during the last glacial maximum form thick carbon-rich soils known as yedoma. As this process occurs, the organic and mineral soil that is deposited is incorporated into the permafrost as the permafrost surface rises.|$|E

It is characterized by the existence of two fóssil paragenetic main conduits of about one decametre in diameter with dendritic tributaries, and a set of semi-active passages in a dendritic pattern at the north and angulate at the south. The fossil zone has a drop of 100 metres and the thickness of intermediate zone varies from 80 metres upstream to 60 metres downstream. Water flows in <b>syngenetic</b> galeries, from the northern to the southern quadrant, towards Gruta da Pena spring.It's possible to distinguish four genetic phases in the cave system development. The first one is represented by superficial phreatic galleries of small diameter, the second one by the Galeria Gémea paragenetic main conduit, the third one by the Galeria Grande and his tributaries and the last one by the active and semi-active galeries of the lower cave levels.This cave is inhabited by several endemic trogobionts: the ground-beetle Trechus lunai, the cave spider Nesticus lusitanicus and by several stygobionts, being the isopod Proaellus lusitanicus the most abundant.|$|E
50|$|Minerals {{present in}} a {{hydrothermal}} system or a fossil volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit are deposited passively or reactively. Mineral associations may vary (1) in different mineralized structures, either <b>syngenetic</b> (namely, passive precipitation in chimneys, mounds and stratiform deposits) or epigenetic (structures that correspond to feeder channels, and replacements of host rocks or pre-existing massive sulfide bodies), or structural zonation, (2) from proximal to distal associations with respect to venting areas within the same stratigraphic horizon, or horizontal zonation, (3) from deep to shallow associations (i.e., stockworks to mounds), or vertical zonation, (4) from early and climactic to late stages of mineralization (dominated by sulfides, and sulfates or oxides, respectively), or temporal zonation, and (5) in various volcano sedimentary contexts, depending essentially on the composition of volcanic rocks and, ultimately, on the tectonomagmatic context. The most common minerals in ore-bearing associations of volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (non-metamorphosed or oxidized) and their modern analogues are pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, covellite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite-tennantite, marcasite, realgar, orpiment, proustite-pyrargyrite, wurtzite, stannite (sulfides), Mn oxides, cassiterite, magnetite, hematite (oxides), barite, anhydrite (sulfates), calcite, siderite (carbonates) quartz and native gold, and are differently distributed in the various associations schematized above. The most common hydrothermal alteration assemblages are chloritic (including Mg-rich ones) and phyllic alteration (dominated by “sericite”, mostly illite), and also silicification, deep and shallow talcose alteration, and ferruginous (including Fe oxides, carbonates and sulfides) alteration.|$|E

By contrast, sand sheets of postglacial age contain few or sometimes no intraformational sand veins and wedges, suggesting that the climatic conditions were unfavourable for thermal-contraction cracking. Beneath a postglacial sand sheet near Johnson Bay, sand wedges with unusually wide tops (3. 9 m) extend down from a prominent erosion surface. The wedges grew vertically downward during deflation of the ground surface, and represent anti-syngenetic wedges. The distribution of sand veins and wedges within the sand sheets indicates that the existence of continuous permafrost during sand-sheet aggradation can be inferred confidently only during full-glacial conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{genesis of}} the giant Dongshengmiao in the {{northern}} margin of the North China Block has been debated since its discovery in the 1950 s, because it shows geological and geochemical characteristics with both <b>syngenetic</b> and epigenetic signatures. It has geological settings and sulfur and lead isotopic compositions that are similar with typical SEDEX (sedimentary exhalative) deposit, while the Zn-Pb-Cu mineralization was controlled by shear deformation and metamorphism, showing similarities with orogenic-type deposits. In this contribution, both the <b>syngenetic</b> and epigenetic features of the Dongshengmiao are envisaged, and accounted for {{in the context of}} a genetic model with two metallogenic periods. Massive pyrite at the Dongshengmiao was mostly recrystallized during metamorphism, but fine-grained texture was locally preserved, indicating its <b>syngenetic</b> origin. On the contrary, all the Zn-Pb-Cu ores observed in this study show characteristics of epigenetic hydrothermal mineralization that controlled by metamorphism and accompanying shear deformation. The sulfur and lead isotopic compositions of sphalerite and galena indicate that they were in situ remobilized from a <b>syngenetic</b> stratabound source, and the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios of ore-fluid indicate that the large-scale remobilization was assisted by metamorphic fluid. The thermodynamic modeling indicates that the ore-fluid during remobilization has a great potential of transporting Cu. This may account for the abnormally enriched Cu in the remobilized SEDEX deposit. The metamorphic fluid might strip Cu from the fluid source during devolatilization, and overprint it on the Zn-Pb orebodies during remobilization. A secondary flow-through modeling reveals that Zn- and Cu-sulfides would be preferentially redistributed in Fe-rich carbonates during remobilization, as a result of fluid-rock interaction. Conclusively, a multistage genetic model is proposed. During the development of the Proterozoic rift, stratabound Zn-Pb mineralization took place in a SEDEX ore-forming system. The <b>syngenetic</b> sulfides subsequently underwent a large-scale fluid-assisted remobilization during the early Cretaceous metamorphism and thrusting, forming the shear zone-controlled epigenetic orebodies. During the remobilization process, Cu was scavenged from the source of metamorphic fluid, and deposited accompanying remobilized Zn-Pb sulfides. Shear structures and Fe-rich carbonates are ideal sites for redistribution and re-deposition of remobilized sulfide...|$|E
40|$|Late Pleistocene Yedoma {{is often}} {{described}} as arctic loess, but its formation is still disputed in literature. Differences of interpretation remain between researchers of western and eastern Beringia. These differences largely center on the relevance of eolian processes for Yedoma formation. Researchers working in Yukon and Alaska often characterize Yedoma silts as primarily loess. In contrast, researchers working in Siberia have proposed several hypotheses about the origin of Yedoma, including alluvial, glaciolacustrine, deltaic, proluvial/colluvial, cryogenic-eolian, nival, and polygenetic processes. The polygenetic Yedoma origin combines two major processes, (1) sedimentation and (2) <b>syngenetic</b> freezing, which were largely controlled by similar landscape and relief characteristics, climate conditions, periglacial processes, and the occurrence of nearby sediment sources. <b>Syngenetic</b> freezing, including the presence of large <b>syngenetic</b> ice wedges, unique cryostructures of the frozen deposits as well as fossils of the late Pleistocene mammoth megafauna and tundra-steppe flora, is the overarching similarity of the Yedoma deposits.

40|$|The origin, structure, {{and history}} of the Brunswick iron-formation and massive sulfides of the Brunswick 6 and 12 mines are reviewed. New {{evidence}} concerning structure, stratigraphy, and alteration of the orebodies is presented. Five generations of folds are described, of which the earliest three have an important influence on the large-scale structure of the mine areas. The earliest folds, F•, are large and overturned to the north and are related to coeval thrusting. These folds have not been recognized previously. The main orebody folds are upright, isoclinal, locally downward-facing structures of the F 2 generation. The mineralization is interpreted as <b>syngenetic,</b> but evidence is presented to show that previously interpreted feeder pipes do not exist in a presently recognizable form and that previously interpreted <b>syngenetic</b> alteration is in fact a later diagenetic or postdiagenetic feature. Remobilization of the sulfide mineralization continued until after the Fa deformation and concentration of the sulfides may be a relatively late feature, but the possibility of the main concentration being <b>syngenetic</b> cannot be ruled out.

40|$|To {{simulate}} a natural carbonate-silicate medium parental for both diamondites and their <b>syngenetic</b> mineral inclusions, melanocratic carbonatites of the Chagatai complex, Uzbeki-stan, were used. The carbonatites {{are characterized by}} {{a high percentage of}} silicate components and high-pressure eclogitic silicate minerals. The experiments carried out at 7. 0 – 8. 5 GPa and 1800 °C show that the diamondites formed very quickly in C-enriched carbonate-silicate melts of the Chagatai carbonatites. According to experimental evidence, the mineralogy of the Chagatai carbonatites under P-T conditions of diamondite formation is represented by grossular-almandine garnet, diopside-hedenbergite clinopyroxene, and calcite (aragonite) and resembles the mineralogy of diamond-bearing Ca-rich eclogites and grospydites found in kimberlites as mantle xenoliths. The Chagatai carbonatites are quite appropriate as a parental medium to simulate physicochemical processes for the formation of natural diamondites. The most important characteristics of these processes are as follows: quick migration of mobile low-viscosity carbonate-silicate melts into zones of diamondite formation, extremely high “snowballing ” rate of diamondite crystallization from a carbon-ate-silicate melt oversaturated with dissolved carbon, formation of <b>syngenetic</b> inclusions of garnet and clinopyroxene, carbonate and sulfides, etc. inside the pores and cavities of diamondites.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a vein-shaped graphite occurrence in which, {{for the first}} time, the geological, mineralogical and isotopic evidence support its formation by physical remobilization of previously formed <b>syngenetic</b> graphite. The deposit studied {{is located in the}} Spanish Central System and it occurs along the contact between a hydrothermal Ag-bearing quartz vein and a graphite-bearing quartzite layer. The characteristics of this occurrence differ from those of fluid-deposited vein-type graphite mineralization in that: (1) graphite flakes are oriented parallel to the vein walls; (2) graphite crystallinity is slightly lower than in the <b>syngenetic</b> precursor (graphite disseminated in the quartzite); and (3) the isotopic signatures of both types of graphite are identical and correspond to biogenic carbon. In addition, the P-T conditions of the hydrothermal Ag-bearing quartz veins in the study area (P < 1 kbar, and T up to 360 ëC) contrast with the high degree of structural order of graphite in the vein. Therefore, physical remobilization of graphite can be regarded as a suitable alternative mechanism to account for some cases of vein-shaped graphite deposits. Such a mechanism would require a previous concentration of disseminated <b>syngenetic</b> graphite promoted, in this case, by the retrograde solubility of quartz. This process would generate monomineralic graphite aggregates enhancing its lubricant properties and permitting graphite to move in the solid state along distances in the range of up to several metres...|$|E

The deposit consist of both stratiform and vein orebodies. The former are of possible <b>syngenetic</b> origin, whereas the latter are ascribed to syn-metamorphic remobilization of pre-existing anomalies. In particular, a syn-metamorphic shear-zone, extensively affecting the northern sector of the deposit, favored intense circulation and focusing of fluids, leading to the emplacement {{of a number of}} metamorphogenic barite +/- polymetallic sulfide orebodies. The geochemical features of stratiform and vein orebodies and of their host rocks have been used to constrain the hydrology and possible provenance of mineralizing fluids. <b>Syngenetic</b> barites are systematically Sr- 87 -depleted with respect to epigenetic barites, indicating that they did not act as a Sr-isotope buffer for syn-metamorphic mineralizing fluids. In addition, the Sr-isotope composition of host rocks does not reflect equilibrium with adjoining vein bodies. These results indicate that (1) interaction between mineralizing fluids, <b>syngenetic</b> barite and host rocks was rather scarce, reflecting a channeled rather than pervasive fluid flow; (2) the source of radiogenic Sr was not represented by Pollone host rocks, but possibly by basement rocks located at depth below the barite orebodies.

This profile is {{considered}} strata-typical and critical in understanding of paleogeographic {{conditions of the}} Arctic in Pleistocene-Holocene. However, interpretation of the profile is under discussion. It consists of two distinct strata: upper layer of 10 – 15 m thick represented by continental sediments and lower one with a thickness of more than 100 m represented by marine sediments. Lower layer of saline marine clays has lenses of tabular ground ice (more than 20 m thick), the bases of which are below the sea level. Upper continental layer is characterized by <b>syngenetic</b> ice-wedges of different generations. Samples were collected from ice-wedges and tabular ground ice for chemical and isotope analysis. The results of the analysis allow to reconstruct paleogeographic conditions of the sedimentation and freezing of Quaternary sediments. Heavy stable isotope content and relationship between oxygen and hydrogen isotopes show that the ice bodies in the lower layer were formed in-situ within the ground. In the upper layer, heavier isotope content found in younger ice-wedges relative to the old-generation wedges. Formation of massive <b>syngenetic</b> Upper-Pleistocene ice-wedges occurred in conditions of colder winter temperatures than at present. <b>Syngenetic</b> Holocene wedges were formed after Holocene Optimum under winter conditions similar to present.

40|$|In recent years, {{several studies}} have focused on the growth {{conditions}} of the diamonds through the analysis of the mineral inclusions trapped in them. In these studies, it is crucial to distinguish between protogenetic, <b>syngenetic</b> and epigenetic inclusions. X-ray topography (XRDT) can be a helpful tool to verify, in a nondestructive way, the genetic nature of inclusions in diamond. With this aim, a diamond from the Udachnaya kimberlite, Siberia, was investigated. The diamond, previously studied by Nestola et al. (2011), has anomalous birefringence and the two largest olivines have typical “diamond-imposed” shapes. The study of the topographic images shows that the diamond exhibits significant deformation fields related to post growth plastic deformation. The absence of dislocations starting from the olivine inclusions, and the dark contrasts around them represent the main results obtained by XRDT, contributing to the elucidation of the relationships between the diamond and the olivines at the micron-meter scale. The dark halo surrounding the inclusions was likely caused by the effect of different thermo-elastic properties between the diamond and the inclusions. The absence of dislocations indicates that the diamond-imposed morphology did not produce the volume distortion commonly associated with the entrapment of the full-grown inclusions and, thus, only based on such evidence, a <b>syngenetic</b> origin could be proposed. In addition, stepped figures optically observed at the interface between diamond and one of the olivines suggest processes of selective partial dissolution that would contribute to a change in the final morphology of inclusions. These results show that a diamond morphology may be imposed to a full-grown (protogenetic) olivine during their encapsulation, suggesting that the bulk of the inclusion is protogenetic, whereas its more external regions, close to the diamond-inclusion interface, could be <b>syngenetic...</b>|$|E
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Angas prospect {{is a small}} stratiform Pb-Zn-Ag mineralised region located on the southeastern flank of the regionally metamorphosed Mount Lofty Ranges, approximately 50 km southeast of Adelaide. The Angas prospect is hosted by Cambrian flysch-like metasediments, that reached mid-amphibolite facies during Cambrian-Ordovician orogeny. High base metal content mineralisation occurs as massive metamorphically recrystallised, coarse-grained sphalerite, galena, pyrite, and pyrrhotite. Intergranular and intergrown sulphides and gangue, suggest a <b>syngenetic</b> origin. Disseminated base metal sulphides are pervasive within the host-unit lithology. Geochemical analyses of silicate/spinel minerals reveal trends that make them important primary exploration targets. Increasing zinc content in staurolite provides a vector toward increasing base metal content. Manganiferous garnet defines the boundaries of a geochemical anomaly that hosts the Angas prospect orebody, indicating its importance as a primary exploration target. Gahnite (zinc-spinel) is found only to occur within a restricted region of the geochemical anomaly, and is mainly associated with areas of high base metal content. The sulphur isotopic signature suggests a dual source of sulphur derived from the mixing of modified Cambrian seawater with biogenic sulphur, producing delta 34 S around zero o/oo. Model Pb isotopic signature ages indicate a <b>syngenetic</b> origin. The sphalerite geobarometer tentatively suggests that the base metals sulphides experienced the same metamorphic pressures as silicate/spinel assemblages. Comparison of the geochemical anomaly at Angas prospect with modern seafloor hydrothermal precipitates show remarkable mineralogy similarities. Supplementing these data are the similarities that exist between Angas prospect whole-rock signatures and ancient hydrothermal systems (e. g. exhalative Broken Hill-type deposits) and unmetamorphosed exhalatives of Dee Range (Queenland).

40|$|The {{identification}} of <b>syngenetic</b> inclusions in diamond (i. e. inclusions of minerals that crystallized {{at the same}} time and by the same genesis as their host) has long been of paramount importance in diamond studies. However, the widespread assumption that many or most inclusions in diamonds are <b>syngenetic</b> is based on qualitative morphological criteria and few direct measurements. In order to provide statistically significant information on inclusion–host genetic relations for at least one kimberlite, we have determined the crystallographic orientations of 43 olivine inclusions with diamond-imposed morphology, a feature generally interpreted to indicate syngenesis, in 20 diamonds from the Udachnaya kimberlite (Siberia). Our unprecedented large data set indicates no overall preferred orientation of these olivines in diamond. However, multiple inclusions within a single diamond frequently exhibit similar orientations, implying that they were derived from original single monocrystals. Therefore, regardless of the possible chemical re-equilibration during diamond-forming processes, at least some of the olivines may have existed prior to the diamond (i. e. they are protogenetic).

The histopathology of both grafted and recipient thyroid was similar and was characterized by infiltration with mononuclear cells together with some plasma cells. Conversely, grafting of affected thyroids from Tx-X rats to normal animals resulted in the regression of the lesion in the graft and no evidence thyroiditis was observed in either the graft or the recipient's thyroid when these were examined 60 days post-grafting.

Field studies have increased our 20 knowledge of cryostructures and massive ground ice in epigenetic and <b>syngenetic</b> permafrost. 21 Epigenetic permafrost deposits are relatively ice-poor and composed primarily of pore-filled 22 cryostructures, apart from an ice-enriched upper section and intermediate layer. <b>Syngenetic</b> 23 permafrost deposits are commonly identified from cryostructures indicative of an aggrading 24 permafrost table and are characterized by a high ice content, ice-rich cryofacies, and nested 25 wedge ice. Degradation of ice-rich permafrost can be marked by thaw unconformities, 26 truncated buried ice wedges, ice-wedge pseudomorphs, and organic-rich ‘forest beds’. 27 Studies of massive ground ice have focused on wedge ice, thermokarst-cave ice, intrusive ice, 28 and buried ice. Significant advances have been made in methods for differentiating between 29 tabular massive ice bodies of glacier and intrasedimental origin. Recent studies have utilized 30 palynology, isotope geochemistry and hydrochemistry, in addition to sedimentary and 31 cryostratigraphic analyses. The application of remote sensing techniques and laboratory 32 methods such as CT scanning has improved estimations of the ice content of frozen 33 sediments...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} studies on the {{reticulum}} cell sarcoma (RCS) tumors of SJL/J mice presented here, indicate that spontaneous tumors, which arise in older mice, also possess the capacity to induce the vigorous proliferative response in <b>syngenetic</b> T lymphocytes that are characteristic of the transplantable RCS lines. Analysis of cell surface antigens revealed the presence of Ia determinats on gradient- purified transplantable RCS tumor cells; however, these cells did not express Thy 1. 2, nIg, or, any of the viral proteins that were tested for by specific antisera. Pretreatment of RCS cells with anti-Ia sera and complement-deleted cells that were stimulatory for <b>syngenetic</b> T lymphocytes, and addition of anti-Ia sera directly to cultures blocked the proliferative response at the stimulator (RCS) cell level. Lymph node cells from H- 2 (8) strains other than SJL/J, including A. SW and B 10. S also gave proliferative responses to RCS cells, although lower in magnitude. A requirement {{on the part of}} responding cells for identity with RCS cells at the Ir region was indicated by the finding that A. TH but not A. TL lymph node cells responded to RCS. It is concluded that RCS cells stimulate Ir-region identical T cells (without evidence of presensitization) through a modification in the expression of Ia antigens {{on the surface of the}} tumor cells...|$|E
40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the problem of}} oil bearing of the Domanic Formation on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Tatarstan. Comparing the geochemical characteristics of bitumen of the Semilukskian horizon and oils of the Eifelian-Frasnian terrigenous complex, it was concluded that in the Semilukskian horizon, mobile bitumen are present along with the <b>syngenetic</b> dispersed matter, which, according to gas-liquid chromatography, are identical to the oil of the underlying terrigenous deposits of the Pashian and Timanian horizons. These bitumens are migratory and reflect the process of upward vertical oil migration, which is responsible for the formation of industrial deposits in the Semilukskian, Sargaevskian, and Rechitskian horizons in those areas where the lithological features of the rocks and the development of superficial fracturing in them make it possible to create a collecting space. The rocks of the Domanic facies should be considered as accumulation or accumulation-generation system, oil deposits of which were formed due to oil systems generated in other sources. New methods of search are needed that allow us to quickly assess the content of migratory hydrocarbons and <b>syngenetic</b> organic matter. This is possible {{on the basis of a}} rapid study of the sludge, which will allow to assess the presence of mobile hydrocarbons and their quantity during drilling. An analysis of the spatial distribution of migratory hydrocarbons will allow localizing oil migration channels...|$|E
40|$|Late Permian kuroko-type {{mineralization}} in the Bully Hill {{area of the}} East Shasta district formed along two horizons {{within the}} Bully Hill rhyolite. In the Bully Hill, Rising Star, and Copper city mine areas, <b>syngenetic</b> mineralization is underlain by alteration zones characterized by addition of SiO₂ and K₂O, loss of NaCO, CaO, and Fe₂O₃*, and the assemblage quartz + sericite + pyrite. Quartz precipitation in the upper portion of the zones led to cyclic sealing of fluid flow, rupturing of the seal, quartz supers aturation, focused fluid discharge, and formation of sulfide mounds on the seafloor. <b>Syngenetic</b> mineralization occurred in several stages: (1) deposition of fine-grained banded sulfides and gangue; (2 a) recrystallization of Stage 1 minerals, and void-filling by pyrite + weakly chalcopyrite-diseased sphalerite ± barite; (2 b) deposition of coarsely-crystalline pyrite + heavily chalcopyrite-diseased sphalerite; (3 a) void-filling and replacement by galena + chalcopyrite + tetrahedrite-tennantite; (3 b) replacement by chalcopyrite; and (4) replacement by barite. ΣSO₄⁼ and H₂S contents of hydrothermal fluids decreased from Stages 2 a to 3 a. δ³⁴S values of sulfides increased successively from Stages 1 (- 15. 8 per mil) to 3 a (3. 0 per mil), reflecting variable inputs of biogenic sulfur and deep-seated fluid evolution. δ³⁴S values of <b>syngenetic</b> barites range from 12. 4 to 22. 5 per mil, reflecting cold seawater and hydrothermal sulfur sources, respectively. δ³⁴S values of epigenetic pyrite and barite within the alteration zones range from - 0. 7 to 2. 7 per mil and 12. 4 to 24. 1 per mil, respectively. Primary and pseudosecondary fluid inclusions in epigenetic minerals have filling temperatures of 240 to 260 °C and salinities of 3 to 12. 3 equivalent weight percent NaCl. Lower limits of fluid salinities and δ³⁴S values of barite indicate that seawater was a primary component of the hydrothermal fluid, and that seawater also mixed with discharging fluids on the seafloor. High fluid salinities, {{the lack of a}} silica source, and the close link of magmatism with mineralization indicate that magmatic fluids may have been {{an important component of the}} hydrothermal fluids...|$|E
40|$|The basin infill of the As Pontes Tertiary strike-slip basin (A Coruña, NW Spain) mainly {{consists}} of terrigenous sediments and lignites. This contribution deals with establishing the depositional environment of these lignites, {{as well as}} with the analysis of their range, maceral composition and paragenetic mineral sequence. The major and trace elements in the lignites and their affinities were also determined. The integration of the available sedimentological, stratigraphical, petrographical, mineralogical and geochemical data allowed to establish: a) The depositional and geochemical controlling features on sulphur accumulation. b) A model for the lignite formation and evolution. The successive, tectonically forced evolutionary stages in the basin generated diverse lignite kinds with different characteristics. The lower coal seams are characterised by highest sulphur and early diagenetic mineral content. These coals were formed in small size, restricted swamp-lacustrine environment with alkaline and highly mineralised <b>syngenetic</b> pore solutions. The basin evolved later to more pore - water dilute low-lying swamps with larger areal extent and lower mineralised <b>syngenetic</b> solutions. As a consequence, the middle and upper coalseams were deposited under decreasing alkalinity and sulphur content, closely related with the basin evolution. The upper coal seams show lower sulphur content and the highest detritical mineral content, in comparison to the underlying seams. The correlation between the mineralogical and geochemical parameters of the As Pontes lignites showed the following element associations: a) major organic affinity for Ca and Mg, and minor affinity for S, Mn and B; b) major aluminosilicate affinity for Al, K, Na, Ti, Bi, Cr, Cs, Cu, Ga, Hf, Li, Mo, Nb, Pb, Rb, Sn, Th, Tl, U, V, Zr and REE, and minor affinity for As, B, Ba, Be, Ge, Mn, P, Sb, Sc, Sr and Se; c) sulphide affinity for Fe, S, As, Co, Ni and Zn; and d) phosphate affinity for P, Ba and Sr. The evolution and the quality of the coal was controlled mainly by: a) Tectonic activity, which controlled subsidence, drainage evolution and basin infill trends. b) Climate, which controlled water supply and evaporation. c) Parent rock, which influenced on detritical mineral supply and water hydrochemistry. d) <b>Syngenetic</b> solutions pH and Fe 2 +/SO 42 - rate, which influenced diagenetic minerals formation and sulphur content and forms in the lignites...|$|E
