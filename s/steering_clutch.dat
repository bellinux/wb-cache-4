50|$|Located in Bangkok, Thailand, Siam Kubota Industry Co.,Ltd. is a {{joint venture}} between The Siam Cement Pcl., Kubota Corporation, Marubeni Corporation, and Min Sen Machinery Co.,Ltd. than began {{operations}} in 1978 http://www.siamkubota.co.th/en/index.aspx.

25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double differential, replacing the <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> {{with a single}} braked differential similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the system, acting as {{pressure}} sink as well as suspension elements, are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated brake accumulator on some models. On later cars fitted with Hydractive or Activa suspension, there may be as many as ten spheres. Spheres consist of a hollow metal ball, open to the bottom, with a flexible desmopan rubber membrane, fixed at the 'equator' inside, separating top and bottom. The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car's hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a security valve, and depending on type of vehicle, can power the <b>steering,</b> <b>clutch,</b> gear selector, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Because driver's hatch {{was moved}} from the glacis plate and {{positioned}} so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead of crawling out of the hatch, his seat received an elevating mechanism. While in a relatively safe area the driver could elevate his seat to look outside of the tank, providing greater visibility and easier access to the controls. While in combat the driver lowered his seat back into the tank and {{had to rely on}} the vision slot protected by [...] (three-layer glass). While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and incline brake were positioned much higher and the levers of the <b>steering</b> <b>clutch</b> and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank.|$|E
50|$|Morozov's {{new medium}} tank design {{received}} a skeptical response. It {{was believed that}} putting a high-speed 12-cylinder engine with a working displacement of almost 40 liters perpendicular to the direction of travel would cause problems, including breaking the connecting rods. It was believed that decreasing the displacement of the engine compartment {{for the purpose of}} enlarging the fighting compartment was unnecessary and that moving the turret rearwards would limit the elevation angle of the main gun. However, it turned out that even though rotating the engine complicated the transmission by introducing an additional reduction gear - gear-train and fan drive, it also solved many problems. The cover of the engine and transmission compartment turned along with the radiator; this allowed easier access to the engine, transmission and batteries. The significant decrease in the length of the engine compartment allowed the turret to be moved rearwards, which in turn moved its rotation axis and the center of mass {{to the center of the}} hull, increased the accuracy of the main gun and decreased a chance that the turret could get stuck after getting hit in the turret ring with a projectile that ricocheted. The thickness of the frontal armor protection more than doubled without disturbing the center of mass or drastically increasing the weight of the tank. At the beginning of World War II the thickness of T-34 armor was considered enough. Improvements made to the T-34 during World War II included increasing the caliber of the gun (from 76.2 mm to 85 mm) and thickening the armor of the turret. No significant improvements were made to the hull. Increasing the size of the fighting compartment allowed the removal of floor ammunition stowage. The height of the tank was decreased by 300 mm, even though the turret remained almost the same. Removal of the conical pair in the transmission permitted fitting a more compact gear box and improved the control of the brakes and the <b>steering</b> <b>clutch.</b> Visibility from the driver's position was improved. The driver was protected from being splashed by water while the vehicle was fording. The new torsion bar suspension allowed easier crossing of rough ground.|$|E
5000|$|The unique long-handled [...] "Thai" [...] type two-wheel tractor was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by M.R. Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have <b>steering</b> <b>clutches,</b> longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and <b>steering</b> <b>clutches.</b> Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, spiked tooth harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a rotary tiller and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R

5000|$|However, it was {{discovered}} that the rear of the vehicle was overloaded and that the vehicle's manoeuvrability was far from satisfactory. To counter the first problem, the rear tension wheels were enlarged, equipped with leaf springs and lowered to the ground, thus converting them to driving wheels. The problem with steering the tractor under heavy load was eventually solved by adding two <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> to both sides of the suspension system. The latter modification in 1938 was included also {{in the development of the}} TKS tankette (in the TKS-B variant). However, by then the serial production of TKS was stopped and in the end the C2P's undercarriage remained distinctive. However, as both designs were being developed simultaneously at the same facility, both were supervised by Rudolf Gundlach and their designers sometimes referred to the C2P as [...] "ciągnik TKS" [...] (TKS tractor), some sources call C2P a development version of TKS, which is not entirely true.|$|R

25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse <b>steering</b> shaft and <b>clutch</b> system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the result}} of the field {{experiment}} of the microcomputerized driverless combine is described. There are two ways of applying automatic control techniques to agricultural machinery. One of them can be applyed to unit farm machinery such as tractor and combine. The other is for agricultural facilities such as a green house or grain dryer plant. This research is included in the former category, and concerns control of a moving vehicle. For this kind of work, some difficulty is sometimes met in sensing and controlling optimally the actuator, because of the rapid and frequent change of circumstances under which the machine is running. In our former work, one of the authors reported on the programmed and feedback control systems of head feed type combine. However those controlling methods could not cover the multiple operation completely. The application of microcomputer not only to indutrial machines but also to agricultural machinery can solve this problem. The following advantages can be listed for the use of micro-computer with agricultural machinery : (1) Multi-input signals can be processed and controlled. (2) Software can easily help {{to solve the problem of}} changing the control process or procedure of routine work which was programmed and stored prior to the operation. (3) Time, labor and energy in agricultural operation can be saved. (4) Safety can be ensured. (5) Machinery can be systematically controlled. Based upon the above merits of using micro-computer with agricultural machinery, a micro-computerized driverless combine was constructed and its controllability was evaluated according to actual harvesting operation in the paddy field. From the test results, the following points are revealed. (1) The machine worked well and control was done satisfactorily, but the <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> should be adjusted for suitable braking force depending on the circumstances of steering and turning at the end of row of rice plants. (2) The hydraulic circuit should be modified to obtain the simultaneous control of the lifting motion of cutter bar and travelling, including the steering and turning. (3) The mechanical sensing device for detecting the cutting height did not work so well, especially in the muddy, wet field. A different type of sensor (such as ultrasonic or optical) is recommended, in addition to the consideration of the position or location of the sensor to be mounted. (4) The learning function should be added to improve the ease of adjustability of control factor referring to the field condition, etc. It can be concluded from this work that the possibility of applying the micro-computer control system to the combine was notably high, and this technique will probably be widely distributed for practical use and future commercial machines...|$|R

50|$|When {{driving in}} a {{straight}} line the two engines were locked; turning the steering wheel gradually closed the throttle for the engine of one track and opened the throttle for the engine driving the other. The two engines were joined at their cross-shafts, from which the final drive to the tracks was by chains to sprockets on either side. When <b>steering</b> the <b>clutches</b> joining the cross-shafts were released, one engine sped up while the other slowed down, the turn being on the side opposite to that of the faster running engine. The steering effect could be increased by use of the brakes on one engine or another. This arrangement had the advantage over that of earlier tanks of being controlled by one man only, but called for great skill {{on the part of the}} driver, because one or both of the engines could be stalled if care was not exercised. Although in theory a simple solution to give gradual steering, in practice it proved impossible to control the speeds of the engines, causing the vehicle to take an unpredictable path. Drivers grew wary and stopped the vehicle and locked one track before every turn; this caused many track breaks, as the movement became too abrupt.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to new {{challenging}} control problems arising in the automotive industry {{as a consequence of}} the customer-driven performance specifications adopted by car builders which have dramatically increased the number of new proposed automated features where feedback interacts with the driver.
