The hybrid algorithms combine di erent local search procedures, including Pareto local search and two phase local search algorithms, with two di erent population-based algorithms, namely a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and a multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithm. The experimental evaluation of these approaches shows that the best hybrid designs, combining Pareto local search with a multi-objective ant colony optimization approach, outperform the best algorithms that have been previously proposed for the TSCP.

30|$|In our study, the new {{fixation}} method {{use only}} three screws.

Three screw heads are shaped into a triangle, which can protect against shear and twisting forces and obtain better stabilization. We also find that this new method is more suitable for type III Hoffa fractures. Because in type III Hoffa fractures, the fracture line is oblique and the fracture fragment in the intercondylar notch is big enough to insert a screw. But in type I Hoffa fractures, the fracture line is vertical and the screw entry point must be closed to the weight-bearing area of the articular cartilage.|$|R
50|$|Monobrowlines are {{a variant}} of browlines in which the bridge is {{contiguous}} with the caps, creating a solid, unbroken line {{across the top of}} the frame. The style dates back to the Shuron Stag, a browline prototype, which enjoyed some brief popularity before being replaced by the Ronsir as Shuron's flagship frame. The original stag had no metal chassis: the lenses were mounted directly to the brow caps via two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>screws.</b> The modern monobrowline originated in the 1980s, as part of an effort by Bausch and Lomb to diversify their Ray-Ban sunglass collection with the Wayfarer Max, a fusion of the then-popular Wayfarer and Clubmaster sunglass models. The style proved unpopular and was quickly phased out. The monobrowline design was resurrected by a variety of manufacturers in the 2010s (chiefly Oakley) after browlines returned to popularity. Unlike its tenure in the 1980s, monobrowlines proved to be a popular variant among eyeglass wearers in the 2010s.|$|R

Then, we define the concept of virtual linkage as a way of expressing the constraints induced by the sensors. We then use the redundancy approach of C.

All the analysis, originally suited for proximity, range or force sensors, is applied to the case of visual sensors. The various involved mappings and the needed assumptions are precised; the design of adequate task functions which use special image features is presented, with some indications on the practical derivation of the jarobian models.
