5000|$|<b>Sertaconazole</b> {{has also}} {{antiinflammatory}} and antipruritic action. It inhibits {{the release of}} proinflammatory cytokines from activated immune cells. It {{has been shown that}} <b>sertaconazole</b> activatates of the p38/COX2/PGE2 pathway. PGE2 can have a variety of important effects in the body including activation of the body's fever response.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, <b>sertaconazole</b> {{contains}} a benzothiophene ring {{which makes it}} unique from other imidazole antifungals. A benzothiophene ring is a sulfur analogue of the indole ring found in the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan {{is found in the}} fungal membrane in addition to lipids such as ergosterol. The benzothiophene ring in <b>sertaconazole</b> mimics tryptophan and increases the drugs ability to form pores in the fungal cell membrane. If the cell membrane is made sufficiently leaky by these pores the fungal cell will die from loss of ATP and other effects which can include calcium disregulation. These pores are believed to open at about 10 minutes following topical application of <b>sertaconazole.</b> One hour following topical application, approximately 90% of fungal cells die from lack of energy (due to ATP loss) and general loss of homeostasis. <b>Sertaconazole</b> is thought to be the only imidazole antifungal with this mechanism of action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sertaconazole</b> {{also appears}} to inhibit the dimorphic {{transformation}} of Candida albicans into pathogenic fungi.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sertaconazole</b> {{has several}} known {{mechanisms}} of action. It is considered fungistatic, fungicidal, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antitrichomonal, and antipruritic.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects were}} rarely {{reported}} with <b>sertaconazole</b> therapy, but may include contact dermatitis, burning on application site and skin dryness.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been shown that <b>sertaconazole</b> can kill Trichomonas vaginalis in vitro. The exact {{mechanism}} of action is as yet unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sertaconazole</b> {{also has}} {{antibacterial}} action. It is {{hypothesized that the}} mechanism of action again involves sertaconazole's ability to form pores by mimicking tryptophan.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sertaconazole</b> (Ertaczo, Dermofix, Konzert, Zalain) is an {{antifungal}} medication of the imidazole class. It {{is available}} as a cream to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot.|$|E
5000|$|Like other {{imidazole}} antifungals, <b>sertaconazole</b> {{blocks the}} synthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting the 14α-demethylase enzyme. Ergosterol is {{a critical component of}} the fungal cell membrane. Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis prevents fungal cells from multiplying and impairs hyphae growth.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sertaconazole</b> nitrate is an {{antifungal}} agent that exhibits anti-inflammatory activity; however, the mechanism for this action was unknown. We investigated the cellular {{mechanisms by which}} <b>sertaconazole</b> exerts its anti-inflammatory activity in keratinocytes and human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs). Paradoxically, <b>sertaconazole</b> was found to activate the proinflammatory p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment with <b>sertaconazole</b> also resulted in the induction of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and the subsequent release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Knocking down p 38 in keratinocytes using small interfering RNA resulted in an inhibition of sertaconazole-induced PGE 2 release confirming that activation of p 38 was required for PGE 2 production. Additionally, in stimulated keratinocytes and human PBMCs, <b>sertaconazole</b> was found to suppress the release of cytokines. Treatment with anti-PGE 2 antiserum or the COX- 2 inhibitor NS 398 reversed the inhibitory effects of <b>sertaconazole</b> on the release of proinflammatory cytokines, linking endogenous PGE 2 with the anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, in an in vivo mouse model of tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) -induced dermatitis, the sertaconazole-mediated inhibition of TPA-induced ear edema was reversed by NS 398. Biochemical analysis of tissue biopsies revealed increase in PGE 2 levels in sertaconazole-treated mice. Thus, activation of the p 38 –COX- 2 –PGE 2 pathway by agents such as <b>sertaconazole</b> provides anti-inflammatory therapeutic benefits...|$|E

40|$|Background : <b>Sertaconazole</b> is a new, broad spectrum, fungicidal and {{fungistatic}} imidazole {{with added}} antipruritic and anti-inflammatory activity {{that would provide}} greater symptomatic relief and hence would be beneficial in {{improving the quality of}} life for the patient with dermatophytoses. Aims and Objectives : To compare efficacy and safety of <b>sertaconazole,</b> terbinafine and luliconazole in patients with dermatophytoses. Materials and Methods : 83 patients with tinea corporis and tinea cruris infections were enrolled in this multicentre, randomized, open label parallel study. The initial ′Treatment Phase′ involved three groups receiving either <b>sertaconazole</b> 2 % cream applied topically twice daily for four weeks, terbinafine 1 % cream once daily for two weeks, luliconazole 1 % cream once daily for two weeks. At the end of treatment phase, there was a ′Follow-up Phase′ at end of 2 weeks, where the patients were assessed clinically and mycologically for relapse. Results : Of the 83 patients, 62 completed the study, <b>sertaconazole</b> (n = 20), terbinafine (n = 22) and luliconazole (n = 20). The primary efficacy variables including change in pruritus, erythema, vesicle, desquamation and mycological cure were significantly improved in all the three groups, as compared to baseline, in the Treatment and Follow-up phase. Greater proportion of patients in <b>sertaconazole</b> group (85 %) showed resolution of pruritus as compared to terbinafine (54. 6 %); and luliconazole (70 %), (P < 0. 05 <b>sertaconazole</b> vs terbinafine). There was a greater reduction in mean total composite score (pruritus, erythema, vesicle and desquamation) in <b>sertaconazole</b> group (97. 1 %) as compared to terbinafine (91. 2 %) and luliconazole (92. 9 %). All groups showed equal negative mycological assessment without any relapses. All three study drugs were well tolerated. Only one patient in <b>sertaconazole</b> group withdrew from the study due to suspected allergic contact dermatitis. Conclusion : <b>Sertaconazole</b> was better than terbinafine and luliconazole in relieving signs and symptoms during study and follow up period.

Phase solubility studies indicated that the solubility of <b>sertaconazole</b> in enzyme-free simulated gastric- and enzyme-free simulated enteric fluids was significantly increased in the presence of cyclodextrins. The observed order of solubility increasing effect was: γ-CD[*]>[*]HPγ-CD[*]>[*]HPβ-CD[*]>[*]β-CD[*]>[*]α-CD. Solid-state sertaconazole–cyclodextrin complexes were prepared by freeze drying, and characterized by X-ray powder difractometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Freeze-dried complexes showed markedly higher solubility than both physical mixtures and <b>sertaconazole</b> alone. The antimycotic activities of sertaconazole–cyclodextrin complexes in solution were evaluated by inhibition zone assays with Candida albicans.

40|$|Context: To {{the best}} of our knowledge, till date no study {{comparing}} the efficacy and safety of terbinafine hydrochloride 1 % cream and <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate 2 % cream has been done in localized tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Aims: This clinical trial was carried out to study and compare the efficacy of topical terbinafine hydrochloride 1 % cream and <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate 2 % cream in localized tinea corporis and tinea cruris and to know the adverse effects of these antifungal creams. Settings and Design: In this prospective, single blind, randomized control trial with two arms, patient were randomized into two groups Group A (treatment with terbinafine cream) and Group B (treatment with <b>sertaconazole</b> cream). A total of 38 patients were enrolled for the study, 20 patients in group A and 18 patients in group B. But five patients of group A and three patients of group B were lost for follow-ups. Therefore sample size was of 30 patients with 15 patients in group A and group B each. Materials and Methods: Patients in group A and B were treated with twice daily topical 1 % terbinafine hydrochloride and 2 % <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate cream respectively for a total duration of three weeks. Clinical improvement in signs and symptoms of each clinical parameter, namely itching, erythema, papules, pustules, vesicles, and scaling were graded weekly and clinical cure was assessed. KOH mount and culture was done weekly up to 3 weeks to access mycological cure. Fungal culture was done on Sabouraud′s dextrose agar with chloramphenicol and cycloheximide. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was done using students paired and unpaired t-tests from the data obtained. Results: Comparison between Group A and Group B for complete cure (clinical and mycological) showed {{that at the end of}} 3 weeks both terbinafine and <b>sertaconazole</b> groups had 100 % complete cure. When the two groups were compared for complete cure, at the end of 1 st and 2 nd week, statistically non-significant results were observed (P = 0. 461 and P = 0. 679 respectively). However, at the end of 2 nd week, complete cure rate for terbinafine was 80 % as compared to 73. 35 % for <b>sertaconazole</b> with no statistical significance. In both Group A and Group B, clinically significant local side effects like erythema, swelling, stinging sensation, or increased itching were not noticed. A majority of our patients in both the group showed Trichophyton rubrum followed by Trichophyton mentagrophytes growth on culture. In Group A, 11 patients showed growth of T. rubrum, 2 patients showed growth of T. mentagrophytes, and 1 patient had only KOH test positive. In Group B, 10 patients revealed growth of T. rubrum, followed by growth of T. mentagrophytes in 3 and Microsporum canis in 2 patients. The therapeutic response is more or less same in infection with different species. Conclusions: The newer fungistatic drug <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate 2 % cream was as effective as terbinafine hydrochloride 1 % cream which is one of the fungicidal drugs, though terbinafine hydrochloride 1 % cream has higher rates of complete cure at the end of 2 weeks as compared to <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate 2 % cream.

COMPLEX TREATMENT OF VAGINAL DYSBIOSIS IN WOMEN WITH recurrent miscarriage IN ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TREATMENT (ART) O. M. Nosenko, K. P. Golovatyuk Odessa National Medical University, Ukraine info@gameta. od. ua Abstract The article presents literature data on modern approaches to diagnosis and {{treatment of}} vaginal dysbiosis caused by fungi of the genus Candida and personal data on the effectiveness of vaginal dysbiosis treatment in women with recurrent miscarriage occurring in ART cycles by combined local therapy with <b>sertaconazole</b> and povidone-iodine. 240 patients of reproductive age with habitual miscarriage of pregnancy after ART and 30 conditionally healthy fertile women were examined. The state of vaginal microbiota was studied using PCR and culture. It were carried out a species identification of the fungi of the genus Candida and their susceptibility to antimycotics. It has been established that among women with a recurrent miscarriage after cycles of ART that repeatedly receive antibacterial therapy in preparation in the ART cycles and after abortion, in the vaginal microbiota Vaginal dysbiosis was observed in 54. 58 % of the cases, in which increased colonization by bacterial-fungal associates was noted in 67. 18 % of individuals. The authors prove that <b>Sertaconazole</b> in combination with povidone iodine is a highly effective regimen of vaginal microbiota normalization in patients with ART with a recurrent miscarriage, even in individuals with the development of cross-resistance to antimycotic therapy. Key words: vaginal dysbiosis, candidiasis, ART, miscarriage, <b>sertaconazole,</b> povidone-iodine...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{designed}} to develop suitable transdermal matrix patch of <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate, which is of the imidazole class used for antifungal medication, using Ethyl cellulose (EC), Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVPK- 30) and Dibutyl phthalate. The aqueous insolubility of the drug inspires for the formulation of controlled release transdermal patches. Different batches developed using Ethyl cellulose and Polyvinyl pyrrolidone in different ratios by solvent evaporation technique. Drug excipient interaction study was further carried out using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic technique. Physical evaluation performed such as moisture content, moisture uptake, thickness and folding endurance. In vitro diffusion studies were performed using cellulose nitrate membrane (pore size 0. 45 μ) in modified Franz’s diffusion cells in buffer of pH 7. 4. Permeation studies illustrated that the ratio of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and ethyl cellulose 1 : 5 shows good controlled release. Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas models were used for optimizing the formulation...|$|E
40|$|Adherence to {{treatment}} {{is an important}} issue in all areas of clinical medicine, including dermatology. Consequences of poor compliance include reduced treatment benefits, biased assessments of treatment efficacy, increased healthcare costs, and in some cases even death. To date, even the most effective interventions in patients' habits have not led to large improvements in either adherence or treatment outcome. New objective electronic measures permit unbiased reporting of actual adherence to therapy regimens and have revealed that nonadherence is more pervasive than had been suspected, usually occurring when patients omit or delay a dose. In dermatology, adherence to therapy for dermatomycosis is known to decrease with the duration of treatment and the number of applications required each day, particularly once symptoms have disappeared. Simpler dosing regimens are sought for the treatment of cutaneous fungal infections. <b>Sertaconazole,</b> an imidazole antifungal, has pharmacokinetics that are considered favorable for once-daily antimycotic therapy. It is hypothesized that its prolonged dermal retention may translate into the need for less frequent application for successful treatment in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSimple, rapid, cost-effective, {{sensitive}} and extractive spectrophotometric methods were {{developed for the}} determination of two antifungal drugs (i. e., <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate (SER) and miconazole nitrate (MCO)) in pure and dosage forms. The methods {{are based on the}} formation of ion-pair complexes between the drugs and acid dyes (i. e., bromocresol purple (BCP), bromophenol blue (BPB) and methyl orange (MO)) in acidic buffer solutions. The formed complexes were extracted with chloroform and measured at 410, 416 and 427 nm for SER and at 408, 415 and 426 nm for MCO using BCP, BPB and MO, respectively. The analytical parameters and their effects on the reported systems were investigated. Beer's law was obeyed in the 1. 0 – 20 and 1. 0 – 24 μgmL− 1 ranges for SER and MCO, respectively. The composition of the ion pairs was determined to be 1 : 1. The molar absorptivity, Sandell sensitivity, limits of detection and limits of quantification were calculated. Other method validation parameters, such as precision, accuracy, robustness, ruggedness and selectivity, were satisfactory. The proposed methods have been successfully applied for the analysis of the studied drugs in their pure and dosage forms. Statistical comparison of the results with the reference methods indicated excellent agreement and no significant difference in accuracy and precision...|$|E
40|$|Effective topical therapy of {{cutaneous}} fungal diseases {{requires the}} delivery of the active agent to the target site in adequate concentrations to produce a pharmacological effect and inhibit {{the growth of the}} pathogen. In addition, it is important to determine the concentration of the drug in the skin in order to evaluate the subsequent efficacy and potential toxicity for topical formulations. For this purpose, an anhydrous gel containing <b>sertaconazole</b> nitrate as a model drug was formulated and the amount of the drug in the skin was determined by in vitro tape stripping. The apparent diffusivity and partition coefficients were then calculated by a mathematical model describing the dermal absorption as passive diffusion through a pseudo-homogenous membrane. The skin irritation potential of the formulation was also assessed by using the in vitro Epiderm™ model. An estimation of the dermal absorption parameters allowed us to evaluate drug transport across the stratum corneum following topical application. The estimated concentration for the formulation was found to be higher than the MIC 100 at the target site which suggested its potential efficacy for treating fungal infections. The skin irritation test showed the formulation to be non-irritating in nature. Thus, in vitro techniques can be used for laying the groundwork in developing efficient and non-toxic topical products...|$|E
