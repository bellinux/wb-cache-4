5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> job in the future.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki raced in fourNASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) {{races in}} 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was {{considered}} NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers {{who wished to}} <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished in second place at his first career NASCAR race, which {{took place at the}} Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew up. Later that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.|$|E

Early on, she struggled to find sponsorship and ran the season without a sponsor. Robinson qualified 26th fastest and finished 15th at her first Busch Series race, which took place at Orange County Speedway. Later that year, she finished 21st at Motor Mile Speedway, and 18th at the season's second race held at Orange County Speedway.

5|$|McAllister {{made the}} <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Football League by signing for newly {{promoted}} League Two club Exeter City {{in the summer}} of 2008. He debuted in the League Cup first round against Southampton on 12 August 2008, which finished as a 3–1 defeat. His first goal came with the equaliser against Lincoln City on 6 December, which finished as a 2–1 victory, and this was followed up with two goals in a 4–1 win at home to Rochdale on 20 December. McAllister scored twice against Dagenham & Redbridge on 20 January 2009 to give Exeter a 2–1 victory. He finished his first season at Exeter with seven goals from 32 appearances, as they finished second in League Two and therefore won promotion into League One. After only making five appearances for Exeter in 2009–10, McAllister joined Barnet on loan in November 2009. He debuted in a 1–1 draw at home to Bournemouth on 1 December 2009 and completed the loan spell with five appearances. McAllister returned to Exeter in January 2010, but was unable to force his way into the first-team, and signed a one-month emergency loan deal with Rotherham United on 11 March 2010. He made his debut for Rotherham two days later in their 1–0 win away to Dagenham & Redbridge and completed the loan spell with eight appearances. Upon his return to Exeter, McAllister was one of nine players released by the club {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|McAllister {{started his}} career with Eastleigh as a youth player. He moved to Basingstoke Town {{towards the end of}} 2001–02, making his debut in March 2002. McAllister spent three seasons there, making 113 appearances, scoring 66 goals before moving up the {{national}} league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made 10 appearances, having loan spells at Gravesend & Northfleet and Eastleigh in 2004–05. He joined Woking in 2005, spending two full seasons there, and making over 100 appearances. He had a short spell with Grays Athletic, being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United, all during 2007–08. After leaving Oxford in 2008, he took a <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Football League {{for the first time in}} his career, signing for Exeter City. He went on to score seven goals in his first season, but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010. McAllister then dropped back down to non-League football, joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford; his team was defeated 1–0 by Manchester United in their FA Cup fifth round tie. He rejected a new contract from Crawley at the end of the 2010–11, subsequently joining Newport County.|$|E

25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one <b>step,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} board (in {{the case of the}} 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make one step at a time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E

This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E

25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop.

BSA, as the only rifle producer in Britain, had to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mark and the workforce voluntarily went onto a seven-day week. Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men {{in all parts of}} the UK.|$|E
25|$|In early 1967 Porter turned {{professional}}, riding for the Condor Mackeson team. The <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> professional ranks {{meant that}} in the individual pursuit he was now racing 5,000m instead of 4,000m, but in his first test at the distance, he emerged victorious, beating Dave Bonner to win the professional title in Leicester. Porter was then selected to race in the world professional pursuit event in Amsterdam. Porter qualified for the final, but, unsettled by a puncture to his opponent, Tiemen Groen, that forced a re-run, he was beaten by two seconds. Nonetheless, his silver medal led to contracts from track promoters, including an invitation to ride the London six-day race – his first. He crashed on the fourth day, breaking his collar bone, and missed contracts for other six-day races. However, he recovered and {{spent much of the}} winter track-racing in Belgium, finishing the Antwerp six-day before returning to England {{for the start of the}} 1968 road season.|$|E
