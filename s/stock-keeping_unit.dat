50|$|Although {{there is}} some overlap in functionality, {{warehouse}} management systems (WMS) can differ significantly from warehouse control systems (WCS). Simply put, a WMS plans a weekly activity forecast based on such factors as statistics and trends, whereas a WCS acts like a floor supervisor, working in real {{time to get the}} job done by the most effective means. For instance, a WMS can tell the system that it is going to need five of <b>stock-keeping</b> <b>unit</b> (SKU) A and five of SKU B hours in advance, but by the time it acts, other considerations may have come into play or there could be a logjam on a conveyor. A WCS can prevent that problem by working in real time and adapting to the situation by making a last-minute decision based on current activity and operational status. Working synergistically, WMS and WCS can resolve these issues and maximize efficiency for companies that rely on the effective operation of their warehouse or distribution center.|$|E

The units in the interest of their easier handling can be sorted into groups. To classifying SKUs the most frequently used method is the ABC analysis. The traditional approach implements a simplified scheme, which is mostly based on annual dollar usage. Classifying units according to one characteristic can lead to rushed result, because the assignment of <b>stock-keeping</b> <b>units</b> might be influenced by other factors, like number of orders, weight or lead time. In recent years a number of decision models have been developed in order to make it possible to consider more than one criterion in the same time. In general, in the case of representing a model the introduction of the algorithm is more preferable than the visualization of data. However the visualization of results can relieve the comprehension of the given problem and the way, how the model works, even in relation to sorting problems.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the first stage}} of a Dirichlet-based approach to analysing and understanding loyalty and switching behaviour for SKUs. An SKU or <b>Stock-Keeping</b> <b>Unit</b> is what is actually stocked, i. e. the combination of a specific pack-size, flavour, colour, pack-design, quality/price level, model specification, etc and also the identifying brand name. The sales of a brand’s different SKUs make up the brand’s total turnover. Since vast numbers of competitive brands are functionally more or less similar, SKUs are necessarily highly differentiated. This initial study concerns IRI scanner-panel data on Fabric Conditioners in Philadelphia in the US. It has shown that the standard performance measures of different product-variants such as pack-sizes and “forms” broadly follow much the same patterns as do the brands. If this generalises to other products, locations and points in time, the finding is of conceptual as well as practical importance. The emerging knowledge from this study will provide insights into competitive tactics, appropriate size of the SKU repertoire, cannibalisation o...|$|E
40|$|The {{spreading}} {{of fabric}} onto cutting tables in several layers, and the cutting of this fabric {{in the most}} cost-efficient manner to produce a pre-determined number of garments is the apparel manufacturing phase that precedes assembly (sewing) and finishing.

We {{show that there}} are important dependencies between {{the layout of the}} shelf and <b>stock-keeping</b> <b>unit</b> (SKU) sales and marketing effectiveness. The importance of these dependencies is further shown by the substantive profit gains we obtain with our proposed shelf optimization approach. The basis of our model is a standard sales equation that explains sales using item-specific marketing effect parameters and intercepts. In a Hierarchical Bayes (HB) fashion, we augment this model with a second layer that relates the effect parameters to shelf and SKU descriptors. We also take into account potential endogeneity of facings. After estimating the parameters of the two-level model using Bayesian methodology, we carefully investigate the dependencies of SKU sales and SKU marketing effectiveness on the shelf layout. Next, we search for the shelf arrangement that maximizes the expected total profit using simulated annealing (SA). We appear to be able to increase profits for all the stores analyzed, and our approach appears to outperform well-known rules of thumb. shelf management, sales models, Hierarchical Bayes, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, simulated annealing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Retailers {{face the}} problem of finding the {{assortment}} that maximizes category profit. This is a challenging task {{because the number of}} potential assortments is very large when there are many <b>stock-keeping</b> <b>units</b> (SKUs) to choose from. Moreover, SKU sales can be cannibalized by other SKUs in the assortment, and the more similar SKUs are, the more this happens. This paper develops an implementable and scalable assortment optimization method that allows for theory-based substitution patterns and optimizes real-life, large-scale assortments at the store level. We achieve this by adopting an attribute-based approach to capture preferences, substitution patterns, and cross-marketing mix effects. To solve the optimization problem, we propose new very large neighborhood search heuristics. We apply our methodology to store-level scanner data on liquid laundry detergent. The optimal assortments are expected to enhance retailer profit considerably (37. 3...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows that}} due to the {{features}} of SKU (<b>stock-keeping</b> <b>unit)</b> demand data wellknown error measures previously used to analyse the accuracy of adjustments are generally not advisable for the task. In particular, percentage errors are affected by outliers and biases arising from {{a large number of}} low actual demand values and correlation between forecast errors and actual outcomes. It is also shown that MASE is equivalent to the arithmetic average of relative mean absolute errors (MAEs) and inherently is biased towards overrating the benchmark method. Therefore existing measures cannot deliver easily interpretable and unambiguous results. To overcome the imperfections of existing schemes a new measure is introduced which indicates average relative improvement of MAE. In contrast to MASE the proposed scheme is based on finding the geometric average of relative MAEs. This allows objective evaluation of relative change in forecasting accuracy yielded by the use of adjustments. Empirical analysis employed a large number of observations collected from a company specialising on manufacturing of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). The results suggest that adjustments reduced MAE of baseline statistical forecast on average by approximately 10 %. Using a binomial test it was confirmed that adjustments improved the accuracy of forecasts significantly more frequently rather than they reduced it...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} customer behavior {{with regard to}} out-of-stocks (OOS) of perishable products (focused on bakery bread) and the resulting inventory performance for these perishable products. Design/methodology/approach – Insights on how consumers behave when their preferred bread product is OOS are derived based on 3, 800 customer interviews performed in three stores of a large Dutch grocery retail chain. Next to this, additional logistical information was measured on regular moments {{with respect to the}} shelf availability per <b>stock-keeping</b> <b>unit</b> during the day and to waste {{at the end of the}} day. Findings – The customer behavior with regard to perishables is observed to be different from that for the non-perishable items. The key observation is that customers have a high willingness to substitute. The incorporation of the obtained knowledge of the observed consumer buying behavior into the existing automated store ordering (ASO) systems is discussed. In the current ASO systems, no distinction is made between perishable and non-perishable products, as it is primarily designed and used for the non-perishables. The authors show that the current ASO can be enriched and extended by taking into account some extra crucial parameters which are based on the observed consumer behavior. Originality/value – One common factor in the research papers published so far is that they primarily looked into the customer behavior for non-perishable items.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the entry {{probability}} and performance of private labels at an organic food retailer. For a growing sector with unique market structure and category characteristics, it examines how competitive factors affect the attractiveness of a product category for private label entry by an organic food retailer and how the manufacturer brand assortment that the retailer stocks affects private label share. Design/methodology/approach – This study analyses store level cross-category data from an independent organic retailer and field data on retail competition. Findings – The findings show that organic private label stock-keeping units are more likely to be present in categories with supermarket competition. They also show that concentration of shares amongst manufacturer brands (as measured by the Herfindahl index) negatively affect the probability that the retailer will enter a category with a private label <b>stock-keeping</b> <b>unit</b> (SKU) but positively affects the share of that private label SKU. Research limitations/implications – Although the results arise from a fairly small sample of around 30 categories, the focal retailer offers a unique opportunity to examine several private label decisions at the store level. Future work could examine in greater depth the competitive interaction between supermarkets and organic retailers and the effects of such competition on their assortment decisions. Originality/value – By extending private label research beyond the conventional supermarket industry, this study conducts a pioneering test of the effects of competition between retail formats on the likelihood of private label entry. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, the {{environmental}} impact of operating a supply chain of a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company over a one year horizon is considered. The environmental impact is evaluated using the Eco-indicator 99.

For a case study containing 10 <b>Stock-Keeping</b> <b>Units</b> (SKUs), which was optimized with a 1 % optimality tolerance, {{the environmental}} impact could be reduced by 2. 9 % without increasing the total costs. A further reduction of environmental impact of up to 6. 3 % was possible at an increase in total costs of 5. 2 %.
