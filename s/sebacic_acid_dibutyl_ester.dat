40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the ecological consequences and potential mechanisms of specific C compounds on soil microbial processes under climate warming, we injected solutions of two modelled root exudates, 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol (BHT) and 1, 2 -benzenedicarboxylic <b>acid,</b> <b>dibutyl</b> <b>ester</b> (DBP), respectively, into soil at two concentrations (20 and 1000 mu gg(- 1) soil). For all treatments, soils amended with the two phenolic compounds were incubated at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) for 30 days. The responses of soil enzyme activity and microbial property to modelled root exudates to some extent depended on temperature regime, exudation component, and addition concentration. For example, the addition of BHT tended to decrease the soil enzyme activities. However, DBP addition generally increased the two metabolic enzyme activities at 30 degrees C, and tended to decrease the two enzyme activities at 20 degrees C, but a significant reduction was observed only at a high concentration at 20 degrees C. The microbial biomass and enzyme activity were generally lower at 30 degrees C compared to those at 20 degrees C, when averaged across all treatment combinations.

In this method two divalent transition metal cations, zinc(II) and copper(II), were used as binding metal ions, and L-tryptophan (A) {{was used as a}} chiral reference. Multimeric complexes were readily formed by electrospray ionization of a methanol:water (50 : 50) solution containing metal ion, L-tryptophan and T. These multimeric complexes included singly charged protonated dimeric [TAH]+, doubly charged copper(II) bound tetrameric [TACu-H] 22 + and doubly charged zinc(II) bound tetrameric [TAZn-H] 22 +, together with other complexes. The mass-selected complex, i. e., [TAH]+, [TACu-H] 22 + and [TAZn-H] 22 +, was used to acquire the second stage mass spectra. The chiral recognition capability of these three complexes was evaluated using the abundance ratios of daughter ion to parent ion. A high degree of chiral recognition ability was observed in [TACu-H] 22 + and [TAZn-H] 22 +. It was found that the type of binding ion {{played an important role in}} the chiral recognition. Different binding ions exhibited distinctive dissociation pathways and unique chiral recognition characteristics. The present method is based not only on whole-molecule loss but also on fractional-molecule loss. In addition, the reproducibility of the chiral recognition method was confirmed by several determinations of the abundance ratios of daughter ion to parent ion with a fixed activation energy and with five different activation energies. It was also shown that this chiral recognition method can tolerate acid interference...|$|R

30|$|There {{were two}} main {{limitations}} {{in the previous}} decane induction process (by pouring/single bolus addition method) for achieving higher <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid</b> productivity (Fig.  1). First, an adjustment of the feeding rate of methyl decanoate (for decanoic acid adaptation) was required at an early period of methyl decanoate transformation. If this method was not followed, the fermentation would fail because of marked accumulation of decanoic acid and loss of the cell viability (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2). However, this solution was undesirable since it could decrease the <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid</b> productivity. Consecutively, higher feeding rate of methyl decanoate was an interesting proposition for enhancing the production of <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid.</b> Second, the accumulation of intermediates, especially decanoic acid, would pose extra risk for the stable production process because of its toxicity (Fig.  2).

30|$|Biotransformation of {{fatty acid}} methyl esters to dicarboxylic acids has {{attracted}} much attention in recent years; however, reports of <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid</b> production using such biotransformation remain few. The toxicity of decanoic acid is the main challenge for this process. Decane induction {{has been reported to}} be essential to activate the enzymes involved in the α,ω-oxidation pathway before initiating the biotransformation of methyl decanoate to <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid.</b> However, we observed the accumulation of intermediates (decanoic acid and 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid) during the induction period. In this study, we examined the effects of these intermediates on the biotransformation process. The presence of decanoic acid, even at a low concentration (0.2  g/L), inhibited the transformation of 10 -hydroxydecanoic <b>acid</b> to <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid.</b> Moreover, about 24 – 32 % reduction in the decanoic acid oxidation was observed in the presence of 0.5 – 1.5  g/L 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid.

Although the productivity of <b>sebacic</b> <b>acid</b> (34.5 [*]±[*] 1.10  g/L) was improved, by 28 % over that achieved using the previously methods, after 54  h, the accumulation of 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid was still detected. The accumulation of 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid even under the decane limiting conditions could be an evidence that oxidation of 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid could be the rate-limiting step in this process.
