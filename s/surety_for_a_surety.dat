50|$|George Pilkington died in 1597 and {{his eldest}} son, Robert, {{inherited}} an estate and rights in a manor burdened by debt from litigation. Robert Pilkington's efforts to enclose the waste lands at Rivington made matters worse. By 1601 Robert had risked the estate by {{using it as}} <b>surety</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> debt of £250 to William Bispham, of London. Robert defaulted in July 1601, and Rivington and other lands passed William Bisham until the debt was settled.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>surety</b> is {{entitled}} to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is {{not the result of}} any contract, but is derived from a equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each <b>surety</b> is severally bound <b>for</b> <b>a</b> given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor in the case of <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> surety; nor where a person becomes <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of <b>a</b> <b>surety,</b> proof can be made against his estate by <b>a</b> co-surety <b>for</b> any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.|$|R

The Environmental Protection Act of 1994 requires the rehabilitation program to include the proposed amount of the financial <b>surety</b> <b>for</b> larger projects while the Codes of Environmental Compliance require <b>a</b> financial <b>surety</b> <b>for</b> small projects. <b>A</b> single <b>surety</b> {{can be used to}} cover the requirement of both the Mineral Resources Act and the Environmental Protection Act (World Bank Group 2008).|$|R

50|$|Nexum was a {{debt bondage}} {{contract}} {{in the early}} Roman Republic. Within the Roman legal system, it {{was a form of}} mancipatio. Though the terms of the contract would vary, essentially a free man pledged himself as a bond slave (nexus) as <b>surety</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> loan. He might also hand over his son as collateral. Although the bondsman could expect to face humiliation and some abuse, as a legal citizen {{he was supposed to be}} exempt from corporal punishment. Nexum was abolished by the Lex Poetelia Papiria in 326 BC, in part to prevent abuses to the physical integrity of citizens who had fallen into debt bondage.|$|R

50|$|Adam Martindale (1623-1686), fourth son of Henry Martindale, {{was born}} at High Heyes, in the parish of Prescot, Lancashire, about 15 September 1623. His father, {{originally}} a substantial yeoman and builder, was reduced in circumstances by becoming <b>surety</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> friend. Martindale was educated (1630-7) at the grammar schools of St. Helens and Rainford, was put <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time to his father's business, and then sent back to school (1638-9) in preparation for Oxford. The troubles of the times hindered his going to the university; he became tutor in the family of Francis Shevington at Eccles, and 'would almost as soone have led beares.' Returning home at Christmas 1641, he found his father's business 'quite dead,' owing to the general sense of insecurity. Apprehensive of a summons to 'generall musters,' he obtained employment as schoolmaster at Upholland, and later at Rainford.|$|R
40|$|Periodically {{one needs}} to re-examine the {{objectives}} and the efforts associated with a field of study. In the case of surety which comprises, safety, security and reliability {{one needs to}} be sure that theoretical efforts support the needs of systems and design engineers in satisfying stakeholder requirements. The current focus in the surety areas does not appear to address the theoretical foundations needed by the systems engineer. Examination of papers and abstracts demonstrate significant effort along the lines of thermal hydraulics, chemistry, structural response, control theory, etc. which are analytical disciplines which provide support <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> theoretic but do not constitute a theoretic. The representations currently employed, fault trees etc., define static representations of a system, not the dynamic representation characteristic of response in abnormal, hostile or under degrading conditions. Current methodologies would require a semi-infinite set of scenarios to be examined before a system could be certified as satisfying <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> requirement. The elements that are required of <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> theoretic must include: (1) a dynamic representation of the system; (2) the ability to automatically identify terminal states of the system; and (3) determine the probabilities of specified terminal states under dynamic conditions. This paper examines the requirements of <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> theoretic that will support the efforts of the design and development engineer. Speculations then follow on technologies that might provide the theoretical and support foundations needed by the systems engineering community to form <b>a</b> robust <b>surety</b> analysis and design environment...|$|R
50|$|In June 2005, Trudeau focused {{attention}} on what he said were the implications for civil liberties in the Canadian government's use of security certificates to detain indefinitely, without trial, suspected terrorists based on secret evidence. Trudeau offered to be <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> <b>for</b> Hassan Almrei, <b>a</b> Syrian refugee held in <b>a</b> Canadian jail <b>for</b> four years without any charges being laid. His appearance in court in support of Almrei resulted in front page coverage in the Toronto Star and National Post and major media attention being given to the security certificate issue for the first time. Trudeau's efforts were chronicled in his documentary Secure Freedom. Almrei was ordered released under house arrest by a Federal Court judge on January 2, 2009.
