40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether reduction mammaplasty is a motivator for postoperative weight loss and to understand how this affected specific quality of life parameters. Material and Methods: All patients who underwent a reduction mammaplasty by the senior author at our department between April 2011 and January 2014 were contacted and invited to participate in a standardized telephonic questionnaire. The outcome questionnaire included data on whether the patients felt that the reduction mammaplasty was a motivator for weight loss and specific information regarding their pre- and postoperative weight and dress size. Additional data points queried included quality of life changes, exercise capacity, satisfaction, symptomatic relief (neck and back pain, intertrigo, <b>shoulder</b> <b>grooving),</b> and whether they would undergo the procedure again. Results: Forty-five women participated in the questionnaire. A total of 66. 7...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionWith {{the rise}} in {{childhood}} obesity, {{an increase in the}} number of patients seeking adolescent breast reduction has been appreciated. This study examines our experience with presenting symptoms, techniques, and both surgical and pathologic outcomes for reduction mammaplasty in the adolescent population. MethodsMedical records of 76 consecutive patients under 18 years of age who underwent reduction mammaplasty over a 10 year period were identified and reviewed for BMI, symptoms, comorbidities, cancer history, surgical technique, resection weight, pathologic findings, and complications. Pathology costs were determined from billing records. ResultsOperative indications included neck, back, and/or shoulder pain (75 %), intertrigo (8 %), <b>shoulder</b> <b>grooving</b> (17 %), difficulty finding bras (8 %) and participating in sports (9 %), and social distress (24 %). Average BMI was 31  kg/m 2 and 65 % of children were obese (BMI >  30). Surgical techniques included Wise pattern (93 %) and superior pedicle (7 %). Complications occurred in 8 patients (10. 5 %). Pathologic examination yielded no cancers with 80 % normal or mildly fibrotic and 20 % benign histology. Per breast reduction specimen, pathology internal costs and external costs by Medicare data averaged $ 65 and $ 118, respectively. ConclusionsAdolescent mammaplasty patients present symptoms mirroring those of the adult population but also exhibit greater obesity, physical strain, social distress, and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Literature reports similar complication rates for adults as we found in our adolescent population. We recommend that surgeons strongly consider reduction mammaplasty in the carefully selected adolescent with macromastia, with realistic expectations and complications in this burgeoning group. Routine pathologic examination, however, is not a cost effective goal...|$|R
40|$|A new {{low-speed}} drag reduction {{approach is}} proposed which employs longitudinal surface V-shaped grooves {{cutting through the}} afterbody shoulder region. The test Reynolds number range was from 20, 000 to 200, 000 based on undisturbed free-stream flow and a body diameter of 6. 08 cm. The V-grooves are shown {{to be most effective}} in reducing drag when the afterbody shoulder radius is zero. Reductions in drag of up to 33 % have been measured for this condition. For large <b>shoulder</b> radius, the <b>grooves</b> are only effective at the lower Reynolds numbers of the test...|$|R
40|$|Examination {{revealed}} that misalignment {{in the assembly}} of the bearing resulted in the failure. Evidences suggest that {{the distance between the}} bearing housing and the flange of the shaft was smaller than that of the permissible limit. This has resulted in sliding of the balls on one of the <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>groove</b> of the inner and outer races. Because of this, there was severe stressing of the cage material leading to fracturing of the cage. Once this failure occurred, the balls and the outer race came out of the bearing assembly. No material abnormalities in the bearing assembly were responsible for the failur...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>shoulder</b> radiusing and <b>grooving</b> (longitudinally and circumferentially) the afterbodies of bluff bodies {{to reduce the}} base drag at low speeds is {{investigated}} experimentally. Shoulder radii as large as 2. 75 body diameters are examined. Reynolds number (ReD) based on body diameter varied from 20, 000 to 200, 000. Results indicate that increasing the shoulder radius to 2. 00 body diameters can reduce the drag levels to those of a streamline body having 67 percent greater fineness ratio. For the relatively sharp shoulder case, body drag reductions as large as 50 and 33 percent are obtained using circumferential or longitudinal grooves, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} scroll shoulder tool {{is widely}} used particularly for thick section friction stir welding (FSW). However, the correlation between its shoulder flow zone weld quality and material flow quantity remains unclear. This information is important for tool design. In the present study, a scroll shoulder tool was used to FSW 20 mm thick 6061 aluminum (Al) plates at a range of welding parameters. The pick-up material (PUM) by the scroll was quantified, {{and the effect of}} welding parameters and PUM on the shoulder flow zone formation and weld quality was studied. It was found that there is a positive linear relationship between the PUM and weld quality. In order to obtain a defect-free FSW weld produced by the scroll <b>shoulder</b> tool, scroll <b>groove</b> needs to be fully filled by PUM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 6061 and {{low carbon}} steel sheets, SPCC, whose {{thicknesses}} were 2 mm, were welded by a friction stir spot welding (FSSW) technique using a scrolled <b>groove</b> <b>shoulder</b> tool without a probe (scroll tool). Tensile-shear fatigue tests were performed using lap-shear specimens at a stress ratio R= 0. 1 in order to figure out fatigue behaviour of dissimilar welds. The tensile-shear strength of the dissimilar welds was {{higher than that of}} the A 6061 similar ones. Furthermore, the dissimilar welds exhibited nearly the same fatigue strengths as the A 6061 similar ones, indicating that FSSW by a scroll tool was effective technique for joining aluminium to steel sheet. The fatigue fracture modes of the dissimilar welds were dependent on load levels, where shear fracture through the interface between A 6061 and steel occurred at high load levels, while a fatigue crack grew through A 6061 sheet at low load levels...|$|R
