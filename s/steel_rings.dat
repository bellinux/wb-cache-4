5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures {{that keep the}} sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>rings,</b> were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{mounting}} system {{arose in the}} early seventies, when touring ballets {{came into contact with}} synthetic rope used by the military. Initially, the synthetic rope was used to replace the twisted cowhide strips. However, the rope could now be tightened {{to the point where it}} tore through the skin; in response, drum makers started using <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> instead of twisted cowhide to hold the skin in place. Despite objections from many djembefolas, the modern {{mounting system}} gradually displaced the traditional one and, by 1991 had completely replaced it.|$|E
25|$|Musashi {{challenged}} Yoshioka Seijūrō, {{master of}} the Yoshioka School, to a duel. Seijūrō accepted, and they agreed to a duel outside Rendaiji in Rakuhoku, {{in the northern part}} of Kyoto on 8 March 1604. Musashi arrived late, greatly irritating Seijūrō. They faced off, and Musashi struck a single blow, per their agreement. This blow struck Seijūrō on the left shoulder, knocking him out, and crippling his left arm. He apparently passed on the headship of the school to his equally accomplished brother, Yoshioka Denshichirō, who promptly challenged Musashi for revenge. The duel took place in Kyoto outside a temple, Sanjūsangen-dō. Denshichirō wielded a staff reinforced with <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> (or possibly with a ball-and-chain attached), while Musashi arrived late a second time. Musashi disarmed Denshichirō and defeated him. This second victory outraged the Yoshioka family, whose head was now the 12-year-old Yoshioka Matashichiro. They assembled a force of archers, musketeers and swordsmen, and challenged Musashi to a duel outside Kyoto, near Ichijō-ji Temple. Musashi broke his previous habit of arriving late, and came to the temple hours early. Hidden, Musashi assaulted the force, killing Matashichiro, and escaping while being attacked by dozens of his victim's supporters. To escape and fight off his opponents he was forced to draw his second sword and defend himself with a sword in each hand. This was the beginning of his niten'ichi sword style. With the death of Matashichiro, this branch of the Yoshioka School was destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Deformability of {{concrete}} decreases as its strength increases. The higher the concrete strength, the lower it’s failure strain which shows increase of brittleness. One {{way to improve}} the ductility and carrying capacity {{of concrete}} is by doing confinement of the concrete. A <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> external confinement {{was used in this}} study. The <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> is made of a steel cylindrical tube that is cut with a specific width (a) so similar to the <b>ring.</b> The <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> is placed at a specific distance between the ring (b). With ring width variation (a = 28, 45 and 73 mm) and the distance between the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> is constant (b = 40 mm), gave the variation of the volumetric ratio which will e afffect the confinement on the concrete. The test results showed that the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> was effective as external confinement in of the concrete. The capability of concrete to support load increases in line with the width of the ring. Increased carrying capacity of concrete for 28, 45 and 73 mm ring width is respectively 115. 382 %, 131. 792 %, 150. 253 % and the maximum strain of concrete increases to 389. 474 %, 368. 421 % and 366. 667 %, respectively...|$|R

The {{pattern design}} of {{brassieres}} {{is the core}} technology for the design and manufacture of brassieres, while the female breast shape and part dimensions are the foundations for pattern design of brassieres. Based upon 3 D body scanning, this paper studied {{the relationship between the}} breast root shape and the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> by considering the features of the pattern design of the brassiere. It concludes that the breast root girth is a complicated three-dimensional curve; it’s inappropriate for the neighboring size’s brassieres to adopt the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> with the same specification; the material design of the <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> should be moderate. The purpose is to provide human body basis for pattern design of brassieres and achieve more standard and scientific pattern design of the brassiere by the underwear enterprises...|$|R

2500|$|The area {{along the}} wall of the {{building}} from the eastern side has a narrow corridor flanked by [...] "lockers" [...] (small rooms with racks). The corridor wall is vertical beaded board, the floors are patched concrete and the outer wall is concrete. The building appears to have been built in two stages, the eastern section has timber trusses and timber frames to the tethering area and looks older than the western end which has steel trusses and partition frames. The tethering area consists of low walls running parallel {{along the length of the}} building, equipped with <b>steel</b> <b>rings</b> for tethering animals and hay racks for them above. When the place is occupied, rails are erected to separate each bay and sawdust and sand bedding is put down. Around most of the perimeter of the building are very basic sleeping quarters for people showing their animals at Ekka. There are a few animal pens under the women's sleeping quarters in the western section. These are for cows in calf or with new calves. In the northwest corner of the building is a room for preparing food used by those sleeping in the building. The building has a later brick extension.|$|E

50|$|A {{cylindrical}} {{driving piston}} is mounted within a cylindrical channel that is closed at its far end. This piston presses against a hard <b>steel</b> <b>ring,</b> {{followed by a}} softer <b>steel</b> <b>ring,</b> and then a ring of more viscous or elastic material such as rubber, copper or soap stone, all within the channel. These three intermediate stages provide an inner cylinder, and the third stage bears on a specially shaped final steel piston that applies the force to pressurise material held {{at the end of}} the outer, enclosing channel. The final piston consists of a wider portion that fills the main channel, and a narrower cylindrical extension that leads back through the inner channel formed by the three ring-shaped intermediate stages, ending within the hard <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> without making direct contact with the driving piston. This arrangement ensures that higher pressures create tighter seals that resist any leakage from the material at the end, since the pressure within the last and softest ring is greater than that in the material at the end.|$|R

The experimental results demonstrate that the ULC and stiffness of steel I-beams significantly decrease with making a hole in web. Accordant of experimental work, it can be noted that behavior of steel I-beam with stiffening opening web using <b>steel</b> <b>ring</b> is satisfactory agreement with behavior of steel I-beam with solid web (before cutting hole). To simulate the experimental cases, the nonlinear finite element model (NFEM) using ANSYS ver. 11 software was adopted in this study.
