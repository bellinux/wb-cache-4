In 1947, when the children {{were old enough to}} attend boarding school, the couple returned to Singapore, both working at Raffles College. In 1952, the couple moved to Ibadan, Nigeria, both accepting posts at University College Ibadan. Norman became the Chair of Physics, whilst Elizabeth took on the role of Lecturer in Soil Sciences. She worked in Agronomy, <b>soil</b> <b>science,</b> and administration. The university opened a department of geology in 1958 and appointed Dr. Elizabeth Alexander Senior Lecturer and Head of Department. Just three weeks into her new role, Alexander suffered a stroke and she died a week later on 15 October 1958 at the age of 49.|$|E
