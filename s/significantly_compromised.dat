25|$|Historically {{the marsh}} {{supported}} an extremely diverse wetlands ecosystem, {{with a variety}} of primary productivity plants including pickleweed, eelgrass and giant bulrush (Scirpus californiens). There has also been historically significant fish, mammal, amphibian and avafauna. The marsh is a significant element within the Pacific Flyway providing resting and feeding areas for migratory birds. As of 2006 this ecosystem has been <b>significantly</b> <b>compromised</b> by fill, levee formation, dredging and other development; estimates generally state that 75 percent of the original biological productivity of the marsh has been destroyed. However, it remains a significant habitat and is subject to meaningful wetland restoration activity, that is being actively evaluated as of the 2000-2006 timeframe.|$|E
25|$|The mineral {{industry}} in Peru has exerted several adverse {{impacts on the}} environment, including reduced {{quality and quantity of}} water supplies and changes in habitat for plants and animals. According to an article in the Journal of Latin American Geography, these effects have <b>significantly</b> <b>compromised</b> the livelihoods of rural populations living in nearby communities. Mining corporations often draw water from nearby streams, canals, aquifers, and lakes, thereby reducing the quantity of water available for subsistence agriculture, farming, and personal consumption. Runoff from mining operations often contaminates local water supplies with substances such as copper, iron, zinc, manganese, mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, cyanide, and selenium, further threatening rural populations' main sources of sustenance. Beyond modifying water supplies, the {{mineral industry}} in Peru has also compromised natural habitat. Mining operations often produce substantial soil erosion, thus degrading the grazing lands that local populations rely on for herding and livestock activities. In addition, mining activities require considerable physical space for infrastructure, road construction, drilling, and other operations. This reduces the quantity of land available for the pastoral activities of rural communities.|$|E
2500|$|By 15 August, {{more than}} 3,000 arrests {{had been made}} across England, with more than 1,000 people issued with {{criminal}} charges for various offences related to the riots.

30|$|A {{growing number}} of {{clinical}} and experimental studies unambiguously show that pleural effusion (PLE) not only causes respiratory derangement but also may <b>significantly</b> <b>compromise</b> circulation [1 – 5]. PLE impairs circulation by decreasing left ventricular (LV) preload resulting in hypotension, low cardiac output (CO) and, in the worst cases, shock [6 – 8].|$|R
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} the {{definition}} of SPD is flawed due to cultural bias {{and that it does}} not constitute a mental disorder but simply an avoidant attachment style requiring more distant emotional proximity. If that is true, then many of the more problematic reactions these individuals show in social situations may be partly accounted for by the judgments commonly imposed on people with this style. However, {{it is important to note}} that impairment is mandatory for any behaviour to be diagnosed as a personality disorder. SPD seems to satisfy this criterion because it is linked to negative outcomes. These include a <b>significantly</b> <b>compromised</b> quality of life, smaller GAF scores even after 15 years and one of the lowest levels of [...] "life success" [...] of all personality disorders (measured as [...] "status, wealth and successful relationships").|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cases of}} vaginal {{hypoplasia}} associated with CAIS can be corrected using non-surgical pressure [...] methods. [...] The elastic nature of vaginal tissue, {{as demonstrated by}} its ability to accommodate the differences in size between a tampon, a penis, and a baby's head, make dilation possible even in cases when the vaginal depth is <b>significantly</b> <b>compromised.</b> [...] Treatment compliance {{is thought to be}} critical to achieve satisfactory results. [...] Dilation can also be achieved via the Vecchietti procedure, which stretches vaginal tissues into a functional vagina using a traction device that is anchored to the abdominal wall, subperitoneal sutures, and a mold that is placed against the vaginal dimple. [...] Vaginal stretching occurs by increasing the tension on the sutures, which is performed daily. [...] The non-operative pressure dilation method is currently recommended as the first choice, since it is non-invasive, and highly successful. [...] Vaginal dilation should not be performed before puberty.|$|E

30|$|Here, {{we build}} on a {{previous}} model of memory sequences [7], which enhances memory capacity by instantaneous feedback inhibition. Both our mean field analysis and our simulations show that, in this model, inhomogeneity in pattern sizes reduces memory capacity, but it does so in an asymmetric way: whereas too small patterns <b>significantly</b> <b>compromise</b> the stability of sequence recall, too large patterns can be compensated for quite robustly.|$|R

The random errors do not <b>significantly</b> <b>compromise</b> the {{validity}} of this work, since four landmarks are needed to obtain these angles {{and some of these}} landmarks are subjective [32 – 34]. Therefore, a few random errors of greater magnitude were expected. Similar studies do not mention the random error magnitude [16, 24]. Therefore, probably, they would be similar for the mentioned reasons.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new tensile optical-surface (TOS) process to produce optically flat micromirrors capable of scanning at high frequencies. A polysilicon membrane is stretched across a stiff, single-crystal silicon-rib structure. This structure increases the stiffness of the mirror without significantly increasing its mass. The low mass makes possible high operating frequencies without deformation that could <b>significantly</b> <b>compromise</b> the optical performance of the mirror. Electrostatic combdrives, made of thick single-crystal silicon, provide large forces that enable mirror operation at tens of kHz...|$|R

We show that the configuration with sapphire end test masses offers the opportunity for thermal tuning on a time scale comparable to the ring up time of oscillatory instabilities. This approach may enable significant reduction of parametric gain. ...|$|R

50|$|To {{the extent}} that Rule 49(3) of the Standing Rules of Parliament {{excluded}} matters of privilege from {{the jurisdiction of the}} disciplinary committee of Parliament, it was incumbent on the National Assembly to create a disciplinary mechanism which was consonant with the Constitution.

Here, we present an 82 -year-old man with iatrogenic perforation of adenocarcinoma of the GE junction. Immediate surgical intervention included palliative resection and GE reconstruction. In the case of iatrogenic tumor perforation, the primary goal should be adequate palliative (and not oncological) therapy.
