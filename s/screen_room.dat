50|$|The theater {{first began}} {{operation}} in 1920 {{as a local}} moviehouse. It added a second <b>screen</b> <b>room</b> in 1979.

5000|$|Her work {{features}} several repeating motifs. Among {{them are}} {{a girl who}} is twenty-three with red hair, a dark-haired lawyer or aspiring politician for a hero, a secondary character predisposed toward speaking in quotations, a fan back chair, a Mandarin coat, a Chinese lacquer <b>screen</b> (<b>room</b> divider), New England as a setting or character trait (“New England granite”), and a black-and-white spotted dog. She also favored the surname [...] "Shaw", which was the maiden name of Herman Melville's wife, who {{was the daughter of}} noted Massachusetts jurist Lemuel Shaw. The middle name of both her sons is Melville. Given what is known of her life, such as her connections to New England, the name [...] "Shaw", and a predilection toward lawyers, it is possible that these recurring details are somewhat autobiographical.|$|E

50|$|Shooting {{then moved}} to Paraty, Rio de Janeiro where the honeymoon scenes were shot. According to Paraty's Tourism Office, filming {{took place in the}} Taquari area, near an {{unidentified}} waterfall and at Mamangua Bay where a mansion is located. It rained on every day of shooting. In late November, shooting moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana where most of the indoor scenes were shot on a sound stage and in a house. Stewart had to wear heavy make-up to look thin and ghastly to show Bella through a phase of pregnancy where the baby starts breaking her bones. The birth scene took two nights to shoot after the cast had a long conversation with Meyer, a midwife and a doctor to discuss the mechanics of the scene, particularly to decide the area where Edward should place his mouth to bite into Bella's placenta if this situation could ever occur in real life. An animatronic baby was used to film a few scenes of newborn Rensemee. The cast and crew spent two months of the filming process shooting in a green <b>screen</b> <b>room</b> on fake snow. Reportedly, a few scenes were also shot in Arsenal Park using green screens.|$|E
