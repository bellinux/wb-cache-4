40|$|We {{present a}} quasi-monotone semi-Lagrangian {{particle}} level set (QMSL-PLS) method for moving interfaces. The QMSL method is {{a blend of}} first order monotone and second order semi-Lagrangian methods. The QMSL-PLS method is easy to implement, efficient, and well adapted for unstructured, either simplicial or hexahedral, meshes. We prove that it is unconditionally stable in the maximum discrete norm, � · �h,∞, and the error analysis shows that when the level set solution u(t) is in the Sobolev space Wr+ 1,∞(D), r ≥ 0, the convergence in the maximum norm is of the form (KT/Δt) min(1,Δt � v �h,∞ /h) ((1 − α) hp + hq), p = min(2, r + 1), and q = min(3, r + 1),where v is a velocity. This means that at high CFL numbers, that is, when Δt > h, the error is O((1 −α) hp+hq) Δt), whereas at CFL numbers less than 1, the error is O((1 − α) hp− 1 + hq− 1)).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical method for free surface flows that couples the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations {{with the level}} set method in the finite element framework. The implicit characteristic-Galerkin approximation together with the fractional four-step algorithm is employed to discretize the governing equations. The schemes for solving the level set evolution and reinitialization equations are verified with several benchmark cases, including stationary circle, rotation of a <b>slotted</b> <b>disk</b> and stretching of a circular fluid element. The results are compared with those calculated from the level set finite volume method of Yue et al. (Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids 2003; 42 : 853 - 884), which employed the third-order essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes for advection of the level set function in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system. The comparison indicates that the characteristic Galerkin approximation of the level set equations yields more accurate solutions. The second-order accuracy of the Navier-Stokes solver is confirmed by simulation of decay vortex. The coupled system of the Navier-Stokes and level set equations then is validated by solitary wave and broken dam problems. The simulation results are in excellent agreement with experimental data.

30|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{has been}} a serious problem while drilling {{that may lead to}} heavy financial costs in the form of lost rig time and lost mud fluid. In severe cases, it can lead to well blowout with serious environmental hazards and safety consequences. Despite extensive advances {{in the last couple of}} decades, lost circulation materials used today still have disadvantages such as damaging production zones, failing to seal large fractures or plugging drilling tools. Here, we propose a new class of smart expandable lost circulation material (LCM) to remotely control the expanding force and functionality of the injected LCM. Our smart LCM is made out of shape memory polymers that become activated by formation’s natural heat. Once activated, these particles can effectively seal fractures’ width without damaging pores in the production zone or plugging drilling tools. The activation temperature of the proposed LCM can be adjusted based on the formation’s temperature. We conducted a series of experiments to measure the sealing efficiency of these smart LCMs as a proof of concept study. Various <b>slot</b> <b>disk</b> sizes were used to mimic different size fractures in the formation. The API RP 13 B- 1 and 13 B- 2 have been followed as standard testing methods to evaluate this product.|$|R
40|$|What {{follows is}} {{an account of}} the design and {{development}} of a calibration device for determining the temporal resolution of a tomographic imaging device. Current practice for characterizing the dynamic response of a tomographic imaging device, such as a Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine, uses image acquisition time as a surrogate for temporal resolution. At present, no standard method for characterizing the temporal resolution of a tomographic imaging device exists. Analogous to the spatial modulation transfer function used for characterizing spatial resolution, the concept of temporal Modulation Transfer Function (t-MTF) can be used to enable characterization of temporal resolution. A scanner's t-MTF represents the percent amplitude modulation in the image {{as a function of the}} input frequency. The calibration device uses <b>slotted</b> <b>disks</b> mounted to planetary gear sets' rotating ring gears. The sun gears are driven by a common shaft, thus allowing for about two decades of input frequencies to be obtained using a single motor and driveshaft. Preliminary results show a monotonic decline in the temporal modulation transfer as the input signal frequency is increased. As was hypothesized, there is more modulation at lower frequency and less modulation at higher frequency. Analogous to the definition of spatial resolution, one can define the frequency for which there is 10 % temporal modulation transfer as the temporal resolution of a scanner. by Alexander Henry Slocum, Jr. Thesis (S.

40|$|The Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) {{has become}} a widely used method to measure trace gases in the atmosphere. DOAS-systems {{normally}} employ <b>slotted</b> <b>disk</b> arrangements, where a narrow slit scans the spectrum produced by a spectrometer. With photodiode array detectors (PDA) {{it is possible to}} record all wavelength in the observed interval simultaneously. But unfortunately these detectors show much higher residual structures. It was the aim of this project to eliminate these structures and thus make this kind of detectors useable for the measurement of atmospheric trace gases. It could be showned that the angular dependence of the PDA response is responsible for the higher residual structure. With the development of a quartz fiber mode mixer it was possible to eliminate the residual structure. Furthermore the possibility of the use of CCD-cameras have been tested in field and laboratory-measurements. A new algorithm for the analysis of atmospheric absorption spectra was developed. The algorithm corrects differences in the wavelength-pixel mapping of the spectra, caused by temperature changes of the spectrometer. It also estimates the errors of the concentrations considers the uncertainty of this correction and the influence of random residual structures. Thus it allows (1) much more sensitive measurements and (2) a realistic calculation of the error of these measurements. (orig.)

40|$|The distortion, {{drag and}} {{break-up}} of drizzle droplets subjected to strong aerodynamic forces was investigated {{to understand the}} pre-impact behaviour of droplets in aircraft icing from supercooled freezing drizzle. The objective was to obtain a formulation and data for the drag properties of droplets distorted by the aerodynamic forces, which were {{beyond the scope of}} available experimental and modelling methods. A practical and efficient semi-empirical computer model was developed for small water droplets in air, 100 µm < D < 500 µm, at moderate Reynolds numbers, 350 < Re < 1500, and high Weber numbers 3 < We < 20. This used available experimental terminal velocity data for free-falling droplets, extrapolated to higher Weber numbers, and the numerical solution for sessile droplets on a horizontal unwettable surface, with corrections for the Reynolds number. A theory for bag break-up was developed based on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the windward droplet surface. The critical Bond number was 13. 7, with a critical diameter of 10. 1 mm for free-falling water droplets, compared to the experimental value of 10 mm diameter. The equivalent Weber number was 14. 2 for free falling water droplets. Aerodynamic interaction between the closely-spaced droplets from a vibrating nozzle droplet generator resulted in irregular spacing and coalescence of droplets. In an alternative design a laminar jet impinged on a rotating <b>slotted</b> <b>disk</b> to achieve the necessary droplet spacing, but the significant size variability of the droplets degraded the experimental measurements. High-speed videos, to 50, 000 pps, and photographs were obtained of droplet distortion, break-up, coalescence and splashes using a high-intensity LED strobe flash. A specially-designed convergent wind tunnel was developed for experimental measurements, to validated the drag model and provide data for droplets distorted by aerodynamic forces. The convergent profile produced a rapidly-increasing Weber number at a sufficiently slow rate to avoid transients or droplet vibrations. A special instrument was developed, with three equispaced parallel laser beams and photo detectors, to determine the droplet velocity and acceleration. Droplet drag characteristics were measured up to Weber numbers of 16. Good agreement was obtained between droplet drag model and experimental results.
