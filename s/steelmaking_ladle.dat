Two kinds of slags with 9. 02 and 4. 14 CaO/SiO 2 ratios were studied for slag resistance by means of crucible tests.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} {{well known that}} a <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle</b> operation {{plays an important role}} in the production of clean steel. A turbulent mixing of melt with Ar gas bubbling from the ladle bottom can homogenize a melt temperature and can control precisely chemical compositions of steel. In order to figure out these phenomena, a quantitative analysis of fluid flow behavior of gas and melt during a ladle operation is required and special concerns should be focused on effects of operating parameters on the perfect mixing time of melt. In this study, as a basic approach, effects of operating parameters such as a melt depth (aspect ratio) and a nozzle type (one-hole or porous plug) on the mixing behavior in ladle operation are investigated. Water model experiments are carried out to simulate these melt behaviors in <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle.</b> As a result, it was found that there exist an optimized melt depth and a nozzle type at a given gas flow rate, which affect significantly on the mixing behavior of melt...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} {{the high cost of}} bauxite, Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C {{refractory}} bricks (AMC) are widely used for steelmaking vessel working linings due to their excellent properties: high temperature mechanical strength and high resistances to both thermal spalling and slag corrosion. In part, these properties stem from the thermal evolution of the phases and the microstructure of AMC refractories, such as the transformation of the aluminum metal (usually added as antioxidant) in Al 4 C 3 and the formation of spinel (MgAl 2 O 4). In this work, the thermal evolution of the phases of three different AMC commercial bricks used in sidewalls and bottom of <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladles</b> between 400 and 1400 ¡C in air was studied. The variation of the mineralogical composition was analyzed using X-ray diffraction and the differences found between the materials were related to their compositional and microstructural differences.

Physical and/or mathematical models {{can be used in}} order to achieve optimum conditions for the clean steel during steelmaking processes. In the present study, important metallurgical transport phenomena in <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladles</b> and tundishes have been investigated using both mathematical and physical (water) models. Through appropriate solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, the intermixing of fluid within gas-stirred ladles can be modelled quite satisfactorily. It is shown that off-centered bubbling gives the most consistent results in terms of minimising mixing times, since angular velocity components intermix fluid across the width of a ladle. Comparisons between mathematical and experimental data are presented. Fluid flow, heat transfer and inclusion flotation have been modelled mathematically for testing the behaviour of several tundish designs.

40|$|Abstract. Flow {{patterns}} and mixing behaviors in a gas stirred <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle</b> with a slag layer were discussed using a water model experiment {{as well as}} a numerical simulation. While the water model experiment was performed to investigate the effect of slag on the mixing behavior in ladle, the numerical simulation was carried out to figure out the flow pattern in ladle with a slag layer. Slag viscosity and its thickness in ladle were considered as major variables. It was found that a slag layer made a great change in the flow pattern in ladle, which, in turn, affected on the mixing behavior in ladle. A flow pattern without a slag layer showed that rising bubbles eventually made a recirculation loop at the central area of the ladle and this flow pattern was regarded as a favorable flow pattern for the better mixing behavior. However, a flow pattern with a slag layer showed distorted and localized recirculating loop near side wall below slag layer. This eventually gave a longer mixing time in ladle with a slag layer. Moreover, as the gas flow rate increases, slag existing on top of the ladle was found to be entrained into the melt. Slag viscosity and its thickness were found to be major variables affecting the behavior of slag entrainment. Lower the slag viscosity and thicker the slag layer, much more slag on top of the melt was entrained into the melt...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: One of {{the primary}} tasks that put the steel {{producers}} to the test is to reduce production costs while maintaining high quality. This objective is achieved among others through the optimization of conducted technological processes. Commonly used technology of steel homogenization with inert gases is an important stage {{in the production of}} steel in which that objective can be accomplished. Design/methodology/approach: Tests of hydrodynamic processes occurring during the steel blowing with inert gases process directly in industrial conditions is very difficult or impossible. Therefore, as the primary research method physical modelling was used. In order to carry out the tests described in the article a physical model of the station for the argon purging was used that is working at the VSB-TU, Department of Metallurgy and Foundry in Ostrava. Findings: As a result the study provided values for the investigated process and determined the appropriate location of the gas-permeable fittings in <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle’s</b> bottom plug. This allows to obtain the required conditions for the steel mixing in the entire volume of ladle’s workspace. Research limitations/implications: Tests presented in the article were carried out in the VSB-TU in Ostrava.

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that silicate application can raise soil P availability for crops, the aim of this research was to compare the effect of silicate application on soil P desorption with that of liming, in evaluations based on two extractors and plant growth. The experiment was carried out in randomized blocks with four replications, in a 3 × 3 × 5 factorial design, in which three soil types, three P rates, and four soil acidity correctives were evaluated in 180 experimental plots. Trials were performed in a greenhouse using corn plants in 20 -dm³ pots. Three P rates (0, 50 and 150 mg dm- 3) were applied in the form of powder triple superphosphate and the soil was incubated for 90 days. After this period, soil samples were collected for routine chemical analysis and P content determination by the extraction methods resin, Mehlich- 1 and remaining P. Based on the results, acidity correctives were applied at rates calculated for base saturation increased to 70 %, with subsequent incubation for 60 more days, when P content was determined again. The acidity correctives consisted of: dolomitic lime, <b>steelmaking</b> slag, <b>ladle</b> furnace slag, and wollastonite. Therefore, our results showed that slags raised the soil P content more than lime, suggesting a positive correlation between P and Si in soil. Silicon did not affect the extractor choice since both Mehlich- 1 and resin had the same behavior regarding extracted P when silicon was applied to the soil.

Magnesia clinker exhibits brilliant blue or red CL colors in these bricks. The blue CL color is generally interpreted {{to be produced}} by lattice defects or intrinsic properties of MgO crystal. The red CL color is related to impurity centers. Cr 3 +, Fe 3 +, and Mn 4 + activators are known to produce red CL color in MgO. Red to blue or blue to red CL color changes in MgO clinkers in MgO-C refractories from slag line of ladle or BOF, in fact, represent changes in local atmosphere within the refractory brick. In a reducing surrounding local CO atmosphere (in {{the center of the}} brick), the valence state of these transition metal ions are easily reduced and the blue CL is enhanced. Similarly, in an oxidized environment where free O 2 and CO 2 are predominant gaseous species, MgO grains in MgO-C and Mag-Chrome brick generally produce red CL color.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{a study on}} the thermal state of {{steelmaking}} ladles was undertaken. The transient hot wire method was verified for thermal conductivity measurements on metallurgical slags and applied to ladle slag measurements. Temperature measurements on ladles in an industrial environment were carried out. The emissivities of the outer and inner shells of steelmaking ladles were investigated. Two dynamic models were developed to predict the heat transfer and fluid flow in a preheating and teeming ladle. The gathered thermal conductivity values for ladle slag were used to study the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt on heat transfer and fluid flow in a teeming ladle. In the first stage, the transient hot-wire method was verified to measure the thermal conductivity of metallurgical slags at steelmaking temperatures. A numerical model was developed, cold model experiments were conducted and test measurements using a high temperature experimental setup were carried out. To minimize natural convection and to obtain more reliable measurements, the crucible diameter, the hot-wire diameter, the applied current, the position of the wire in the crucible and the cooling on the upper surface of the crucible were studied. Investigations into the choice of sheathing material of the circuit exposed to the slag were also made. It was found that only certain materials were suitable for slag measurements depending on slag composition and temperature. The electrical resistivity of the hot wire was measured to make the thermal conductivity calculation more reliable. The wire diameter also played a major role due to the heat generation per surface area. The thermal conductivity should be derived from the values measured during the first seconds. In this initial stage, the effect of the natural convection {{as a function of the}} wire position in the crucible, the cooling on the top surface and the diameter of the crucible are negligible. A compromise has to be made in choosing the electrical current, since higher current results in higher sensitivity but at the same time in more natural convection. In the second stage, the thermal conductivities of four different ladle slags were measured at 1773 K, 1823 K, 1873 K and 1923 K using the transient hot wire method. Very good reproducibility was obtained. The thermal conductivity did not vary substantially with the variation of slag composition at 1873 K and 1923 K, at which the slag samples were all entirely liquid. The thermal conductivities were low. It was found that the precipitation of solid phase resulted in a considerable increase of thermal conductivity. In the third stage, a two dimensional model was developed in order to predict the temperature distribution in the ladle wall during the preheating process. The model calculated the heat transfer and the velocity field in the gas phase inside the ladle as well as the heat transfer in the solid walls during the preheating process. Measurements of the temperature profiles in an industrial ladle were carried out using an infrared thermography. The measurements were made both inside and outside the ladle. The model predictions were found to be in reasonably good agreement with the measured temperatures. It was found that the preheating time could be minimized when the working lining became thinner. The effect ofthe distance between the lid and the ladle was also studied by the model. The results indicated that there was no significant temperature change on the upper side wall of the ladle. On the lower side wall and bottom the temperature changed slightly. The temperature difference in the lower part of the ladle could be explained by the larger flame distance from the bottom layer. In the fourth stage, a two dimensional axisymmetric model was developed to predict the heat flux in a <b>steelmaking</b> <b>ladle</b> during the teeming process. The model predicts dynamically the flow fields in both the liquid phase and the gas phase along with the movement of the liquid upper surface. The model also predicts the temperature distributions in the liquid metal, gas phase and all layers in the ladle wall. Again, industrial measurements were performed using an infrared thermography, both inside the ladle after teeming and at the wall outside the ladle during the whole process sequence. The model predictions were found to be in agreement with the measured data. It was found that the heat transfer to the surrounding atmosphere and the conductivity of the highly insulating layer were the most important factors for the heat loss. The decrease of the thickness of the working lining was found to have limited effect on the total heat flux. In the fifth and final stage, the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt, on fluid flow and on heat transfer in a teeming ladle was investigated theoretically. The two dimensional axisymmetric model developed in the fourth stage was used. To predict the effect of the slag layer a stationary heat conduction boundary condition including thermal conductivity and slag layer thickness was employed. Different calculations with differing thermal conductivity values for the slag layer were carried out. The calculations showed that the effect of the slag layer was insignificant. This could be explained by the similarity of the thermal conductivity of slag and gas phase. QC 20121010 </p...|$|E

In the present study principal component analysis (PCA), projection to latent structures (PLS) and hierarchical PCA {{has been used to}} create models of five process steps at a Swedish steelworks. The focus has been to identify and explain relations to quality problems in each step, both within the step itself, but also from upstream processes using hierarchical PCA. The five process steps that have been modelled are the blast furnace, desulphurization in the torpedo car, basic oxygen steelmaking in the LD–LBE-converter, secondary <b>steelmaking</b> in <b>ladle</b> and ladle furnace and, finally, continuous casting of slabs. Among the results achieved it is found that: PLS prediction of crude iron analysis from blast furnace discharge has been made with a fraction of explained variance for external validation (Q 2 PS) above 20 % for P, Cr, Cu, Ti, CaO, SiO 2, MgO and basicity. The data resolution was relatively low. Hierarchical modelling revealed correlations between the process steps, e. g. that LD-converter treatments registered as severe slopping heats have a titanium content in the incoming crude iron that is higher than average. Heats with too high phosphorous content after LD-treatment can be identified as having low silicon content in the crude iron, which makes it impossible to create the necessary slag amount for desired phosphorous cleaning effect. High sulphur content in the torpedo car demands a long treatment time. If the silicon content is low in such a batch, there is an evident risk that it will not have high enough temperature in the secondary steelmaking. Capturing reasons for quality problems during casting is difficult due to the low variation in data. The main variations exist between the steel qualities. However, the importance of casting properties such as oscillations for visual quality of the slabs, and temperature and steel analysis for slab inner quality have been recognized...|$|R

In secondary <b>steelmaking,</b> the gas-stirred <b>ladle</b> refining process is enhanced by applying a vacuum. A three phase (steel/gas/slag) mathematical model based on the fundamental transport equations has been reported in the literature. This model was used to study the steelmaking refining process. In this approach, the gas-stirred ladle system fluid flow prediction from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was linked with thermodynamic analysis, with some thermal simplification. The model predicts the changes in the mass concentration of the elements of concern (Al, O, and S) during the refining process. In the present work we aim to enhance the modeling in the literature. Here we use Fluent as the CFD package to predict the flow pattern of the three phase (steel/gas/slag) system. The thermodynamic package is MTDATA from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), which has the capability to make thermodynamic predictions for multi-component systems containing up to 30 elements. Therefore, it is possible to solve for the properties of the slag as a function of composition and temperature. The two packages are being linked in a Visual Basic environment. The mass concentration of the different elements at the steel/slag interface is being updated at a pre-defined Δt time step. Comparison of the model calculated results with data from the literature show the potential of this model. Real plant data will be used to validate this multi phase simulation model...|$|R
