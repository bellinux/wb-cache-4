5|$|Crowley's {{thought was}} not always cohesive, and was {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was <b>steeped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.|$|E
5|$|Miguel de Benavides {{was born}} in 1550 in the Castilian town of Carrión de los Condes, {{province}} of Palencia, Spain, {{in the heart of}} the austere, grain-producing Tierra de Campos. Benavides was <b>steeped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theological principles of Francisco de Vitoria and Bartolomé de las Casas, who exchanged the prestigious professorial chair for remote and difficult new missions of the Philippines. He was chosen to govern the newly created Diocese of Nueva Segovia (now Vigan) as its First Bishop (1595–1601). He wrote the Doctrina Christiana in Chinese, the first book printed in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} three sons born in Adelaide,Unley to Martin and Jeanne (née Richardson), Chappell was <b>steeped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game from an early age.

Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five, as were younger brothers Greg and Trevor, who both also went on to play for Australia.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too <b>steeped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

25|$|Sedgwick and Frank's {{critique}} of Cvetkovich's first book, however, is merely {{used as a}} way to challenge the “hygiene of…antiessentialism” in poststructuralist theory. In a footnote, they state that there are numerous other theorists (including Sedgwick herself) that are more <b>steeped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> “routines of theory” of which they accuse Cvetkovich, and who are “more directly responsible for their popularization.” However, they chose to critique Cvetkovich's book because using a new scholar's work would allow them to more “effectively defamiliarize” the “critical practices” they are challenging.|$|E
25|$|Dede {{has been}} criticised by Turkish music purists {{for not being}} <b>steeped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sufi traditions and for not {{properly}} representing Sufism in his music and writings.

However, {{as more than a}} ney player, working just as often as a DJ as performing live in concert, with an audience consisting of clubbers, not Islamic scholars, Dede aims to synthesise several different traditions rather than recreate a historically pure music.|$|E

25|$|The main {{themes in}} Brennan's short stories are {{feelings}} of loneliness, vulnerability, despair, spite, and fear. She often wrote about unhappy, loveless marriages {{and people with}} claustrophobic, sad and disappointed lives. Her studies of these relationships sometimes have a cruel tone. Another theme is about how the individual's need for expression is countered and restricted by the need for societal acceptance {{in a country that}} clung to traditions <b>steeped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church and strict convention. For example, in The Devil In Us she describes a convent school that uses morals to cruelly stop any type of nonconformity.|$|E
