5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission <b>striping.</b> Transmission <b>striping</b> occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Rbk Edge jersey, the Flames updated their look once again, replacing the horizontal <b>striping</b> with vertical <b>striping</b> down the sides. To honour the team's heritage, the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches. In celebration of their 30th season in Calgary, the Flames wore their original jersey design for five games in 2009â€“10, each against a Canadian opponent. The 2009-10 version of the jersey was produced in the traditional style that preceded the Edge redesign; for the following season, the throwback design was adapted to the Edge format as the Flames' new regular third jersey.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of <b>striping</b> {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed <b>striping</b> patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold <b>striping</b> pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E

5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg <b>striping</b> and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white <b>striping</b> of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Magnum XL-200 {{has three}} white-and-black trains. Each train has red, black or blue <b>striping</b> at the front. Each train has six cars; riders are {{arranged}} two-across in three rows {{for a total}} of 36 riders per train. Magnum was the first coaster in which Arrow Dynamics used its Hypercoaster trains, which were subsequently installed on dozens of other new rides. Riders are secured by a single lap bar and a seat belt.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' amaryllis, Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual <b>striping.</b>|$|E

5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf <b>striping</b> in N. tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{has mostly}} black, gray, and white plumage, which is soft, lacking gloss. With its <b>striping</b> {{and the small}} yellow spot between its eye and bill, it is a {{distinctive}} bird. The sexes differ slightly, both having gray upperparts with black streaks, and white underparts with black streaks on the flanks. The adult male is striped with a black on the crown, throat, and below the eye, and has white around its chin and above its eye. The adult female has more dingy plumage on its head, with a white throat and dark gray cheeks. The most similar birds to the black-throated gray warbler are the black-and-white and blackpoll warblers, which although marked in black have entirely different plumage patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{color of the}} Namib Desert Horse is bay, {{although}} {{there are a few}} chestnut and brown horses. The gene for gray does not occur in the breed. There are many individuals with dorsal <b>striping</b> but no zebra stripes. No other colors have been recorded. The Namib Desert Horses are athletic, muscular, , and strong boned. They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head, skin, and coat. Overall, they have good conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances.|$|E

30|$|The {{detection}} {{accuracy of}} the light <b>stripe</b> centers {{is an important factor}} based on the structured light vision measurement, {{and the quality of the}} light <b>stripe</b> images is a prerequisite for accurately detecting the light <b>stripe</b> centers; this paper separately proposes image enhancement methods for linear and arc light <b>stripe</b> images. For linear light <b>stripes,</b> the image with better quality is captured and the gray-scale distribution of the normal section corresponding to the light <b>stripe</b> centers is used as a template for light <b>stripe</b> images with poor quality. The poor quality light <b>stripe</b> images are finally optimized by linear interpolation. For arc-shaped light <b>stripes,</b> this paper proposes a positioning method for light <b>stripe</b> centers on arc, and then the gray-scale distribution of the normal cross-section of corresponding center which is on a good quality light <b>stripe</b> image is used as templates to improve the poor quality light quality <b>stripe</b> images. In order to verify the effectiveness of the light <b>stripe</b> image enhancement algorithms, this paper respectively presents verification methods to linear light <b>stripe</b> and arc light <b>stripe.</b> Finally, the quality of the light <b>stripe</b> images could be improved by image enhancement algorithms through experiments.|$|R

5|$|Three {{subspecies}} are recognised, differing in {{the overall}} tone of their plumage and in the head <b>striping</b> of the female. The subspecies ammodendri occurs in {{the west of the}} saxaul sparrow's range, while stoliczkae and nigricans occur in the east. This distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia, from central Turkmenistan to northern Gansu in China. A bird of deserts, the saxaul sparrow favours areas with shrubs such as the saxaul, near rivers and oases. Though it has lost parts of its range to habitat destruction caused by agriculture, it is not seriously threatened by human activities.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in <b>striping</b> patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
