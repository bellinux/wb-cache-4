40|$|The four {{kinds of}} anti-tumor agents i. e. nitromin (0. 5 mg per mouse, four times), {{colchicine}} (0. 05 mg per mouse, one time), sakomycin (5 mg per mouse, one time) and mitomycin C (0. 04 mg per mouse, one time) were intraperitoneally administered to dds-mice {{which had been}} transplanted with Ehrlich ascites tumor seven days previously. And the changes of the DPN diaphorase, TPN diaphorase, succinic dehydrogenase (SD) and α-glycero-phosphate dehydrogenase (αGD) of the ascites tumor cells were cytochemically examined in the smear method and suspension method. 1) In general, moderate morphological changes of the tumor cells by these anti-tumor agents were observed, and the changes of the stainability of the oxidative enzymes were often observed. 2) After nitromin administration. no change of the stainability of the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase in the smear method and slight increase of their stainability in the suspension method were observed. The stainabilities of the SD and α-GD were decreased in lesser degree in both methods. 3) After colchicine administration, no change of the stainability of the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase in the smear method was observed, but their stainability of all tumor cells showed a tendency down to keep same intensity. A slight decrease of the stainability of the SD and α-GD was observed in the smear method, while their stainabilities were slightly increased in the suspension method. 4) After <b>sarkomycin</b> administration, stainabilities of all four enzymes were decreased in certain degree in the smear method, but the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase staining intensity were remarkably decreased in the suspention method and their stainabilities of all cells showed a tendency down to keep same intensity. The SD and α-GD staining intensity were also decreased slightly in the suspension method. 5) After the administration of mitomycin C, changes of the staining intensity of the DPN diaphorase and TPN diaphorase were scarcely observed in both methods. The staining intensity of the cells in the end stage of the interphase showed to be decreased in lesser degree. Stainabilities of the SD and α-GD were slightly decreased in the smear method, while their stainabilities were slightly increased in the suspension method. 6) It might be assumed that the decrease of the stainability reacted with the anti-tumor agents in the smear method specimen showed decrease or destruction of the oxidative enzymes and that the change of stainability reacted in the suspension method specimen showed change of {{the activity of the}} enzymes...|$|E
40|$|The {{cleavage}} {{reaction of}} cyclopropane ring {{is one of}} the useful method in organic synthesis. Especially, the sequence of cyclopropanation-homoconjugate addition {{is one of the}} accessible methods for the synthesis of natural products possessing ring and side-chain contiguous chiral centers. This paper deals with the synthetic studies of biologically active natural products possessing such chiral centers by using the ring opening reaction of double activated cyclopropanes. Methyl 6 -exo-methyl- 2 -oxobicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexane- 1 -carboxylate (1), the main starting material for the synthesis of target moleculars has been synthesized in chapter 1. Alkylation of the dianion of methyl acetoacetate with 1 -chloro- 2 -butene followed by diazo transfer and copper-mediated cyclopropanation to give cyclopropane (1) in moderate yield. Three other cyclopropane derivatives (4, 8 and 10) have been prepared in the same manner. Optically active cyclopropane derivatives (19 and 20) has been obtained from l-menthyl acetoacetate (12) by optical resolution of diastereomeric mixture (15 + 16). The stereochemical course of homoconjugate addition to an activated cyclopropane has been elucidated in chapter 2. It has been apparent that the opening reaction proceed with inversion of absolute configuration at the apical carbon of the cyclopropane. (2 RS, 3 RS) - 2 -Methyl- 3 -[(1 RS) - 1, 5 -dimethylhexyl]cyclopentanone (35), the key intermediate in the synthesis of vitamin D_ 3, has been prepared stereoselectively using the cuprous iodide-mediated homoconjugate addition of Grignard reagent in chapter 3. Treatment of 1 with 4 -methylpentylmagnesium bromide in the presence of cuprous iodide to give keto ester (49). Methylation followed by decarbomethoxylation gave desired ketone (35). 1 - (1 '-Hydroxyethyl) - 7, 7 a-dihydro- 5 (6 H) -indanone- 7 a-carboxylic acid- 7 a, 1 '-lactone (58), a potential intermediate for the synthesis of steroid (55) containing E (lactone) ring, was synthesized stereoselectively using the acid catalyzed homoconjugate addition of methanol to cyclopropane (1) in chapter 4. The reaction gave 1, 5 -adduct (21), which was converted to diketone (60) by treatment with methyl vinyl ketone. Lactonization followed by aldol condensation gave desired tricyclic lactone (58). Chapter 5 deals with a preparation of(2 RS) - 2 -[(1 RS) - 3 -oxocyclohexyl]propanoic acid (71), the key intermediate in the synthesis of the naturally occurring juvenile hormone juvabione (70), by employing the homoconjugate addition of cyanide anion to bicyclo [4, 1, 0]heptane derivative (10). Treatment of 10 with sodium cyanide in dimethylsulfoxide gave cyanide (73). Decarbomethoxylation followed by acid hydrolysis gave desired keto acid (71). Plinol A (83), B (84), C (85) and D (86) have been derived from linalool by an ene reaction. The short step synthesis of plinol A and B have been achieved starting from methoxy keto ester (21) via ketone (99) in six steps in chapter 6. Bicyclic lactone (23) was converted to plinol C in eight step sequences. The key reaction of the synthesis is stereoselective introduction of C- 1 methyl group of plinol C to ketone (102). In addition, enantioselective synthesis of plinol A and C has been achieved starting from (+) - 23. In chapter 7, the synthesis of (2 RS, 3 SR) - 2 -hydroxyethyl- 3 -[(1 RS) - 1 -hydroxyethyl]cyclopentanone derivative (157), a potential intermediate in the synthesis of thienamycin, has been discussed. Introduction of C 2 unit to keto ester (21) at C- 2 position afforded 146 which was transformed into secondary alcohol (153) in six steps. Mitsunobu reaction of 153 gave desired cyclopentanone (157) possessing correct stereochemistry in thienamycin. The synthesis of (±) - 1 '-epiinvictolide (163) has been reported in charpter 8. The cyclopropane (1) was treated with n-propylmagnesium bromide in the presence of cuprous iodide to give keto ester (166), which was transformed into ketone (168) by methylation followed by decarbomethoxylation. 1, 3 -Carbonyl transposition of 168 using Wharton rearrangement afforded ketone (174). Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 174 followed by methylation to give (±) - 1 '-epiinvictolide, the stereoisomer of queen recognition pheromone of red imported fire ant. An iridoid monoterpene hop ether (180), a constituent of the volatile oil of Japaniese hops, has been synthesized in chapter 9. Bicyclic lactone (23) was converted to methyl ketone (186) in four step sequences containing katalization, reduction, silylation and oxidation. (±) -Hop ether (180) was obtained after introduction of methyl group followed by desilylation, cyclization, deketalization and methylenation. Stereocontrolled total synthesis of (±) -dihydronepetalactone (190), physiologically active compornent for the Felidae animals, has been accomplished in chapter 10. The cyclopropane (1) was treated with sodium cyanide in dimethylsulfoxide to give cyanide (191). It was transformed into unsaturated lactone (197) in six steps by usual operations. The lactone (197) was converted to dihydronepetalactone (190) by stereoselective introduction of C- 1 methyl group using Gilmann reagent. Chapter 11 deals with the unsuccessful approach for the synthesis of other biologically active natural products (rudmollin (198), valerenal (208) and <b>sarkomycin</b> (229)) ...|$|E
