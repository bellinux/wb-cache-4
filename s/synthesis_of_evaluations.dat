40|$|Co-funded {{policies}} are proliferating {{in the public}} sector, thus creating the need for evaluations in partnership. In this context, evaluation faces specific difficulties: objectives are multiple and ambiguous, indicators may not be perceived as relevant, data collection is complex, and partners' views legitimately differ. The article describes the evaluation of an urban development policy co-decided and co-funded by the French government and the Poitou-Charentes Region. It demonstrates {{that it was possible}} to overcome the difficulties of joint evaluations through a series of technical innovations: a concept map structured the evaluation; scoring sheets were used to construct qualitative impact indicators, data about impacts was collected via 20 case studies, and, finally, a multicriteria-multijudge analysis was used to conclude the evaluation while respecting different points of view. In addition to its operational interest, this experience seeks to make a theoretical contribution to the question of the final <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluations.</b> © SAGE Publication.

It is to assess whether a set of selected evaluations and expert articles indicate that Norway has obtained greater influence and achieved greater efficiency in its environmental assistance through outsourcing of its funding, both regarding individual organisations and environmental-related assistance in general. In line with the terms of reference the synthesis study is based on the documentation (a selection of evaluation reports and expert articles) that Nordic Consulting Group AS (NCG) has been asked to review by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). The study is thus limited to a review of the documentation provided, even though NCG also possesses relevant experience-based knowledge about other multi-lateral development banks, such as the Asian Developmen...|$|E

Overall, there was a significant increase in relevant disclosures associated with the polygraph. The impact on reoffending rates was significant for violent but not sexual offenses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy set-based {{approach to the}} <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> information technology (IT) projects. We assume a multi-criteria decision-making framework, where sets of general and domain-specific criteria are used to judge the relative performance of alternative technologies. The methodology was originally developed for DIAS. net, an EU project aiming at {{the development of the}} Information Society in insular and isolated regions of Europe. In this paper, we present many aspects <b>of</b> our <b>evaluation</b> framework, including the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluation</b> teams, the assessment of the importance <b>of</b> criteria, the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the performance of the alternatives and the final ranking and selection of projects. The methodology presented has the innovative feature of embodying techniques of fuzzy sets theory into the classical multi-criteria decision analysis. This combination enables us to handle efficiently the subjectiveness that often characterizes expert judgements on a decision problem. Fuzzy linguistic terms, such as "poor," "fair," "very important," etc. are proposed for assessing the relative merit of alternatives and criteria. The paper concludes by exploring the potentiality of the above methodology in providing a flexible and robust IT evaluation framework.

40|$|Evaluation {{is firmly}} {{established}} {{as part of}} rural development policymaking in the EU. A requirement to evaluate is {{set out in the}} Rural Development Regulation, the legal basis for spending EU funds on agreed aspects of rural development, which also stipulates the process to be used. Member States are responsible for ensuring that independent "ex ante," mid-term and "ex post" evaluations are carried out for each seven-year Rural Development Programme (RDP), but with inputs from the Commission, notably on common evaluation questions to be used in all countries. Such a heavily structured system has both advantages and disadvantages. Consistency <b>of</b> approach enables <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluation</b> results at the EU level and provides a degree of quality control. However, it constrains the ability of evaluators to pursue issues which may be of importance locally or to other stakeholders. Technical details, especially the timing <b>of</b> <b>evaluation</b> stages, also diminish the ability to learn from past programmes. Data availability remains an important issue. Nevertheless, our experience is that it is both possible and important to learn from evaluating RDPs, not only to measure their apparent achievements, but also to enhance the quality of the policy process, at all levels.
