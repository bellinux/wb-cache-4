5|$|No.81 Wing re-formed at Williamtown on 2February 1987. Along with No.75 Squadron at Tindal, its flying units {{consisted}} of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown with No.2 OCU, {{all of which}} had converted from the Mirage to the Hornet between 1985 and 1987, the last-mentioned being the prime operator of the two-seat F/A-18B trainers. Having continued to perform fighter maintenance through the 1960s and '70s, No.481 Squadron disbanded on 31January 1987. It re-formed the next day as No.481 Wing under No.81 Wing's parent organisation, Tactical Fighter Group (TFG), and {{consisted of}} two squadrons, Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Williamtown (AMSWLM) and Aircraft Equipment Maintenance Squadron Williamtown (AEMSWLM). By 1996, No.81 Wing had been augmented by Nos.25 and 76 Squadrons, operating Macchi MB-326 lead-in fighters, the former based at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, and the latter at Williamtown, where it also employed Pilatus PC-9s for forward air control (FAC). On 1July 1996, No.481 Wing was reorganised as No.402 Wing, incorporating a newly re-formed No.481 Squadron as well as Weapon <b>Systems</b> <b>Support</b> Flight and Field Training Flight. No.402 Wing transferred its functions to No.81 Wing's flying squadrons on 31July 1998 before disbanding in October. The same year, No.25 Squadron was split, its Macchis now being operated by a re-formed No.79 Squadron. No.78 Wing was re-established in 2000 as an operational training formation, taking over Nos.76 and 79 Squadrons, and No.2 OCU. By 2007, No.2 OCU {{had returned to the}} control of No.81 Wing.|$|E

25|$|While many simpler {{operating}} <b>systems</b> <b>support</b> {{a limited}} range of options for accessing storage systems, operating systems like UNIX and Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS.

This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.|$|E

25|$|IPv6 is not {{directly}} interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet {{not directly}} accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating <b>systems</b> <b>support</b> both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.|$|E
25|$|Currently most {{operating}} <b>systems</b> <b>support</b> {{a variety}} of networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface.|$|E
