25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking what I thought of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E

[...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful mother and so I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby." [...] Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Having started {{rigorous}} workouts in {{the final}} trimester of her pregnancy the year before to prepare {{for her role in}} A Few Good Men, Moore was physically fit for the photoshoot. Thus she appeared in additional nude photos within the magazine's cover story. Moore viewed the photos as a chance to show off the results of her workouts: [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get better with each baby and I have." [...] The weeklong effort also involved shots taken in Kauai, Hawaii that are included in Gair's second book, Body Painting. Moore felt she looked better on the cover at age 29 than she had in a bikini nine years earlier in Blame It on Rio.|$|E

[...] Carey included her duet with Busta Rhymes, [...] "I Know What You Want", which was released as a single from his album, It Ain't Safe No More (2002), and became Carey's highest charting song internationally since 2001, reaching top five peaks in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, the US and the UK. In an interview with Carson Daly, Carey said, [...] "The Busta Rhymes duet...has become so successful and we always <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> put it on my album as well."

Rush stated he was not {{initially}} familiar with Green Lantern but {{was drawn to the}} part after seeing the concept art explaining, [...] "When I got the offer for it I said, ‘Haven’t they made that film?’ They said, ‘No, it’s a completely computer-generated character.’ I saw the artwork and I <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> love to be that guy. Because I had voiced an owl in [...] and I’d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo and I thought I could really improve on that now by being half-bird, half-fish, part lizard. You don’t get to do that in a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but {{there is a kind of}} theme I suppose".|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to hear it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E

500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the post-war}} period progressed, Abe's stance as an {{intellectual}} pacifist led to him joining the Japanese Communist Party, with whom he worked to organize laborers in poor parts of Tokyo. Soon after his reception of the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, Abe began to feel {{the constraints of the}} Communist Party's rules and regulations alongside doubts about what meaningful artistic works could be created under the title of [...] "socialist realism." [...] By 1956, Abe began writing in solidarity with the Polish rebels and their freedom movement, drawing the ire of the Japanese Communist Party. The Party's criticism reaffirmed his stance: [...] "The Communist Party put pressure on me to change the content of the article and apologize. But I refused. I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never change my opinion on the matter. This was my first break with the Party." [...] The next year, Abe traveled to Eastern Europe for the Twentieth Convention of the Soviet Communist Party. Here, Abe saw little of interest, but the arts gave him some solace. He visited Kafka's house in Prague, read Rilke and Karel Čapek, reflected on his idol Lu Xun, and was moved by a Mayakovsky play in Brno.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 August {{an article}} {{published}} in the Sunday Times claimed ministers at Westminster had agreed not to specifically exclude al-Megrahi from an agreement concerning prisoner transfers in 2007 because of [...] "overwhelming national interests". In a letter dated 19 December 2007, Secretary of State for Justice Jack Straw wrote to his Scottish counterpart, [...] "I had previously accepted the importance of the al-Megrahi issue to Scotland and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> try to get an exclusion for him {{on the face of the}} agreement. I have not been able to secure an explicit exclusion. The wider negotiations with the Libyans are reaching a critical stage and, in view of the overwhelming interests for the UK, I have agreed that in this instance the [...] should be in the standard form and not mention any individual." [...] Straw is quoted as stating that an application under the prisoner transfer agreement was turned down. Straw denied that the release was part of any deal, while Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond reiterated that the release had been granted on compassionate grounds and not as part of any deal struck by the British Government.|$|E

Crouch-Hazlett had just finished speaking from atop a soap box and announced a money collection when, she later recounted, [...] "a policeman with the usual porcine proportions came up and <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to clear the sidewalk." [...] The crowd complied for the request for sidewalk clearance by opening a pathway, but this proved insufficient for the officer, who jerked Crouch-Hazlett down from the box. Crouch-Hazlett was arrested while a vast crowd swarmed around her and the arresting officers, screaming [...] "Shame!" [...] and [...] "Cowards!" [...] Crouch-Hazlett was taken to police headquarters and a $25 bond declared, which was quickly offered by a city attorney, who was not himself a Socialist. A crowd reported in the press as 2,000 persons gathered to demand Crouch-Hazlett's release, with the Spokane Fire Department called out to help disburse the gathering. Crouch-Hazlett was released on $25 bail and escorted by a happy throng to her hotel.|$|E

During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that [...] "neither President Clinton nor Secretary [...] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace." [...] In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: [...] "They asked me before the election if I'd honor ," [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> but...

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick.

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous; but the wicked and him who loves {{violence}} His soul hates," [...] bear on God's instruction in [...] "Take the Levites." [...] The Midrash taught {{that the words}} of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous," [...] imply that God never raises a person to high rank before first testing and trying that person. If the person stands the trial, God raises the person to high rank. The Midrash found this {{to have been the}} case with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and so also with the tribe of Levi. The Midrash taught that the Levites devoted their lives to the sanctification of God's Name. When the Israelites were in Egypt, the Israelites rejected the Torah and circumcision, as implied by Ezekiel's rebuke of them in [...] "Thus says the Lord God: 'In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt'"; and afterwards, [...] says, [...] "They rebelled against Me, and would not hearken to Me [...] [...] [...] then I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> pour out My fury upon them." [...] So God brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, and during that time God slew all the wicked Israelites, as [...] reports, [...] "I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me." [...] The Levites, however, were all righteous and practiced the Torah; as [...] says, [...] "For they have observed Your word, and keep Your covenant." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] "covenant" [...] referred to circumcision, as [...] says, [...] "This is My covenant [...] [...] [...] every male among you shall be circumcised." [...] And the Midrash taught that when the Israelites made the Golden Calf, the Levites did not participate, as [...] says: [...] "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp [...] [...] [...] and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him." [...] When Moses told them in [...] "Put every man his sword upon his thigh," [...] they did so and respected no persons. Moses accordingly blessed them in [...] saying, [...] "Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him.'" [...] When God thus saw that the Levites were all righteous, and that they stood the test, as [...] says, [...] "Whom You did prove at Massah," [...] God decided, as reported in [...] "The Levites shall be mine." ...|$|E
