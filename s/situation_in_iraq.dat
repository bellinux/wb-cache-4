5|$|The <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> did not improve, Abdul Salam Arif, the President of Iraq and a Nasserist, plotted a coup {{against the}} Ba'ath Party on 18 November, which succeeded.

5|$|Ibrahim {{moved to}} secure control of Iraq region, but {{although}} he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, {{who had made}} Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Rida succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although {{the rest of his}} family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Rida also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad ("the place of martyrdom"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.|$|E

25|$|As the {{security}} <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> has worsened since the invasion, many journalists {{have found it}} increasingly difficult to report from Iraq without jeopardizing their lives. Some media outlets, unable to afford the cost of additional security, have even abandoned their bureaus in Baghdad. This trend has forced journalists to depend even more heavily on U.S. military sources, which has led some critics to call into question the impartiality of their reports on events such as the Iraqi elections.|$|E

In the case of Iraq, Cordesman observes that the burden is on the Islamic civilization, not unilaterally the West, {{if for no other}} reason that the civilization to which the problematic nation belongs will have cultural and linguistic context that Western civilization cannot hope to equal.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several episodes in which {{large numbers of people}} were {{severely}} poisoned by food contaminated with high levels of methylmercury, notably the dumping of industrial waste that resulted in the pollution and subsequent mass poisoning in Minamata and Niigata, Japan and the <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> in the 1960s and 1970s in which wheat treated with methylmercury as a preservative and intended as seed grain was fed to animals and directly consumed by people (see Basra poison grain disaster). These episodes resulted in neurological symptoms including paresthesias, loss of physical coordination, difficulty in speech, narrowing of the visual field, hearing impairment, blindness, and death.

For these new video installations, which each last eight minutes, Farocki shot footage in military facilities in the USA and combined these sequences with material from computer simulations. Reminiscent of computer games, these programs are used by soldiers to practice for real emergency <b>situations</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> Afghanistan, and potential crisis zones. A variation of this can be found in another film in the Serious Games series, Immersion, which deals with the reenactment of soldiers’ traumatic wartime experiences using the same kind of simulation technology, which in this case serves therapeutic purposes.

5000|$|Emigration from Iraq to Canada has {{increased}} dramatically due to political and economic <b>situations</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The Iraq-Iran War resulted in many immigrants. With the destroyed Iraqi economy and the oppression of the 13-year economic sanctions against Iraq that followed the Gulf War of 1990-91, there {{was all the more}} reason to emigrate. From 1945 until 1975 fewer than 200 Iraqis arrived in Canada. Emigration substantially increased in 1979, the year Saddam Hussein became president of Iraq. Between 1975 and 1992, 6,472 Iraqis arrived in Canada, [...] establishing about 3.5 percent of all Arab immigrants in Canada. About 65 percent of Iraqis settled in the province of Quebec, particularly in Montreal, and in the province of British Columbia, particularly in Vancouver on shores of the Pacific Ocean. Many Iraqis also live in the province of Ontario, particularly in the Canadian capital city of Ottawa, Windsor and Toronto, the most populated city in Canada.|$|R

500|$|More than 20 nations (most {{notably the}} United Kingdom), {{designated}} the [...] "coalition of the willing" [...] joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared {{the end of}} major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] speech was later criticized as premature. From 2004 until 2007, the <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> deteriorated further, with some observers arguing {{that there was a}} full-scale civil war in Iraq.

The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> was [...] "grave and deteriorating". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy.

The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the characteristics of attendees of an open walk-in psychiatric clinic in a general hospital in Baghdad and the suburb towns of <b>Iraq</b> <b>in</b> the year 2010. Methods: As part of a retrospective survey, information on specific variables (socio-demographic background, clinical characteristics and attendance rate) were sought from medical records in the year 2010 (January to December). Results: Despite the shortcomings expected from a country coming out of the ravage of war, the survey included 2, 979 attendees (1, 864 [63 %] males and 1, 115 [37 %] females) of a walk-in psychiatric clinic who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The profile of attendees indicated that a majority of the cohort was self-referred with a predominance of employed males, aged 19 to 49 years, residing in Baghdad City. Depression and psychosis were the most common diagnosis given. Conclusion: The observed patterns are discussed within the available literature relevant to consultation liaison psychiatry, and specific to <b>situations</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Arab/Islamic cultural patterning...|$|R
500|$|Clinton {{opposed the}} Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both {{military}} and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful).

In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton {{was one of those who}} voted against it.
