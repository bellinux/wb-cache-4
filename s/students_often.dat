5|$|In 1862, Lee and the Shaws {{agreed to}} share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an {{affluent}} part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay. Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's <b>students</b> <b>often</b> gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly; thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with {{a wide spectrum of}} literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Margaret MacVicar {{founded the}} Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable {{undergraduates}} to collaborate directly with {{faculty members and}} researchers. Students join or initiate research projects ("UROPs") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly. A substantial majority of undergraduates participate. <b>Students</b> <b>often</b> become published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.|$|E
5|$|The {{curriculum}} {{is designed to}} prepare students for professional careers in the arts. Each student concentrates in at least one major area: creative writing, dance, drama, music, stagecraft, and visual art. Younger <b>students</b> <b>often</b> concentrate in two or more. High school students are required to specialize and major only in the areas in which they have potential to do professional work. Advanced students study up to two hours each day in their major. Forty percent of the students stay at least two hours after school for rehearsals, private lessons, and productions.|$|E
50|$|Pyjamas Day: {{students}} {{wear their}} pyjamas. <b>Student</b> <b>often</b> get hot chocolate and cookies during lunch.|$|R
50|$|The {{student and}} {{instructor}} complete DIS Form and submit {{it to the}} Academic Coordinator who establishes the course in the registration system. The <b>student</b> <b>often</b> titles his/her own subject area.|$|R
40|$|This {{article has}} two purposes: {{to present a}} {{rationale}} for using quality literature with at-risk students and to present effective strategies with which to do so. Instruction for at-risk <b>students</b> is <b>often</b> inappropriate for two major reasons. First, at-risk <b>students</b> are <b>often</b> mistakenly assumed to be students with low abilities {{and low levels of}} experience. Second, the educational goals for at-risk <b>students</b> are <b>often</b> inappropriately low...|$|R
5|$|Business school rankings are {{important}} to the various business schools because they are an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such <b>students</b> <b>often</b> are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E
25|$|<b>Students</b> <b>often</b> go to Hersheypark {{and other}} attractions in Hershey, Lancaster or Harrisburg.|$|E
25|$|<b>Students</b> <b>often</b> {{prefer to}} keep the company of yogis (soul {{conscious}} individuals) as opposed to bhogis (those given over to worldly pleasures).|$|E
50|$|More {{recently}} the University received military students from Canada, the Congo, Morocco, Tunisia and Rwanda, thanks to military cooperation, training and development programs. However, these <b>student</b> <b>often</b> {{belong to the}} social elite of their home country.|$|R
50|$|Although Herzer {{considered}} {{himself to be}} a lesbian for some time in his life, he then identified as transsexual. His school records show that he was a problem <b>student,</b> <b>often</b> engaging in fights, using street drugs and consuming alcohol.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} likely pathway for {{students}} transferring from community colleges, usually to a four-year public university within their state. About half of public universities recalculate a transfer applicant's GPA when deciding whether to admit the <b>student.</b> <b>Often</b> large public universities are well-suited to absorb many transfer applicants.|$|R
25|$|Within months, 15,000 <b>students,</b> <b>often</b> Afghan refugees, from {{religious}} schools or madrasas – one source calls them Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-run madrasas – in Pakistan joined the group.|$|E
25|$|Thornlea <b>students</b> <b>often</b> {{play key}} {{roles in the}} social activist life of Thornhill, and have, in the past, helped {{organize}} the Terry Fox Run, {{as well as the}} Walk Against Male Violence.|$|E
25|$|Graduates of China's {{primary and}} {{secondary}} schools test highly in both basic skills and critical thinking skills; however, due to poor health, rural <b>students</b> <b>often</b> drop out or lag in achievement.|$|E
40|$|This {{site from}} SERC's Starting Point {{explains}} that active {{learning is a}} student centered approach in which the responsibility for learning is placed upon the <b>student,</b> <b>often</b> working in collaboration with classmates. Links to examples of Active Learning techniques are included on the site. Educational levels: Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division...|$|R
50|$|Planning for {{the future}} of the {{individual}} <b>student</b> <b>often</b> requires a paradigm shift for everyone involved. With the IEP that is in effect the year the student turns 16, the IEPs often make a subtle change from overcoming deficits and approaching developmental norms to post secondary goals, transition plan activities and transition services that capitalize on the students’ strengths, needs, preferences, and interests.|$|R
50|$|The Association des etudiants {{centrale}} Nantes is the <b>Student</b> Association <b>often</b> called BDE (Bureau Des Eleves).|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Nobel Prize winners for Physiology and biochemistry, other important research projects have been conducted by the University and CBS. Being a research based college, faculty and <b>students</b> <b>often</b> take advantage of plentiful opportunities to research a variety of topics.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another option}} is Farm Hall, located at the University Farm. Only a handful of <b>students,</b> <b>often</b> majors in {{agricultural}} science, live here each year. Their work on the farm helps them gain useful first-hand experience, as well as help pay for room and board.|$|E
25|$|Many {{schools do}} not allow chewing gum because <b>students</b> <b>often</b> dispose of it inappropriately (leaving it under desks and chairs, behind vending machines, etc.). The chewing may also pose a {{distraction}} to class, and the gum might carry diseases or bacteria from other students.|$|E
50|$|The {{only child}} in the Hoschedé-Monet {{household}} to become interested in art, Blanche began painting {{at the age of}} eleven and developed a fond relationship with Claude Monet. She visited his studio as well as Édouard Manet's. By the time she was 17 years old, she was Monet's assistant and only <b>student,</b> <b>often</b> painting en plein air alongside him, painting the same subject with the same colors.|$|R
50|$|Teachers {{facilitate}} <b>student</b> learning, <b>often</b> in {{a school}} or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors.|$|R
25|$|<b>Students</b> in America <b>often</b> {{begin to}} pursue the study of bassoon {{performance}} and technique in the middle years of their music education. <b>Students</b> are <b>often</b> provided with a school instrument and encouraged to pursue lessons with private instructors. Students typically receive instruction in proper posture, hand position, embouchure, tone production, and reed making.|$|R
25|$|In {{places where}} a {{particular}} set is not locally entrenched, e.g., Europe and the United States, instruction is now mostly simplified, as the economic importance of mainland China increases, and {{also because of the}} availability of textbooks printed in mainland China. Teachers of international <b>students</b> <b>often</b> recommend learning both systems.|$|E
25|$|The city of Tilburg hosts many festivals, such as Incubate, Festival Mundial (world culture), Stranger Than Paranoia (jazz), Tilburg Students Festival, and Roadburn Festival. 013 is {{a modern}} pop-centre. Paradox is a club for {{experimental}} jazz and improvised music. Fontys University of Applied Sciences started a pop academy {{in the beginning of}} the 21st century, and <b>students</b> <b>often</b> perform on local stages.|$|E
25|$|Westgate {{was first}} {{established}} to provide student {{housing for the}} large numbers of veterans returning to study after World War II. The demand for housing was unprecedented both in quantity as well as in quality; <b>students</b> <b>often</b> were married and many had children to care for. A temporary community persisted for over a decade before {{the decision was made to}} create more-permanent housing for married students.|$|E
50|$|Third party {{involvement}} such as {{non-governmental organizations}} (NGO’s), or <b>student</b> groups, <b>often</b> forms {{an essential part}} of a successful co-management.|$|R
5000|$|Calamba Institute's <b>students</b> are <b>often</b> called [...] "CIER'S". The student {{publication}} of the school is also named after this pseudonym.|$|R
50|$|Transformative: Culturally {{relevant}} {{teaching is}} transformative because educators and their <b>students</b> must <b>often</b> defy educational traditions {{and the status}} quo.|$|R
25|$|Catholic Newman Club, {{founded in}} 1915, {{is the third}} oldest {{existing}} student organization on campus. The club {{works in conjunction with}} the Pittsburgh Oratory of Saint Philip Neri - which offers daily mass and confession times as well as perpetual Eucharistic adoration - and the Fellowship of Catholic University Students to provide events that offer students a deeper look into the Catholic faith. <b>Students</b> <b>often</b> engage in service opportunities with various charitable organizations.|$|E
25|$|According to Ibrahima Caba Bah, his {{children}} told stories that some evenings, after {{the extinction of}} the fires of the school reading, he used to bring together some of the <b>students,</b> <b>often</b> {{under the direction of}} Thierno Oumar Kaana, to make them recite his poems from one of his books (Maqaliida-As-Sa'aadati). He listened from his room standing under the orange tree in the courtyard, vaguely illuminated by the dying embers of the doudhal.|$|E
25|$|Testing or {{evaluation}} {{is important to}} martial artists of many disciplines who wish to determine their progression or own level of skill in specific contexts. <b>Students</b> <b>often</b> undergo periodic testing and grading by their own teacher in order to advance {{to a higher level}} of recognized achievement, such as a different belt color or title. The type of testing used varies from system to system but may include forms or sparring.|$|E
25|$|At school, {{he proved}} a lively {{but not always}} disciplined <b>student,</b> <b>often</b> {{receiving}} the scoldings of his father. The young man showed no talent for drawing, the very subject which the father had mastered. The father insisted then that Zanzotto take music lessons, since music was {{the passion of the}} town thanks to the fame of local soprano Toti Dal Monte (whom Zanzotto would recall at the being of his opera, Idioma).|$|R
40|$|Barely {{three-quarters of}} all high school {{students}} are graduating from high school in the United States. This has summoned a call for culturally responsive teaching! Included in an examination of the development of cultural awareness into state driven curriculums is the look at how leaders in education can foster success for a culture that often goes unnoticed: the culture of the learning disabled! The learning disabled <b>student</b> <b>often</b> goes undetected after years of struggling to learn, including frustration with state adapted curriculum geared for students with average capabilities. Leaders in education MUST understand the process that allows learning disabled students to qualify for special education and develop strategies and techniques to address those <b>students</b> that <b>often</b> drop out of school {{because of a lack of}} culturally responsive teaching which incorporates attention to their unique needs...|$|R
40|$|During {{basic science}} courses, medical <b>students</b> are <b>often</b> {{required}} to explain complex scientific and medical information to faculty {{and to each}} other as they study and complete examinations. Later, as physicians, these <b>students</b> will <b>often</b> be in the position of explaining similar, complex information to patients. By practicing how to explain medically relevant basic science information to lay people (potential patients) early in their training, students may gain valuable skills and preparation for their future roles as physicians...|$|R
