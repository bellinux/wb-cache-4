40|$|Arts-science {{collaboration}} is gaining increasing attention in geography and other disciplines, {{in part due}} to its ability to 2 ̆ 7 do 2 ̆ 7 social, cultural and political work. This paper considers the work of <b>SiteWorks,</b> a series of projects initiated by Bundanon Trust - an Australian public company. <b>SiteWorks</b> involves arts practitioners, scientists, other scholars and local people creating works in response to the Bundanon site, on the Shoalhaven River, southeastern Australia. The paper draws on my experience as a <b>SiteWorks</b> participant, and poses two questions. What does this arts-science collaboration contribute {{to an understanding of the}} more-than-human world of this site? What are the methodological implications of the collaborative, embodied research methodology? The study finds that <b>SiteWorks</b> informs a politics of belonging. Understanding belonging has implications for thinking and action towards plant and animal life, and for the highly contested realms of human identity, indigeneity and migration. Unsettling fixed notions of belonging is essential for learning to live with the contingency presented by contemporary environmental change. Here I propose a 2 ̆ 7 passing-through place 2 ̆ 7; a place not permanently dwelt in but vital nonetheless. Secondly, the study finds that collaborative, embodied research methodology reveals and challenges our practices, invites new modes of investigation, and presents new questions and insights into place and practice. Embodied methods heighten awareness of the more-than-human world, presenting opportunity for more ethical co-existence. The academy is presently witnessing increasing attention to impact and non-traditional output. Despite ongoing challenges, collaborative, embodied research practice presents one avenue for attending to these imperatives...|$|E

Asking an audience about their own relationships with animals is a common and useful strategy in Animal Studies talks (especially those for a general public) because it can help resituate (rehome?) the abstract 2 ̆ 2 animal 2 ̆ 2 into more relatable terms. It also makes the effects of categorical thinking palpable: relatability wears thin and often falls apart across categorical divisions and between them, such as those animals named 2 ̆ 2 feral. 2 ̆ 2 The text of my talk follows from this first engagement with the audience about their own companions and then describes five propositions on ferals...|$|E

To bring costs within the original budget, Metropolitan Council members proposed measures such as eliminating the Mitchell Road station in Eden Prairie or decreasing the size of the Hopkins maintenance facility.|$|R

40|$|Discussing {{an urban}} walking event, “Moss-eye view”, {{held in the}} City of London {{as part of the}} This Is Not A Gateway festival (October 2010), this paper {{considers}} the ways in which cities may be understood from the view of more-than-human processes and incorporations. The walk explores how distinct insights emerge into ways of ‘becoming urban’ by attending to organisms, environments, and forms of <b>sitework</b> that are not typically foregrounded in the usual economies of the City of London. Moss incorporates the material effects of urban ecologies across time and space, and thus forms a process of bio-indication in the city, capturing pollutants and making resources available for other organisms. Mosses in the city might be studied as sentient, more-than-human exchangers of and participants in urban energies, and as in-between and peripheral organisms that connect up sites by working across material, affective, political, socionatural, and imaginative registers. It is argued that the “Moss-eye view” walking event is a form of research that opens up infra-urban practices for understanding cities through alternative associations and incorporations of urban life...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summaries}} {{the work}} undertaken to date, {{and provides a}} platform on which further site selection, training and fieldwork may be undertaken. The outline quantity of <b>sitework</b> is stated, based on a build up of likely time input required.

Currently, STATS 19 has yielded 11 potential study sites out of 997 accidents on the network over a 5 year period. While OTS data has limited coverage of the proposed study sites, it may be utilized at a later stage for operational matters. A proposed methodology of Conflict Study is detailed with further development required through the trialling process.

50|$|Design {{is a third}} theme. Many {{have written}} about {{high-rise}} design as {{a contributor to the}} decline of public housing, so there was a risk that the book would retread familiar ground here. Instead, Mr. Hunt digs into the historical records and unearths some gems tying the design of the Chicago buildings to the cost-cutting obsessions of Washington bureaucrats. Cost cutting first became a political football back in the 1930s when Senator Harry Byrd added construction cost limits to the original public housing statute. Nathan Strauss and John Taylor Egan are federal administrators who are portrayed as driving the design train and running the public housing program into the ground. Their obsession with cost-cutting led them to promote 50 units per acre as the ideal density, with site plans that emphasized long, narrow and tall buildings to minimize <b>sitework</b> cost. While the Corbusier modernism fad might have been a factor in the design decisions, a much more important factor was the construction cost limits imposed by the federal administrators of the public housing program. The public housing program train runs so far off the tracks that Mayor Richard J. Daley begs Congress {{to put an end to}} the cost-cutting so he can build normal Chicago communities with the federal program.|$|R

Element which precentage cost has the closest relationship with inflation is <b>sitework</b> for industrial building, structure for housing, thermal and moisture protection for office building. Element which per square meter cost has the closest relationship with inflation for industrial building is doors and windows, structure for housing, thermal and moisture protection for office building Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia : Banyaknya perubahan dalam biaya konstruksi bangunan akibat laju inflasi yang terjadi beberapa tahun terakhir ini, mendorong diperlukannya analisa hubungan antara biaya konstruksi bangunan dengan inflasi.
