25|$|What a book Melville has written! It {{gives me}} an idea of much greater power than his {{preceding}} ones. It hardly <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points.|$|E
25|$|The {{beauty and}} variety of tone, the {{impeccable}} mechanism, and the noble, architectonic conception were great pianism and great musicianship. It is not customary to compare the work of local artists favorably {{with that of the}} foreign-born great, but I cannot refrain from doing so in this case, because it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Kirkpatrick was playing the piano as it is not often played by anybody.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, {{but it does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R

500|$|McCudden, {{watching}} from 900meters (3,000feet), recalled: [...] "I saw him {{go into a}} fairly steep dive and so I continued to watch, and then saw the triplane hit the ground and disappear into a thousand fragments, for it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it literally went into powder." [...] There would be debate later whether Voss {{dropped out of the}} inverted triplane.|$|E
500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Battle of the Buffet" [...] is {{regarded}} as a historic moment in the rivalry between Manchester United and Arsenal. Ferguson in his autobiography reflected it as the point where his relationship with Wenger started to break down, and it was not until United's Champions League semi-final victory over Arsenal in 2009 that they were on talking terms. He added: [...] "It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> losing the game scrambled Arsène's brain." [...] When asked to recollect his version of events of [...] "Pizzagate", Wenger admitted his team's conduct was aggressive and said: [...] "I think on that day, [...] had not his best day and that brought a lot of frustration on." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> online {{copyright}} infringement is {{a legitimate}} problem, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when {{what you really need}} is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet." ...|$|R

500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gary Arnold, in the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "At any rate, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> what Eddie and the Cruisers {{aspired to}} do was {{certainly}} worth doing. The {{problem is that it}} finally lacks the storytelling resources to tell enough of an intriguing story about a musical mystery man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scotland {{denied the}} {{allegations}} at the trial. In London Cage {{he says he}} was [...] "greatly troubled[...] [...] by the constant focus on our supposed shortcomings at The Cage, for it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> these manufactured tales of cruelty toward our German prisoners were fast becoming the chief item of news, while the brutal fate of those fifty RAF officers was in danger of becoming old history." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{windows were}} {{installed}} in 1953 after lobbying from the Daughters of the Confederacy. The {{dean of the}} cathedral, the Very Rev. Gary Hall, stated that the Charleston church shooting was the catalyst for the planned removal, saying [...] "It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we couldn't, with credibility, address the race agenda {{if we were going}} to keep the windows in there." [...] In 2017, however, the windows remained in place. On September 6, 2017, workmen were removing them.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{believed}} that it was so clear that axiomatisation in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very much concerned with it. But in recent times I have seen to my surprise that so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory provide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the time had come for a critique."

2500|$|Senator Kerry, after 9/11... it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the country}} came {{together}} as I've {{never seen it}} come together since World War II. But some of {{that seems to have}} melted away. I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. But if you were elected president, or whoever is elected president, will you set a priority in trying to bring the nation back together? Or what would be your attitude on that? ...|$|E

2500|$|Former Southern Baptist Convention President W.A. Criswell (1969-1970) welcomed Roe v. Wade, {{saying that}} [...] ""I {{have always felt}} that it was only after a child was born and had a life {{separate}} from its mother that it became an individual person," [...] the redoubtable fundamentalist declared, [...] "and it has always, therefore, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{what is best for the}} mother and for the future should be allowed." [...] This was a common attitude among evangelicals at the time. Criswell would later reverse himself on his earlier position.|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{if he was going}} to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stieglitz {{turned the}} Camera Club's current {{newsletter}} into a magazine, Camera Notes, {{and was given}} full control over the new publication. Its first issue was published in July 1897. It was soon considered the finest photographic magazine in the world. Over {{the next four years}} Stieglitz used Camera Notes to champion his belief in photography as an art form by including articles on art and aesthetics next to prints by some of the leading American and European photographers. Critic Sadakichi Hartmann wrote [...] "it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> artistic photography, the Camera Club and Alfred Stieglitz were only three names for one and the same thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 18, 1851, The Whale was {{published}} in Britain in three volumes, and on November 14 Moby-Dick appeared in the United States as a single volume. In between these dates, on October 22, 1851, the Melvilles' second child, Stanwix, was born. On December 1 Hawthorne wrote a letter of appraisal to Duyckinck, prompted in part by his disagreement with the review in Literary World: [...] "What a book Melville has written! It gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones. It hardly <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Langewiesche, an {{aviation}} journalist, said: [...] "n {{the case of}} the Egyptians, they were following a completely different line of thinking. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they knew very well that their man, Batouti, had done this. They were pursuing a political agenda that was driven by the need to answer to their higher-ups in a very pyramidal, autocratic political structure. The word had been passed down from on high, probably from Mubarak himself, {{that there was no way}} that Batouti, the co-pilot, could have done this. For the accident investigators in Egypt, the game then became not pursuing the truth but backing the official line." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 35 years, Barry Jones, who was {{a member}} of both the Victorian and Federal Parliaments refused to comment {{publicly}} on Ryan's hanging. Mr Jones broke his silence in 2002 at the launch of Mike Richards' book, The Hanged Man. Mr Jones says he remains [...] "unsure" [...] of whether Ryan ever pulled the trigger. [...] "It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there was probably a reasonable doubt in the case," [...] he said. Mr Jones, also the former secretary of the Victorian Anti-Hanging Committee says he believes Ryan's hanging was an attempt by then Victorian Premier Henry Bolte, to push his law and order agenda.|$|E
