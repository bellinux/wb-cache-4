5000|$|Structurally <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> were {{introduced}} by Aleksandr Andronov and Lev Pontryagin in 1937 {{under the name}} [...] "syst√®mes grossiers", or rough systems. They announced a characterization of rough systems in the plane, the Andronov-Pontryagin criterion. In this case, structurally <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> are typical, they form an open dense set {{in the space of}} all systems endowed with appropriate topology. In higher dimensions, this is no longer true, indicating that typical dynamics can be very complex (cf strange attractor). An important class of structurally <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> in arbitrary dimensions is given by Anosov diffeomorphisms and flows.|$|R
5000|$|When Smale {{started to}} develop the theory of {{hyperbolic}} dynamical systems, he hoped that structurally <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> would be [...] "typical". This would have been consistent with the situation in low dimensions: dimension two for flows and dimension one for diffeomorphisms. However, he soon found examples of vector fields on higher-dimensional manifolds that cannot be made structurally stable by an arbitrarily small perturbation (such examples have been later constructed on manifolds of dimension three). This means that in higher dimensions, structurally <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> are not dense. In addition, a structurally <b>stable</b> <b>system</b> may have transversal homoclinic trajectories of hyperbolic saddle closed orbits and infinitely many periodic orbits, even though the phase space is compact. The closest higher-dimensional analogue of structurally <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> considered by Andronov and Pontryagin is given by the Morse-Smale systems.|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{games with}} partial {{cooperation}} cover a wider rank of real world situations than the classic model of cooperative games where every subset {{of a set}} of agents can form a coalition to execute the game. In this paper, the set of feasible coalitions which models the partial cooperation will be given by a union <b>stable</b> <b>system.</b> These systems contain, as particular cases, the communication situations and the permission structures, which are well-known both from a theoretical and applied point of view. Moreover, union <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> are a natural framework for many other economic situations that arise in practice and which can not be modelled by these subsystems. In this paper, the goal is to make clear that there exists a close relationship between the Myerson value and the so-called conference game which player set consists of the supports of the union <b>stable</b> <b>system.</b> For that, we first analyze the relation between the restricted game and the conference game to establish later which effects a union <b>stable</b> <b>system</b> has on certain desirable properties of these games.

40|$|Stability is a {{universal}} concept which we experience in our everyday lives. It plays {{a central role in}} the study of dynamical systems and is still the subject of intensive research by the control community. The question of finding the nearest <b>stable</b> <b>system</b> appears in system identification where one sometimes faces unstable models created from the perturbed data of a <b>stable</b> <b>system.</b> In many cases, solving the problem in the spectral space does not make sense due to the sensitivity of the poles of the system to perturbations. We thus investigate algorithms for finding a nearest <b>stable</b> <b>system</b> in the space of coefficients. Very few existing methods are available to solve the problem. This is due to the nonsmooth, nonconvex nature of the set of <b>stable</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, the methods that can solve the problem are not always able to actually guarantee that the solution will be stable. Our work contains the original description of two methods for matrices and two methods for polynomials which substantially expand the number of optimization methods available to the user for the resolution of the nearest <b>stable</b> <b>system.</b> These methods cover all the possible variations of the problem : for polynomials or for matrices, in continuous-time or in discrete-time, for real or complex data. We prove the convergence of the methods to a stationary point of the formulation.

We introduce and analyze accessible union <b>stable</b> <b>systems</b> where union stability reflects the communication network and accessibility describes the hierarchy. Particular cases of these new structures are the sets of connected coalitions in a communication graph, antimatroids (and therefore also sets of feasible coalitions in permission structures) and augmenting systems which have numerous applications in the literature.
