5|$|Since {{much of the}} {{criticism}} {{is the result of}} photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still of which can be seen on the right), <b>shot</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E

5|$|There {{were many}} ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were <b>shot</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on the border {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.|$|E
5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were <b>shot</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E
5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, {{and the lights}} go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally <b>shot</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Aslam and Khan confront {{one another}} as the police, having been alerted to Khan's {{location}} by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not <b>shot</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script; the scenes set around the Osbourne {{residence}} for instance, were all filmed at once, during two to three days, though during the episodes, the scenes took place in separate parts of the episode. Parts of the introduction scenes, where Danny's team break into Osbourne's house, was actually filmed on the Grid set. Parts of the sequence were originally filmed without sound; the sound would later be added during post production. The footage of the drowned immigrants found at the shore were <b>shot</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> second unit headed by producer Simon Crawford Collins on a pebbled courtyard in Kensington to double as a beach.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the populations}} of cheetah in India saw a drastic fall. The last {{physical}} evidence of the cheetah in India {{was thought to be}} three individuals, all <b>shot</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Maharajah of Surguja (a man also noted for holding a record for shooting 1,360 tigers), in 1947 in eastern Madhya Pradesh, but a female was sighted in Koriya district, present-day Chhattisgarh, in 1951. During the early 2000s, scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, proposed a plan to clone Asiatic cheetahs obtained from Iran. India asked Iran to transport one live pair to India, or, if that was not possible, allow them to collect sperm and eggs of the cheetah pair in Iran itself. However, Iran rejected both proposals.|$|E
