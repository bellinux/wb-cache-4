5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then <b>strode</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease as England faced a {{short burst}} of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over {{to see if he}} could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp <b>strode</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
25|$|In the 1975 Cricket World Cup Final against Australia, the West Indies {{were deep}} in trouble at 3/50 when Lloyd <b>strode</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease. He duly made 102 from 88 balls, the only limited overs {{international}} century of his career. With Rohan Kanhai he added 149 for the West Indies {{to win by}} 17 runs. Play ended at 8:40pm London time and was the longest days' play ever at Lords.|$|E

25|$|After Sigismund III {{was elected}} in 1587, Elizabeth's {{intelligence}} service gave notice that an ambassador was in transit and that the deputation was one of amity. On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade. To ensure Elizabeth would not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor was to report the arrangements made. Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, and kissed the Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour. Działyński then <b>strode</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre of the chamber without any forewarning {{of what he was}} about to say, and, instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated, he couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed and spoke as a herald. In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action.|$|E
500|$|In the Third Test at Headingley, Macartney became {{only the}} second batsman to score a century before lunch on {{the opening day of}} a Test. The match started poorly for Australia. English captain Arthur Carr won the toss and sent Australia in to bat after a {{thunderstorm}} on the previous day had turned the surface into a sticky wicket; Bardsley was then dismissed by the first ball for a golden duck. Macartney <b>strode</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease, surveyed the fielding positions and called down the wicket to the bowler Maurice Tate [...] "Let's have it!" [...] He nearly regretted his comment when he edged the ball to Carr at third slip from the fifth ball of the day. It was a difficult chance but the English skipper failed to hold the ball. Macartney was then on two. Within a few minutes, he had regained the initiative for the Australians.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examined aging effects by characterising one parameter of {{the gait}} cycle from treadmill walking. The minimum foot clearance (MFC) during the swing phase of gait {{is an essential}} event that reveals two things: 1) how the locomotor system achieves control over many degrees of freedom when performing this spatial end point trajectory task {{while at the same}} time being challenged by postural stability; 2) the risk associated with tripping over an unseen obstacle due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> performance of this task. Poor gait stability and tripping induced falls are contemporary issues related to elderly populations, where characterising MFC variability from one <b>stride</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next can provide important links between these issues...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 A {{distinct}} {{characteristic of}} legged locomotion is its periodic nature. This periodic motion, {{in the form}} of a periodic orbit, has been the target of many walking and running control strategies. The spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) has become a popular model of sagittal plane locomotion, exhibiting behavior characteristic of a variety of legged animals. In this work, a model predictive control scheme is developed for the rigid body SLIP <b>to</b> drive <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> a periodic orbit. This is accomplished by defining a Poincaré map from one <b>stride</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next and using numerical optimization each <b>stride</b> <b>to</b> select a leg touchdown angle that will best deliver <b>the</b> system <b>to</b> a desired fixed point of this map. The scheme is tested on both the point mass and rigid body SLIP models using parameter values that are characteristic of the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis. It is found <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> region of stability for both, as well as greatly improving <b>the</b> systems ability <b>to</b> recover from energy conservative perturbations...|$|R
