40|$|Abstract: Novel {{biodegradable}} elastic hydrogels, {{based on}} hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer blocks, were syn-thesized via the radical crosslinking reaction of diacrylates of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL). PEG and PCL diols were diacrylated with acryloyl chloride {{in the presence}} of triethylamine, with the reaction confirmed by FT-IR and 1 H-NMR measurements. The diacrylate polymers were used as building-blocks for the <b>syn-theses</b> of a series of hydrogels, with different block compositions, by simply varying the feed ratios and molecular weights of the block components. The swelling ratio of the hydrogels was controlled by the balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer blocks. Usually, the swelling ratio increases with increasing PEG content and decreasing block length within the network structure. The hydrogels exhibited negative thermo-sensitive swelling behavior due to the coexistence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer components in their network structure, and such thermo-responsive swelling/deswelling behavior could be repeated using a temperature cycle, without any sig-nificant change in the swelling ratio. In vitro degradation tests showed that degradation occurred over a 3 to 8 month period. Due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, elasticity and functionality, these hydrogels could be utilized in various biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering and drug delivery systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} major {{developments}} {{associated with the}} synthesis, properties, structure and applications of polymer-immobilised clusters of platinum, pal-ladium, iridium, rhodium, osmium and ruthenium, are presented. Special {{attention is paid to}} polymer analogous reactions with metal clusters and new directions involving the polymerisation and copolymerisation of cluster-con-taining monomers. Some specific features of fixing heterometallic clusters on polymers are examined and the more interesting application of PCNM in catal-ysis, and future developments in this direction, are discussed. Polymer-immobilised clusters of the noble metals (PCNM) are of great interest for at least two reasons; first, they are a new type of cata-lyst which can be used in many organic <b>syn-theses</b> * and second they can be widely used as a basis for the production of different polymeric materials with unusual properties. In addition polymer-immobilised clusters can act as a con-venient model of metal catalyst surfaces (3). Studying immobilised clusters can provide infor-mation about the structure of the catalyst sur-face, such as metal-substrate bond energies, the stereochemistry of the active centre and struc-tural transformations occurring during catalytic reactions, and also about the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. At least three fields of chemistry are linked by PCNM cluster co-ordination chemistry, poly-mer chemistry and catalysis. There are three major methods for the preparation of PCNM; these are the physical insertion of small metal particles into a polymer, chemical insertion and (co) polymerisation of cluster-containin...|$|R

40|$|M. A. Description of {{the topic}} and major sources The present study {{consists}} of a prosopographical examination of a major per-sonality {{at the turn of}} the 12 th- 13 th century, before and after the conquest of Constan-tinople by the knights o the Fourth Crusade (1204), based on the major contemporary and later Byzantine sources (Michael and Niketas the Choniatai, Theodore Skoutari-otes, Ephraim of Ainos, Chronicle of the Morea and Geoffrey of Villehardouin), as well as on the available secondary bibliography (specialised articles and major <b>syn-theses</b> by J. Hoffmann, K. Setton, M. Kordoses, R. Radić, A. Savvides, Aneta Ilieva, P. Niaves et alii). The codification of this material puts Sgouros’ career in the right perspective and helps solve various misinterpretations regarding his personality, aims and rôle vis-à-vis his contemporary events. Aims and methodology The existing bibliography refers to various aspects of Sgouros’ meteoric career, yet a complete and analytical study on this topic was still missing. The present dissertation’s aim is to fill this gap by providing a detailed biography of this important independent Greek lord (“archon”),whose activities span between c. 1200 and c. 1208. Moreover, this study also provides information on the family (“oikos”) of the Sgouroi as well as prosopographical data on Leon’s father, Theodore Sgouros –also a local lord in the north-eastern Peloponnese (the Morea) at the close of the 12 th century – as well as on his enigmatic brother, Gabriel Sgouros, who seems to have remained ‘phrouriarch’ of Nauplion after Leo’s violent end. Additionally, the dissertation tackles topographical/geographical issues re-garding Sgouros’ advance from the north-eastern Peloponnese to central Greece (“Hellas”), as far north as Thessaly’s capital, Larissa, also providing relevant maps and sketches/photographs. Moreover, it provides sigillographic evidence according to the only surviving lead seal (molybdōboullon) of Leon Sgouros, nowadays in the Athens Numismatic Museum. A brief sketch of Sgouros’ personality and activities A highly controversial figure, Leon Sgouros has been variably characterised an unscrupulous and ambitious local tyrant, but also a heroic adversary against the Latin onslaught and the last defender of medieval Hellenism at the time of the Fourth Crusade and the ensuing first fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders (1204). Although several of this compatriots had placed upon him their hopes for an effective resistance against the Western invaders of Greece, Sgouros would expend most of his energy combating his fellow Greeks, in the course of his desperate attempt to expand his territories northwards, reaching as far as Larissa, the capital of central Greece (Thessaly), only to be repulsed by the advancing latin conquerors of northern Greece at Thermopylai and seek shelter in the steep fortress of Akrocorinth (northeastern Mo-rea), where he was blockaded and besieged for almost four years), c. 1204 -c. 1208). He eventually perished fighting the Latins either leaping on horseback from the preci-pices of Akrokorinth, or defending his native Nauplion. Evolution of the present study Sgouros’ eventful career is here examined in the following sections: a. His origins, the social-political conditions of his time and the rôle of his family in this context. b. His prevalence in the north-eastern Peloponnese (c. 1200 - 1202 / 1203). c. His invasion of Attica and Boeotia (capture of Athens -except the Acropolis- and Thebes), as well as of Euboea (1203 - 1204). d. Arrival in Thessaly (Larissa); pact with ex-emperor Alexios III Angelos, stand in Thermopylae and withdrawal to Akrocorinth (1204) e. Long siege of Sgouros in Akrocorinth by the Latins and his legendary suicide on horseback from the fortress (1204 - 1208); the alternative version of his assassina-tion outside Nauplion. f. Evaluation of his personality according to the testimony provided by the primary sources as well as by modern scholars (negative criticisms, but also positive as-pects). Sgouros’ real contribution to the attempt for the survival of medieval Hel-lenism. g. The above sections roughly correspond to the chapters of the present dissertation...|$|R

40|$|Because of its {{interference}} {{with the formation of}} messenger ribonucleic acid, actinomycin D has come to be regarded as a general inhibitor of protein <b>syn-thesis.</b> Under certain conditions, however, the drug has the opposite net effect and appears to enhance protein synthesis.

40|$|Synthesis of {{reversible}} logic {{has become}} a very impor-tant research area. In recent years several algorithms – heuristic as well as exact ones – have been introduced in this area.

Thus, a <b>syn-thesis</b> methodology is proposed that determines for a given reversible function an equivalent circuit realization modulo output permutation.
