5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, ecology transitioned {{from a more}} {{descriptive}} form of natural history to a more analytical form of scientific natural history. Frederic Clements published the first American ecology book in 1905, presenting the idea of plant communities as a <b>superorganism.</b> This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' <b>superorganism</b> concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of seral development that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by Henry Gleason, who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates {{to the development of}} community associations.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, the {{sociologist}} Herbert Spencer saw {{society as}} a social organism and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist William Wheeler developed {{the concept of the}} ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term <b>superorganism</b> to describe such an entity. This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as Gregory Stock in his book Metaman and Joel de Rosnay to describe planetary {{society as a}} <b>superorganism.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{precursor}} {{of the concept}} is found in entomologist William Morton Wheeler's observation that seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism (1911). Wheeler saw this collaborative process at work in ants that acted like the cells of a single beast he called a <b>superorganism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Physicist and philosopher Peter Russell elaborates {{a similar}} view, and {{stresses}} the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging <b>superorganism.</b> This approach is most popular in New Age circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} the Earth is alive is found in {{philosophy}} and religion, but the first scientific discussion was by James Hutton. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a <b>superorganism</b> and that its proper study should be physiology. Although his views anticipated the Gaia hypothesis, proposed in the 1960s by scientist James Lovelock, his idea of a living Earth was forgotten in the intense reductionism of the 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|Eusocial insects like ants {{and honey}} bees are {{multicellular}} animals {{that live in}} colonies with a highly organized social structure. Colonies of some social insects may be deemed <b>superorganisms.</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryDecision {{making in}} <b>superorganisms</b> such as honey bee colonies often uses {{self-organizing}} behaviors, feedback loops {{that allow the}} colony to gather information from multiple individuals and achieve reliable and agile solutions. Honey bees use positive feedback from the waggle dance to allocate colony foraging effort. However, the use of negative feedback signals by <b>superorganisms</b> is poorly understood. I show that conspecific attacks at a food source lead {{to the production of}} stop signals, communication that was known to reduce waggle dancing and recruitment but lacked a clear natural trigger. Signalers preferentially targeted nestmates visiting the same food source, {{on the basis of its}} odor. During aggressive food competition, attack victims increased signal production by 43 fold. Foragers that attacked competitors or experienced no aggression did not alter signal production. Biting ambush predators also attack foragers at flowers. Simulated biting of foragers or exposure to bee alarm pheromone also elicited signaling (88 -fold and 14 -fold increases, respectively). This provides the first clear evidence of a negative feedback signal elicited by foraging peril to counteract the positive feedback of the waggle dance. As in intra- and intercellular communication, negative feedback may play an important, though currently underappreciated, role in self-organizing behaviors within <b>superorganisms...</b>|$|R
25|$|Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler (29 May 1880 – 8 May 1936) was a German {{historian}} and philosopher of history whose interests included mathematics, science, and art. He {{is best known}} for his book The Decline of the West (Der Untergang des Abendlandes), published in 1918 and 1922, covering all of world history. Spengler's model of history postulates that any culture is a <b>superorganism</b> with a limited and predictable lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Damer and David Deamer {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that cell membranes cannot be formed in salty seawater, and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a <b>superorganism</b> rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.|$|E

Hutton is considered the father of geology, but his idea of a living Earth was forgotten in the intense reductionism of the 19th century.

5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} bee species, honey bees have {{perennial}} colonies which persist year after year. Because of this {{high degree of}} sociality and permanence, honey bee colonies can be considered <b>superorganisms,</b> meaning that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called [...] "swarming".|$|R
2500|$|<b>Superorganisms</b> are {{important}} in cybernetics, particularly biocybernetics. [...] They exhibit a form of [...] "distributed intelligence", {{a system in which}} many individual agents with limited intelligence and information are able to pool resources to accomplish a goal beyond the capabilities of the individuals. Existence of such behavior in organisms has many implications for military and management applications, and is being actively researched.|$|R
25|$|Inspired by {{colonies of}} insects such as ants and bees, {{researchers}} are modeling {{the behavior of}} swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots {{can be considered as}} one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a <b>superorganism,</b> exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors. Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly.|$|E
500|$|The Clementsian <b>superorganism</b> {{theory was}} an overextended {{application}} of an idealistic form of holism. The term [...] "holism" [...] was coined in 1926 by Jan Christiaan Smuts, a South African general and polarizing historical figure who {{was inspired by}} Clements' <b>superorganism</b> concept. Around the same time, Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book Animal Ecology. Elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains, food cycles, and food size, and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. Alfred J. Lotka brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.|$|E

Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before losing its power when she was wounded in battle and receiving a blood transfusion. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega in order to end the alien invasion and save the human race.|$|E

50|$|This term {{may be used}} interchangeably with hive mind.

It is frequently associated {{with the concept of}} an entity that spreads among individuals and suppresses or subsumes their consciousness in the process of integrating them into its own collective consciousness. The concept of the group or hive mind is an intelligent version of real-life <b>superorganisms</b> such as an ant colony or beehive.|$|R
5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica.

2500|$|The term <b>superorganism</b> is {{used most}} often to {{describe}} a social unit of eusocial animals, where division of labour is highly specialised and where individuals {{are not able to}} survive by themselves for extended periods.

Superorganisms tend to exhibit homeostasis, power law scaling, persistent disequilibrium and emergent behaviours.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>superorganism</b> raises the {{question}} of what is to be considered an individual. Toby Tyrrell's critique of the Gaia hypothesis argues that Earth's climate system does not resemble an animal's physiological system. Planetary biospheres are not tightly regulated {{in the same way that}} animal bodies are: [...] "planets, unlike animals, are not products of evolution. Therefore we are entitled to be highly skeptical (or even outright dismissive) about whether to expect something akin to a [...] "superorganism"". He concludes that [...] "the <b>superorganism</b> analogy is unwarranted". However, as Gaia is another systemic level of integration in Nature, precisely has properties that cannot be inferred from their components.|$|E
5000|$|Ants form colonies {{that range}} in size from a few dozen predatory {{individuals}} living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called [...] "drones" [...] and one or more fertile females called [...] "queens". The colonies are described as <b>superorganisms</b> because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOrganisms {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} remarkable features of our living world. However, they have not yet received any accepted characterization within the framework of the evolutionary theory. The reasons for this contrast between the saliency of organisms in the biological landscape and their theoretical status are multiple and they are analyzed in the first part of this paper. Starting from this contrast, I argue for a theoretically grounded concept of organism within the framework of evolutionary theory itself. To this effect I argue that the theory of major transitions in evolution (Maynard Smith and Szathmáry 1995; Michod 1999) provides us with the theoretical basis for an understanding of the individuality of organisms and I propose a first characterization of organisms as evolutionary units structured by a division of reproductive labor among their parts. I also discuss {{one of the}} most important implications of this definition, namely that some colonial entities are to be counted as <b>superorganisms.</b> Finally, I show that though theoretically satisfying, this definition does not suffice in order fully to individuate the organisms and <b>superorganisms</b> in practice. To this end, physiology is needed, because it offers us some criteria for their individuation in ecological space. These criteria, however, are not immune to errors through misidentification and their shortcomings are discussed in the last section. In conclusion, I emphasize the positive implications of these criteria concerning the ecological significance of organisms...|$|R
