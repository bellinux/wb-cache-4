The same study found no difference in levels of functional impulsivity between groups, indicating that dysfunctional impulsivity was the version of impulsivity that led to substance abuse. This relationship with dysfunctional impulsivity has also been found in regards to cigarette smoking. Higher levels of dysfunctional impulsivity have been related to difficulty restraining oneself from smoking in inappropriate places, smoking without being aware of doing so, and overall craving for cigarettes. Dysfunctional impulsivity scores have also been found to be higher in heroin users and addicts overall when compared to non-drug abusing control groups.|$|E

50|$|Together {{with the}} systematizing {{quotient}}, the empathy quotient {{was developed by}} Simon Baron-Cohen and is used to test his empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory of autism.

This theory is consistent with the findings that individuals with autism score <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> on the systemizing quotient and lower scores on the empathizing quotient than the general population.

METHODS: We evaluated US {{images of a}} phantom made of degassed gelatin {{and each of the}} following four modified versions of a commercially available vascular puncture needle (18 G) : re-cut needle, dimple needle, rough-surface needle (rough over the sections of needle located 3 - 6 mm from the tip), and a needle with four side holes (side holes covered by the sheath). An unmodified commercially available puncture needle was used as a control.

5000|$|A {{considerable}} amount of studies have found gender differences in egocentrism (Smetana,J.G.&VillaLobos M., 2010). Kimberly A Schonert-Reichl’s (1994) study {{on the relationship between}} depressive symptomatology and adolescent egocentrism recruited 62 adolescents (30 males, 32 females) aged from 12 to 17. The study used Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) and the New Personal Fable Scale (NPFS) as measuring tools. The results revealed <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> obtained by females compared with males in the Transient Self subscale in IAS. [...] Transient Self, as defined by Elkind and Bowen in 1979, refers to impermanent image of self that is mainly relative to one-time behaviors and temporary appearance. Thus, adolescent females have a higher tendency to consider themselves to be different from others, and tend to be more self-conscious in situations that involve momentary embarrassments (e.g. going to a party with a bad haircut), than their male peers. Another study conducted by Goossens and Beyers (1992) using similar measuring instruments found that boys have stronger beliefs that they are unique, invulnerable and sometimes omnipotent, which are typical characteristics of personal fable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} is {{hormone replacement therapy}} or estrogen therapy. Women using hormone therapy {{for at least two}} years have increased blood flow to the hippocampus and temporal lobe as compared to those who did not undergo therapy. These areas of the brain are key to memory. Also, women who do not undergo therapy have been found to have less metabolic activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, while those with estrogen therapy did not show a significant metabolic change. This is important as declines in cerebral metabolism occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's, as mentioned in [...] "Causes". Women who had their uterus and ovaries removed for medical reasons and lost their gonadal hormones showed a decrease in short-term verbal (hippocampus) and working memories (pre-frontal cortex), yet with estrogen therapy the memory loss was prevented. [...] Furthermore, those who have undertaken estrogen therapy have shown <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> on verbal memory, verbal fluency, and visual memory tasks as compared to those who did not undergo treatment. It is widely found that this treatment must be administered near to the onset of menopause as opposed to several years postmenopause, when hormone therapy can have detrimental effects on cognition.|$|E
50|$|Critics of {{this view}} also assert {{that it is not}} {{consistent}} with known findings. For instance, they claim that ADHD is as frequent in Japan and China as in the US, yet in such societies (which supposedly favor child obedience and passivity) one would expect higher rates of ADHD if this theory were correct. However, this is also disputed on the grounds that more aggressively obedient societies may suppress 'symptoms' of rebellion or 'ADHD'. The style in which individuals of these nationalities interact in their home countries, which is typically much more reserved and serious than in the United States, seems to suggest this. However, there is no solid proof of this assertion. Additionally, rates of medical diagnoses in China cannot be a reliable indicator of ADHD prevalence, especially for such non-life-threatening disorders as ADHD, due to the large peasant population in that country who cannot easily seek the services of a trained child psychologist. Timimi's view has been seriously criticized by Russell Barkley and numerous experts in Child and Family Psychology Review (2005). In any case, {{it has been shown that}} Chinese and Indonesian clinicians give <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> for hyperactive-disruptive behaviors than did their Japanese and American colleagues when evaluating the same group of children. Significant differences in the prevalence of ADHD across different countries have been reported, however. Timimi himself cites a range of prevalence that goes from 0.5% to 26% as support for his theory.|$|E
40|$|Aim of the study: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine changes in {{psychological}} distress, such as depression and anxiety, and quality of life (QOL) during the perioperative period in maxillofacial cancer patients undergoing surgery. We also investigated the relationship between patient’s psychological distress and QOL. We hypothesized that perioperative psychological distress would affect QOL. Thus, maxillofacial cancer patients with lower psychological distress would experience better QOL compared with patients with higher psychological distress. Methods:The data were obtained in Dept. of Maxillofacial surgery, Clinical Hospital, Stip. The sample consisted of forty patients diagnosed with cancer in maxillofacial region. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General (FACT-G); and Head and Neck (FACT-H&N), as quality of life (QOL) surveys were administered preoperatively, after surgery, and 1 month after leaving the hospital. Results: Anxiety was highest pre-operation and depression was highest post-operation, but improvements in both were seen post-discharge. At the pre-operation time point, anxiety and depression low-score groups had <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> on Emotional well-being and Functional well-being. At the post-operation time point, anxiety and depression low-score groups had <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> on all QOL subscales.
