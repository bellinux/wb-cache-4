Local workers cleared roads, and about 1,100people assisted in various relief efforts. The Jamaican Red Cross provided about 40,000meals each day to residents who lost food during the floods. Repairing damaged roads and bridges cost about $4.3million. For at least one day, all schools and most businesses on the island were closed.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower <b>subsided</b> after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E

However, this criticism <b>subsided</b> once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have <b>subsided,</b> the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this <b>subsided.</b> Moore began to find success as an art critic {{with the publication of}} books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.|$|E

Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
