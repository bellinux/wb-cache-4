Pink salmon account for 69% of the total Russian salmon fisheries.

50|$|Common and harmless, draughtsboard {{sharks are}} often caught {{incidentally}} by trawl, rock lobster, and probably <b>set</b> <b>net</b> fisheries. It {{is likely that}} most captured sharks survive {{to be returned to}} the water alive, as this species can tolerate being out of water {{for an extended period of}} time. From 1988 to 1991, there was a New Zealand shark liver fishery and reported catches of draughtsboard sharks were 74 - 540 tons per year. After the fishery was discontinued, catches dropped to under five tons per year. Because its population seems healthy and free from significant threats, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Least Concern.|$|E
