In addition, total PCB levels were from four to seven times lower than the closer precedents for the area (18 – 26 years ago) indicating a progress in the environmental release and biota exposure of PCBs and posing an objective indicator of success of the present international elimination programme. Further, when compared with regional and global bioaccumulation patterns, PCBs congeners in Argentinean specimens appeared to occur in a decreasing tendency.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the {{intertidal}} seagrass macrobenthos at three geographically and ecologically disparate localities (in the north-east <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>south-west</b> Indian and south-west Pacific Oceans) possess similar relative species occurrence distributions and uniform species densities.

The two lower-latitude systems were particularly similar in all these respects. Although sharing the same subset of individual functional groups, however, the relative importance of members of that subset varied from locality to locality and even within a single locality, whilst still maintaining the same ranked relative functional-group occurrence distribution.

The hapuka Polyprion oxygeneios (Schneider & Foster) (Fig. 1) is an {{important}} deep-water commercial fish species, caught mainly off Australia, New Zealand, Juan Fernandez Archipelago off Chile, the Tristan da Cunha Group of the South Atlantic (Sepúlveda & Pequeño, 1986; May & Maxwell, 1986; Paulin et al., 1989; Paxton et al., 1989; Andrew et al., 1995) and incidentally caught off Chilean Patagonia (Nakamura et al., 1986). The distribution of P. oxygeneios is exclusively southern circum-global, intemperate-cold waters from 28 _ to 43 _ S (Paxton et al., 1989). Polyprion oxygeneios (Polyprionidae; Nelson, 1994) is mainly a demersal species with a depth range of 50 – 450 m, occurring over ‘rough’ ground from the central shelf to the upper slope (Paxton et al., 1989).

40|$|In 1999, the Norwegian {{fisheries}} authorities {{established a}} regulation {{for the protection}} of cold-water coral reefs, Lophelia pertusa, against damage from bottom trawling, including: prohibition of intentional destruction, precaution when fishing in the vicinity of known sites and, for certain locations, a total ban of bottom trawling. As of today, there are nine areas that have received a species protection and where bottom trawling is banned: Sula, Iverryggen, Røst, Tisler, Fjellknausene, Korallen, Træna, Breisunddjupet and Rauerfjorden (for geographical coordinates see Appendix 2). The present report is a response to a request from the Directorate of Fisheries to “evaluate areas for protection of coral reefs”. The request included three tasks: 1) Describe the distribution of reefs near by the protected sites on the background of new knowledge. The directorate will use the information to consider whether or not the present borders of the protected areas are appropriate. 2) Evaluate whether the nine specific sites are representative for the reefs along the coast and offshore. 3) Consider whether new sites can add to the total representativeness of protected reefs along the coast and offshore. In this report the representativity of larger known Lophelia sites has been evaluated based on a combination of growth form and geographical location. The aim was to create a network of protected coral areas that covers most of the different reef forms in each to four defined sub-coral provinces and seascapes along the Norwegian coastline. The reef forms are (example site) : 1) elongated or cigar-like (Træna), 2) drop-like to elongated, with or without signs of sea-bed erosion at the reef front facing the current (Breisunddjupet, Hola), 3) reef-complexes consisting of hundreds or thousands of coral domes growing close to each other or merged together (Sula), 4) single and circular of up to 50 m in height (Fugløya), 5) wall-reefs consist of colonies growing on steep walls or on overhangs in fjords (Straumsneset), 6) hillreefs grow in sloping terrain on the coast and in fjords, for example on sills of fjords (Stjernsund). A last category (7) refers to their function: connectivity or bridgehead that function as links between reefs in the Atlantic ocean and the Norwegian coast through the transport of larvae (Storneset). In addition we divided the Norwegian sea areas into three seascapes: 1) coast and the fjords, 2) continental shelf, 3) shelf brake including the slope. The Norwegian coast boarders three seas: the North Sea with Skagerrak, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. Although these regions are all influenced by the North-East Atlantic water, they have distinctive physical conditions that will, for instance, influence the connectivity between Lophelia in Norwegian waters and the reefs further <b>south-west</b> in the <b>Atlantic</b> ocean. Our hypothesis is that higher exposure of an area to the inflow of Atlantic water, the higher the connectivity among reefs in the Atlantic Ocean and Norwegian waters. This hypothesis and the general hydrographical situation are the basis for an identification of four Coral Subprovinces along the Norwegian coast and shelf: Skagerrak, Vestlandet, Midt-Norge and Nord-Norge. Within these sub-provinces, we suggest new sites that will add to the representativeness of protected reefs. We also suggest to close at least one site in each of the Coral Sub-provinces, against all fishing activities including long-line and gill-net fishing. Once the fishing impact is removed, it will allow the study of other impact factors, such as climate change and ocean acidification, which in turn will make it easier to interpret the results of reef monitoring in the future...|$|R

A total of 297 fish caught in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, contained 29 species of metazoan parasites. Univariate analysis on parasite popula-tions, {{as well as}} multivariate discriminant analysis, calculated for juvenile and adult fish sepa-rately, allowed {{the identification of the}} two stocks, one from Argentina and Uruguay and the other from Brazil, to be made. Southern samples were characterized by higher prevalences and abundance of larval endohelminths, whereas in the northern stock, gastrointestinal and ectopar-asitic species were common. Discriminant analyses on parasite infracommunities of Brazilian fish showed notable differences between juvenile and adult hosts; no such trend was observed in fish from Argentina and Uruguay, despite differences between juveniles and adults at the population level. Different oceanographic conditions and their influence on the distribution of parasites as well as of other hosts involved in their life cycles could be key factors for the differences observed among stocks of C. guatucupa. # 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: biological tags; Cynoscion guatucupa; south-west Atlantic; stocks...|$|E
40|$|Aim Pelagic seabirds exploit {{large areas}} of ocean when acting as central-place foragers during the {{breeding}} season, and ranges are even more extensive outside the breeding period. Spatial niche partitioning is known to occur among species that breed sympatrically, but is less apparent during the non-breeding period when there is increased potential for overlap among closely related species from neighbouring island groups. This applies to several species of prion, Pachyptila spp., in the Southern Ocean; although extremely abundant, their at-sea distribution was virtually unknown because they are difficult to distinguish while at sea. To understand spatial niche partitioning at large scales, we investigated the year-round distribution of thin-billed prions (Pachyptila belcheri) from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and Antarctic prions (Pachyptila desolata) from South Georgia.

40|$|In this study, we {{consider}} the influence of mesoscale oceanographic processes around the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) in the <b>South-west</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> during {{the period in which}} the commercial squid fishery for Illex argentinus operates. Spatially referenced fishery data and satellite-derived advanced very high resolu-tion radiometry (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data were examined using geographic informa-tion system (GIS) techniques. The distribution and relative abundance of I. argentinus in the Falkland Islands fishery was examined for the period 1989 – 96. Three consistent areas of high abundance were observed to the north-east (shelf-break region) and north-west (shelf region) of the islands, and close to the northern coast of East Falkland. Areas of high sea surface temperature gradients (thermal gradients) extracted from remotely sensed satellite images were used as an indicator of mesoscale oceanographic activity and compared with the location of the fishery. I. argentinus were found to be associated with areas of thermal gradients, commonly seen at the interface of Falkland Current and Patagonian shelf waters.

Two surveys were conducted: {{the first in}} 1997 (13 deployments) used a conventional 35 mm stills camera with a 200 J flash, whilst the second in 2000 (1 5 deployments) used low-light digital video cameras. The scavenging community responded rapidly {{to the arrival of}} bait on the sea floor and was dominated by stone crabs (Lithodidae) and toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Stone crabs took up residence around the bait until it was consumed, with a maximum number of 108 in the field of view after four hours.

Toothfish were the most frequently observed scavenging fish and were seen during all but one deployment, typically making brief visits (1 - 2 min) to the bait, but appeared startled by the flash in the 1997 survey. Labriform swimming (sculling with the pectoral fins) was the principal form of locomotion in toothfish (0. 22 body lengths (BL) sec-I), but they were capable of more rapid sub-carangiform (using caudal trunk and fin) motion (3 BL sec-I) when startled.

It is {{distributed}} over an area next to the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, where it is commonly the most abundant commercial finfish species. This fish migrates to the outer Falkland shelf and aggregates in dense schools to spawn in August-September in the south-western part of the islands. Feeding concentrations of Southern blue whiting are targeted by specialized surimi vessels until the following March. Southern blue whiting is also taken as an occasional bycatch by finfish trawlers. Fishery and biological information collected by scientific observers aboard commercial Spanish trawlers between 1988 and 2003 were analysed in relation to physical and environmental factors to establish the spatio-temporal pattern of the species.

40|$|Sedentary {{consumers}} play {{an important}} role on populations of prey and, hence, their patterns of abundance, distribution and coexistence on shores are important to evaluate their potential influence on ecosystem dynamics. Here, we aimed to describe their spatio-temporal distribution and abundance in relation to wave exposure in the intertidal rocky shores of the <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to provide a basis for further understanding of ecological processes in this system. The abundance and composition of the functional groups of sessile organisms and sedentary consumers were taken by sampling the intertidal of sheltered and moderately exposed shores during a period of one year. The sublittoral fringe of sheltered areas was dominated by macroalgae, while the low midlittoral was dominated by bare rock and barnacles. In contrast, filter-feeding animals prevailed at exposed shores, probably explaining the higher abundance of the predator Stramonita haemastoma at these locations. Limpets were more abundant at the midlittoral zone of all shores while sea urchins were exclusively found at the sublittoral fringe of moderately exposed shores, therefore, adding grazing pressure on these areas. The results showed patterns of coexistence, distribution and abundance of those organisms in this subtropical area, presumably as a result of wave action, competition and prey availability.

40|$|Two {{mesoscale}} net sampling {{surveys were}} conducted in the <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic</b> between 34 ° and 55 °S. The first survey was in the austral spring of 1990 and used both an RMT 8 net which was trawled obliquely down to 200 or 300 m and caught mainly macrozooplankton and a Bongo net which was deployed at the surface and sampled mesozooplankton. The second survey was in the austral spring of 1991 and used a Bongo net which was deployed obliquely down to 50 m and sampled mesozooplankton. This thesis considers the species composition and abundance of these samples and {{represents one of the}} first insights into the mesoscale biogeography of zooplankton communities in the <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> 155 species from 9 taxonomic groups were considered including euphausiids, hyperiid amphipods, chaetognaths, salps, siphonophores, and nektonic/planktonic fish. Multivariate analyses were used to highlight species assemblage distribution patterns and determine strongly correlated environmental variables. In the 1990 RMT 8 samples, species assemblages showed a distribution pattern related to the location of water masses, which was reflected in a combination of water mass and latitude being the most strongly correlated environmental variables. In the 1990 Bongo samples, a combination of seasurface temperature and latitude were most strongly correlated environmental variables and different species assemblages showed a pattern of being located in exclusive temperature ranges. The two sample sets did exhibit some common distribution patterns especially in the warm, sub-tropical waters to the north and the Falkland Shelf to the south. However, there were fundamental differences in the mid-latitudes regions, possibly reflecting the reduced ability of larvae to counteract expatriating forces when compared with adults. Further comparisons made between the 1990 and 1991 Bongo sample sets highlighted some of the causal factors behind distribution patterns. For instance, the precise definition of the boundary between sub-tropical and sub-Antarctic assemblages by the 17. 3 °C isotherm despite the multitude of expatriating phenomena suggested that many organisms were at the edge of their physiological limits in this region. In polar waters, distribution patterns were consistent but temperatures variable suggesting that advection rather than temperature tolerance was more influential. Further data from Montu (1977) and the Discovery Investigations was examined to add a seasonal dimension to the above patterns as well as providing an insight into the importance of population ecology on community distribution. Studies were concentrated on euphausiid species from which it was apparent that size structure and species dominance changed considerably with season. Estimates of the productivity of these species showed that weight-specific rates were comparable with more sub-tropical regions despite biomass levels being proportionally low. The use of satellite thermal images for predicting faunal distribution patterns was assessed with respect to future biogeographic analysis of this region. Images were a good predictor at the sub-tropical boundary but a poor predictor in other regions highlighting the fact that in situ net sampling methods still appear to be the most effective and reliable investigative tools for biogeographic analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, has a key {{position}} in the Southern Ocean food web by serving as direct link between primary producers and apex predators. The <b>south-west</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector of the Southern Ocean, {{where the majority of}} the krill population is located, is experiencing one of the most profound environmental changes worldwide. Up to now, we have only cursory information about krill's genomic plasticity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes induced by anthropogenic CO 2 emission. The genome of krill is not yet available due to its large size (about 48 Gbp). Here, we present two cDNA normalized libraries from whole krill and krill heads sampled in different seasons that were combined with two data sets of krill transcriptome projects, already published, to produce the first knowledgebase krill 'master' transcriptome. The new library produced 25 % more E. superba transcripts and now includes nearly all the enzymes involved in the primary oxidative metabolism (Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) as well as all genes involved in glycogenesis, glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acids β-oxidation. With these features, the 'master' transcriptome provides the most complete picture of metabolic pathways in Antarctic krill and will provide a major resource for future physiological and molecular studies. This will be particularly valuable for characterizing the molecular networks that respond to stressors caused by the anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and krill's capacity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean...|$|E
