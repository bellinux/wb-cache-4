When incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides, it {{is capable of}} differentiating between the two purine nucleobases by virtue of the fact that its fluorescence is largely quenched when it is base-paired to guanine, whereas base-pairing to adenine causes only a slight reduction of the fluorescence quantum yield.

40|$|Several pi-electron rich {{fluorescent}} aromatic compounds containing trimethylsilylethynyl functionality {{have been}} synthesized by employing Sonogashira coupling reaction {{and they were}} characterized fully by NMR (H- 1, C- 13) /IR spectroscopy. Incorporation of bulky trimethylsilylethynyl groups on the peripheral of the fluorophores prevents self-quenching of the initial intensity through pi-pi interaction and thereby maintains the spectroscopic stability in solution. These compounds showed fluorescence behavior in chloroform solution and were used as selective fluorescence sensors {{for the detection of}} electron deficient nitroaromatics. All these fluorophores showed the largest quenching response with high selectivity for nitroaromatics among the various electron deficient aromatic compounds tested. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence titration profile of 9, 10 -bis(trimethylsilylethynyl) anthracene with picric acid provided evidence that this particular fluorophore detects picric acid even at ppb level. A sharp visual detection of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene was observed upon subjecting 1, 3, 6, 8 -tetrakis (trimethylsilylethynyl) pyrene fluorophore to increasing quantities of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene in chloroform. Furthermore, thin film of the fluorophores was made by spin coating of a solution of 1. 0 x 10 (- 3) M in chloroform or dichloromethane on a quartz plate and was used for the detection of vapors of nitroaromatics at room temperature. The vapor-phase sensing experiments suggested that the sensing process is reproducible and quite selective for nitroaromatic compounds. <b>Selective</b> fluorescence <b>quenching</b> response including a sharp visual color change for nitroaromatics makes these fluorophores as promising fluorescence sensory materials for nitroaromatic compounds (NAC) with a detection limit of even ppb level as judged with picric acid...|$|R
40|$|Patients with end stage {{renal disease}} are {{dependent}} on dialysis. In most outpatient centers, the dialysate is prepared with a fixed electrolyte concentration without {{taking into account the}} inter-individual differences of essential electrolytes (sodium, potassium and calcium). This one-size fits all approach can lead to acute and chronic cardiovascular complications in dialysis patients. On-line monitoring of these essential electrolytes is an important physiological step towards patient specific dialysate leading to individualized treatment. Currently, changes in electrolyte concentrations are indirectly measured by conductivity measurements, which are not ion- specific. In this paper, we present a novel optical sensor for on-line monitoring of sodium concentrations in dialysate. This sensor is ion-specific and can detect up to a single ion. The working principle is based on the <b>selective</b> fluorescence <b>quenching</b> of photo-induced electron transfer (PET) molecules. The PET molecules when complexed with sodium ions start fluorescing upon laser excitation. The emission intensity is directly correlated to the sodium concentration. To prove the working principle, a micro-optofluidic device has been fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with integrated optical fibers for fluorescence light collection. The PET molecules are covalently grafted in the PDMS microchannel for continuous monitoring of the sodium dialysate concentrations. The experimental setup consists of a laser module (λ= 450 nm) operating at 4. 5 mW, a syringe pump to precisely control the sample flow and a spectrometer for fluorescence collection. The performance of the sensor has been evaluated for sodium ions ranging from 0 - 50 mM. A clear signal and good response time was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of luminescence decay experiments from proteins is typically modeled {{as a combination}} of independent first-order decay functions. However, Poisson noise in the photon counting experiment limits the ability of this approach to resolve decay components from separate lumiphores with similar lifetimes. To provide further differentiation, we incorporate time-resolved circular polarization of luminescence, an additional independent observable, into the analysis. In the simplest case, for example, each lumiphore's chirality {{is assumed to be}} time independent and is determined by the position of the lumiphore with respect to the surrounding chiral environment within the protein. In this paper, we describe the {{analysis of}} simultaneously recorded time-resolved luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence data to obtain improved temporal resolution. When combined with <b>selective</b> dynamic luminescence <b>quenching,</b> in a model system comprising a mixture of Tb/transferrin and Tb/conalbumin, we demonstrate resolution between two decay components with a lifetime difference of 7 % and a difference in emission anisotropy of 5 X 10 (- 2). Evidence for the improved discrimination is further demonstrated by the increase in curvature of the chi 2 surface that results from the additional information...|$|R
