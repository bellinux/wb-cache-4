Based on the data of storm <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the <b>study</b> area <b>in</b> the past 30 years, the return periods of 18 tide stations for storm surge are calculated separately.

According to the view of systematic point, this article quotes the result of vulnerability assessment which was done by the author in the previous research. Based on the hazard evaluation and vulnerability evaluation, risk assessment of storm <b>surges</b> <b>in</b> the <b>study</b> region is done, and the risk zoning map is drawn.

Despite a distinct cline in genetic variation from mainland populations to peripheral islands, the study populations were characterized by overall high genetic variation, in line with effective population sizes derived from single-sample estimators which were on average about 20 individuals.

Despite this, there is recent experimental evidence for adaptive brood sex ratio manipulation in birds. Parental care is a particularly likely candidate to affect the brood sex ratio because it can have strong direct effects on the fitness of both parents and their offspring. We investigate and make predictions of factors that can be important for adaptive brood sex ratio manipulation under different patterns of parental care. We encourage correlational studies based on sufficiently large datasets to ensure high statistical power, studies identifying and experimentally altering factors with sex-differential fitness effects that may cause brood sex ratio skew, and studies that experimentally manipulate brood sex ratio and investigate fitness effects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The recent <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> {{analysing}} spatial dependence {{in political}} science has gone hand-in-hand with increased attention paid to the choice of estimation technique. In comparison,specification choice has been relatively neglected,even though it leads to equally, if not more, serious inference problems. In this article four specification issues are analysed. It is argued that to avoid biased estimates of the spatial effects, researchers need to consider carefully how to model temporal dynamics, common trends and common shocks, {{as well as how}} to account for spatial clustering and unobserved spatial heterogeneity. The remaining two specification issues relate to the weighting matrix employed for the creation of spatial effects: whether it should be row-standardised and what functional form to choose for this matrix. The importance of these specification issues is demonstrated by replicating Hays ’ model of spatial dependence in international capital tax rate competition. Seemingly small changes to model specification have major impacts on the spatial effect estimates. It is recommended that spatial analysts develop their theories of spatial dependencies further to provide more guidance on the specification of the estimation model. In the absence of sufficiently developed theories, the robustness of results to specification changes needs to be demonstrated...|$|E

Nevertheless, most of these studies have focused on primates only, and little is known about other animal orders.

However, this may have been due to the experimental set-up, as many studies that use different set-ups report conflicting results within the same species. We therefore tested ravens' prosocial tendencies in a different set-up; i. e., we tested whether sub-adult ravens would transfer a token to a partner and, thereby, provide the partner with the opportunity to exchange a token for a reward. To control and test for effects of partner identity, we tested eight individuals both in a dyadic and in a group setting. Our results show that in general the ravens in our experiment did not show other-regarding preferences. However, some acts of helping did occur spontaneously. We discuss what could be the causes for those sporadic instances, and why in general prosocial tendencies were found to be almost lacking among the ravens in this set-up...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{has been}} a <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> linking genome {{structure}} and gene expression, with special focus on duplicated genes. Although initially duplicated from the same sequence, duplicated genes can diverge strongly over evolution and take on different functions or regulated expression. However, information on the function and expression of duplicated genes remains sparse. Identifying groups of duplicated genes in different genomes and characterizing their expression and function would therefore be {{of great interest to}} the research community. The ‘Duplicated Genes Database’ (DGD) was developed for this purpose. [br/] Methodology: Nine species were included in the DGD. For each species, BLAST analyses were conducted on peptide sequences corresponding to the genes mapped on a same chromosome. Groups of duplicated genes were defined based on these pairwise BLAST comparisons and the genomic location of the genes. For each group, Pearson correlations between gene expression data and semantic similarities between functional GO annotations were also computed when the relevant information was available. [br/] Conclusions: The Duplicated Gene Database provides a list of co-localised and duplicated genes for several species with the available gene co-expression level and semantic similarity value of functional annotation. Adding these data to the groups of duplicated genes provides biological information that can prove useful to gene expression analyses.

Different ways of calculating hormone levels and the importance of collecting data for specific a priori hy-potheses are explained.

The coupling of the silicon and carbon cycles through terrestrial and marine biological pumps, occlusion of carbon in phytoliths and chemical weathering of mineral silicates {{highlights the importance of}} understanding silicon fluxes. With more than half of terrestrial net primary productivity attributed to high silicon-accumulating plants, and a complex evolutionary history of plant silicon uptake capacity apparent, a better understanding of plant silicon function is essential to progress this field. All plants contain some silicon, which they use to defend against herbivores, alleviate the impacts of abiotic stresses and possibly substitute for roles normally filled by carbon. Plant silicon content ranges from 0. 1 % to more than 10 % of plant dry mass, and following plant death, some silicon dissolves, but larger discrete silica bodies (phytoliths) can persist, recording plant presence and silicon function.

Collectively, results of 32 field studies representing 24 countries across four continents indicate an antibody prevalence of 8. 01 % in pigeons and doves but only 0. 37 % of the total was associated with exposure to the same serotype as a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak occurring in poultry at the time.

The wide-ranging institutions seemingly beloved to middle-class citizens across the globe – be it marriage, the nuclear family, education, multinational employment, etc. – are reflected in media discourses and increasingly in scholarly work, highlighting the lifestyles of those who are relatively affluent inside and beyond academia. But whilst practices ranging from the celebration of Valentine’s Day in India to private clinics providing in vitro fertilization in Egypt, or from “eating out” in urban China to investing in an apartment in Istanbul may be seen as recognizable markers of a shared global middle-class culture, the topic of the middle class remains problematic in anthropology. Interestingly, while more and more communities and individuals around the world adopt the discourse and practices of being ‘middle-class’, anthropologists continue to struggle with work addressed both to class in general and to the middle class in particular. But if class has remained a contested notion for anthropologists and other social scientists (Waquant 1992, Kalb 2015), the ethnography of middle-class lifestyles is booming. Even where class per se is not acknowledged as the focus of analysis, a whole host of issues related to middle-class life are being explored. As such it seems appropriate to find some common denominators in the analysis of the middle class, especially where claims of being middle-class (or not) and aspirations of becoming middle-class are shared amongst those with whom we do research. Not only are terms of identification intimately linked to questions of identity, we can also learn a lot from looking more closely at what ethnographies of the middle class contribute to the wider analysis of social inequality around the world...|$|E

Nevertheless, video content analysis in public scenes remained a formidable challenge due to intrinsic difficulties such as severe inter-object occlusion in crowded scene and poor quality of recorded surveillance footage. Moreover, it is nontrivial to achieve robust detection of unusual events, which are rare, ambiguous, and easily confused with noise. This thesis proposes solutions for resolving ambiguous visual observations and overcoming unreliability of conventional activity analysis methods by exploiting multi-camera visual context and human feedback. The thesis first demonstrates the importance of learning visual context for establishing reliable reasoning on observed activity in a camera network. In the proposed approach, a new Cross Canonical Correlation Analysis (xCCA) is formulated to discover and quantify time delayed pairwise correlations of regional activities observed within and across multiple camera views. This thesis shows that learning time delayed pairwise activity correlations offers valuable contextual information for (1) spatial and temporal topology inference of a camera network, (2) robust person re-identification, and (3) accurate activity-based video temporal segmentation. Crucially, in contrast to conventional methods, the proposed approach does not rely on either intra-camera or inter-camera object tracking; it can thus be applied to low-quality surveillance videos featuring severe inter-object occlusions. Second, to detect global unusual event across multiple disjoint cameras, this thesis extends visual context learning from pairwise relationship to global time delayed dependency between regional activities. Specifically, a Time Delayed Probabilistic Graphical Model (TD-PGM) is proposed to model the multi-camera activities and their dependencies. Subtle global unusual events are detected and localised using the model as context-incoherent patterns across multiple camera views. In the model, different nodes represent activities in different decomposed re 3 gions from different camera views, and the directed links between nodes encoding time delayed dependencies between activities observed within and across camera views. In order to learn optimised time delayed dependencies in a TD-PGM, a novel two-stage structure learning approach is formulated by combining both constraint-based and scored-searching based structure learning methods. Third, to cope with visual context changes over time, this two-stage structure learning approach is extended to permit tractable incremental update of both TD-PGM parameters and its structure. As opposed to most existing studies that assume static model once learned, the proposed incremental learning allows a model to adapt itself to reflect {{the changes in the}} current visual context, such as subtle behaviour drift over time or removal/addition of cameras. Importantly, the incremental structure learning is achieved without either exhaustive search in a large graph structure space or storing all past observations in memory, making the proposed solution memory and time efficient. Forth, an active learning approach is presented to incorporate human feedback for on-line unusual event detection. Contrary to most existing unsupervised methods that perform passive mining for unusual events, the proposed approach automatically requests supervision for critical points to resolve ambiguities of interest, leading to more robust detection of subtle unusual events. The active learning strategy is formulated as a stream-based solution, i. e. it makes decision on-the-fly on whether to request label for each unlabelled sample observed in sequence. It selects adaptively two active learning criteria, namely likelihood criterion and uncertainty criterion to achieve (1) discovery of unknown event classes and (2) refinement of classification boundary. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated using videos captured from busy public scenes such as underground stations and traffic intersections...|$|E
30|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} musculoskeletal condition; its economic burden is very large {{and appears to be}} growing [1]. Persons seeking care for LBP constitute a substantial proportion of patients seen in primary care offices [2]. Although it is difficult to predict who among those with first episodes of LBP will develop recurrent or chronic symptoms, there has been a recent <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> the <b>study</b> of both clinical and biological markers of “potential chronicity”. Several authors have tried to characterize typical neuromuscular and kinematic patterns that distinguish the LBP patients from healthy participants. Changes in feedforward EMG (Electromyogram) activation [3, 4], changes in erector spinae muscle fatigue characteristics [5], changes in the control of force production and movement production as well as changes in lumbopelvic kinematics have all been described [6] as potential indicators of physiological adaptation to chronic LBP. Amongst the various physiological indicators of LBP, the flexion relaxation phenomenon (FRP) {{has been one of the}} most studied surface electromyographic (sEMG) responses.|$|R
40|$|Import tariff {{receipts}} {{represent an}} important share of government revenues {{in many developing}} countries and there has recently been a <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> empirical <b>studies</b> showing how evasion in this field is a pervasive phenomenon. In the case of import tariffs, the tax base is the product of quantity and unit value, both of which have to be reported and need to be assessed by the custom authority during an audit. I show that when the fiscal authority has an imperfect detection technology, there is an additional incentive for the taxpayer to underdeclare, as a greater declaration in one dimension actually increases the fine when evasion in the other dimension is detected, and a tax base presenting this feature is subject to more evasion compared to a tax base that can be assessed directly. Also, when enforcement capacity is low, voluntary compliance is higher when the importer is required to declare only the total value of import...|$|R
40|$|Resting {{and active}} motor {{thresholds}} versus stimulus–response curves to determine {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} intensity in quadriceps femoris John Temesi 1, Mathieu Gruet 2, 3, 5, Thomas Rupp 2, 3, Samuel Verges 2, 3 and Guillaume Y Millet 1, 3, 4 * Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely-used investigative technique in motor cortical evaluation. Recently, {{there has been a}} <b>surge</b> <b>in</b> TMS <b>studies</b> evaluating lower-limb fatigue. TMS intensity of 120 - 130 % resting motor threshold (RMT) and 120 % active motor threshold (AMT) and TMS intensity determined using stimulus–response curves during muscular contraction have been used <b>in</b> these <b>studies.</b> With the expansion of fatigue research in locomotion, the quadriceps femoris is increasingly of interest. It is important to select a stimulus intensity appropriate to evaluate the variables, including voluntary activation, being measured in this functionally important muscle group. This study assessed whether selected quadriceps TMS stimulus intensity determined by frequently employed methods is similar between methods and muscles. Methods: Stimulus intensity in vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and vastus medialis muscles was determined by RMT, AM...|$|R
