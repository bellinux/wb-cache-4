40|$|Basaltic lavas {{typically}} form channels or tubes, {{which are}} recognized on the Earth and Mars. Although largely unrecognized in the planetary community, terrestrial inflated sheet flows also display morphologies that share many commonalities with lava plains on Mars. The McCartys lava flow field {{is among the}} youngest (approx. 3000 yrs) basaltic flows in the continental United States. The southwest sections of the flow displays smooth, flat-topped plateaus with irregularly shaped pits and hummocky inter-plateau units that form a polygonal surface. Plateaus are typically elongate in map view, up to 20 m high and display lineations within the glassy crust. Lineated surfaces occasionally display small < 1 m diameter lava coils. Lineations are generally straight and parallel each other, sometimes for over 100 meters. The boundaries between plateaus and depressions are also lineated and tilted to angles sometimes approaching vertical. Plateau-parallel cracks, sometimes containing squeeze-ups, mark the boundary between tilted crust and plateau. Some plateau depressions display level floors with hummocky surfaces, while some are bowl shaped with floors covered in broken lava slabs. The lower walls of pits sometimes display lateral, sagged lava wedges. Infrequently, pit floors display the upper portion of a tumulus from an older flow. In some places the surface crust has been disrupted forming a slabby texture. Slabs are typically {{on the scale of}} a meter or less across and no less than 7 - 10 cm thick. The slabs preserve the lineated textures of the undisturbed plateau crust. It appears that this style of terrain represents the emplacement of an extensive sheet that experiences inflation episodes within preferred regions where lateral spreading of the sheet is inhibited, thereby forming plateaus. Rough surfaces represent inflation-related disruption of pahoehoe lava and not a a lava. Depressions are often the result of non-inflation and can be clearly identified by lateral <b>squeeze-outs</b> along the pit walls that form when the rising crust exposes the still liquid core of the sheet. The plains of Tharsis and Elysium, Mars, display many analogous feature...|$|R
40|$|Basaltic lavas {{typically}} form channels or tubes during flow emplacement. However, {{the importance}} of sheet flow {{in the development of}} basalt ic terrains received recognition over the last 15 years. George Walke r?s research on the 1859 Mauna Loa Flow was published posthumously in 2009. In this paper he discusses the concept of endogenous growth, or inflation, for the distal portion of this otherwise channeldominated lava flow. We used this work as a guide when visiting the 1859 flow to help us better interpret the inflation history of the McCartys flow field in NM. Both well preserved flows display similar clues about the process of inflation. The McCartys lava flow field is among the you ngest (approx. 3000 yrs) basaltic lava flows in the continental United States. It was emplaced over slopes of < 1 degree, which is similar to the location within the 1859 flow where inflation occurred. Although older than the 1859 flow, the McCartys is located in an arid environ ment and is among the most pristine examples of sheet flow morphologies. At the meter scale the flow surface typically forms smooth, undula ting swales that create a polygonal terrain. The literature for simil ar features includes multiple explanatory hypotheses, original breakouts from adjacent lobes, or inflation related upwarping of crust or sa gging along fractures that enable gas release. It is not clear which of these processes is responsible for polygonal terrains, and it is po ssible that one explanation is not the sole cause of this morphology between all inflated flows. Often, these smooth surfaces within an inflated sheet display lineated surfaces and occasional squeeze-ups alon g swale contacts. We interpret the lineations to preserve original fl ow direction and have begun mapping these orientations to better interpret the emplacement history. At the scale of 10 s to 100 s of meters t he flow comprises multiple topographic plateaus and depressions. Some depressions display level floors with surfaces as described above, while some are bowl shaped with floors covered in broken lava slabs. Th e boundaries between plateaus and depressions are also typically smoo th, grooved surfaces that have been tilted to angles sometimes approaching vertical. The upper margin of these tilted surfaces displays lar ge cracks, sometimes containing squeeze-ups. The bottom boundary with smooth floored depressions typically shows embayment by younger lavas. It appears that this style of terrain represents the emplacement of an extensive sheet that experiences inflation episodes within prefer red regions where lateral spreading of the sheet is inhibited, thereby forming plateaus. Depressions are often the result of non-inflation and can be clearly identified by lateral <b>squeeze-outs</b> along the pit walls that form when the rising crust exposes the still liquid core of the sheet.

At {{the end of the}} nineties, Constantin Film acquired majority stakes in the film production companies Olga Film GmbH, Engram Pictures and MOOVIE GmbH. In September 1999 the company then went public on the German stock market as Constantin Film AG. Deutsche Börse placed the Constantin Film share on the selection index Nemax 50 in March 2000. Constantin Film AG founded Rat Pack Filmproduktion GmbH {{over the next few years}} with producer Christian Becker and his team. The Swiss Highlight Communications AG (a strategy and finance holding with the operative segments of film and sports and event marketing) acquired 23 percent of the capital stock of Constantin Film AG from Kirch Beteiligungs GmbH und Co.

In 2003, the board of Constantin Film AG embarked on a new strategic path for the company: the traditional business areas of production and distribution were expanded to include the three areas of licence trading, home entertainment exploitation and increased TV service production (especially TV entertainment). Constantin Film AG also acquired 61 percent of the shares in KirchMedia Entertainment GmbH (now renamed Constantin Entertainment GmbH), one of the market leaders in German show and entertainment production.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{minority}} squeeze-outs and their regulation in Germany, a country where majority shareholders have extensively used this tool since its introduction in 2002. Using unique hand-collected data, the authors carry out the first detailed analysis of the German <b>squeeze-out</b> offers from the announcement to the outcome of post-deal litigation, examining also the determinants of the decision to <b>squeeze-out</b> minority investors. Design/methodology/approach: Using unique data on court rulings and compensations, the authors analyze a sample of 324 squeeze-outs of publicly listed companies from 2002 to 2011 to carry out the first detailed analysis of the <b>squeeze-out</b> procedure and the post-deal litigation. The authors employ the event study methodology to assess the stock market reaction around the announcement of the <b>squeeze-out.</b> Findings: Large firms with foreign large shareholders are the most likely to be delisted. Positive stock price performance increases the likelihood of a <b>squeeze-out,</b> but operating performance has the opposite effect. Stock prices react positively to <b>squeeze-out</b> announcements, in particular when the <b>squeeze-out</b> does not follow a previous takeover offer. Post-deal litigation is widespread: nearly all squeeze-outs are legally challenged by minority shareholders. Additional cash compensation is larger in appraisal procedures, but actions of avoidance are completed in less time. Overall, the evidence suggests that starting post-deal litigation by challenging the cash compensation offered in a <b>squeeze-out</b> delivers high returns for minority investors. Research limitations/implications: The lack of data concerning the identity of minority shareholders in firms undergoing a <b>squeeze-out</b> does not allow a proper investigation of the incentives of the different types of investors. Practical implications: The paper provides evidence about the incentives of the different players in a <b>squeeze-out</b> offer. The findings of the paper could be helpful in assessing the impact of the <b>squeeze-out</b> rule. The results also contribute to the understanding of minority investors’ incentives to start post-deal litigation. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence about post-deal litigation, in particular how investors use the procedures that the system provides them to protect themselves against controlling shareholders.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>squeeze-out</b> of thin liquid films between two solids {{is perhaps the}} most central topic in tribology. It is directly relevant for wear and indirectly involved in many other important processes, e. g., adhesion and friction. In this review we present a broad overview of the basic principles of <b>squeeze-out,</b> and present a number of applications to adhesion, friction and wear. We first describe the squeezing of 'thick' liquid films (thickness larger than ∼ 100 Å), which can be described using the Navier¿Stokes equations of hydrodynamics, and present experimental illustrations for soft solids (rubber) and hard solids (mica). Next we consider molecularly thin liquid films. Here the <b>squeeze-out</b> occurs in a quantized manner involving a monolayer at each step. We discuss the nature of the nucleation of n→ n- 1 monolayer <b>squeeze-out,</b> where n is the number of trapped monolayers. We consider in detail the nature of the spreading which follows the nucleation and show that the boundary line may exhibit instabilities. Sometimes the <b>squeeze-out</b> is incomplete, resulting in trapped islands. These islands may be pinned, or else they drift slowly to the periphery of the contact area where they get squeezed out through narrow liquid channels. We consider also dewetting at soft interfaces and present an application to the adhesion of soft objects on wet substrates. Finally, we present molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results on various aspects of <b>squeeze-out</b> for liquid-like and solid-like lubrication films, and discuss the implications for wear...|$|E

40|$|The {{expulsion}} {{dynamics of}} the last liquid monolayer of molecules confined between two surfaces has been analyzed by solving the two-dimensional (2 D) Navier-Stokes equation for a compressible liquid.
