This department was responsible for designing the <b>Swing</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> a new safety device in 2002, leading to several design awards. In 2004 a new era was started with the appointment of Suzie Wright as CEO. [...] As the company continued to grow Digga {{moved into a new}} manufacturing plant in 2005. The 8000sqm facility is situated in Yatala, Queensland. Mid 2007 saw the facility grow further with a 4500spm extension added with new material handling machines required. A major announcement in 2009 was the acquisition of Kanga Loaders [...] which was followed later that year by the launch of Digga Service and Spares and in 2010 by the acquisition of Universal Augers.|$|E

This latter which is affected by the measured oscillation, is calculated on-the-fly {{in order to reduce the}} swing phenomenon.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} problems {{found during}} third party commissioning of projects where humidity control was {{an indicator of}} significant problems. Project 1 was an 8000 square foot library. Problems found included air conditioning (A/C) and heating systems both running during the summer, A/C systems that ran most of the unoccupied period, and relative humidity that was over 90 % every night. Project 2 was a 1200 square foot meeting room. The outdoor air (OA) preconditioning system was found to operate in hot gas bypass mode with little humidity control capability. Project 3 was the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system on a 400 square foot library conference room with electric reheat for humidity control on a three-ton split system. The design was for a humidistat to call for cooling on high humidity. Reheat was energized as the space temperature dropped below the heating set point.

40|$|In this paper, we aim {{to realize}} {{compliant}} biped walking on uneven terrain with point feet. A <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is designed for a 5 -link planar biped walker. According to the role that each leg plays, the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is decomposed into two parts: the <b>swing</b> leg <b>control</b> and the support leg control. The trajectory of the swing foot is generated in real-time to regulate the walking speed. By considering the reaction torque of the swing leg's hip joint as disturbance, a sliding model controller is implemented at the support leg's hip joint to control the torso's posture angle. In {{order to make sure}} the landing foot does not rebound after impact, the vertical contact force control is set as the internal loop of the hip's height control. In simulation, the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is tested on a virtual 5 -link planar biped walker in Matlab.

Ah patients had a prosthesis with a knee joint with mechanical <b>swing</b> phase <b>control</b> (the Otto Beck 3 R 20) before entering the study. The amputees changed their knee joint to one with pneumatic <b>swing</b> phase <b>control</b> (the Tehlin knee joint) at random either after the first or second assessment. The amputees were asked for their preference at the second and third assessments. The energy expenditure while walking at speeds of 2 and 3 km/h was measured at each assessment. After having tried both knee joints, 19 patients preferred the Tehlin knee, 6 patients preferred the Otto Beck 3 R 20, and 3 patients had no preference. The energy expenditure measurement showed that walking with the Tehlin knee required more energy than walking with Otto Beck 3 R 20. Because of the limited number of patients included in the study and the fact that a double-blind design was impossible to achieve, conclusions should be drawn with caution...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{developing}} advanced control methods for two industrial systems in discrete-time aiming {{to enhance their}} performance in delivering the control objectives as well as considering the practical aspects. The first part addresses wind power dispatch into the electricity network using a battery energy storage system (BESS). To manage {{the amount of energy}} sold to the electricity market, a novel control scheme is developed based on discrete-time model predictive control (MPC) to ensure the optimal operation of the BESS in the presence of practical constraints. The control scheme follows a decision policy to sell more energy at peak demand times and store it at off-peaks in compliance with the Australian National Electricity Market rules. The performance of the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is assessed under different scenarios using actual wind farm and electricity price data in simulation environment. The second part considers the control of overhead crane systems for automatic operation. To achieve high-speed load transportation with high-precision and minimum load swings, a new modeling approach is developed based on independent joint control strategy which considers actuators as the main plant. The nonlinearities of overhead crane dynamics are treated as disturbances acting on each actuator. The resulting model enables us to estimate the unknown parameters of the system including coulomb friction constants. A novel load <b>swing</b> <b>control</b> is also designed based on passivity-based control to suppress load swings. Two discrete-time controllers are then developed based on MPC and state feedback control to track reference trajectories along with a feedforward control to compensate for disturbances using computed torque control and a novel disturbance observer. The practical results on an experimental overhead crane setup demonstrate the high performance of the designed <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> Comment: PhD Thesis, 230 page...|$|R
