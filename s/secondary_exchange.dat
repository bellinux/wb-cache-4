40|$|Objective To {{trace the}} growth of syringe {{exchange}} programs (SEPs) in the United States since 1994 – 95 and assess {{the current state of}} SEPs. Methods Annual surveys of US SEPs known to North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN). Surveys mailed to executive directors with follow-up interviews by telephone and/or e-mail. Response rates have varied between 70 % and 88 % since surveys were initiated in 1996. Results The numbers of programs known to NASEN have increased from 68 in 1994 – 95 to 186 in 2007. Among programs participating in the survey, numbers of syringes exchanged have increased from 8. 0 million per year to 29. 5 million per year, total annual budgets have increased from $ 6. 3 to $ 19. 6 million and public funding (from state and local governments) has increased from $ 3. 9 to $ 14. 4 million. In 2007, 89 % of programs permitted <b>secondary</b> <b>exchange</b> and 76 % encouraged it. Condoms, referrals to substance abuse treatment, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) counseling and testing and naloxone for overdose were among the most commonly provided services in addition to basic syringe exchange. Each of these services was provided by 40 % or more of SEPs in 2007. Conclusions While syringe exchange has remained controversial in the United States, there has been very substantial growth in numbers of programs, syringes exchange and program budgets. Utilizing <b>secondary</b> <b>exchange</b> to reach large numbers of inject-ing drug users and utilizing SEPs as a new platform for providing health and social services beyond basic syringe exchange have been the two major organizational strategies in {{the growth of}} SEPs in the United States...|$|E

This is of intrest as a ferromagnetic semiconductor would allow for a great many applications {{in the field of}} spintronics. Neutron scattering experiments were undertaken to better understand the antiferromagnetic interactions in type AII 1 −x Mnx B VI semiconductors. These antiferromagnetic interactions, which compete with the ferromagnetic interactions, result in materials which are ferromagnetic, but only at very low temperatures. Inelastic neutron scattering was undertaken to determine the exchange constant in various materials while neutron diffraction was used to determine the distances involved in the exchange interaction. There appears to be an overall distance dependence in the materials, but high pressure studies undertaken show the functionality differers between the overall trend and the individual materials. The data taken is also analyzed to determine more distant interactions and <b>secondary</b> <b>exchange</b> interactions.

40|$|There {{are cases}} where the {{parallel}} (or <b>secondary)</b> <b>exchange</b> rate applies only to a few limited transactions. An example is the “switch pound” in the United Kingdom during September 1950 through April 1967. However, {{it is not unusual}} for dual or parallel markets (legal or otherwise) to account for the lion’s share of transactions with the official rate being little more than symbolic. The official rate typically diminishes in importance when the gap between the official and market-determined rate widens. To provide a sense of the comparative relevance of the dual or parallel market we proceed along two complimentary dimensions. First, we include a qualitative description in the country-specific chronologies of what transactions take place in the official market versus the secondary market. Second, we develop a quantitative measure of the potential size of the leakages into dual or parallel exchange markets. We classify episodes where there are dual/parallel markets into three tiers according to the level (in percent) of the parallel market premium: low (below 10 percent), moderate (10 percent or above but below 50), and high (50 percent and above). For the episodes of dual/parallel markets, we provide information about which category each episode falls in (by calculating the average premium for the duration of the episode).

The dye never entered seeds or inner dorsal pod strands connecting directly to seeds. Root feeding (early morning) of intact plants with 32 PO 4 or 3 H 2 O rapidly (20 min) labeled pod walls but not seeds, consistent with uptake through xylem.

40|$|Secondary syringe {{exchange}} (SSE) {{refers to the}} exchange of sterile syringes between injection drug users (IDUs). To date there has been limited examination of SSE {{in relation to the}} social networks of IDUs. This study aimed to identify characteristics of drug injecting networks associated with the receipt of syringes through SSE. Active IDUs were recruited from {{syringe exchange}} and methadone treatment programs in Montreal, Canada, between April 2004 and January 2005. Information on each participant and on their drug-injecting networks was elicited using a structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Subjects’ network characteristics were examined in relation to SSE using regression models with generalized estimating equations. Of 218 participants, 126 were SSE recipients with 186 IDUs in their injecting networks. The 92 non-recipients reported 188 network IDUs. Networks of SSE recipients and non-recipients were similar with regard to network size and demographics of network members. In multivariate analyses adjusted for age and gender, SSE recipients were more likely than non-recipients to self-report being HIV-positive (OR[*]=[*] 3. 56 [1. 54 – 8. 23]); require or provide help with injecting (OR[*]=[*] 3. 74 [2. 01 – 6. 95]); have a social network member who is a sexual partner (OR[*]=[*] 1. 90 [1. 11 – 3. 24]), who currently attends a syringe exchange or methadone program (OR[*]=[*] 2. 33 [1. 16 – 4. 70]), injects daily (OR[*]=[*] 1. 77 [1. 11 – 2. 84]), and shares syringes with the subject (OR[*]=[*] 2. 24 [1. 13 – 4. 46]).

40|$|Abstract Background Persons who inject drugs (PWID) {{are at an}} {{elevated}} risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In many high-income countries, needle and syringe exchange programs (NSP) {{have been associated with}} reductions in blood-borne infections. However, {{we do not have a}} good understanding of the effectiveness of NSP in low/middle-income and transitional-economy countries. Methods A systematic literature review based on PRISMA guidelines was utilized to collect primary study data on coverage of NSP programs and changes in HIV and HCV infection over time among PWID in low-and middle-income and transitional countries (LMICs). Included studies reported laboratory measures of either HIV or HCV and at least 50 % coverage of the local injecting population (through direct use or through <b>secondary</b> <b>exchange).</b> We also included national reports on newly reported HIV cases for countries that had national level data for PWID in conjunction with NSP scale-up and implementation. Results Studies of 11 NSPs with high-coverage from Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia, Iran, Lithuania, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam were included in the review. In five studies HIV prevalence decreased (range − 3 % to − 15 %) and in three studies HCV prevalence decreased (range − 4. 2 % to − 10. 2 %). In two studies HIV prevalence increased (range + 5. 6 % to + 14. 8 %). HCV incidence remained stable in one study. Of the four national reports of newly reported HIV cases, three reported decreases during NSP expansion, ranging from − 30 % to − 93. 3 %, while one national report documented an increase in cases (+ 37. 6 %). Estimated incidence among new injectors decreased in three studies, with reductions ranging from − 11 / 100 person years at risk to − 16 / 100 person years at risk. Conclusions While not fully consistent, the data generally support the effectiveness of NSP in reducing HIV and HCV infection in low/middle-income and transitional-economy countries. If high coverage is achieved, NSP appear to be as effective in LMICs as in high-income countries. Additional monitoring and evaluation research is needed for NSPs where reductions in HIV/HCV infection among PWID are not occurring in order to identify and correct contributing problems. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this chapter}} we {{consider}} classes of models {{that have been}} recently developed for quantitative finance that involve modelling a highly complex multivariate, multi-attribute stochastic process known as the Limit Order Book (LOB). The LOB is the primary data structure recorded each day intra-daily {{for the majority of}} assets on electronic exchanges around the world in which trading takes place. As such, it represents {{one of the most important}} fundamental structures to study from a stochastic process perspective if one wishes to characterize features of stochastic dynamics for price, volume, liquidity and other important attributes for a traded asset. In this paper we aim to adopt the model structure recently proposed by Panayi and Peters [2015], which develops a stochastic model framework for the LOB of a given asset and to explain how to perform calibration of this stochastic model to real observed LOB data for a range of different assets. One can consider this class of problems as truly a setting in which both the likelihood is intractable to evaluate pointwise, but trivial to simulate, and in addition the amount of data is massive. This is a true example of big-data application as for each day and for each asset one can have anywhere between 100, 000 - 500, 000 data vectors for the calibration of the models. The class of calibration techniques we will consider here involves a Bayesian Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) reformulation of the indirect inference framework developed un- der the multi-objective optimization formulation proposed recently by Panayi and Peters [2015]. To facilitate an equivalent comparison for the two frameworks, we also adopt a reformulation of the class of genetic stochastic search algorithms utilised by Panayi and Peters [2015], known as NGSA-II [Deb et al., 2002]. We adapt this widely utilised stochastic genetic search algorithm from the multi-objective optimization algorithm literature to allow it to be utilised as a mutation kernel in a class of Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers (SMC Sampler) algorithms in the ABC context. We begin with the problem and model formulation, then we discuss the estimation frameworks and finish with some real data simulation results for equity data from a highly utilised pan-European <b>secondary</b> <b>exchange</b> formerly known as Chi-X, before it was recently aquired by BATS to form BATS Chi-X Europe in 2014 ([URL]...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} into and characterise students’ experiences of learning from their having taken part in an international upper <b>secondary</b> <b>exchange</b> in an intercultural context. Focusing on educational and intercultural dimensions, the thesis contributes knowledge of the implications of increasing internationalization and student mobility in education. The study builds on audio-recorded qualitative, in-depth interviews with Swedes and Chileans who respectively sojourned in Chile and Sweden as upper secondary students. The analysis of the narratives draws on theories regarding qualification, socialization and subjectification - the three educational functions or processes identified by Biesta (2010) - and learning from experiences, particularly experiences of disjuncture leading to feelings of disturbed harmony and experiences from encounters and engagement with others (Jarvis, 2009; Biesta, 2010; Hansen, 2011).  As extracurricular activities with 'recreational' elements, upper secondary sojourns are often not taken into account by students' educational institutions. However, the results from this study show that sojourners experience transformative changes and extensive learning related to qualification, socialization and (particularly) subjectification. Furthermore, they perceive the as different, more holistic and complete than learning in other contexts. When leaving the familiarity and comfort in the home environment and engaging with the relative unfamiliarity of everyday activities in an international, intercultural the sojourners commonly confront perceived limitations and cross both physical (geographical) and conceptual boundaries. Such confrontations and crossing often lead to experiences of disjuncture and disturbed harmony. The complex processes of resolving difficulties, understanding and meaning making are sources to learning that infuse a sojourn with potential to foster learning as a 'bildungsreise’.  There are notable potentials for transformations of sojourners' views of both the other and themselves, involving increases in self-confidence, personal growth, connectedness and feelings of being qualified, capable and empowered, which promote synergistic developments in all three educational functions. Notably, the homestay, communicative situations and interpersonal interactions provide such situations of potent learning opportunities that boost personal growth. In sojourners' engagement and interest in the other, and willingness to consider other perspectives and modify one’s own there are apparent potentials for further developments of an intercultural and cosmopolitan attitude and outlook.  A major conclusion, based on the presented evidence, is that even short stays (potentially less costly than longer stays) provide extensive learning rooted in social and subjective transformations (in addition to their value for qualification per se) that may have benefits extending well beyond upper secondary school years. Furthermore, they may also have prolonged benefits for wider society through the enhanced understanding of others and other perspectives. Thus, they appear to have high educational value beyond recreational pleasure. ...|$|E
