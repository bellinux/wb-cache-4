40|$|Under the principal-agent relationship, {{there are}} two major factors that {{directly}} affect <b>subsidiary</b> strategy’s implementation and performance—enterprise groups’ internal interactive control and <b>subsidiary</b> managers’ strategic behavior. Prior research showed that the parent companies hope their <b>subsidiary</b> managers to be obedient and active, i. e. to keep a high degree of strategic identity and <b>subsidiary</b> initiative. We build and analyze a model to test the mediating role of strategic identity and <b>subsidiary</b> initiative based on data collected from Chinese groups. The results show that interactive control, strategic identity and <b>subsidiary</b> initiative all could improve <b>subsidiary</b> performance, furthermore, <b>subsidiary</b> initiative is a mediator between decision-making decentralization and <b>subsidiary</b> performance, and also a mediator between horizontal communication and <b>subsidiary</b> performance, the mediating role of strategic identity is not tested, but vertical communication can improve strategic identity. In the conclusions, we provide guidance on how parent companies to choose excellent <b>subsidiary</b> managers, and then how to develop a suite interactive control system...|$|R

Despite {{a growing body}} of {{research}} on the role of expatriates in <b>subsidiary</b> performance, the mechanisms through which expatriates affect <b>subsidiary</b> performance are still the subject of debate. Drawing on the resource dependence theory, we examine the indirect effect of expatriates on <b>subsidiary</b> performance via <b>subsidiary</b> autonomy based on a sample of Chinese multinational enterprises (MNEs). The findings show that an increase in expatriates reduces the level of <b>subsidiary</b> autonomy and thus negatively affects <b>subsidiary</b> performance. We also find that the institutional quality of host countries reinforces the negative impact of expatriates on <b>subsidiary</b> autonomy, but reduces the importance of the latter on <b>subsidiary</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper inductively derives a {{model that}} {{develops}} the concept of <b>subsidiary</b> embeddedness as the canvas within which <b>subsidiary</b> strategy can take place. Our model identifies three hierarchical levels of embeddedness: Operational embeddedness relates to the interlocking day-to-day relations. Capability embeddedness deals {{with the development of}} competitive capabilities for the multinational as a whole. Strategic embeddedness deals with <b>subsidiary</b> participation in the MNC strategy setting. We deem these three types of embeddedness as ways to develop <b>subsidiary</b> strategic alternatives. In as such, different types of <b>subsidiary</b> embeddedness imply different <b>subsidiary</b> roles. Embeddedness, as it was inductively derived from a revelatory case study, is not merely an outcome of the institutional setting, but a resource a <b>subsidiary</b> can manage by means of manipulating dependencies or exerting influence over the allocation of critical resources. A <b>subsidiary</b> can modify its embeddedness to change its strategic restraints. Therefore, the development of <b>subsidiary</b> embeddedness becomes an integral part of <b>subsidiary</b> strategy. Multinational management; subsidiary; strategy; organization;...|$|R
