40|$|Effects {{of organic}} matter {{management}} and <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> on the synchrony between soil N mineralization and crop N demand were studied in a field experiment. Four different levels {{of organic matter}} (OM) were applied to a crop rotation during 12 years by various applications of animal manure, straw incorporation and catch crop growing. A spring barley crop was grown to test {{the influence of the}} previous OM applications. <b>Soil</b> <b>loosening</b> with a row cultivator was carried out one, two or three times {{in the first part of}} the growth season to examine the potential for adjusting soil N mineralization by soil tillage in cropping systems with different OM input. Immediately before each of the soil loosenings and again after one, two and three weeks, plant biomass and soil were sampled from subplots. Soil receiving only mineral fertilizer without extra input of organic matter generally contained less nitrate than soil with annual supply of animal slurry, straw and catch crop material. <b>Soil</b> <b>loosening</b> raised the nitrate content compared with undisturbed soil. The maximum increase in soil nitrate after <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> was estimated to 27 kg NO 3 -N ha- 1 14 days after <b>soil</b> <b>loosening.</b> The <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> only had a minor influence on N and dry matter (DM) in the barley harvested at the same time as the soil sampling. 	The temporal pattern of both DM production and N uptake were more influenced by OM levels than by <b>soil</b> <b>loosening.</b> Barley grown on soil without extra OM input and with all N supplied with mineral fertilizer developed faster in the first part of the growth season than barley receiving part of its N input with slurry. However, the N uptake in dry matter was less affected causing higher N concentrations in DM on soil with extra annual OM inputs. At maturity, both grain DM yield and N uptake were highest at soil with the highest OM input. The <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> did not significantly influence barley dry matter yield but the total N uptake was slightly higher (5 kg N ha- 1) with only one <b>soil</b> <b>loosening.</b> It appears that application of OM as slurry, straw and catch crop had a pronounced influence on crop development and N availability but <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> did not significantly improve the synchrony between soil N mineralization and crop N demand. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} tillage systems (TS) on wheat quality traits {{including}} grain yield, thousand-kernels weight, hectoliter mass, flour extraction rate and flour rheological properties were evaluated. Five different TS were compared in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production on one experimental field (chernosem) {{located in the}} Baranya region, north-eastern Croatia from 1998 to 2001. Tillage systems included conventional tillage (CT), disc harrowing, fine till (DHF), <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> (SL) + disc harrowing (DH), disc harrowing, coarse till (DHC) and no-tillage (NT). The most stable grain yield was obtained by DHF and CT in all three experimental years. There was no striking regularity with regard to applied TS and hectoliter mass and thousand-kernels weight. The biggest difference of hectoliter mass was determined between CT and NT. TS had significant influence on the flour extraction rate in all three experimental years. The influence of TS on farinographic parameters was significant for all three experimental years for the quality number. Quality number was greater under CT than under other TS. Tillage effect on extensographic and amylographic parameters in the 3 -year average did not show statistically significant differences.

When {{the estate}} was redeveloped {{in the late}} 1970 s, the conversion from rice to sugarcane was accompanied by the adoption ofameliorative practices, including surface and subsurface drainage and the incorporation of gypsum into the topsoil. More recently, high rates of filtercake were incorporated when replanting.

The results showed that commercial rates of gypsum (5 or 10 t/ha) were beneficial only when excess sodium occurred in the topsoil. Filtercake improved yields by reducing sodicity (sodic soils) as well as improving water holding capacity and structural stability (sodic and non-sodic soils). Root studies showed that effective rooting depth associated with gypsum and filtercake remained shallow, indicating that these treatments were ineffective in dealing with subsoil limitations. Gypsum at higher rates than used commercially, although improving subsoil sodicity, failed to improve yields, thus demonstrating that excess sodium is not the only unfavourable factor in the subsoil. By contrast, good yield responses to deep ploughing were obtained in recent trials, suggesting that in the duplex <b>soils</b> <b>loosening</b> the hard consistency ofthe subsoil is at least as important as reducing sodicity...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was set up}} to investigate the effects of <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> on the drainage efficiency of a structurally unstable silty clay loam in Devon. Such soils are common to the Palaeozoic slates of South West England, and in many parts of Wales and Scotland. The dominance of the fine earth fraction these soils by silt sized particles and the associated low clay fractions (10 - 35 %) gives rise to weak structures that are unsuitable f or mole drainage. Six drains were laid with permeable fill at a 20 m spacing on a gently sloping site at Seale-Hayne College Farm. A year after installation half the site was loosened to a depth of 0. 4 m. The whole site was then cultivated and winter wheat sown. The study concentrated on the modification of the soil physical environment and water transmission routes following loosening operations for autumn re-wetting, the winter period and spring drying. Data collection involved the analysis of drainflow hydrographs and the measurement of soil water physical parameters. Results from an intensive twelve month monitoring period indicate that the modification of subsoil to improve drainage does not necessarily give the results expected. In this study {{it has been shown that}} loosening of an unstable silty clay loam did not enhance drainage, in fact the reverse was true which can have dire consequences in terms of trafficability and plant root growth. Loosening lead to an increased porosity which resulted in a greater, albeit temporary, retention of water within the disturbed zone. This means that loosened soils were wetter prior to a rainstorm and remained so for a longer period after rainfall. This response, in turn lead to significant reductions in soil shear strength, which has important implications for successful crop husbandry in the autumn and spring periods when field operations are necessary. Further work is required to assess the temporal persistence of <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> on soil physical conditions and crop responses...|$|E

40|$|An {{eighteen}} month {{field trial}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> on plant nutrition and pasture production. The field trial was conducted on an established (8 year old) mixed sward pasture. The soil type was a Templeton silt loam (yellow-grey earth) of low to medium fertility. Two layers were identified as likely to be restrictive to root growth (22 - 27 cm and 40 - 60 cm). The statistical design was a randomised block consisting of thirty-six plots (8 m x 8 m) in four replicates. The three cultivation treatments of nil cultivation, aeration (to 27 cm) and subsoiling (to 47 cm) were carried out on the 10 -Nov- 90 and 10 - 0 ct- 90 respectively. On 22 -Dec- 90 three fertiliser treatments were applied: nil fertiliser, phosphate only (30 kg P ha⁻¹) and phosphate (as above) plus sulphate fertiliser (30 kg S ha⁻¹). The pasture was harvested when plant height reached approximately 8 - 10 cm. Pasture production and macro nutrient concentration were determined for each pasture harvest. From 1 -Aug- 91 root length measurements were made at monthly intervals. Soil water content was measured at weekly intervals at six depths (20, 30, 35, 40, 50 and 70 cm) using Time-Domain-Reflectrometry. Soil bulk density and hydraulic conductivity were measured at two dates during the period of the trial. Although root pruning by the loosening implements was suspected to have slightly reduced pasture production from 7 -Nov- 90 to 22 -Apr- 91, <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> led to a significant (P< 0. 10) increase in pasture production of approximately 1, 300 kg DM ha⁻¹ over the second season (1991 / 1992) of the trial. Loosening by cultivation of the compacted soil layers significantly (P< 0. 10) reduced bulk density (11 % reduction) and significantly (p< 0. 10) increased porosity. Through the creation of soil physical conditions which were more favourable for root growth, <b>soil</b> <b>loosening</b> allowed the earlier onset of spring root growth, and root growth rates were 0. 06 mm cm⁻² d⁻¹ higher than in the nil cultivation treatment. Subsoil loosening created a more extensive pasture root system compared to the nil cultivation treatment. By 18 -Jan- 92 the subsoil loosened treatment had a significantly (P< 0. 10) larger root length (44 % higher) at the 30 - 60 cm depth than the nil cultivation treatment. The subsoiled treatment had a significantly (P< 0. 10) drier soil profile (0 - 70 cm) over the 1991 / 1992 season. This was considered to be due to higher soil drainage rates in late winter/early spring and a small increase in water use by the pasture. <b>Soil</b> <b>loosening</b> was found to result in a significant (P< 0. 10) increase (5 kg S ha⁻¹) in sulphur uptake by the pasture plants. The Templeton silt loam of the trial site was found to be deficient in sulphur, with particularly low concentrations (< 3 µg SO₄ ²⁻ g⁻¹) occurring in the top soil. The sulphate concentration was higher (10 µg SO₄ ²⁻ g⁻¹) in the lower soil depths (30 - 50 cm). The more extensive pasture root system at this depth in the loosened treatments therefore had greater access to this sulphur, and resulted in increased pasture uptake of sulphur and increased pasture production on the loosened treatments. Pasture grown on the loosened treatments tended to have higher concentrations of several macronutrients (S, Ca, Mg and Na) particularly during spring and mid-summer. The concentration of these four macronutrients in this Templeton silt loam were also found to increase below a depth of approximately 30 cm. The greater root lengths below 30 cm in the loosened treatments allowed the pasture roots greater access and consequently higher uptakes of these nutrients. In August 1991 a microplot trial was established in an attempt to establish accurately the nutrient uptake potential of roots present in the trial plots. Radioactive tracers (³²p and ³⁵S) were injected to three depths (25, 40, and 55 cm) in the soil profile. The 80 cm diameter microplots were harvested when pasture height reached approximately 8 cm. The pasture samples were then dissected, dried, ground and the tracer activity determined. The subsoiled treatment was found to have a higher cumulative ³⁵S percent recovery from the 55 cm injection depth, confirming the results of the main trial...|$|E
