5|$|In 1959, a <b>study</b> <b>contract</b> {{was awarded}} to Hawker Siddeley and Bristol for {{preliminary}} designs based on the slender delta concept, which developed as the HSA.1000 and Bristol 198. Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation.|$|E
25|$|The AAM-A-1 {{project began}} in 1946 with the {{awarding}} of a <b>study</b> <b>contract,</b> under the designation MX-799, to the Ryan Aeronautical Company {{for the development of}} a subsonic air-to-air missile, which would be used by interceptor aircraft for the destruction of enemy bombers. A contract for the development of the missile, designated AAM-A-1 Firebird, was awarded in 1947.|$|E
500|$|In December 1962, HSA {{dedicated}} {{its full}} effort to developing the RAF's single seat variant; Wood notes [...] {{the starting point}} for which was broadly similar to the proposal submissions for NBMR-3. On 18 February 1963, Julian Amery, the Minister of Aviation, confirmed that the project <b>study</b> <b>contract</b> had been placed; on 25 March, Amery announced that the BS100 had been selected as the powerplant to be used on the P.1154. At this point, the program was envisioned to involve the ordering of a total of 600 aircraft, 400 for the RAF and 200 for the Royal Navy. However, as HSA carried out further work on the detailed design phase of the programme, it was becoming clear that opinions on the internal equipment for the aircraft varied substantially between the two services.|$|E

50|$|The initial {{plans to}} upgrade the legacy Air Force Space Surveillance System were made in 2009. The USAF 850th Electronic Systems Group, Electronic Systems Center awarded three $30-million <b>study</b> <b>contracts</b> to Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon on 11 June 2009.|$|R
500|$|The 1982 Falklands War {{made clear}} the {{importance}} of airborne early warning and control {{and led to the}} development of the Sea King AEW2, which was succeeded by the Sea King ASaC7. This will be retired in the second half of 2018 and planning for its replacement was identified at an early stage as an integral part of the next-generation aircraft carrier. The programme became known as the [...] "Future Organic Airborne Early Warning" [...] (FOAEW), and contracts were placed with BAE / Northrop Grumman and Thales in April 2001. In April 2002, BAE and Northrop Grumman received a follow-on <b>study</b> <b>contract</b> for Phase II of the project, by then renamed Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control (MASC). The MASC assessment phase began in September 2005 and by May 2006 three study contracts were awarded for MASC platform and mission systems options: one to Lockheed Martin UK for a Merlin helicopter fitted with AEW mission systems, another to AgustaWestland to maintain the present Sea King ASaC7 and finally to Thales UK to upgrade the Sea King's mission systems.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1946 the USAAF {{began work}} on Project Mastiff, a nuclear armed air-to-surface drone or {{self-controlled}} air-to-surface missile. Northrop Corporation, Bell, and Republic Aviation were invited by the USAAF to submit proposals for Mastiff. Bell was awarded a feasibility <b>study</b> <b>contract</b> by the USAAF on 1 April 1946. Bell studied the feasibility of developing a subsonic [...] "pilot-less" [...] bomber carrying a substantial payload over a distance of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) {{program began}} in 1979. Full {{development}} of the black project followed, and was funded under the code name [...] "Aurora". After the evaluations of the companies' proposals, the ATB competition was narrowed to the Northrop/Boeing and Lockheed/Rockwell teams with each receiving a <b>study</b> <b>contract</b> for further work. Both teams used flying wing designs. The Northrop proposal was code named [...] "Senior Ice" [...] and the Lockheed proposal code named [...] "Senior Peg". [...] Northrop had prior experience developing the YB-35 and YB-49 flying wing aircraft. The Northrop design was larger while the Lockheed design included a small tail. In 1979, designer Hal Markarian produced a sketch of the aircraft, that bore considerable similarities to the final design. [...] The Air Force originally planned to procure 165 of the ATB bomber.|$|E
50|$|Construction was {{originally}} {{expected to begin}} by end of 2013 once feasibility <b>studies</b> <b>contracted</b> to German company ILF were complete.

2500|$|Although {{dramatic}} funding {{cuts for}} the GCV program in January 2014 put the very completion of the acquisition effort in jeopardy, funding remained for research on a hybrid-electric propulsion system. [...] The BAE GCV's hybrid-electric engine is more fuel efficient, has fewer moving parts, and has faster acceleration than ordinary engines. [...] While powering a vehicle concept that reached 70 tons proved impractical, its benefits of providing power for onboard electronics, silent overwatch, and short, stealthy movements are still promising. [...] BAE has pledged to support future Army developmental efforts with technologies from their GCV entry. On 18 July 2014, BAE Systems was awarded a $7.9 million <b>study</b> <b>contract</b> for technical, cost, and risk assessments to utilize the GCV TD phase integrated hybrid-electric propulsion and mobility subsystems Automotive Test Rig (ATR) and the hybrid-electric integrated propulsion subsystem (Hotbuck) for the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) effort.|$|E

But the poverty has radically changed the situation in his family, his father working as taxi driver and his mother, Ala Boboc, became unemployed. Valeriu Boboc graduated from [...] "Miguel de Cervantes" [...] High School Chişinău and attended International Relations Institute of Moldova for one year. He left university because he didn't have three thousand lei to pay the <b>study</b> <b>contract.</b> Looking {{to find a better}} paid work, he tried to leave for Russia, but failed. He worked at a car wash, a car service and then sold belts at market. In the same place was selling clothes Natalia, whom he married in 2007. Valeriu Boboc lived in an apartment in Bubuieci, with his wife, his child Dragoş (born July 30, 2007), his brother Marcel and parents. Some claim he was known at local city police stations as a passive addict and a hooligan.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda and NSU {{signed a}} <b>study</b> <b>contract</b> {{to develop the}} Wankel engine in 1961 and competed to bring the first Wankel-powered {{automobile}} to market. Although Mazda produced an experimental Wankel that year, NSU was first with a Wankel automobile for sale, the sporty NSU Spider in 1964; Mazda countered with a display of two- and four-rotor Wankel engines at that year's Tokyo Motor Show. In 1967, NSU began production of a Wankel-engined luxury car, the Ro 80. However, NSU had not produced reliable apex seals on the rotor, unlike Mazda and Curtiss-Wright. NSU had problems with apex seals' wear, poor shaft lubrication, and poor fuel economy, leading to frequent engine failures, not solved until 1972, which led to large warranty costs curtailing further NSU Wankel engine development. This premature release of the new Wankel engine gave a poor reputation for all makes and even when these issues were solved in the last engines produced by NSU {{in the second half}} of the '70s, sales did not recover. Audi, after the takeover of NSU, built in 1979 a new KKM 871 engine with side intake ports and 750 cc per chamber, [...] at 6,500 rpm, and 220 Nm at 3,500 rpm. The engine was installed in an Audi 100 hull named [...] "Audi 200", but was not mass-produced.|$|E
