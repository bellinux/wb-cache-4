500|$|OBAMA: Well, look, I find it amusing {{that those}} who helped to authorize and {{engineer}} the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield {{in the war against}} terrorism. (Cheers, applause.) ...|$|E
500|$|Tamworth started 2009–10 in good form, and by late September 2009 were {{occupying a}} {{play-off}} {{spot in the}} Conference Premier. Mills' team eventually finished in 16th place in a season of consolidation; this represented the second highest league placing in the club's history. He made the last appearance of his career aged 48 after starting Tamworth's 4–3 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United on 24 April 2010, before substituting himself for Des Lyttle in the 55th minute. This was his third appearance of the season. In the Conference Premier, Tamworth were playing against a number of clubs with Football League pedigrees, meaning {{they were not able}} to offer contracts as lucrative or long as many clubs. Mills complemented the competitiveness of his team in this division, saying: [...] "For a small club like us, it's great to be mixing with these teams. But, while we may be smaller, like last year, we will make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> capable of getting results." [...] Tamworth had a strong start in 2010–11; they were again in a play-off position by late September 2010, and by the time Mills had left the club they were 12th in the Conference Premier.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to apply a criticism similar to Nietzsche's criticism of Kant's [...] "thing in itself" [...] to qualia: Qualia are unobservable in others and unquantifiable in us. We cannot possibly be sure, when discussing individual qualia, that we are even discussing the same phenomena. Thus, any discussion of them is of indeterminate value, as descriptions of qualia are necessarily of indeterminate accuracy. Qualia {{can be compared to}} [...] "things in themselves" [...] in that they have no publicly demonstrable properties; this, along with the impossibility of being <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> communicating about the same qualia, makes them of indeterminate value and definition in any philosophy in which proof relies upon precise definition. On the other hand, qualia could be considered akin to Kantian phenomena since they are held to be seemings of appearances. Revonsuo, however, considers that, within neurophysiological inquiry, a definition {{at the level of the}} fields may become possible (just as we can define a television picture at the level of liquid crystal pixels).|$|E

2500|$|Having {{sought to}} find an a priori {{cognitive}} faculty corresponding to every empirical [...] one, Kant remarked that, {{in order to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not leaving the solid ground of perception, we often refer back from the empirical [...] abstract idea [...] to the latter [...] The temporary representative of the idea [...] thus called forth, and which is never fully adequate to it, he calls a 'schema,' in contradistinction to the complete image. He now maintains that, as such a schema stands between the empirical [...] idea [...] and the clear sensual perception, so also similar ones stand between the a priori perceptive faculty of the sensibility and the a priori thinking faculty of the pure understanding. To each category, accordingly, corresponds a special schema. But Kant overlooks the fact that, {{in the case of the}} empirically [...] acquired ideas , we refer back to the perception from which they have obtained their content, whereas the a priori ideas , which have as yet no content, come to the perception from within [...] in order to receive something from it. They have, therefore, nothing to which they can refer back, and the analogy [...] with the empirical [...] schema falls to the ground.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the speech}} Bannon invoked the Christian {{concept of the}} Church Militant. He claimed that World War I ushered in [...] "a new Dark Age" [...] that {{continued}} through World War II and which was only able to be overcome by [...] "the heroism of our people...really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists" [...] combined with the underlying principle of [...] "an enlightened form of capitalism" [...] that was [...] "eventually [...] to take back continental Europe and to beat back a barbaric [...] empire in the Far East." [...] Bannon {{went on to say}} [...] "I believe we've come partly off-track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years." [...] Bannon maintained that [...] "the West" [...] was successful due to a capitalism based on [...] "the underlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief." [...] Which was under threat from [...] "state-sponsored capitalism... you see in China and Russia.", from [...] "Ayn Rand or Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism", and from [...] "immense secularization of the West... the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration [...]" [...] Bannon held that the undermining of [...] "enlightened capitalism", and the loss of [...] "Judeo-Christian belief" [...] he held it was based on, were in dangerous decline right as [...] "we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism" [...] which includes Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Boko Haram [...] "and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war". Bannon called on Christian capitalists to examine the purpose of their wealth and if divine providence was calling on them [...] "to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth...and make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> reinvesting that back into positive things... bind together as partners with others in other countries" [...] which would better prepare the West at these [...] "the very beginning stages of a global conflict".|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing right. And {{yet what}} else can we do? Well, then, Ida, the die <b>is</b> cast, and <b>we</b> will call upon Mrs. Westmacott tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|Midwinter smiled. [...] "Nothing whatever," [...] he replied. [...] "But I couldn't <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to {{have the}} whole ship to {{ourselves}} till I got over the bulwark and looked about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hawk," [...] I {{said to him}} darkly, over a mystic and conspirator-like pot of ale, [...] "I want you, {{next time}} you take Professor Derrick out fishing"--here I glanced round, to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not overheard--"to upset him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a cruel and awkward fate to hit the reef again," [...] said Paul; [...] "and yet I cannot be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not running {{directly}} for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't feel at all <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{right in}} this arrangement," [...] Elspie had said; but Dan and Fergus, and Mrs Davidson and Jessie had thought otherwise, so she was overruled.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a large}} subject," [...] he said, [...] "and I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> of one mind. We {{will not}} discuss it. At any rate, I am very sorry for Berenice!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{tapes were}} not {{provided}} to the September 11 Commission, which used classified transcripts of interrogations of Zubaydah in writing its report. Philip D. Zelikow, the Executive Director of the Commission, stated, [...] "We believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> asked for such material and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not provided such material." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{that is all}} I want. And I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>that.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "I {{was pretty}} {{thorough}} {{in terms of}} going and seeing Matt and seeing what they had in mind; the actual guts of the show, {{what they were going}} to be about and that it was definitely something new...I wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to do something that was rugby league, that was different and that I just liked the feel of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a fine}} spirit, that," [...] the Bishop declared. [...] "I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{not all of us}} {{a little}} over-inclined towards compromises. The sapping away of {{conscience}} is so easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> quite repaid {{for giving}} up our dinner," [...] Selina remarked, with a {{backward}} {{glance at the}} young man. [...] "Oh, here you are at last, Mary. I didn't hear you come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} dishonest to be otherwise. There {{is one thing}} you will excuse, before I proceed to detail my plans and wishes: I must take {{occasion}} to examine this closet, {{in order to be}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> actually alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she said, looking {{round to}} make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> alone, [...] "I dread these {{meetings}} of the Council. I have always the feeling that something terrible will happen. I knew Lord Ronald very well, {{and his mother was}} one of my dearest friends. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he was perfectly innocent. And to-day he is in a madhouse. They say that he will never recover." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Ciara {{was in the}} {{recording}} studio with Dre & Vidal. She {{decided to take the}} beat back to Atlanta, Georgia. It took Ciara one week to complete the lyrics for the love song to Atlanta. She quoted, [...] "I didn't waste time and just write to any beat. If I don't like a beat, I won't work with it." [...] Also she recalled, [...] "I wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> actually talking about Atlanta".|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mind}} {{walking on the}} lower deck?" [...] she asked. [...] "I {{want to talk to}} you, and I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> {{disturbed}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{trouble with}} Us,' said he, 'is that We take such an infernally long time making <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> right that We don't go ahead when things happen. For instance, I {{ought to have}} gone ahead instead of pulling up when I hit that bicycle.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{different}} things {{look in a}} snow-storm!" [...] Dick said, as they stopped for breath and shelter under the lee of a wall. [...] "I don't know, Tom, but I am not quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going straight; I {{do not know what}} wall this is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In many ways, my dear Fischer," [...] he said, [...] "one sympathises {{with that}} speech of yours; {{but the truth}} is best, and it is to talk truths that we have met this evening. We are gaining no ground here. I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not losing." ...|$|E
60|$|So we lugged him {{on to his}} feet, {{gave him}} another prod, which sent him limping off; and on we went on our course, <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at last safe, for we had thrown the bloodhound {{altogether}} off our trail. For {{a mile or so}} we kept right away from our course, for fear that they should keep straight on, and, missing the scent, lead the dog across the trail, and so pick it up again; then we turned and made straight for the road.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three months, I should think,--or perhaps more. Of course Crawley {{would do}} all that he could to delay us, and I am not at all <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> in any very great hurry ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, our direct way," [...] Rupert said; [...] "but I was {{thinking}} it over {{while waiting for}} you. You see with the start we have got and good horses, we might have kept ahead of them for a day; but with one horse carrying double, {{there is no chance}} of us doing so for eighty miles. We must hide up somewhere to let the horses rest. They would make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to take ship, and would be certain to send on straight to Nantes, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> arrested when <b>we</b> arrive there.|$|R
6000|$|Lanfear felt {{bound to}} follow up her lead, whether she wished it or not. [...] "A good third of our lives here is passed in sleep. I'm not always <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> right in {{treating}} the mental--for certainly they are mental--experiences of that time as altogether trivial, or insignificant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honorary {{members have}} the right to attend all {{meetings}} of our society," [...] he pronounced. [...] "They can even speak, if invited to do so by the chairman for the day. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all of us very pleased indeed to welcome Mr. Dartrey and Mr. Tallente." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{received}} the doctor to-day in the drawing-room. To my amazement, he begged leave {{to speak with}} me in the garden. When I asked why, he answered: [...] "I don't want to have a listener at the door. Come out on the lawn, where we can be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> alone." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brendon replied, [...] "I can't {{remember}} now, {{but every}} day we had five different things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had to convey... but I do know that Jim Byrkit, and then Alex Manugian, the other writer, had to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all on point. So {{it was just a}} matter of getting that information out. ... Since there was no script, I had no idea how it ended. ... When I saw the movie, I'm like, 'Oh shit, this is awesome!' ... To be quite honest with you, I never really knew what was going on fully until I saw the movie done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they will. They {{have only}} got {{provisions}} {{enough to take}} them back to camp; and as, when they pull the wire in, they will find <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have gone, they will feel quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> drowned.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not so <b>sure</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> only saying {{yesterday}} {{that as you}} {{had been in the}} country a fortnight without coming to us, we did not think <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> at home when you did come." ...|$|R
