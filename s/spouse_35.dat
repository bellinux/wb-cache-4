40|$|Background: Psychosocial {{stressors}} and {{the quality}} of the support system are important factors in attempted suicide. This research has studied these stressors and the condition of the support system in suicide attempt cases in Karaj, Iran. Methods: This is a part of the Iranian section of the widest multisite study on suicide prevention (SUPRE-MISS) proposed and directed by the WHO in eight countries, including Iran. Here we present data obtained from 632 suicide attempters presenting in emergency centers over a period of ten months. Results: According to the time lapse from the stressor to the suicide attempt, proximal stressors are considered to be precipitating while distal stressors are considered to be perpetuating factors. Although, family conflicts were found to increase the risk of suicide one year after the conflict, conflicts with family (25 %) and <b>spouse</b> (<b>35</b> %) were the most frequent stressors one month before the attempt, acting as proximal factors. Conflict with spouse was more prominent for people who had been married less than seven years. Conflict with family was the most important stressors for 15 - 25 year-old attempters. Though it is not clear which areas of conflict are more crucial in a suicide attempt, especially considering gender differences, educational and financial problems were more prominent one year before the suicide attempt. The support system was more crucial for female attempters: Although they received more practical support than males, females complained more of deficiencies in support. Conclusions: The roles of different psychological stressors in attempted suicide vary according to the time lapse from the stressor until the suicide. Family and marital conflicts can be precipitating and perpetuating factors, while educational and financial problems appear to be perpetuating factors. Family is considered to be an important support system for a great number of attempted suicide cases, especially since it offers practical support. Support systems are crucial in preventive programs for suicide, especially among women...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} psychological {{morbidity and}} resilience, including the subjective burden of 76 caregivers of elderly cancer survivors utilizing a cross-sectional questionnaire. Participants were mainly elderly female <b>spouses,</b> sole-caregiving > <b>35</b> hours per week; 19. 1 % and 23. 6 % reported moderate or greater anxiety and depression, respectively. A significant regression model found depression, emotion-focused coping, and greater years since diagnosis as {{significant predictors of}} subjective caregiver burden. Thus, caregiving appears a dominant role for this group and the Brief Assessment Scale for Caregivers of the Medically Ill (BASC) {{appears to be an}} efficient screening tool for psychological morbidity in this under-supported group.

40|$|Participants were 40 {{persons from}} a group of 44 end-stage renal disease {{patients}} in southern Sweden who in 1985 received home hemodialysis under the auspices of a hospital renal unit, together with their <b>spouses</b> (n = <b>35).</b> At a 10 -year follow-up, 15 of the patients had died and 25 had survived. Univariate log rank tests of the influence of physical and demographic factors, the patient's dialysis-linked complaints and the burdens of the illness indicated the most important predictors of 10 -year survival to be the patient's age, severity of the illness, the patient's dialysis-linked complaints (notably that of itching), and the burdens of the patient's disease on the spouse (particularly burdens of a sexual character).

40|$|Background: Assault, {{though a}} major cause of maxillofacial {{injuries}} in the developed nations, has not been adequately investigated among Nigerian population. This study aimed to analyze the pattern of maxillofacial injuries caused by assault in our institution. Methods: A descriptive clinical survey of patients with assault-induced oral and maxillofacial injuries presenting to our maxillofacial surgery clinic/emergency ward was carried out. Demographic data and pattern of injuries obtained from patients′ record and department trauma database were analyzed. Results: 156 patients presented with oral and maxillofacial injuries between October 2009 and December 2010. Thirty-four cases were due to assault and male to female ratio was 1. 8 : 1. The mean age of the patients was 21. 4 ± 6. 26 years (age range 2 - 48 years). 23. 6 % (n= 8) of the injuries were due to domestic violence between <b>spouses</b> while <b>35.</b> 3 % (n= 12) resulted from fight. Students unrest and armed robbery attack accounted for six cases each (17. 7 %, n= 6), while there were two cases due to child battering. 64. 3 % (n= 22) of the injuries sustained involved soft tissues while 35. 7 % involved hard tissues. Contusion was the most common isolated soft tissue injury accounting for 56 % (n= 10) while dentoalveolar fracture was the most encountered hard tissue injury (62. 5 %, n= 16). Conclusion: There is need for preventive strategies to reduce the incidence of assault-induced maxillofacial injuries...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of psychological morbid-ity in HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women seeking an-tenatal care in Zimbabwe. Methods: Pregnant women were screened for psychological morbidity at the initial antenatal care visit using the 14 -item Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ) before voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT). The primary outcome measure was “cases, ” as determined by a SSQ score of ≥ 8. Demographic characteristics and HIV status were compared between cases and noncases to determine the risk factors for psychological morbidity. Results:Of the 437 par-ticipants, psychological morbidity was detected in 73 (17 %) women before undergoing VCT. Risk factors for psychological morbidity included having a <b>spouse</b> older than <b>35</b> years of age. HIV infection by itself was not {{a risk factor for}} psychological morbidity for women. Conclusions: There is a high burden of psychological morbidity among pregnant women in Zimbabwe. Mental health services should be integrated into antenatal care to improve psychological health for all women in Zimbabwe...|$|R
40|$|The Life and Health Status of Urban Elderly People in Beijing, China Background Population ageing has {{becoming}} an important development issue that requires urgent action. Health, {{economic and social}} issues of ageing are inextricably linked to the development process. Living arrangements are influenced {{by a variety of}} factors including health status, cultural traditions and social services and support. In turn, living arrangements affect life satisfaction, health and so on. Living alone or only with a spouse is increasingly becoming a trend in the developed countries. Methods Using deliberate sampling method, we selected a typical mixed community in the urban areas of Beijing. From November 10 to 18, 2001, using a questionnaire, we personally interviewed 90 % of the qualified subjects including men and women: 60 years or older, Chinese and living in the urban areas of Beijing for at least 3 years. The present living arrangement and preferred living arrangement were asked. The data on the selfreported chronic diseases were collected by a checklist for the presence of ten common chronic diseases. Information was also collected on the self-reported of limitations in 13 separate activity of daily living (ADL) items. The Chinese version of the Personal Interview SF- 36 and the standard methods to score the SF- 36 were used to measure the health of the elderly objectively. Results The population ageing is a fact in Beijing urban areas and seem to be at its early stage. Though living with a spouse and children was the most common living arrangement for the old persons, the rate of those living alone or only with a <b>spouse</b> reached <b>35.</b> 0 %. If the conditions allowed, there were 58. 4 % of the old people who preferred to live alone or only with a spouse. The general prevalence of chronic disease was 80. 8 %. And hypertension, osteoporosis and coronary heart diseases were the first three common chronic diseases and prevalence were 38. 0 %, 24. 0 % and 22. 6 % respectively. 48. 3 % of the old people can do all the ADL activities on their own easily, and there were 9. 4 %, 34. 4 % and 46. 5 % with personal care, gross mobility and range of motion limitations respectively. According to the SF- 36 test, the health of the old persons was quite good. The score on emotion, social activities and mental was better than that on physical aspects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAgeing {{is due to}} a {{progressive}} loss of the person's adaptation capability, whereas during this period environmental aggression increases. In the elderly, life events re-present a psychological traumatism that overwhelms the old person and related family, disrupting and fragilising homeostatic balance. A number of authors have suggested a possible link between life traumatisms and the dementia processes. The aim {{of this study is to}} reveal the presence of life traumatisms preceding the apparition of the dementia syndrome. Method. This is a retrospective and comparative work based on the PIXEL study on complaints and demands from the principle informal caregivers of Alzheimer patients. It includes 565 patients presenting the criterion of dementia as defined by the DSM IV, and questionnaires filled out by the principle caregivers. One item of the questionnaire referred to life events which could have played a part in the development of the disorder. In a second stage, the reported events were classified into 4 distinct categories: loss, repeated or prolonged stress, psychotraumatism and depression-inducing events. The statistics were produced using SAS and Stat 10 software. Student's test, ANOVA and chi 2 -test were used. RESULTS: 372 caregivers answered the first item (65 %); 76 of them believed there was no event while 296 related the disorder to one or several life events (79 % of responders, 52 % of the sample). These results confirm Persson and Clement's study which evidenced a higher frequency of stressing life events for subjects afflicted with dementia as compared with older people without any psychic disorder. Reported events and their respective frequency: spouse death (15. 39 %), parents' death (15 %), familial difficulty (10. 08 %), anaesthesia (8. 49 %), child's death (4. 42 %), somatic disturbance (4 %), depression (3. 89 %), retirement (3. 89 %), financial problems (2. 65 %), loneliness (2. 65 %), removal (1. 76 %), fall (1 %), alcohol (0. 8 %), traumatism (0. 53 %), <b>spouse</b> care (0. <b>35</b> %), leaving for home care, storm and caregiver change in life (0. 17 %). Regrouping the data: 82. 71 % of the answers can be connected to prolonged stress, 62. 85 % to real or symbolic loss, 39 % to a psychotraumatic event and finally, most of these events can potentially induce depression. DISCUSSION: Some of the events refer to difficulties concerning people close to the subject (death of a close relation, hospitalisation of husband or wife) in a period when the loss of autonomy or handicap means greater dependence on surrounding people. General anaesthesia is mentioned by 48 caregivers. In fact, this usually implies surgery, the presence of organic pathology or the need for hospitalisation, which we know has a destabilizing effect in the elderly. It is therefore not surprising that 23 answers mentioned somatic disorders (4 % of the sample). According to Leger, it's mostly a loss type event which is implied in the elderly. Such losses would induce a weakening of cognitive stimulation which could decompensate an infraclinical dementia or accelerate an emerging dementia process. Antecedents of depressive illness are considered as an element of risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease. Depression is spontaneously mentioned by 22 caregivers. We must add the many reported life events which are well known to induce depression in older people. Most of the events considered in this study are liable to provoke manic mood swings. Depression resulting from life events can be considered either as an affection occurring along with dementia or as the aggravating factor of an infraclinical process or, finally, as an additional factor of vulnerability. With older people, many events may constitute a trauma because of the proximity of death and because of their sudden onset (fall, hospitalisation, somatic illness). Several studies have pointed out that a particularly traumatic event could enhance the risk of dementia. Life events associated with chronic or repeated stress are characterized by their permanence or their repetition. According to a general psychosomatic biological pattern, psychic distress will engender a series of degradations or an acute or chronic response to an early trauma. According to this hypothesis, prolonged exposure to an excess of glucocorticosteroids at the time of a disadaptative stress would have deleterious effects on the hippocampus. Indeed, the hippocampus plays a part in a number of functions affected by dementia such as memory, learning process and emotional adjustment. This study takes into account stress factors ("stressors") but not factors influencing their impact on the subject such as an individual predisposition (genetic, psychopathologic, coping abilities) and social support. The force of the impact of these events on older people and what is really experienced by them remain unknown. This study strengthens a number of others evincing an unusual frequency of life events in dementia processes. According to an integrative pattern, repeated or prolonged stress could be a deciding factor in the degenerative process or a factor of decompensation with older people presenting a genetic, biological or psychological vulnerability to dementia. The impact of such life events would vary according to the subject's pre-morbid personality, coping abilities and the support he/she can rely on. CONCLUSION: Some life events may be involved in the dementia process as shown by the results of this study, but this relationship does not imply direct causality. It's difficult to appreciate whether these results are not a consequence of the greater attention paid to the patient after the appearance of the first symptoms, leading to a closer observation. Stress could trigger the degenerative process. This argues for the necessity of an early diagnosis taking into account a traumatic event of life either precocious or late...|$|R
