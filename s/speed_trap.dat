In a race of attrition, Button was the final classified finisher, in eleventh position, two laps behind the race winner. In doing so, he completed the MP4-30's first full race distance.

500|$|In February 1957, the King County Board of Commissioners {{received}} a petition signed by Snoqualmie Valley residents {{asking for the}} dis-incorporation of East Redmond. The petition concerned the maintenance of Novelty Hill Road, which ran through East Redmond towards the Snoqualmie Valley, which would be too expensive for East Redmond to maintain; the petition also alleged that the town had created a <b>speed</b> <b>trap</b> on the road. Another petition {{was presented to the}} town council that month, signed by 125 of its 375 residents hoping to trigger a dis-incorporation election. The election was called off after a ruling by a Superior Court judge after the discovery of signatures that did not match voter registrations, as well as withdrawn signatures, which reduced the number of petitioners to below the majority of registered of voters. Residents of the Novelty Hill Road area unsuccessfully attempted to secede from East Redmond through a special election in May 1957; The Seattle Times reported that some residents had voted in favor of staying in East Redmond in order to be eligible to vote for dis-incorporation at a later date. A petition to dis-incorporate a majority of the town was certified in June, and the county scheduled a vote on the matter in October.

2500|$|Qualifying at Imola during Round 2 of {{the season}} {{highlighted}} both the problems and advantage that the lowline Brabham BT55 had during 1986. Acceleration out of the Variante Bassa chicane before the start-finish line showed the Brabhams as among the slowest cars when they crossed the line. However, {{by the time they}} reached the <b>speed</b> <b>trap</b> just before the braking area at Tosa, they were among the quickest. The cars were slow out of the corners, but once they got up to speed the lowline aerodynamics and the [...] BMW turbo did their job and with the reduced drag, from the high speed Tamburello curve both Patrese and de Angelis accelerated quicker than any other cars. At Imola, the Brabhams were almost 4 seconds off pole with Patrese qualifying 16th and de Angelis 19th. The Brabham-BMWs were in fact slower than both the Benettons and Arrows which used the conventional upright BMW engine.|$|E

2500|$|Hopewell {{has come}} to the {{attention}} of AAA because some of its members have complained that Hopewell is a <b>speed</b> <b>trap</b> for its practice of citing drivers for speeding along a 1.7 mile stretch of Interstate 295, nicknamed the [...] "Million Dollar Mile" [...] by disgruntled drivers. AAA, claimed in a press release that Hopewell employs 11 sheriff's deputies working in 14-hour shifts to patrol less than two miles of the highway that lie within the city limits of Hopewell. [...] However, this statistic has been denied by the sheriff of Hopewell, who was baffled as to where that information was generated as he said the deputies working on I-295 only work eight-hour shifts. This practice, which it has been claimed, annually generated $1.8 million in revenue from speeding tickets, of which 75% were issued to out of state drivers, triggered a court clash between the Commonwealth's Attorney and the city prosecutor, and elicited an official ruling from the Attorney General of Virginia. Sheriff Luther Sodat said that the almost two-mile stretch of highway “is a safety issue for Hopewell.” Virginia's urban interstates have a fatality rate about one-third the Statewide rate for all roads combined.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} concept worked, in {{that the}} car produced plenty of downforce without increasing drag which allowed the cars to run less wing and be among the fastest {{in a straight line}} at the faster tracks like Hockenheim, Monza and the Österreichring (where Warwick was actually the quickest through the <b>speed</b> <b>trap</b> at [...] heading into the Bosch Kurve). However, the tilted over engine and specially designed gearbox also produced many reliability problems including oil surge and a lack of throttle response that only compounded the already poor response of the BMW turbo (four cylinder turbos generally suffered more 'turbo lag' as a result of only using a single turbocharger, while V6 and V8 engines used twin turbos and suffered less lag). This saw the Brabhams off the pace on the slower circuits such as Monaco (where de Angelis qualified 20th and last for his final race, though amazingly Patrese managed to qualify 6th), Detroit, and the then new circuits of Jerez and the Hungaroring where acceleration counted for more than outright speed. The team scored just two points all season, both by driver Riccardo Patrese with sixth placings in San Marino and Detroit. It should be noted that, as in 1985, the Brabham's performance was severely hampered by inconsistent Pirelli race tyres.|$|E
2500|$|The sheer top-end {{power of}} the BMW engines (around [...] in {{qualifying}} trim, with around [...] for racing) ensured that the B186s were always competitive, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that the cars were usually amongst the fastest through the speed traps. Indeed, Berger set the highest top speed of the season at Monza with [...] (Fabi was second quickest on the straight, and also took the pole while Berger started third, the pair split by defending World Champion Alain Prost in his McLaren-TAG which was actually some [...] slower through the <b>speed</b> <b>trap).</b> However, the handling of the chassis did not match this in the first part of the season as the team struggled with the 'light switch' power delivery of the BMW engine. The handling was eventually sorted but the car was often not on the ultimate pace of the front runners. The cars were also unreliable due to a shortage of spare parts and the strain placed on the chassis by the enormous {{power of the}} BMW engine, and less competitive on slower circuits where the power did not count for as much and the turbo lag of the 4 cylinder engine made it slower on low down acceleration than the V6 turbos of Honda, TAG, Ferrari and Renault. The team was also initially disadvantaged by its partnership with the tyre supplier Pirelli, when most of the front running teams were running Goodyears, as neither it or fellow-Pirelli user Brabham had managed to complete many laps during pre-season testing; the Italian company mostly relying on data from the Ligier team.|$|E
