40|$|The {{congenital}} {{fusion of}} carpels, or <b>syncarpy,</b> {{is considered a}} key innovation as it is found in more than 80 % of angiosperms. Within the magnoliids however, <b>syncarpy</b> has rarely evolved. Two alternative evolutionary origins of <b>syncarpy</b> were suggested in order to explain the evolution of this feature: multiplication of a single carpel vs. fusion of a moderate number of carpels. The magnoliid family Annonaceae provides an ideal situation to test these hypotheses as two African genera, Isolona and Monodora, are syncarpous in an otherwise apocarpous family with multicarpellate and unicarpellate genera. In addition to <b>syncarpy,</b> the evolution of six other morphological characters was studied. Well-supported phylogenetic relationships of African Annonaceae and in particular those of Isolona and Monodora were reconstructed. Six plastid regions were sequenced and analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The Bayesian posterior mapping approach to study character evolution was used as it accounts for both mapping and phylogenetic uncertainty, and also allows multiple state changes along the branches. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered a fully resolved clade comprising twelve genera endemic to Africa, including Isolona and Monodora, which was nested within the so-called long-branch clade. This is {{the largest and most}} species-rich clade of African genera identified to date within Annonaceae. The two syncarpous genera were inferred with maximum support to be sister to a clade characterized by genera with multicarpellate apocarpous gynoecia, supporting the hypothesis that <b>syncarpy</b> arose by fusion of a moderate number of carpels. This hypothesis was also favoured when studying the floral anatomy of both genera. Annonaceae provide the only case of a clear evolution of <b>syncarpy</b> within an otherwise apocarpous magnoliid family. The results presented here offer {{a better understanding of the}} evolution of <b>syncarpy</b> in Annonaceae and within angiosperms in general...|$|E
40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} to the {{differences}} in place and time of origin of the abaxial (upper) and adaxial (lower) parts of the margin of ascidiform carpel primordia. It is assumed that the adaxial parts will develop more fully when the primordia have more space and time to develop on an expanding floral apex. The favoured occurrence of the margin {{at the base of}} the primordia seems a prerequisite to incipient <b>syncarpy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The floral {{structure}} of the neotropical palm Sabal palmetto is described. The species {{is characterized by the}} presence of hermaphrodite solitary flowers; congenitally united imbricate sepals and free imbricate petals. The six stamens are fertile, with filaments congenitally united towards the base. Contrary to previous reports indicating complete <b>syncarpy,</b> the three carpels are free in the basal region and postgenitally fused above the level of the septal nectary; they are ascidiate throughout the ovary and plicate from the style base up to the stigma. Our study supports the close relationships between Sabaleae and the rest of Cryosophileae...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} PhD {{project was}} to study the evolution, {{systematics}} and biogeography of two African genera from the pan-tropical Annonaceae family: Isolona and Monodora. Both genera are unique within the family in that the female reproductive parts (or carpels) are fused into a single unit. All other Annonaceae have freely arranged carpels. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships of Isolona and Monodora at the intra-familial and intra-generic levels. In Chapter 2, we {{explore the influence of}} priors when using the novel Bayesian based posterior mapping to study the evolution of morphological characters. Up to now, it was unclear if these priors had any influence on the results. Using a family level molecular phylogeny of the Annonaceae, we study the evolution of two morphological characters under different prior values. We show that different prior values will return different results. Thus, inadequate prior values can lead to erroneous conclusions over the evolution of the studied morphological characters. We also indicate a practical way to choose the prior values when using the posterior mapping approach to study morphological character evolution. In Chapter 3, using the posterior mapping approach, we study the evolutionary origins of <b>syncarpy</b> in Annonaceae. The closest relatives of Isolona and Monodora are elucidated. We generate a well resolved phylogeny which included {{for the first time the}} majority of African Annonaceae genera. We also study additional morphological and palynological characters relevant to Annonaceae classification in general. Our phylogenetic analyses recover a fully resolved clade comprising twelve endemic African genera, including Isolona and Monodora, which was nested within the so-called long-branch clade. This is the largest and most species-rich clade of African genera identified to date within Annonaceae. Our results indicate that <b>syncarpy</b> arose by fusion of a moderate number of carpels. The alternative hypothesis that <b>syncarpy</b> arose by multiplication of an initial single carpel receives no support. In Chapter 4 we use African Annonaceae as a model family to study the biogeographical aspects of the evolutionary origins of African rain forests. It is generally thought that the large West-Central rain forest blocks was continuous during the Eocene with the now fragmented and smaller forests of East Africa, explaining the strong floristic affinities between both areas. Using dated molecular phylogenies we provide evidence of the recurring break-up and reconnection of this pan-African rain forest during the Oligocene and Miocene. The reconnections allowed for biotic exchange while the break-ups induced speciation enhancing the levels of endemicity, thus providing an explanation for present-day patterns in the distribution and diversity of plants in African rain forests. In Chapter 5, we perform a detailed analysis of pollen morphology within a strongly supported monophyletic group of five African genera, including Isolona and Monodora. We specifically assess if pollen characters are useful for classification purposes within Isolona and Monodora using a species-level molecular phylogeny. The results show a wide pollen morphological diversity. The pollen types defined within Isolona and Monodora provide little taxonomic information for major clades within both genera. However, pollen variation proves useful as a support of phylogenetic relatedness between groups of closely related species. Finally in Chapter 6, a monographic revision of both Isolona and Monodora is presented. Isolona consists of 20 species with five endemic to Madagascar and one newly described species. Monodora has a total of 14 species, three of which were described during this PhD project from Tanzania. Detailed descriptions as well as keys are provided. The conservation status of each species is assessed following the IUCN recommendations. Just under half of the total number of species from both genera is assigned to some level of threat (12 species or 60 % in Isolona and four species or 28 % in Monodora) ...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{publication}} of hypotheses explaining the homeotic control of floral organ identity {{together with the}} availability of increasingly comprehensive and well-resolved molecular phylogenies presents an ideal opportunity for reassessing current knowledge of floral diversity and evolution in the Annonaceae. This review summarizes currently available information on selected aspects of floral structure and function, including: changes {{in the number of}} perianth whorls and the number of perianth parts per whorl; the evolution of sympetaly; the diversity and evolution of pollination chambers (with a novel classification of seven main structural forms of floral chamber based on the different arrangement, size and shape of petals); the evolution of perianth glands; floral unisexuality and hypotheses explaining the unexpectedly high frequency of occurrence of androdioecy; the origin and possible function of inner and outer staminodes; the evolution of stamen connective diversity and theca septation; and the origin of 'true' <b>syncarpy</b> and functionally equivalent extragynoecial compita. In each case, current ideas on the origin, evolution and function are discussed. The information presented in this review enables two main conclusions to be drawn. The first is that changes in the homeotic control of floral organ identity may have {{had a profound impact on}} floral structure in several disparate lineages in the family. This is most obvious in Fenerivia, in which a centrifugal shift of floral organ identity has occurred, and in Dasymaschalon, in which a reverse (centripetal) shift has occurred. Other genera that have gained or lost entire perianth whorls are likely to have undergone similar homeotic changes. Attention is also drawn to the extensive functional convergence in Annonaceae flowers, with widespread homoplasy in many characters that have previously been emphasized in higher-level classifications.
