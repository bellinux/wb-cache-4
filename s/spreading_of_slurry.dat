This study investigates the effects of effluent from three potential sources of Campylobacter spp. on the levels of Campylobacter spp. in a river.

40|$|Soil survey {{activity}} In Italy, overall {{soil survey}} activity has increased considerably {{in the last}} few years, but the organisation of knowledge on Italian soils is still in its infancy. This increase in activity of survey has been due to various reasons, but principally to a series of national and European legislations, involving soil investigations as part of measures to protect the environment. Examples of these include regulations regarding the application of nitrogen fertiliser and the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurries</b> and sewage and the need for Environmental Impact Analsis prior to infrastructure expansion programmes. At different administrative levels, i. e., national, regional, province and communal, many strategies and regulations involve the need for soil survey, for example, in support of increased land productivity, such as that of vineyards and forests, or land planning like “watershed plans”, “management of water resources plans”, “environmental safeguard plans”, “province land co-ordination plans”, “communal regulator plans”, “forest settlement plans ” and creation of natural parks. Another significant impulse to soil survey has been given by the preparation of soil maps for programming the agricultural policy of some regional Administrations. Besides the soil survey activities promoted or introduced by public institutions, there are also a number of pedological studies financed by single or associated private bodies. The most common are land suitability for different crops and, in the last decade, agricultural zoning, particularly in relation to viticulture, or location of sites useful for specific agricultural activities, such as growth of truffles and tree nursery plantations. Finally, a number of soil surveys are included in research activities led by different Universities...|$|R
40|$|Stereodeposition is a {{freeform}} fabrication technique which accomplishes the computer-controlled, layerwise buildup {{of an object}} through direct placement of a fluid which rapidly solidifies. Current materials compatible with stereodeposition include functional ceramics and metals, engineering polymers, and composites. The key to this flexibility is stereodeposition's ability to operate under {{a wide range of}} liquid-to-solid transformation rates. Understanding and controlling the material parameters involved in the liquid-to-solid transition is critical, as solidification ultimately impacts the precision and quality of the final object. A model of the liquid-to-solid transition has been developed in which a bead spreading on a curved surface is followed as a series of state "snapshots", whereby an applied force produces an incremental bead motion in an increment of time. This approach differs from most liquid spreading models, but allows flexibility in the time and geometry dependence of forces associated with a solidifying stereodeposition liquid. The model predicts bead contact angle as a function of time based on initial liquid properties (surface tension, viscosity, yield strength) and the solidification strategy employed, namely rheology control, mass transfer, or thermal transfer. Three parameter groupings are identified: alpha, which controls final contact angle, beta, which controls spreading rate, and delta, which controls amount of liquid transformation occurring during spreading. To validate the model, dynamic measurements are performed on the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurries</b> <b>of</b> silica particles in various liquids. The model is found to predict the early stage <b>of</b> <b>spreading</b> (5 s) under one of the two proposed boundary conditions, and is shown to be equivalent in the limit to the more traditional dynamic wetting models employing an energy rate balance.

40|$|Efficiency and fate of slurry N {{applied to}} {{permanent}} grass in Ardenne (Belgium) – Effect of {{the choice of}} spreading period. In Haute Ardenne and Pays de Herve, areas devoted to grass, slurry represents {{the main source of}} nitrogen; slurry is applied on permanent pasture. This paper aims to compare the nitrogen efficiency of cattle slurry with that of mineral fertilizers and to determine the influence of the choice of spreading period on N use by grasses. Results from two long terms trials and from one in micro plots using stable 15 N are presented. Results show that the fertilizers applied (organic and mineral) only affected at a mean level of 25 % N absorbed by grassland. The efficiency of spring slurry applications carried out in favorable spreading conditions matched those of mineral N. From our results, it can be concluded that N losses in grasslands are very low and are due to volatilization just after the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurry...</b>|$|E

40|$|Ammonia {{is easily}} lost after land <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> {{livestock}} <b>slurries.</b> Low-emission techniques entailing injection and trailing shoes have therefore become compulsory in the Netherlands on grassland. There {{is an argument}} that the emission of ammonia after surface application is overestimated and that the emission of various other nitrogen (N) compounds, following the prescribed low-emission techniques, is underestimated. Opponents also claim that injection in particular decreases grassland yields due to its negative effect on soil quality and biodiversity. They state that a similar reduction in ammonia emissions could be realized via low-protein dairy cow diets and slurry spreading under favourable weather conditions. This study evaluates these claims and concludes that low-emission techniques reduce the loss of ammonia effectively and increase the availability of N to grassland. There are no indications that low-emission techniques per se have negative effects on soil quality, the productivity of crops and biodiversity. It has also been demonstrated that the efficacy of proposed alternatives is limited. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Penrith Sandstone aquifer is a {{regionally}} {{important source}} of public water supply and is locally impacted by anthropogenic pollution. Livestock rearing is the main agricultural activity in the Eden valley, Northwest England. The <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> wastes on grassland to improve pasture is common place and has increased in recent years. Both the timing and quantities applied are more dictated {{by the need to}} dispose of the slurry than to meet the crops nutrient needs.

Changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fulvic-like (FA) and tryptophan-like (TRP) intensities and TRP: FA ratios (1. 6 - 0. 4) within the unsaturated zone are strongly suggestive a farm waste source of organic carbon. The preferential removal of the more labile TRP within the shallow unsaturated zone compared to the FA is likely due to microbial degradation.

40|$|This paper investigates an odour {{incident}} {{that occurred in}} April 2008 with an initially unknown source and cause which resulted in hundreds of notifications of odour complaints across England. Detailed analysis of the incident illustrates how {{a combination of the}} geographical distribution of odour reports together with Met Office data and back-trajectory modelling can be utilised to trace the source location and source term of the odour. The analysis suggests that the source of the odorant was not locally generated and that long range transport from Northern Europe was the likely explanation. This requires potentially exceptional source strength so that dilution at distance is sufficient to lead to odour perception thousands of km away. The proposed cause is suggested to be wide-spread <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>slurry.</b> This is common practice in Europe during the spring, and has implications for future reports of odour travelling extensive distances and resulting in long-range pollution events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFecal {{contamination}} {{of water resources}} is evaluated by the enumeration of the fecal coliforms Escherichia coli and Enterococci. However, the enumeration of these indicators does not allow us to differentiate between the sources of fecal contamination. Therefore, it is important to use alternative indicators of fecal contamination to identify livestock contamination in surface waters. The concentration of fecal indicators (E. coli, enteroccoci, and F-specific bacteriophages), microbiological markers (Rum- 2 -bac, Pig- 2 -bac, and Lactobacillus amylovorus), and chemical fingerprints (sterols and stanols and other chemical compounds analyzed by 3 D-fluorescence excitation-matrix spectroscopy) were determined in runoff waters generated by an artificial rainfall simulator.

40|$|In Aberdeenshire, {{approximately}} 25, 000 people rely on {{potable water}} from private water supplies. Many of these supplies are of questionable quality {{with regards to}} microbiological contamination, which is often {{due to a lack}} of maintenance and protection of these supplies. Agricultural practices such as the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> and grazing animals in the proximity of supplies all increase the risk of contamination. The presence of coliform bacteria and in particular E. coli, in private water supplies is an indication of the potential for the water supply to be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. With the increasing occurrence of severe illness from pathogens such as E. coli O 157, which have been found in a number of private water supplies, there is an increasing concern with regards to groundwater quality. This study was conducted initially to determine the magnitude of private water supply contamination in Aberdeenshire and to investigate any links between this contamination with seasonality and rainfall. To enable analysis of a large number of water samples to be carried out within an accepted timeframe, Colilert 18 ™ was validated for the detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in potable water and was compared to the accepted standard method, membrane filtration. Colilert 18 ™ was further validated for use with soil samples to allow the study of factors affecting coliform survival in water and soil to be carried out. Coliform survival in ii soil was found to be influenced particularly by temperature and soil texture. The transport of coliform bacteria in soil was investigated using repacked and undisturbed soil columns, with transport enhanced by rainfall. However even with heavy rainfall coliform bacteria can become attached to or trapped within the soil structure. It was evident from these studies that coliform bacteria and therefore pathogenic microorganisms have the potential to survive in the environment and to travel through the soil structure and enter groundwater.

40|$|Surface <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> {{leads to}} the {{inevitable}} emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with goose foot chisels (wings) requires high draught forces. This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less draught force. These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a trailing foot implement. In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the draught force requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a trailed sliding foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and knife coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the draught force. For a working depth of 5 cm, the required draught forces per shallow injector element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a knife coulter plus injector. The lowest draught forces occurred on peat soil and the highest forces on dry clay. The trailing foot required an average draught force of 39 N. The draught force of the trailing foot did not relate to the soil conditions but an effect of the grass sward condition was suggested. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|E
40|$|In the Federal Republic of Germany approx. 220 mill. tonnes {{of organic}} manure are {{produced}} annually in cattle and pig management, of which 140 mill. tonnes {{are in the}} form of liquid manure. Errors in the use of organic manure (too much, at the wrong time, with inadequate technology) result in environmental stress {{in the form of}} emissions into the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. The primary objective of the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) key field of promotion 'Environmentally Sound Treatment and Use of Livestock Manure' was to improve the possibilities of technical action to reduce such environmental harm, and in particular to protect the ground water against infiltration by nitrates and other slurry ingredients. To this end {{the state of the art}} of slurry treatment was to be advanced in order to provide farmers with efficient and economically acceptable alternatives to the current slurry treatment and spreading practice. The KTBL multisectoral project acted as a scientific parallel scheme. The subject of this multisectoral project was a comparative assessment of the newly developed methods under technological, ecological and economic aspects, characterisation of the new kinds of slurry products and their environmentally sound on-farm use, as well as an examination of the epidemiological aspects of the methods and the products. The assessment of the results revealed that due to the high costs and lack of operational reliability of the methods, chances of introducing more advanced slurry conditioning methods do not exist at the present time. In slurry surplus situations, partial conditioning methods enter into question for nutrient separation from liquid manure, especially solids separation. Slurry conditioning has to complete with simple methods such as transport and adapted feeding, which lead to similar relief of environmental stresses, but can be implemented more cheaply. Anaerobic treatment proved to be a method with promising prospects for the future, and this should be promoted by further activities in the fields of science and practical application. Positive effects relieving the burden on the environment can be achieved by combining existing techniques in feeding, storage, treatment and <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurry.</b> The precondition for this is consistent implementation of the relevant state of the art.

40|$|Combining {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} (LCA) and simulation modelling (SM) {{has been used}} to assess and improve a collective manure management plan set up in Brittany (north-western France) by a group of farmers to comply with current Nitrogen reduction regulations in agriculture. The plan studied aimed at organizing the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> surpluses produced by 11 pig farms (representing 57. 6 tons N/year) on crop land loaned by 22 crop farms located approximately 44 km away. LCA was used according to its normalized methodology to statically assess the potential environmental impacts based on 4 criteria: eutrophication, climate change, acidification and use of non-renewable energy. COMET, the dynamic systems model used in this study, has been implemented with the Vensim® software by coupling: logistics models, to simulate the transportation and spreading of manure, both at the individual (within farms) and collective (transfer plan) levels; biophysical models, mainly empirical, to simulate ammonia (NH 3) and methane (CH 4) emissions as the main criteria of the environmental evaluation with COMET. The approach encompassed four steps that alternated between the LCA and SM methodologies: (i) LCA was initially performed to assess the environmental impacts of two disposal scenarios, i. e. slurry biological treatment or transfer for application to remote crop farms. The analysis concluded the transfer scenario had the least environmental impact as, if properly implemented, it may save on the use of chemical fertilizers. (ii) SM using the COMET model simulated the logistics and agricultural feasibility of the transfer scenario to verify to what extent the collective management plan can be fully completed in due time on appropriate cropping systems. (iii) A second iteration of LCA was made to assess the environmental impacts of simulated variants of the transfer scenario, this time using simulation outputs instead of reference database information. These analyses showed important differences of impacts among the management options simulated. (iv) Finally, simulations with COMET were performed to examine the interaction between the individual level of management (manure spreading within animal farms) and the collective level (manure transfer plan to land loaners' crop farms). The variability of impacts between individual situations was very high, suggesting that farmer equipment should be adapted and collective rules made flexible to secure farm stock management. Beyond the results from the first three steps, this paper emphasises the more realistic outcomes achieved in the fourth and final step. This step allowed the variability of individual pig farm logistics and gas emissions to be analyzed, as well as simple techniques, that could be implemented by individual farmers to improve the whole system agricultural and environmental performance, to be checked. This paper concludes that benefits can be drawn from combining LCA and SM, as this makes possible to consider the diversity of actual farming situations and practices and, so, to design management rules balancing individual and collective needs...|$|E

Heating the instrumental inlet and the drift tube to 180 °C enabled an effective time resolution of ~ 1 s and {{made it possible to}} apply the instrument for eddy covariance (EC) measurements. EC fluxes of NH 3 were measured over two agricultural fields in Oensingen, Switzerland, following fertilisations with cattle slurry. Air was aspirated close to a sonic anemometer at a flow of 100 STP L min − 1 and was directed through a 23 m long 1 / 2 " PFA tube heated to 150 °C to an air-conditioned trailer where the gas was sub-sampled from the large bypass stream. This setup minimised damping of fast NH 3 concentration changes between the sampling point and the actual measurement. High-frequency attenuation loss of the NH 3 fluxes of 20 to 40 % was quantified and corrected for using an empirical ogive method. The instrumental NH 3 background signal showed a minor interference with H 2 O which was characterised in the laboratory. The resulting correction of the NH 3 flux after slurry spreading was less than 1 ‰. The flux detection limit of the EC system was about 5 ng m − 2 s − 1 while the accuracy of individual flux measurements was estimated 16 % for the high-flux regime during these experiments. The NH 3 emissions after broad <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the <b>slurry</b> showed an initial maximum of 150 μg m − 2 s − 1 with a fast decline in the following hours...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of improved technology of the preparation <b>of</b> coal-water <b>slurries</b> that have potential for replacing fuel oil in direct combustion. Research accomplishments are summarized for: standardization of experimental procedures; investigation of effect of high-pressure roll mill/ball mill grinding on the energetics of fine grinding and the rheology <b>of</b> coal-water <b>slurries</b> prepared with such fines; study of aging behavior of slurries; and ways of improving rheology <b>of</b> <b>slurries.</b> The rheological behavior <b>of</b> <b>slurries</b> is a manifestation of particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions in the slurry. Improvement in the rheology <b>of</b> <b>slurries</b> could be brought about by suitably altering these interactions. The research directed towards investigation of the influence of co-addition of sodium hexametaphosphate and vacuum oil, with CoalMaster as the primary dispersant, showed that co-addition of the reagents significantly improved the rheology <b>of</b> coal-water <b>slurries.</b> Further research conducted in this quarter indicated that co-addition of reagents also improves the long-term rheological behavior <b>of</b> coal-water <b>slurries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nano-ceramics with {{excellent}} strength, toughness, oxidation resistance, corrosion resistance {{and the like}} metals superplasticity show an attractive application prospect. However, the production of high density of nano-ceramics is very difficult. This paper focuses on the preparation <b>of</b> concentrated suspension <b>slurry,</b> the main technical parameters and the additive proportion of raw materials. The optimum dosage of dispersant PAANa is 1. 4 wt%. When the PH value is about 9, the best stability <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> is achieved. When the milling time reaches 10 h, the lowest viscosity is reached. The solid content viscosity <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> increases with the decrease <b>of</b> the <b>slurry</b> temperature. Solid phase volume with 40 vol % <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> can be successfully cast out the mould homogeneously. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} <b>of</b> manure or <b>slurry</b> management on intensive pig {{farms are}} the provision <b>of</b> adequate <b>slurry</b> storage capacity and the efficient recycling <b>of</b> the <b>slurry</b> nutrients for crop production. However, recent surveys <b>of</b> pig <b>slurry</b> dry matter suggest there is excessive dilution <b>of</b> raw pig <b>slurry</b> with water. This has two {{important implications for}} management. The first is greater storage capacity will be required due to the increased volume <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> generated. Slurry storage is expensive. For example, a 350 sow unit adding 10 weeks storage needs to invest £ 50, 000. Secondly, evidence from the literature indicates an improved slurry nitrogen efficiency with the more dilute manure. The results of field trials showed that higher dry matter pig slurries reduced the relative efficiency <b>of</b> pig <b>slurry</b> nitrogen for second cut silage production. This is probably linked to reduced ammonia volatilisation losses, consequent to the less viscous nature <b>of</b> dilute <b>slurry</b> which permits a more rapid infiltration of the ammonium nitrogen into the soil. The use of a band spreader or shallow injection rather than the conventional splash plate were shown {{to increase the efficiency}} <b>of</b> pig <b>slurry</b> nitrogen for grass silage production. Therefore, the potential for the higher pig slurry dry matter, required for cost effective storage/ handling costs, to reduce the efficiency of its nitrogen for grass silage production can be partially offset by using band spreaders or shallow injection spreading systems. These have the added advantage of reducing odour emissions from the land <b>spreading</b> operation. End <b>of</b> Project ReportTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|R
