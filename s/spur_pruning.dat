40|$|Cytokinins play an {{important}} role in budburst, flowering and fruit set in table grapes. Rest-breaking treatments with hydrogen cyanamide and pruning practices modify budburst and reproductive development in table grapes, especially in regions with low and often inadequate winter chilling. The effect of these treatments on the xylem sap and bud Zeatin riboside (ZR) content was determined during late winter and budburst in 'Sultanina', 'Sunred Seedless', and 'Alphonse Lavalleé' canes in a total of nine trials conducted between 1997 and 2001. Bud ZR levels of hydrogen cyanamide treated 'Sultanina' canes showed an earlier and increased cytokinin peak, in particular in the distal buds. Large ZR peaks before budburst and noticeable differences between distal and proximal buds were absent on non-sprayed canes. The xylary ZR content of long pruned 'Sultanina', 'Sunred Seedless', and 'Alphonse Lavaleé' canes showed a significantly higher and earlier cytokinin peak than in short pruned spurs. By contrast, the bud ZR content tended to be higher in spurs than canes. Pruning and rest-breaking treatments enhanced budburst and increased endogenous cytokinins in these experiments. Long pruning in 'Sultanina' and 'Sunred Seedless' (both parthenocarpic) is necessary for acceptable fruit set and yields. Possibly, in longer canes more cytokinin is available for reproductive development.

40|$|Selection of new grape cultivars by {{intraspecific}} crossing increases biodiversity {{as well as}} improves some parents’ characteristics. However, {{their success}} is still unclear. It seems to depend upon how well they respond to different challenges and demands of the modern viticulture, such as their adaptability to climate change and vineyard mechanization. This research aims to characterize vine performance and suitability to mechanical harvesting of cultivar ‘Ervi’ (V. vinifera L.), an Italian crossbreed between ‘Barbera’ and ‘Croatina’. The trial was performed between 2008 and 2010 on the Piacenza hills using Guyot trained vines. Cluster number and yield per vine were recorded at harvest. Subsequently, shoot fertility, cluster and berry weight were calculated accordingly. Soluble solids, pH and must titratable acidity were analyzed as well as total anthocyanins and phenols grape content. A pool of 891 berries was randomly picked and their respective detachment force was measured by a dynamometer. ‘Ervi’ showed more constant yield than its parents and shoot fertility higher than ‘Croatina’ suggesting that short <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> is feasible. Berry weight in ‘Ervi’ was also lower than in ‘Barbera’. Ripening was earlier than both parents. The adaptability of ‘Ervi’ to the mechanical harvesting is similar to ‘Barbera’ and better than ‘Croatina’. The BDF is cultivar-dependent and is an important parameter for mechanical harvesting.

40|$|More than 70 % of the {{vineyards}} of Douro, the Port wine region, are planted in hillsides with a slope superior to 30 %. After the inscription of the Douro Valley in the "World Heritage list - UNESCO", in slopes higher than 30 % is mandatory that vineyards are planted in terraces {{with less than}} 2. 5 m wide and a single row of plantation. However narrow terraces have the disadvantage of a low planting density and consequently a low yield potential, circumstance the disencourages its use by grape growers. Because of that, an experiment was performed in a vineyard planted in terraces of 2. 3 m wide, and a single row of vines, with two alternatives of training. 1) the traditional vertical shoot positioning - VSP and 2) a double cordon, trained upwards and downwards, the LYS 2 / 3. Additionally, two pruning alternatives had been introduced in the cordon trained downwards of LYS 2 / 3, <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> (Royat) and can pruning. The variety used was Touriga Nacional, grafted in 110 R. The results obtained in 2005 and 2006 showed that yield in the LYS 2 / 3 system was 24 % {{higher than in the}} VSP.

40|$|The {{effect of}} hedge pruning Cabernet Sauvignon and Doradillo grapevines was {{examined}} for five years. The mature vines {{had previously been}} <b>spur</b> <b>pruned</b> on bilateral cordons and were hedged to square, offset rectangular or triangular shapes. The yield and the capacity of hedged vines were {{equal to or greater}} than the manually pruned vines except in 1976, when the hedged Doradillo vines had lower yields than those manually pruned. Hedging increased yields compared to the control vines mainly through increases in the numbers of clusters. Hedging had different effects on each variety. With Cabernet Sauvignon a triangular hedge initially had lower yields but in later years yielded more than the square and offset hedges. The increase in yield was due to an increase {{in the size of the}} bunches, as a result of an increase in berry number, compared to the other hedge shapes. The effect of shape on bud selection is discussed. Machine pruning can increase the efficiency of pruning 40 -fold so that one man can prune up to 400 ha (4 x 106 m 2) of grapevines.

40|$|High-altitude {{regions of}} {{southern}} Brazil, located above 900 m above sea level, the cordon training with <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> {{is widely used}} because of easier application. In these regions, Chardonnay wine grape shows potential to produce quality wines, however, in commercial vineyards, the training system used has not provided productivities that makes economically viable the cultivation of this variety. Given this, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of different cane-pruning systems on the vegetative, productive and enological potential of Chardonnay grapevines grown in the high-altitude region of Southern Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a commercial Chardonnay vineyard, located in São Joaquim – Santa Catarina State (28 o 17 ′ 39 ”S and 49 ∘ 55 ′ 56 ” W, to 1230 [*]m a. s. l) during 2015 and 2016 vintages. Chardonnay vines (grafted on 1103 Paulsen) were planted in 2010, with a 3. 0 [*]m (row) × 1. 0 [*]m (vine) spacing. The treatments consisted of different cane-pruning systems: Cordon spur-pruning (control); Sylvoz; Cazenave; Capovolto; single Guyot and double Guyot. Pruning was performed in August of each year when the buds were in the green tip developmental stage. Data was analyzed by Scott Knott test (p < 0. 05) following a randomized block design with four replicates, each consisting of 12 vines per plot. We observed higher yield in the Cazenave and double Guyot training system with three and two more tons of grapes than spur-pruning respectively. The bud fertility was higher in plants trained in double Guyot. Vines spur-pruned showed higher relation of leaf area: production, with values above 100 [*]cm 2 g− 1 grape at 2016 vintage. Commercial maturity of grapes (soluble solids, acidity and polyphenols) did not differ among training systems studied.

40|$|The {{researches}} {{carried out}} during the PhD were focused {{on the effects of}} different cultural techniques on the phenolic compound of Vitis vinifera L., under the ongoing climate change scenario that has been causing negative effects on grape composition and sensory attributes of wines. In the first trial was evaluated the effectiveness of the delayed winter <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> after budburst to slow down sugar accumulation in cv. Merlot, with the aim to reduce the decoupling between technological and phenolic maturity. This technique, if applied in a particular period, resulted able to slow down sugar accumulation without negative effects on berry flavonoids and with acceptable loss of yield. Since the topic of the phenolic maturity became important in the evaluation of the effects that global warming and cultural techniques have on black berry varieties, in the second experiment were investigated the changes that occurs on berry flavonoids and in the properties of skin cell wall material during the last part of ripening in cv. Merlot. Total and extractable anthocyanins increased until harvest, as well as the affinity of cell wall material for the commercial seed tannin. This latter aspect might be correlated to the decrease of astringency during ripening. In the third experiment was investigated the role that sunlight incidence on clusters of cv. Grechetto gentile plays on grape composition and on the phenolic tastes of the resulting wines. Increased light incidence determined higher concentration of flavonols in grape and wine and that was correlated to the greater perception of astringency and bitterness of the wines.

40|$|An {{hypothesis}} that root restriction bags affect the vegetative growth, fruitfulness and fruit maturity of minimally managed field grown grapevines (Vilis vinifera cv. Cabemet Sauvignon) was examined with {{data collected from}} 1991 - 1996 {{as part of an}} ongoing trial. Root restriction clearly reduced vegetative growth, however fruitfulness was less affected, resulting in improvements in crop load and the maturity of the grape berries. The proportionate bag volume effects on growth were less consistent. Grapevine cuttings were planted at ground level in porous geotextile Duon® root control bags in the spring of 1989 in Canterbury, New Zealand. Treatments consisted of four bag volumes of 10, 25, 48 and 102 litres, 'bagged' and unrestricted 'control' vines. The grapevines were spaced at 2 metre between vines and trained to a single cordon. The vines were minimally managed with winter short <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> and irrigation was applied uniformly across all treatments. The experiment was divided into three sections to test two hypotheses. Firstly were the bagged vines different from the non bagged vines and secondly were the bag effects proportionate. Root restriction treatments generally reduced all vegetative growth parameters including: pruning fresh weights; trunk cross sectional area; primary and lateral shoot number and length, node number (leaf number), internode length and leaf area per plant. Mean leaf size was smaller and despite the growth reductions the canopy density was improved in the bagged vines, through less leaf shading. Root restriction affected fruitfulness to a lesser extent, leading to increased harvest efficiency indices; fruit weight per unit pruning weight, leaf area per unit pruning weight and the fruit weight produced per total shoot number. Moreover, root restriction treatments affected the main fruit maturity parameters used for wine production. At harvest root restriction treatments increased the juice total soluble solids concentrations and decreased the titratable acidity concentration leading to an increased total soluble solids to titratable acidity ratio. In the final year these differences occurred from 7 weeks prior to harvest. Root restriction treatments also decreased juice potassium ion concentration. Potassium ion concentration was correlated with pH, and pH was generally lower in the bagged vines. Berry colour development at veraison was also earlier in the root restriction treatments. The {{hypothesis that}} bag volumes are proportionate to changes in vegetative growth, fruitfulness and fruit maturity is not clear. There was some evidence to suggest relationships between these parameters may exist, however, R 2 values were low. Clearly the smallest bag volumes had disproportionate growth suggesting root escapes and, or, changed root to shoot relationships which would confound results. Root escapes were confirmed by preliminary root excavation...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common manners of {{classifying}} vine training systems now is based on which parts of the vines are permanent fixtures which determines which parts of the vine are removed each year as part of the winter pruning. With a cane-trained system, there are no permanent cordons or branches that are kept year after year. The vine is pruned down to the spur in winter, leaving only one strong cane which is then trained into becoming the main branch for next year's crop. Examples of cane trained systems include the Guyot and Pendelbogen. With spur-trained systems, the main branch or cordon is kept each year with only individual canes being pruned during the winter. While vines that are cane trained will often have a thin, smooth main branch, spur trained vines will often have thick, dark and gnarled cordon branches. Many old vine vineyards will often utilize spur training system. Some examples of spur-training systems include the goblet or bush vine systems, and Cordon de Royat. Some systems, like the Scott Henry and VSP Trellis, can be adapted to both spur and cane training. Vine systems that are classified as either cane or spur trained may be alternately described by the way they are pruned in the winter so systems that are described as [...] "cane-trained" [...] will be <b>spur</b> <b>pruned</b> while systems that are [...] "spur-trained" [...] will be cane-pruned.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical and manual leaf {{removal of}} Nero d Avola vines {{were carried out}} in a {{commercial}} vineyard in Sclafani Bagni area, Sicily (South Italy), in the 2007 growing season. Rows were North East-South West oriented and vines were <b>spur</b> <b>pruned</b> and non-irrigated. The aim {{was to investigate the}} effects of two different ways of defoliation on plant physiology, vegetative parameters, yield and grape quality in a warm temperature area. Fruit zone defoliation consisted of mechanical (MLR) and hand leaf removal (HLR), applied either to both sides of the canopy (Northweast and Southeast). These treatments were applied when the berries had reached pea size and compared to a non-defoliated treatment (control). Hand and mechanical leaf removal caused different and significant reduction in leaf area per shoot modifying leaf-to-fruit ratio. Different vegetative activity was showed among the treatments during the vegetative season (from pea size to harvest). Consequently, differences in canopy architecture were measured at pea size and harvest. Photosynthetic activity of primary leaves was higher in leaf removal treatments than in non-defoliated. In HLR must sugar (°Brix) tended to increase during ripeness process, but at harvest no significant differences among treatments were found. Skin total anthocyanins was lower in HLR and the control vines showed the highest values. Leaf removal had effect on variability between the two canopy sides (Northeast/Southwest) for total anthocyanins and flavonoids.

The treatments were: upright vertical, cane pruned (Guyot); upright vertical, <b>spur</b> <b>pruned</b> (Bilateral Cordon); Scott Henry, cane pruned; Lyre, cane pruned; and Geneva Double Curtain (GDC,) cane pruned.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and growth of}} grape berries was studied in Canterbury, New Zealand on Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Experimentation {{was set up to}} examine: changes in yield components, the development of individual flowers, and the growth and cellular makeup of seeded, seedless, and shot berries. Vine yield components were manipulated by altering vine phenology using delayed winter <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> and alginate gel encapsulation. Flower development was studied by tagging flowers at capfall and describing the resulting berries at véraison. The set and development of the tagged flowers was altered with girdling and leaf area removal treatments to change carbohydrate availability. Finally the growth curves and cellular makeup of the different types of berries were described from a separate sample of berries. The timing of phenological growth stages may have an important role in determining components of yield. Bunch weight increased (38 %) with delayed winter <b>spur</b> <b>pruning,</b> due to a larger average berry weight. The increase in average berry weight resulted from changes in the berry population, with the proportion of large seeded berries increasing within bunches, associated with a possible reduction in the proportion of smaller seedless berries. Treatments that delayed bud break also delayed flowering date, perhaps to a time when weather conditions were more favourable for berry development. A weak relationship between the warmth of the bud break period and yield, as well as bunch weight, was found; this may be an indirect relationship. Studying individual flowers showed that berry set and development could be altered by manipulating carbohydrate availability. Girdling changed the development of some flowers. The proportion of seeded berries that formed was unaffected by girdling, while the proportion of seedless berries increased. The response of shot berries and flowers that abscised differed between 1999 and 2000. In 1999 the proportion of shot berries decreased, while in 2000 it was the proportion of abscised flowers that decreased after girdling. Leaf area reduction on girdled shoots had an opposite effect to girdling, with extreme levels of leaf removal (75 %) reducing the proportion of shot and seeded berries that formed. The percentage of abscised flowers increases dramatically with leaf area removal, while the proportion of seedless berries was unaffected. However, a weak positive relationship between total shoot leaf area and seedless berry development exists. The data from yield components and of individual flowers suggest that the population of berries are fluid in nature. Shot berries and flowers that abscise appear to be a pool from which seedless berries can form, when carbohydrate availability allows. The antibiotic spectinomycin was applied to alter fruit set and seed development of berries, though no effect was identified. The lack of a spectinomycin effect may have been the result of incorrect timing of treatment application. The mean overall fruit set differed between the 1999 (41 %) and 2000 (71 %) seasons. The greater fruit set and different behaviour of abscised flowers (c. f. shot berries in 1999) in 2000 might be a reflection of the warmer than average flowering period compared to the cooler flowering period of 1999 : This suggests that environmental conditions at flowering may influence fruit set. Flowers were found to vary in size at capfall, but neither flower size (ovary diameter) nor the time of capfall of individual flowers had any influence on berry set and development. Flower size and environmental conditions affected the progression of capfall. Smaller flowers tend to undergo capfall after larger flowers, and the progression of flowering is disrupted when rainfall and associated low temperatures occur. Temperatures above 15 °C were found to advance capfall in the 1999 and 2001 seasons. With flowers undergoing capfall {{over an extended period of}} time (about 20 days), individual flowers will experience quite different environmental conditions. However, no strong relationships between daily assessments of temperature at capfall and berry set or berry development were found. The strong effect of carbohydrate availability on berry development (as found with girdling and leaf area removal) suggests that light intensity (due to its impact on current photoassimilate supply) may be more valid an environmental index than temperature. The extent of berry growth is determined by the seed. A strong relationship between berry size and seed content was found. A minimum level of seed development (> 0. 5 mg fresh weight at harvest) is required for double sigmoid berry growth, which occurs as a consequence of cell division and expansion. Both seeded and seedless berries exhibit double sigmoid growth curves, however when seedless berries have less than 0. 5 mg seed content they show a single sigmoid growth curve. Seedless berries grow only as a result of cell expansion. Failure of the ovules to develop mean that shot berries only show a small amount of growth immediately post-capfall then halt all growth. A model of berry formation has been proposed, where flower abscission and fruit set are considered as contrasting processes and the formation of shot and seedless berries occurs when the normal process of seeded berry development fails. Once abscission has been prevented (i. e. the flower is set), the extent to which the flower develops is determined by what stage during pollination (shot berry) and fertilisation (seedless berry) that seed formation fails...|$|E

A área {{experimental}} foi instalada em uma propriedade pertencente à Vinícola Intervin®, localizada em Maringá-PR. Os vinhedos foram estabelecidos em julho de 2001, e as plantas foram conduzidas no sistema latada (4, 0 x 1, 5 m), enxertadas sobre o porta-enxerto IAC 766 'Campinas'. As podas curtas de formação (duas gemas) foram realizadas no fim do mês de agosto de 2007 e 2008, e as podas longas de produção (oito gemas) foram realizadas no fim de fevereiro de 2008 e 2009. As avaliações foram realizadas em duas safras fora de época (2008 e 2009), a partir do início da maturação das uvas até sete dias após a colheita. Foram utilizadas 20 plantas representativas de cada variedade. Para a evolução da maturação fenólica das uvas, foi determinado o teor de antocianinas e o índice de polifenóis totais (IPT) do mosto das bagas. Por ocasião da colheita, foi avaliado o teor de resveratrol do mosto das uvas. Para a 'Alicante', a média do teor de antocianinas foi de 55, 4 mg 100 g- 1, IPT de 474, 0 mg 100 g- 1 e teor de resveratrol de 7, 6 µg g- 1.

The <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> of formation (two buds) was held in late August of 2007 and 2008 and the long pruning of production (eight buds) was held in late February of 2008 and 2009. The evaluations were performed in two out of season grapes production (2008 and 2009), from early ripening up to seven days after harvest, using 20 representative vines of each variety. The grapes phenolic maturation evolution was determined by means of anthocyanins content and total polyphenols index (TPI) of the berries.

40|$|Overview of projects, project results, funding {{bodies and}} {{partners}} in 2002 {{and plans for}} 2003 Including: SOIL MANAGEMENT * Evaluation of leaf analysis in organic fruit growing {{as a tool for}} measuring the uptake of nutrients: Consultants and researchers exchanged practical experiences and the LBI hopes to work with target values. * Impact of sulphur stress: The fruit quality seemed to be better in the reduced sulphur treatment (27 kg /ha instead of 60 kg /ha after flowering). * Fertilisation: In a late summer fertilisation trial with Elstar, trees fertilised late summer/autumn have a higher nitrogen content in the bud the following spring. And fertilising just before winter leads to increased growth of weeds in the next season. * Ground cover: The key to white clover undergrowth is to ‘do it properly or not at all’. It is difficult for an organic grower to restore undergrowth which has been invaded by grasses to bare earth. Undergrowth is definitely not the answer for fruit growers who have any difficulty with mechanical weeding. The management of ground cover requires at least as much mechanisation as the bare tree strip. REGULATING GROWTH AND CROP * Steps to counter biennialism in Elstar: A trial was set up at three orchards combining various measures: thinning or not thinning with two or three applications of lime sulphur, adapted pruning, 3 levels of fruit bearing (30, 40, 50 tonne/ha) and early or late manual thinning. This trial should demonstrate the relative significance of the various measures. Flowering will be evaluated in the spring of 2003. * Fruiting <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> in Elstar: To obtain better insight into the effect of different pruning methods three pruning treatments were used: standard pruning, removal of an extra large amount of fruiting spurs, and removal of extra fruiting spurs but sparing smooth one-year-old shoots. The production of the trees has been estimated and the blossom will be evaluated in the spring of 2003. * Effect of thinning times, fertilisation and bearing on regularity of production and fruit quality in Elstar: Ripening was delayed by the high nitrogen dose and associated higher acid content. Despite the late ripening the firmness was still lower, the calcium content lower and the nitrogen content higher. All three factors pro- duce a clear deterioration in quality. On the other hand, the sugar and acidity were higher in this case, but both these values fall within the target band. The trial will continue in 2003 CANKER * Administering calcium hydroxide against Cancer through the sprinkler irrigation system: Despite its effectiveness, sprinkling with calcium hydroxide cannot as yet be generally recommended for practical application. All the difficulties stem {{from the fact that the}} agent does not really dissolve, and the suspension formed very rapidly settles out. FRUIT QUALITY * Optimum picking time for Santana: Santana is a relatively new variety, and further investigation is required into optimising cultivation and storage. The apples only developed their full flavour when picked some time after the point of physiological ripeness. * Sprinkling to combat sunscald: By sprinkling under specific conditions an average of 1. 38 fruits per tree was protected from sunscald. Per hectare sprinkling on these three days yielded around € 621 per ha. (Assuming: 3000 trees/ha, 6 fruits/kg, price € 1. 10 or € 0. 20 for industrial use). * Rot resistance test: The Louis Bolk Instituut is attempting to develop a test for the evaluation of the natural resistance of the fruit. This demonstrates, for example that apples with a high nitrogen content have more and larger areas of rot than apples with a lower nitrogen content. * Prospects offered by calcium chloride (CaCl 2) before or after harvest: A pilot experiment was carried out on a farm to look into the prospects of spraying with CaCl 2 before the harvest or rinsing with CaCl 2 after harvest to reduce fruit rot. Neither treatment led to a reduction in fruit rot, but rather to an increase. * International association for ‘Organic Food, Quality and Health’ (FQH) : The purpose of the group of researchers and traders brought together under the FQH banner is to develop a new concept of quality based on life processes and to select and further develop relevant methods of measurement. ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common manners of {{classifying}} vine training systems now is based on which parts of the vines are permanent fixtures which determines which parts of the vine are removed each year as part of the winter pruning. With a cane-trained system, there are no permanent cordons or branches that are kept year after year. The vine is pruned down to the spur in winter, leaving only one strong cane which is then trained into becoming the main branch for next year's crop. Examples of cane trained systems include the Guyot and Pendelbogen. With spur-trained systems, the main branch or cordon is kept each year with only individual canes being pruned during the winter. While vines that are cane trained will often have a thin, smooth main branch, spur trained vines will often have thick, dark and gnarled cordon branches. Many old vine vineyards will often utilize spur training system. Some examples of spur-training systems include the goblet or bush vine systems, and Cordon de Royat. Some systems, like the Scott Henry and VSP Trellis, can be adapted to both spur and cane training. Vine systems that are classified as either cane or spur trained may be alternately described by the way they are pruned in the winter so systems that are described as [...] "cane-trained" [...] will be <b>spur</b> <b>pruned</b> while systems that are [...] "spur-trained" [...] will be cane-pruned.|$|R

A ground truth evaluation trial {{was set up in}} an experimental vineyard with two plots of the white varieties ‘Alvarinho’ and ‘Arinto’, trained on a vertical shoot positioning system and <b>spur</b> <b>pruned.</b> For each varietal plot, six smart points were selected with 10 contiguous vines each. During the ripening period of the 2016 season the vines were manually assessed for canopy dimensions and yield and then scanned by the VINBOT sensor head composed with a 2 D laser rangefinder, a Kinect v 2 camera and a set of robot navigation sensors. Ground truth data was used to compare with the canopy data estimated by the rangefinder and with the output of the image analysis algorithms. Regarding canopy features (height, volume and exposed leaf area), in general an acceptable fit between actual and estimated values was observed with canopy height showing the best agreement. The regression analysis between actual and estimated values of canopy features showed a significant linear relationship for all the features however the lower values of the R 2 indicate a weak relationship. Regarding the yield, despite the significant R 2 (0. 31) showed by the regression analysis between actual and estimated values, the equation of the fitted line indicate that the VINBOT algorithms underestimated the yield by an additive factor. Our results showed that canopy features can be estimated by the VINBOT platform with an acceptable accuracy. However, the underestimation of actual yield, caused mainly by bunch occlusion, deserves further research to improve the algorithms accuracyN/...|$|R

Vines were trained to a vertical trellis system, <b>spur</b> <b>pruned.</b> The vineyard was drip irrigated (4 l/h). Three treatments were applied: 1. vines grown without irrigation water: dry condition; 2. vines irrigated until véraison with 560 m 3 : late stress; 3. vines irrigated until ripeness with 1120 m 3 : no stress. The aim {{of the study was to}} find the different behaviors of Ψp, Ψl e Ψs during the season. Water potential measurements (Pre dawn (Ψp), leaf water potential at midday (Ψl) and Stem water potential (Ψs) in bagged leaves at midday, both in shaded leaves) were determined using a Scholander Chamber, the day before and after each irrigation. Different water potential methods showed water content variation (in following irrigation) in different dates. In dry condition Ψp was good indicator of plant water condition whereas Ψl e Ψs during the season, had variable behaviour. Ψp evidenced better differences, between irrigated and not irrigated vines, compare to Ψs and Ψl respectively. So that Ψp is good indicator of irrigation response, in the earlier season. However Ψs and Ψl were good indicators of irrigation response during the end of the season. Higher variability was respectively found for Ψl and Ψs than Ψp This was due to the environmental condition influences.

40|$|Modern canopy {{management}} practices and irrigation strategies have improved {{the economic and}} environmental sustainability of Australia ' s wine industry, in terms of increased production and improved wine quality for minimal production cost and environmental impact. This study tested the hypothesis that partial rootzone drying (PRD) integrated with low input, minimal pruning practices can improve sustainability of winegrape production in warm - climate, irrigated vineyards. The bi - factorial experiment investigated three conventional pruning practices; hand <b>spur</b> <b>pruning</b> (SPUR), mechanical hedging (MECH) and minimal pruning (MIN) integrated with standard drip (SD) and PRD irrigation strategies. The sustainability of winegrape production of field - grown cv. Shiraz grapevines was determined by examining yield, fruit composition, wine composition and quality, vine physiology and susceptibility of bunches to Botrytis bunch rot. Winegrape production was strongly influenced by pruning level and the resultant bunch number per vine. Increased node retention at pruning of minimal pruned vines resulted in 4 - fold more bunches per vine than spur pruned vines. Mechanical hedged vines had an intermediate number of bunches per vine. Yield generally reflected the trend in bunch number per vine. However, minimally pruned and mechanically hedged vines compensated for greater carbohydrate partitioning between reproductive sinks by producing smaller bunches with fewer berries per bunch. Partial drying of the grapevine rootzone had a detrimental effect on yield relative to SD irrigation (18 %). The additive effect of SD combined with light pruning treatments resulted in few statistically significant interactions for the measured yield components. Berry weight was the only parameter influenced by the interaction between irrigation and pruning during the three experimental seasons; PRD + MIN reduced berry weight by 36 % compared to SD + SPUR, in response to lower irrigation inputs and higher bunch number. A 2 - fold increase in water use efficiency (tonnes per megalitre) was found by the reduced irrigation inputs of PRD combined with the high crop levels of MIN vines compared to SD + SPUR vines. Fruit and wine composition was also largely unaffected by combined irrigation and pruning treatments, {{as a result of}} the additive effect of PRD and MIN. However, light pruning levels (MIN and MECH) and their associated small berry size and high bunch exposure, reduced pH and increased titratable acidity, and anthocyanin and phenolic concentrations of berry juice compared to SPUR. Minor pruning level effects on wine composition can be directly correlated with those observed on fruit composition. PRD had minimal effect on basic fruit composition but strong effects on wine spectral parameters : density, hue, total anthocyanin and phenolic concentration and ionised anthocyanin concentration, possibly as a result of co - pigmentation of anthocyanin compounds with exocarp tannins. Berry size was strongly correlated with fruit and wine quality. Small berries (i. e. from PRD and MIN) had lower pH and higher anthocyanin and phenolic concentrations in the juice and produced wine that was more acidic, brighter and had higher colour density and anthocyanin (total and ionised) and phenolic concentrations than all other treatments. Midday and diurnal leaf gas exchange were manipulated by partially drying the rootzone. PRD reduced midday stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration compared to SD. Stomatal limitation on photosynthesis and transpiration was probable, given the strong positive relationship with stomatal conductance and reduced carbon isotope discrimination by PRD. Transpiration efficiency was improved for PRD irrigated vines compared to SD irrigated vines. Leaf water potential and osmotic potential were measured diurnally, in conjunction with leaf gas exchange to investigate the response of PRD irrigated vines to increasing vapour pressure deficit. Diurnally, stomatal conductance was reduced by PRD compared to SD, which maintained leaf water potential, while no osmotic adjustment occurred. Therefore, PRD irrigation maintained hydraulic water status by hydrating half of the rootzone, whilst dehydration of the other half of the rootzone resulted in the partial closure of stomata. Pruning treatment effects on vine physiology were less pronounced. Minor gas exchange effects showed that pruning level influenced carboxylation efficiency and not stomatal limitations, as photosynthesis was not directly correlated with stomatal conductance. Bunches were least resistant to infection by Botrytis when fully developed and at maximum maturity. The development of bunches into tighter clusters as berry size increased from veraison to harvest and the increase in sugar content may have encouraged development of Botrytis. The distinct bunch architecture resulting from the combined pruning and irrigation treatments influenced the incidence and severity of Botrytis bunch rot. Light pruning combined with PRD irrigation produced small, loose bunches in season 2001 - 02, which were less susceptible to Botrytis bunch rot development compared to the large, compact bunches produced on SD + SPUR vines. However, low bunch numbers and high fruit - set on MIN and MECH vines in season 2002 - 03 led to a significant change in bunch architecture. As a consequence of the increased compactness of bunches in season 2002 - 03, no pruning effects on Botrytis development were observed. Long term economic and environmental sustainability of winegrape production is dependent on continual improvement in fruit and wine quality, preservation of yield, reduced water and chemical usage. This study has shown partial drying of the rootzone combined with light pruning techniques improved yield, fruit and wine composition, water use efficiency and transpiration efficiency and reduced the incidence and severity of Botrytis bunch rot compared to SD and severe pruning levels. Therefore, over the three experimental seasons, PRD combined with minimal pruning was determined as the preferred strategy to enhance the sustainability of winegrape production of Shiraz cv. in warm - climate, irrigated vineyards.

40|$|The {{formation}} of inflorescence primordia (IP) marks {{an important step}} in the reproductive cycle of grapevines. The development of an IP to a grape bunch occurs over the course of two growing seasons. During season one, an IP initiates from a group of uncommitted cells, termed an anlage, where initiation is thought to occur around the time of flowering. Further branching and development of IP continues until the onset of winter dormancy. During spring of the following season, branching of IP resumes and each branch terminates in a floral identity, where each floral identity has the potential to form a berry. Inflorescence primordia initiation and development is sensitive to carbohydrate (CHO) availability and temperature. This thesis explores the influence of CHO availability and temperature during IP initiation and their continued development the following season. An inflorescence or bunch has two main components: the inner and outer arm. For the purpose of this thesis, inflorescence or bunch architecture is defined by the type of structure occurring at the outer arm position: and outer arm with floral identities; a tendril; or no structure. While the inner arm is required for an inflorescence structure to occur, development of the outer arm to a floral bearing structure does not always occur. Although initiation of the inner and outer arm likely occurs at the same time, the development of the outer arm into a floral bearing structure is frequently delayed compared to its inner arm structure. The causes and consequences of delayed outer arm formation on yield and grape composition at harvest are also addressed in this thesis. The effect of restricting CHO availability to IP during their second season of development was achieved by pre-budbreak (BB) cane girdling. First, it was established that pre-BB cane girdling alters the CHO availability to developing shoots and IP structures (Chapter 3. 1). Canes were girdled 5, 10 or 20 cm from the terminal bud of the cane and shoot growth of the terminal bud was monitored over a single growing season. A linear relationship was found between the initial rate of shoot growth and the amount of cane isolated by the girdle. A decrease in available CHOs during initial shoot growth appeared to inhibit the shoot’s ability to produce new vegetative nodes past the point of discontinuity. This resulted in a decrease in total leaf area due to incomplete leaf expansion. The transition of the vine’s dependence on reserve CHOs to a net positive state appeared to occur when shoot growth reached a steady state. In the case of severe CHO restriction, no lateral growth occurred, suggesting the CHO status of the vine {{may play a role in}} lateral bud growth. The cross sectional area of canes or shoots were shown to have a linear relationship to their CHO content, which allowed for an estimation of the amount of CHOs required to obtain growth similar to the Control treatment. Additionally, main shoot leaf area can be used to predict total CHO content in the shoot at harvest. In the same experiment, the dates of flowering, flower number, berry number and grape berry soluble solids (SS) were measured for the inner and outer arm components of the basal and apical inflorescence and bunches separately (Chapter 3. 2). Restricting pre-BB CHOs resulted in the abortion of some pre-formed inflorescences and reduced branching of the inflorescences that did develop. In general, berry SS were greatest for the basal inner arm, followed by those of the apical bunch inner arm, then those of the basal bunch outer arm, then lastly by those of the apical bunch outer arm. However, this was influenced by the relative berry numbers between the inner and outer arm. Bunches with more similar berry numbers on the inner and outer arms had more synchronous flowering and uniform SS. The differences in SS were largely a reflection of the timing of flowering of the various inflorescence components and may be an important source of variation in SS within a vine at harvest. The effects of girdling shoots and / or periodic leaf removal post fruit set on the initiation and development of IP was studied (Chapter 4). Dormant latent buds from treatment shoots (shoot node positions one to ten) were grown as single node cuttings (SNCs). Inflorescence number per SNC and their architecture were scored for every SNC. Girdling increased the proportion of SNC basal bunches with an outer arm, but had no effect on the number if inflorescence structures per bud (fruitfulness). However, there was a decrease in fruitfulness per bud and in the proportion of SNC basal inflorescences with an outer arm when girdled shoots had their leaves removed at zero and four weeks post fruit set respectively. This chapter presents novel information regarding the timing of IP initiation, including the initiation and development of the outer arm. As well, for the first time, the {{formation of}} an outer arm is shown to be sensitive to girdling and / or leaf removal. The influence of temperature during IP initiation on the resulting fruitfulness, distribution and architecture over the course of two consecutive growing seasons, at a single vineyard (2 -Cane, 4 -Cane and <b>Spur</b> <b>pruning)</b> was studied (Chapter 5). The pruning system had no effect on the fruitfulness per bud, or on the resulting bunch architecture. Warmer temperatures during IP initiation were correlated to: an increase in fruitfulness; an increase in the occurrence of an outer arm; and a decrease in the basal bunch insertion point on a shoot. As well, an increase in cane cross sectional area correlated to an increase in the average fruitfulness per shoot along a cane, where the influence of cane cross sectional area on fruitfulness was consistent between seasons. Additionally, an increase in cane cross sectional area correlated to an increase in the average occurrence of an outer arm per shoot along a cane, where the influence of cane cross sectional area was greater when temperatures during IP initiation were cooler. Temperatures during winter dormancy and BB were altered to determine its influence on the timing of BB and the branching of IP structures (Chapter 6). Winter dormant buds were passively heated using plastic heating chambers for different periods during dormancy to BB. Heating buds from either July or August to BB advanced the date of BB and the start date of flowering for the basal inner arm component by 14 and 16 days respectively compared to the Control treatment. Heating buds during winter dormancy had no effect on the fruitfulness of buds, the distribution of inflorescence structures on shoots or on the identity of the structure occurring at the outer arm position. However, elevated bud temperatures 12 days pre-BB caused a statistically significant decrease in the flower number per shoot (P < 0. 05). Additionally, it was found that any delay in the start of flowering (which can be influenced by the date of BB, the position of the inflorescence on the shoot and / or the inflorescence component in question) is reflected in the accumulation of SS at harvest. The influence of temperature during IP initiation and CHO availability during BB were combined in a final experiment to improve the ability to predict when IP is occurring (Chapter 7). In this experiment, the influence of temperatures during IP initiation on fruitfulness and inflorescence architecture was studied between vineyards from separate growing regions throughout New Zealand. Winter dormant canes were harvested from each vineyard, and nodes three and ten were grown as SNCs. The volume of the SNC, inflorescence number, the position of the bunch on the SNC shoot and the occurrence of an outer arm were recorded. Inflorescence number and the occurrence of an outer arm increased as the volume of the SNC increased. The timing of IP initiation was predicted using stepwise regressions from 80 days pre to 90 days post 50 % flowering with a variable window of time. Regressions of average daily temperature during IP initiation versus bunch number and versus the occurrence of an outer arm resulted in a linear continuum between node three and node ten for both bunch number (R²= 0. 73) and the occurrence of an outer arm (R²= 0. 47). The results also indicate that the use of 50 % flowering as a reference point to calculate IP initiation is a valid alternative to destructively sampling buds to determine bud fruitfulness and IP architecture. This thesis provides an understanding of two of the major factors affecting bunch architecture, specifically outer arm development, which are temperature and CHO availability. The results indicate that temperature is likely the major factor influencing bunch architecture. Whereas CHO availability is a modifying factor, and is likely not to be an issue in New Zealand where grapevines are rarely CHO stressed...|$|E

Ground truth data was used to relate with images taken by the sensors and to test algorithms of image analysis. In this paper we present and discuss the relationships between actual and estimated yield computed using the surface occupied by the grape clusters in the images. Our preliminary results showed that, despite of a slight underestimation of the ground truth, caused mainly by cluster occlusion, when the canopy density allows visualization of most part of the clusters, the yield can be estimated by machine vision with a high fidelity.

These trellis systems were: upright vertical, cane pruned (double Guyot); upright vertical, <b>spur</b> <b>pruned</b> (bilateral cordon); Scott Henry, cane pruned; Lyre, cane pruned; and Geneva Double Curtain (GDC), cane pruned. In 1996, the double canopy systems had almost double the yield of the single canopy systems. There were no differences in yield or its components in 1997 among the five trellis systems. The bilateral cordon had a higher leaf area index than did the other systems. There were no differences in juice soluble solids, pH, or titratable acidity (TA) among the different trellis systems in either year. Also, {{there were no differences}} seen between the two canopies of the double canopy trellis systems in either year. There were no differences in sugar or starch concentrations in the trunk wood among the five trellis systems at any sample date. Sugar concentration in the trunk was highest during leaf fall and lowest at bloom on a dry weight basis. Starch concentration in the trunk was highest during dormancy and lowest during leaf fall and bud burst. Trunk volume was highest in the GDC and lowest in the Guyot. There was a negative correlation between most yield components and the carbohydrate concentration at bud burst. Leaf photosynthesis was strongly correlated with berry weight and skin anthocyanin content. In a separate study, yield components, fruit composition and wine quality of fruit generated in both curtains of the Scott Henry system were analyzed. In 1996, the bottom canopy had higher yield, cluster weight, more clusters per shoot and a higher TA than did the top canopy. Must soluble solids were not affected by vine canopy or sun orientation in 1996, but pH was lower and TA was higher in the bottom canopy. In 1997 the top canopy had a higher yield than did the bottom canopy. There were no canopy or orientation effects on leaf gas exchange, leaf area, shoot diameter, or intemode length.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{relationship}} between carotenoid contents in grapevine berries and plant water status. For this purpose, a black grapevine variety, Vitis vinifera L. cv. Touriga Nacional, was studied. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} same Douro vineyards, with plants of the same age, in two different water retention soils. A higher water retention capacity soil, soil A, and a lower water retention capacity soil, soil B, were both in a 1. 2 m deep silt-loam schist-derived soil. The training system was the double cordon trained and <b>spur</b> <b>pruned.</b> A first range was nonirrigated (NI) and a second one was irrigated (I), 60 % of evapotranspiration (ET 0). For soil B, a 30 % of ET 0 treatment was also applied. The plant water status was estimated by predawn leaf water potential. The effects of plant water status on berry growth were studied by measurement of the berry weight and total soluble solids (°Brix). The carotenoid profile was quantitatively determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array. Carotenoids determined were â-carotene, lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, and luteoxanthin. The comparison between irrigated and nonirrigated grapes was followed from 2 weeks before veraison until the ripe stage. Results showed that at harvest time, berries exposed to the NI had a lower weight than those exposed to the irrigated treatment (60 % of ET 0), 0. 89 vs 1. 36 g/berry and 0. 94 vs 1. 34 g/berry, for soils A and B, respectively. The irrigated treatment contributed to a higher sugar concentration in both soils. However, depending on the soil water retention capacity, the carotenoid contents were different in soils A and B. For soil A, the total carotenoid content was similar for both NI and I treatments. However, with regard to soil B, in irrigated treatment, levels of carotenoids were approximately 60 % lower than those found for the NI. It seems to be possible to produce higher weight berries (with higher sugar levels) with similar carotenoid contents. On the other hand, soil characteristics had a larger influence than irrigation on the concentration of carotenoids in grapes, resulting in an important viticultural parameter to take into account in aroma precursor formation...|$|R

The early defoliation determined a decrease in the number of berries per bunch (- 17 %) and the size of grapes at harvest (- 15 %) compared to the other thesis, moreover, did not affect the level of sugar at ripeness, leading to a significant increase of the phenol content (polyphenols, anthocyanins and total anthocyanins extracted). Instrumental analysis of phenol substances were perfectly compatible with those obtained by the of sensorial analysis panel which tested the berry maturity using a new method developed by our Department.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Plant Pathology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. In recent years, {{several studies}} have {{conclusively}} shown that numerous pathogens, including several species in the Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis, Phaeoacremonium, as well as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Eutypa lata, contribute to premature decline and dieback of grapevines. These pathogens {{have the ability to}} infect grapevines through pruning wounds, which leads {{to a wide range of}} symptoms developing that includes stunted growth, cankers and several types of wood necrosis. Pruning wounds stay susceptible for 2 to 16 weeks after pruning and sustained levels of pruning wound protection is therefore required. The aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the ability of several biological agents to protect pruning wounds, (ii) characterise unknown Trichoderma strains and identify their modes of action and (iii) determine the optimal time of season for biological agent application. Several biological agents were initially evaluated in a laboratory for their antagonism against trunk disease pathogens. The best performing control agents were tested in a field trial conducted on Merlot and Chenin blanc vines in the Stellenbosch region. <b>Spurs</b> were <b>pruned</b> to three buds and the fresh pruning wounds were treated with benomyl as a control treatment, Trichoderma-based commercial products, Vinevax® and Eco 77 ®, Bacillus subtilis, and Trichoderma isolates, USPP-T 1 and -T 2. Seven days after treatment the pruning wounds were spray inoculated with spore suspensions of four Botryosphaeriaceae spp. (Neofusicoccum australe, N. parvum, Diplodia seriata and Lasiodiplodia theobromae), Eutypa lata, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phomopsis viticola. After a period of 8 months the treatments were evaluated by isolations onto potato dextrose agar. Trichodermabased products and isolates in most cases showed equal or better efficacy than benomyl, especially USPP-T 1 and -T 2. Moreover, these isolates demonstrated a very good ability to colonise the wound tissue. The two uncharacterised Trichoderma isolates (USPP-T 1 and USPP-T 2), which were shown to be highly antagonistic toward the grapevine trunk disease pathogens, were identified by means of DNA comparison, and their ability to inhibit the mycelium growth of the trunk disease pathogens by means of volatile and non-volatile metabolite production studied. The two gene areas that were used include the internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and 2) and the 5. 8 S ribosomal RNA gene and the translation elongation factor 1  (EF). The ITS and EF sequences were aligned to published Trichoderma sequences and the percentage similarity determined and the two Trichoderma isolates were identified as Trichoderma atroviride. The volatile production of T. atroviride isolates was determined by placing an inverted Petri dish with Trichoderma on top of a dish with a pathogen isolate and then sealed with parafilm. Trichoderma isolates were grown for 2 days on PDA where after they were inverted over PDA plates containing mycelial plugs. The inhibition ranged from 23. 6 % for L. theobromae to 72. 4 % for P. viticola. Inhibition by non-volatile products was less than for the volatile inhibition. Inhibition ranged from 7. 5 % for N. parvum to 20. 6 % for L. theobromae. In the non-volatile inhibition USPP-T 1 caused significantly more mycelial inhibition than USPP-T 2. The timing of pruning wound treatment and subsequent penetration and colonisation of the wound site was also determined. One-year-old canes of the Shiraz and Chenin blanc cultivars were grown in a hydroponic system, pruned and spray treated with a spore suspension of Trichoderma atroviride (USPP-T 1) as well as a fluorescent pigment. On intervals 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after treatment, the distal nodes were removed and dissected longitudinally. From the one half, isolations were made at various distances from the pruning surface, while the other half was observed under ultra-violet light to determine the depth of fluorescent pigment penetration. Shortly after spray-inoculation of a fresh pruning wound, Trichoderma was isolated only from the wound surface and shallow depths into the wound (2 to 5 mm). One week after inoculation, Trichoderma was isolated at 10 mm depths, and after 2 weeks, at 15 mm depths. Fluorescent pigment particles were observed to a mean depth of 6 mm, which suggests that initial isolation of Trichoderma at these depths was resultant of the physical deposition of conidia deeper into the pruning wound tissue, whereas the isolation of Trichoderma from deeper depths might be attributed to colonisation of grapevine tissue. In a vineyard trial, fluorescent pigment was spray-applied to pruning wounds of Shiraz and Chenin blanc grapevines during July and September at intervals 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after pruning. One week after treatment, the distal nodes were removed and dissected longitudinally. Each half was observed under UV light and the pigment penetration measured. For Chenin blanc and Shiraz, July pruning wounds showed significant deeper penetration of the pigment than pruning wounds treated in September. Moreover, pruning wounds made in September showed pigment particles in longitudinal sections up to 1 day after pruning, whereas wounds made in July showed pigment particles up to 3 days in the xylem vessels. These findings suggest that the best time for application of a biological control agent should be within the first 24 hours after pruning...|$|R
