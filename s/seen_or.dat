5|$|By the 1920s, the kakapo was {{extinct in}} the North Island and its range and {{numbers in the}} South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> heard, and {{occasionally}} eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kakapo were becoming scarce.|$|E
5|$|Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) informs Black that, {{before his}} escape, Fabricant {{had married a}} {{correspondent}} he met through a prison pen-pal service. Watts and Black interview the woman, Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), at her home. Butler is adamant she has not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> heard from Fabricant since his escape. However, Black finds information on Butler's computer which he believes is linked to his own home address; and photographs of a judge who he recognizes as having been murdered.|$|E
5|$|Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{reported}} that Lawrence's DND (and consequently, his Telengard) was directly inspired by Whisenhunt and Wood's dnd for PLATO, with its randomized dungeons and minimalist graphics, though Lawrence recalled {{in an interview}} that he had not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> known of their game. Computer Gaming World Scorpia wrote that Telengard was based on the earlier, public domain software Castle Telengard.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Andrew Goldberg and {{directed}} by Julius Wu. It received praise from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.4 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jeff Bergman, Jamie Farr, Phil LaMarr, Wendy Raquel Robinson and Nicole Sullivan, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. This is the first episode where Meg was not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> mentioned.|$|E
5|$|The really curious part of {{this story}} is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they {{walked out of the}} inn in different directions, and were never <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> heard of again.|$|E
5|$|They {{are both}} naive {{about sex and}} technology. Tracy, for example, {{attempts}} to telephone Robert to inform him that he's lost his mobile phone, and believes {{that she is a}} lesbian when she discovers her husband in women's clothing. They have a baby, who is <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> referred to occasionally. This reflects, as the writer observes, Moffat's inexperience of looking after children at the time.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the Terran Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats to Char, despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, she has not been <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> heard from by any of the other characters.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be <b>seen,</b> <b>or</b> viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E

5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; he wanted the boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> spoken to each other.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time few players had <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E
5|$|Its growing rarity {{increased}} interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, {{the last two}} confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, {{off the coast of}} Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> caught are unconfirmed. A record of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} the group {{dispersed}} after the events. Peter the Painter was never <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> heard from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin's 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. Her eventual fate and date of death are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to live in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Raynor's rebel {{movement}} is contracted {{by a group}} called the Moebius Foundation to recover pieces of a Xel'Naga artifact which is ultimately used on Char by a combined force of Raynor's Raiders and Terran Dominion expeditionary fleet to deinfest the Queen of Blades, restoring Sara Kerrigan's humanity. After her deinfestation, Kerrigan is relentlessly pursued by Arcturus Mengsk; during one such raid Arcturus's Dominion forces capture and allegedly summarily execute the rebel commander. It is later revealed that Raynor was not in fact executed, but held prisoner as a hostage to keep Kerrigan in line. After being freed from his prison Raynor assists Kerrigan as she storms the Dominion capital of Augustgrad on the planet Korhal After a showdown with Arcturus Mengsk inside his Palace, Kerrigan manages to gain the upper hand with help from James Raynor, and kills Arcturus by overloading his body with psychic energy, causing him to explode spectacularly. In Legacy of the Void, Raynor and his Raiders are now part of the Dominion military under the new Emperor Valerian, and (with the aid of Artanis and his protoss forces) defend Korhal from an attack by Amon. Joining with Artanis and Kerrigan later on, Raynor watches as Kerrigan ascends to become a Xel'naga and destroys Amon once and for all; two years later, Kerrigan – in human form – visits Raynor at the bar on Mar Sara where he began in Wings of Liberty, and he leaves with her. He is not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> heard from again.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2014, Angle {{was named}} Executive Director of Wrestling Operations of TNA by TNA's Board of Directors. He {{announced}} a TNA World Heavyweight Championship rematch for the July 3 episode of Impact Wrestling between Lashley and Eric Young, and reinstated Bobby Roode, {{who had been}} indefinitely suspended by MVP. Angle also retired the TNA Television Championship, which had not been <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> defended since Abyss won it at Slammiversary 2013. On September 18, 2014 (aired on October 29 due to tape delay), Angle refereed the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between Bobby Roode and Bobby Lashley. Angle's contract with TNA was due to expire on September 14, 2014. Around this time {{he reached out to}} Vince McMahon to offer his services for a return to the WWE. Unbeknownst to him Triple H had taken over McMahon's former duties. Angle offered to return as a part-time wrestler due to concerns of his age and health. Angle was caught off guard when WWE declined his services. It is speculated that WWE only offered a full-time contract which Angle didn't accept or WWE declined his return due to past relationship issues with him. After he was denied by WWE, he quickly signed a part-time contract with TNA Wrestling. On September 21, 2014, Angle's contract with TNA expired, ending his eight-year tenure with the company. Angle teased a return to WWE, however, he was offered a full-time contract, so Angle decided to stay with TNA.|$|E

5|$|The BPF {{returned}} to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> detected that {{day or the}} next. One of Formidables Avengers made a successful landing aboard Indomitable with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating {{with one or two}} days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished for nearly an hour, not least because the electric motors driving the steel fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach Formidable early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines in July 1966, playing two {{shows at the}} Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila. Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady Imelda Marcos when {{presented}} with {{an invitation to a}} breakfast party. He had politely declined on behalf of the group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not <b>seen</b> <b>or</b> heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing {{that they would not be}} allowed back on the plane. Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane with Evans.|$|E
