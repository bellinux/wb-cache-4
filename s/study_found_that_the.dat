5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during {{the first four years}} of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May.

A <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hartebeest is able to digest a higher proportion of food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the International Resource Panel, {{hosted by}} the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), {{published}} the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries.

From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final consumption perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It {{became clear that the}} smog had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E

5|$|The {{highest quality}} {{evidence}} indicates that circumcision does not decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction.

However, the <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existing evidence is not very good. Another 2013 systematic review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect premature ejaculation.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 study {{compared}} mDNA {{sequences of}} modern wolves {{with those from}} 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000 and 1,200 years before present (YBP). The <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups. Haplogroups 1 and 2 could be found among wolves across Eurasia but only haplogroup1 {{could be found in}} North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup2, indicating its predominance in this region for over 40,000 years, {{both before and after the}} Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in Europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over the past several thousand years, but in North America haplogroup2including the Beringian wolfbecame extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. However, a 2016 study did not support the existence of two wolf haplogroups.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} {{the impact of the}} UCS on health care utilization.

First, using a trend analysis of health care utilization before and after <b>the</b> UCS, some <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of outpatient visits and/or inpatient admissions in designated facilities significantly increased after the UCS. Additionally, the increase was significantly higher in low-income groups (HISOR 2012; International Health Policy Program [IHPP] 2007 a; Limwattananon et al. 2011; Tangcharoensathien et al. 2007, 2013).|$|R
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 a {{residents}} progress {{association was}} formed. A prime goal was {{the building of}} a reservoir—supplied from the river—on Armidale hill overlooking the town. To defray costs and gain council acceptance, {{a large part of the}} work was performed by volunteers. This scheme began supplying the town on 17 February 1961. Up to the 1970s, Carrick's growth was limited by the lack of town sewerage—which restricted the minimum allotment size—and reluctance of landowner's to subdivide property. A 1977 planning <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land structure allowed most of the town to be served by a gravity fed system and recommended construction. As of 2008 the majority of the town was connected to reticulated water and sewerage.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, {{there was still a}} high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
