50|$|Steinitz' goby {{shares a}} large burrow system with alpheid shrimp such as Alpheus purpurilenticularis or Alpheus djeddensis. The goby {{does not take}} part in the {{burrowing}} and the shrimp does all the excavation in a sandy or <b>silty</b> <b>area</b> of the seabed. The burrow has one or more openings, the positions of which are altered as the shrimp engages in its burrowing activities. A new entrance may be opened after the goby pokes its head through the substrate from inside. Entrances can be moved by as much as 80 cm in a day with the location of {{the main part of the}} burrow remaining unchanged. The entrance may be reinforced by shell and coral fragments particularly before nightfall but still may collapse during the night, a time during which both partners remain inside the burrow. In the morning the shrimp is often seen bringing out sediment and depositing it nearby whereas in the evening, sediment is taken into the burrow, perhaps to allow feeding to take place during the night.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{measurements of}} sediments during the 2000 - 2001 Asian Seas International Acoustic Experiment in the East China Sea. A number of techniques {{were used to}} infer properties of these sediments, including gravity and piston cores, subbottom profiling using a water gun, long-range sediment tomography, and in situ measurement of conductivity. Historical data from echosounder records and cores showed two regions of surficial sediments in the experimental area: a <b>silty</b> <b>area</b> {{to the west and}} a sandy area to the east. The tomography, cores, and water-gun measurements confirm the two surficial sediment regions seen in the historical data and also indicate that the subbottom structure at the experimental site consists of a thin (0 - 3 m thick) layer of sandy sediment directly beneath the sea floor. Below this layer, there is an extensive package of sediment with relatively uniform acoustic attributes. Core analysis shows that the surface sediment layer varies in compressional wave speed from a low near 1600 m/s in {{the west side of the}} experiment area to 1660 m/s in the east side of the experiment area. Long-range sediment tomography inversions show a similar spatial variation in the surface layer properties.

40|$|Adaptation of {{agricultural}} practices according to {{requirements of the}} Nitrates Directive and validation through nitrates leaching follow up thanks to lysimeters. Since six years nitric nitrogen lixiviation is followed in six fields located in a <b>silty</b> <b>area</b> in Hesbaye (Belgium), mainly dedicated to vegetable crops. Open-field lysimeters are used, with the aim not to impede agricultural operations. These lysimeters allow the quantitative follow-up of the nitrate lixiviation below the root zone. The aims of the project are the setting up of better agricultural practices with regard to water quality on the one hand, and the adjustement of fertilization advice and {{the assessment of the}} impacts on yields, nitrogen remainder, and nitrate concentration in the water collected {{at the bottom of the}} lysimeter on the other hand. To reach these aims, experimental designs were set up in the parcels equiped with a lysimeter. These designs allow to test the impact of different levels of nitrogen fertilizers. An environmental indicator (APL in French) follow-up allows to make each year a report on the risk of nitrogen lixiviation related to the different objects tested on the subparcels. Finally, individual yields on the different subparcels are quantified to take the economic impact of the agricultural practices modification into account. During this test, the impact of a fertilization level reduction was just observed on the yields during double vegetable growing, only on the second crop. The other tests showed that a reduction of nitrogen fertilization level (in comparison with fertilization advice), and even, in some cases, no fertilization had no impact on yield and crop quality.

Predicting the effects of a range of possible LUCCs helps local authorities choose policies that can help to mitigate the risks to which local populations are exposed. In this article we build scenarios for changes in farming systems, with a 2015 horizon and with 2007 as the initial situation. These scenarios are assessed through combined biophysical and economic approaches. Two scenarios for the disappearance of dairy farming are chosen. One scenario has no public-action program (StopMilk), while the other one has a program based on the funding of best management practices (StopMilk-E). These scenarios are assessed at the small watershed scale (7 km 2) in terms of both changes in farming systems and effects on runoff (use of the STREAM model). Finally, the economic evaluation of additional costs of StopMilk-E is extrapolated {{at the level of the}} Austreberthe watershed syndicate (214 km 2), using the French Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) with a spatially referenced database of cropping plans. StopMilk leads to a significant increase in runoff whereas the local public-action program proposed under StopMilk-E reduces runoff to below the 2007 level. The Austreberthe watershed residents’ willingness to pay for a 15 -year program is around € 395, 000 /year, which is not sufficient to balance the cost of the modified farming practices (€ 640, 000 /year over the first 3 years). Funding of the practices would require either subsidies from a higher level (Europe), borrowing by the community, and/or a more selective approach in the type and the location of farming practices to be funded.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The spatial {{distribution}} and abundance patterns of benthic infauna result from interactions {{with a host}} of environmental variables including sediment characteristics (percent silt-clay, grain size, total organic carbon), depth, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. This thesis focuses on the association of bivalve assemblages and species with potentially influential environmental variables along the continental shelf of the Pacific Northwest. Data for this research comes from two surveys funded by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), conducted in 2010 and 2012. Across the six sites from northern California to Washington sampled in 2010, eight distinct bivalve assemblages were identified using non-metric multidimensional scaling and SIMPER analysis from the ecological software PRIMER 6. Environmental characteristics associated with each assemblage were determined. Percent silt-clay was the most useful environmental variable for distinguishing bivalve assemblages by habitat, with major differences between sandy and <b>silty</b> <b>areas.</b> Within predominantly sandy habitats, changes from one bivalve assemblage to another were associated with small differences in the remaining percentage of silt-clay in the sediment, whereas within predominantly silty habitats, changes in assemblage were associated with changes in depth, rather than exact percent silt-clay. Sediment was also associated, to varying extent, with the distributions of the most abundant bivalve species observed [...] Axinopsida serricata, Nutricola lordi, Ennucula tenuis, Macoma carlottensis, and Acila castrensis. While Axinopsida serricata was a soft-sediment generalist, Nutricola lordi was a specialist, restricted to very sandy (< 1 - 2 % silt-clay) sediment. High abundances of Ennucula tenuis were associated with specific combinations of depth, sediment type, and DO, while distribution of Acila castrensis was most associated with depth, sediment type, and TOC. Macoma carlottensis, which can function as either a suspension or deposit feeder, displayed the highest abundances in sediment with an equal mix of silt/sand and high TOC. Except for Nutricola lordi, biotic interactions or "missing" environmental variables not assessed here are likely at least as influential in structuring the {{spatial distribution}} of these species.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Nellis Dunes Recreational Area (Clark County, Nevada, USA) to investigate emission of dust produced by off-road driving. Experiments were carried out with three types of vehicles: 4 -wheelers (quads), dirt bikes (motorcycles) and dune buggies, on 17 soil types characteristic for a desert environment. Tests were done at various driving speeds, and emissions were measured for {{a large number of}} grain size fractions. This paper reports the results for two size fractions of emissions: PM 10 (particles < 10 mu m) and PM 60 (particles < 60 mu m). The latter was considered in this study to be sufficiently representative of the total suspendable fraction (TSP). Off-road driving was found to be a significant source of dust. However, the amounts varied greatly with the type of soil and the characteristics of the top layer. Models predicting emission of dust by off-road driving should thus consider a number of soil parameters and not just one key parameter. Vehicle type and driving speed are additional parameters that affect emission. In general, 4 -wheelers; produce more dust than dune buggies, and dune buggies, more than dirt bikes. Higher speeds also result in higher emissions. Dust emitted by off-road driving is less coarse than the parent sediment on the road surface. Off-road driving thus results in a progressive coarsening of the top layer. Exceptions to this are silty surfaces with no, or almost no, vegetation. For such surfaces no substantial differences were observed between the grain size distribution of road dust and emitted dust. Typical emission values for off-road driving on dry desert soils are: for sandy areas, 30 - 40 g km(- 1) (PM 10) and 150 - 250 g km(- 1) (TSP); for <b>silty</b> <b>areas,</b> 100 - 200 g km(- 1) (PM 10) and 600 - 2000 g km(- 1) (TSP); for drainages, 30 - 40 g km(- 1) (PM 10) and 100 - 400 g km(- 1) (TSP); and for mixed terrain, 60 - 100 g km(- 1) (PM 10) and 300 - 800 g km(- 1) (TSP).

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{concept of}} hydrological connectivity {{is difficult to}} quantify. Some indices have been proposed. The most cited is Borselli’s one. It mainly uses the DEM as input. The pixel size may strongly impacts {{the result of the}} calculation. It has not been studied yet in <b>silty</b> <b>areas.</b> Another important aspect is the choice of the weighting factor which strongly influences the index value. The objective of this poster is so to compare 8 different DEM’s resolutions (12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 204, 504 and 996 cm) and 3 different weighting factors (factor C of Wischmeier, Manning’s factor and rugosity index) in the Borselli’s index calculation. The IC was calculated in a 124 ha catchment (Hevillers), in the loess belt, in Belgium. The DEM used is coming from a UAV with a maximum resolution of 12 cm. Permanent covered surfaces are not considered in order to avoid artefact due to the vegetation (2 % of the surface). Regarding the DEM pixel size, the IC increases for a given pixel when the pixel size decreases. That confirms some results observed in the Alpine region by Cavalli (2014). The mean difference between 12 cm and 10 m resolution is 35 % with higher values up to 100 % for higher connectivity zones (flow paths). Another result is the lower impact of connections in the watershed (grass strips…) at lower pixel sizes. This is linked to the small width of some connections which are sometimes comparing to cell size. Furthermore, a great loss of precision is observed from the 500 cm pixel size and upper. That remark is quite intuitive. Finally, some very well disconnected zones appear for the highest resolutions. Regarding the weighting factor, IC values calculated using C factor are lower than with the rugosity index which is only a topographic factor. With very high resolution DEM, it permits to represent the fine topography. For the C factor, the zones up to very well disconnected areas (grass strips, wood…) are well represented with lower index values than downstream zones. On the contrary, areas up to very well connected zones (roads, paths…) are higher and much more connected than downstream areas. For the Manning’s factor, the values are very low and not very well contrasted. This factor is not enough discriminant for this study. In conclusion, high resolution DEM (1 meter or higher) is needed for the IC calculation (precison, impact of connections…). Very high resolution permits to identify very well disconnected areas but it multiplies the calculation time. For the weighting factor, rugosity index and C factor have each some advantages. It is planned to test other approaches for the IC calculation...|$|R

These <b>areas</b> contain slightly <b>silty</b> sand and friable silty clay loam, and are located near two sets of boreholes (∼ 200 meters apart) within the Rio Bosque Park. ^ The seasonal fluctuation of the water table depth is a function of the amount of rain, irrigation and river levels.

To establish the reliability of the geophysical techniques, I conducted several experiments in both the laboratory and the field to verify the velocity profiles of dry and saturated materials at the two sites. ^ The downhole seismic, SASW and DC resistivity techniques all provided three-layer soil models with layer thicknesses and properties consistent with the known depth to the water table. The seismic refraction technique, however, overestimates the water table depth by three factors. The SASW method appears to be the best technique for locating the water table, with estimates within ∼ 20 cm of true water table depth. ...|$|R

In this paper, taking the typical continental naturally fractured silty laminae shale in China as anexample, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize multiple hydraulic fracturing parameters to maximize the stimulated area in combination with numerical modeling based on the coupled flow-stress-damage (FSD) approach. This paper demonstrates hydraulic fracturing effectiveness by defining two indicesnamelythe stimulated reservoir area (SRA) and stimulated <b>silty</b> laminae <b>area</b> (SLA). Seven uncertain parameters, such as laminae thickness, spacing, dip angle, cohesion, internal friction angle (IFA), in situ stress difference (SD), and an operational parameter-injection rate (IR) with a reasonable range based on silty Laminae Shale, Southeastern Ordos Basin, are used to fit a response of SRA and SLA as the objective function, and finally identity the optimum design under the parameters based on simultaneously maximizingSRA and SLA. In addition, asensitivity analysis of the influential factors is conducted for SRA and SLA.

40|$|Soil {{strength}} {{is defined as}} the resistance which as to be overcome to obtain a given soil deformation. Amongst the numerous methods developed to measure soil strength, two are classically used. On one hand, a laboratory method based on triaxial tests of undisturbed soil samples allows the estimation of cohesion and internal friction angle by the Mohr-Coulomb equation. On the other hand, measuring soil penetration resistance by pushing a cone into a soil is a widely used technique. Both techniques deliver discontinuous field information and are not suited to produce digital soil mapping. The objectives of this paper are to present a sensor able to continuously measure soil strength variations. The sensor was constituted of a thin blade pulled in the soil at a constant depth and speed and a beam which transferred the soil-blade forces to a transducer fixed on a vehicle. The transducer measures the draft force Fx, the vertical force Fz and the moment My thanks to an octagonal ring dynamometer. A measurement chain was developed to acquire simultaneously the signals provides by the soil strength sensor and those of a DGPS. Signal processing was notably based on geostatistics and allows soil mapping [1]. Four fields representative of the soils used in <b>silty</b> <b>areas</b> for arable production in Belgium were selected. The measurements were repeated several times during 1999 - 2003. Targeted test plots were chosen in each field to perform reference measurements, namely granulometry, cohesion, friction angle, pF, water content, dry bulk density, and cone index. The within-field studies revealed high variability caused by texture, history, traffic, etc., and showed a correlation between the sensor signals and physical parameters, such as cone index and soil moisture, as long as no over-consolidation of the soil occurred [2]. To assess the similarity of soil strength between the fields, the data Fx, Fz and My were classified by using canonical variates (CV). The two first CV represented 95. 9 % of the variability, which means that two main variables contain the essential part of the information. In a plane (Fz, Fx), three clusters could be distinguished. The first one (trials 1 and 5), characterized by a low draft and a high Fz, corresponded to trials performed in March on soils ploughed during the winter, naked or covered with small vegetation, and characterized by small values of cone index. The second one (trials 2, 3, 4, 7) with high values of Fx and Fz grouped measurements done just after wheat harvest in August. The third cluster (trials 6) corresponded to measurements performed during wheat growth. It may be concluded that the signals from the sensor treated by suited statistical analysis have the potential to differentiate soil structures at a field scale.

Identification of buried, but well-defined, Canopic channels pro-vides baselines for renewed archaeological exploration in this delta sector. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Apogonichthyoides taeniatus {{also known}} as two belt {{cardinal}} and striped cardinalfish, this species was named: Apogon taeniatus and Apagon bifasciatus, but Apogonichthyoides taeniatus accepted now. It is a marine fish of subtropical climate and associated coastal reefs and mangroves. A. taeniatus is an extremely cryptic species. It is virtually never seen during the day. A. taeniatus {{also appears to be}} a very shallow water species. A. taeniatus is found in seagrass beds or areas with heavy algal growth. A. taeniatus is easily confused with A. pseudotaeniatus, which has a similar color pattern. A. taeniatus inhabits coastal shallow <b>silty</b> and mangrove <b>areas</b> and usually found at depths between 5 – 20 m. It can grow up to 5 cm maximum. We report for the first time from Iranian Waters) Persian Gulf, Kish Island), we found it at depth from 3 m, and Maximum length is 4 cm in Kish Island (Iranian Waters). Males incubate eggs in buccal cavity. Embryos do not feed externally in the buccal cavity. Distinct pairing during courtship and spawning. Internal fertilization and paternal care by mouth brooding is found to be a rare combination of reproductive strategy...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the grain-size and clay-mineral {{compositions}} of 73 surface sediment samples {{collected in}} a variety of environmental settings in the White Sea are presented to characterize recent sedimentation processes, reconstruct transport pathways, and identify potential source areas of the terrigenous components. Areas > 100 m deep are invariably characterized by <b>silty</b> clay, whereas <b>areas</b> < 100 m deep exhibit more heterogeneous grain-size compositions plausibly explained by coastal erosion and (re-) distribution mechanisms, particularly tidal currents. The dominance of sand in the estuarine areas of the Onega and Dvina rivers as well as toward Gorlo Strait connecting the White Sea with the Barents Sea, is attributed to increased current speeds. Illite and smectite are the dominant clay minerals in recent sediments of the southwestern and eastern White Sea sectors, respectively. Their distribution patterns largely depend on the geology of the source areas and mirror surface circulation patterns, especially in Dvina Bay. Smectite is a key clay mineral in White Sea surface sediments as it reveals the dominating influence of the Northern Dvina's runoff on sedimentation and water circulation throughout the basin of the sea. In comparison to other Eurasian shelf seas, the White Sea is characterized by a greater diversity of clay-mineral assemblages, which range from illite- to smectite-dominated sectors containing variable amounts of chlorite and kaolinite...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a report}} of field {{research}} on Karezes in Turpan and Hami in 1988. Both districts are in Xinjiang, China. The research was conducted by the Xingjiang Institute of Biology, Pedology and Desert Research Chinese Academy of Sciences (XIBPDR) and an exploratory party from Japan sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Much information was obtained on Karezes. For example, how to excavate them, the equantity of ground-water, how to maintain them, how to use their water for fields and present their troubles in Turpan and Hami. This abstract shows the troubles of Karezes, their vitalization and mentions conservation of water-resources in the future. We appreciate Xinjiang Bureau of Water Conservancy (XBWC) for their important information and suggestions. But this briefing is private and the first author takes the responsibility for mistakes. 1. Lowering of the Ground-water Table The biggest problem of the Karezes in Turpan and Hami is lowering of the ground-water table. The Karezes depend on ground-water but many Karezes excavated when the ground-water table was moderate high. Lowering of the ground-water table can not keep this condition and serves poor water resources. The construction of open channels in 1960 - 1970 s to get snow-melt water from the Tien Shan Mts., was possibly due to lowering the ground-water table. Snow-melt water flow in many rivers infiltrates the desert land from the river beds. This infiltration has enriched the ground-water of Turpan and Hami for a long time. But new open channels convey water to fields directly and do not give the river-flow enough time to infiltrate the desert land. The ground-water has thus decreased considerably. Today, thousands of small pump stations pump ground-water for irrigation in Turpan and Hami but they also lower the ground-water table. The ground-water table is thus not available for many Karezes. The great success of agricultural and industrial development in Turpan and Hami is due to water resources development and conservation by those pumps and open channels. But the Karezes are suffering from little water due to modern water facilities. 2. Breakdown of the inner walls of Karez Most outlets of the Karezes are near villages or vegetable fields, i. e. oasis. The soil around an oasis is silty. Silty soil is good for vegetable growth {{but not for the}} structure of Karezes. When silty soil becomes moisture, it becomes loosely. Flow of a Karez gives moisture to the inner wall and makes erosion continuously along the watered lower part of the wall. After a moderate time, the walls become weak and falls down. This situation has continues for a long time. The diameter of a Karez becomes bigger and bigger under a <b>silty</b> soil <b>area.</b> This is very dangerous for the people of a village, because big diameter thins top soil of a Karez near the outlet. In fact, there are many big hole-rows in some villages caused by dropping of top soil. When soil deposits on the bed of a Karez, flow is dammed up leading to greater depth. This causes water loss through infiltration by high water depth pressure. 3. Possibility of Water Pollution The success of agricultural development in Turpan and Hami depends also on popularization of chemical fertilizer. But this may lead to ground-water pollution, because some Karezes get seepage water from vegetable fields. If water contains excess chemical fertilizer, pollution will eventually result. 4. Vitalization To lessen the decrease in ground-water flow, the bureau and farmers try to extend a Karez toward the up-stream to obtain more water but without success in some cases. The basic problem of Karezes is the lowering of ground-water. So, the bureau has recommended farmers to keep their pump stations away from the under-ground way of a Karez. This is good policy to conserve the ground-water table. But to farmers who want to get much water and produce much food, the pump station is more convenient and reliable. Pumping ground-water will be more popular and facilities larger in next ten years possibly. But this may lead to serious problems for Karezes. XBWC is trying to recharge the ground-water by flood flow every year. When heavy rain falls in the Tien Shan Mts., they forecast the time that the flood water will reach the desert. This will lead to good results provided the farmers work here. Vitalization of Karezes depends on recharging the ground-water over a long period. In a short term, extension of their length and protect work for seepage from inner wall of Karez are good policies. In any case, the vitalization must {{be a part of the}} strategy of water resources development and conservation for the Tien Shan Mts., in the near future. 5. Renovation of the Water Delivery System Farmers in the vicinity of an oasis share water from Karezes very strictly. They have a conventional water delivery system for villages and fields. The system is very good, because all farmers can obtain water easily and equally. Only the quantity of water may be inadequate. To improve the system, field research for unit water requirement of crops and vegetables is needed. The results of this research and appropriate improvement of form and dimensions of fields may save water for fallow irrigation. Most delivery channels from Karezes are made by soil. Sometimes a channel breaks and water flows into roads and other places. To prevent spillover and seepage, seal materials for channel beds and walls are needed. Attention should be directed to the fact that when a channel is covered by seal, flow condition change. If the new design discharge for sealed channel is equal to old one, flow velocity will increase causeing water depth to be low. These improvement, research and work have already been started and strongly supported by XIBPDR and XBWC. But the difficulty is not research but money. 6. Observation of Ground-water To vitalize Karezes, we need more precise data on ground-water moving in the desert. LAND-SAT clearly showed the ground-water or soil moisture everywhere on the earth. Unfortunately continuous data are not available on it. We must create an observation system for ground-water and on which the future supply of water for the Karezes will depend. The Tien Shan Mts., await future development of water resources and water power generation. Some Karezes will obtain water from the Tien Shan Mts., as a result. Some inner walls will be sealed to become under-ground reservoirs for excess flood water...|$|R
