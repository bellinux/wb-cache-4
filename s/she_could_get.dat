5|$|Nevada was refloated on 12 February 1942 and {{underwent}} temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to Puget Sound Navy Yard for a {{major overhaul}} and modernization. This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance so she slightly resembled a South Dakota from a distance. Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. Nevada then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11–18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu.|$|E
5|$|Lydia {{finds out}} Sarah is bribing Holly Cunningham (Lydia Waters) to befriend Persephone so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> closer to her, leaving things awkward between the girls. The next day, Lydia allays her fears to Sarah over {{relationships}} {{and the girls}} seal it with a kiss, which Michaela sees. Sarah and Lydia then begin a full relationship. It is revealed that out of her family, Persephone {{is the only one}} who knows of Lydia's sexuality. Lydia replaces Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) as the drummer of Josh's band 'The Somethings' as he kicked him out because he was against having wheelchair user Hayley Ramsey (Kelly Marie Stewart) as the lead singer because of their bad breakup. Lydia is later kicked out of the band due to unreliability.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E

5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Dick about his {{relationship}} with Betina. Veronica talks to one of Betina’s friends, who says that Dick mistreated her, and Betina’s goal was for Dick to get her pregnant so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him in trouble. Veronica asks Keith about whether or not he has resumed a relationship with Rebecca, and Veronica gets into Stanford University. Veronica is pushed into second place at the Kane scholarship after Angie. Rebecca denies having a relationship with Keith, while Angie also gets into Stanford. Wallace points out Rhonda’s sister to Veronica, but she doesn’t give Veronica any information. Veronica asks Keith to dig into the financial records of the bus crash victims. Veronica learns that none of the families had very much money, except for Rhonda’s family, who got a $2 million bailout from Woody (Steve Guttenberg).|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did work}} for {{publishers}} other than Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation on his part, and partly to Dick Giordano's inking, which exhibited a different line weight. That same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist if he took the job, told Schultz he would only do it if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility in handling comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E
25|$|Jon Lovitz as Artie Firestone (season 2–3), {{a mentally}} {{unstable}} billionaire who is {{heir to the}} Firestone family fortune. In season two, while disowned by his family and homeless, he became engaged to Joy so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> her green card. In season three, he began taking medication for his mental illness and was welcomed back into the Firestone family. The character's name and personal fortune is a reference to another character played by Lovitz, Artie Ziff, on The Simpsons.|$|E

6000|$|... "Papa!" [...] she said, {{clinging}} to him. She {{had meant to}} assure him that that sorrow should never be his, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> beyond the one word.|$|R
25|$|Faithfull {{lived on}} London's Soho streets for two years, {{suffering}} from heroin addiction and anorexia nervosa. Friends intervened and enrolled {{her in an}} NHS drug programme, from which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> her daily fix on prescription from a chemist. She failed at controlling or stabilising her addiction at that time. In 1971, producer Mike Leander found her {{on the streets and}} made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album Rich Kid Blues. The album was shelved until 1985.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{consider}} national defense, {{a standard}} {{example of a}} pure public good. Suppose homo economicus thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all {{of the millions of}} other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that he or <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> injured or killed during the course of his or her military service.|$|E
25|$|Dushku {{intended}} to attend Suffolk University in Boston, {{where her mother}} taught at the time, but her agent asked her to submit a videotape audition for a show starring another of his clients, Sarah Michelle Gellar. After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local Claire's to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part, Faith on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When she began her work on that series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive emancipation to work the production's long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of that show, jokingly {{said that she would}} sign the emancipation order if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a signed photo from Dushku.|$|E

25|$|Mireille {{spent all}} of 1966 and 1967 touring. It was then, during a car ride to another concert, that Stark advised Mireille that she was finally debt free, and worth {{more than a million}} francs ($200k USD in 1967). She had always prayed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> her family out of poverty, but the touring and singing were much more {{important}} at the time. In her autobiography, she stated her first major purchases were a vehicle for her father's business and a large home for her parents and siblings. Most importantly, she had a telephone installed for the family, so her parents no longer {{had to go to the}} pharmacy to talk to her while she was in Paris. Her one regret, was that she was unable to see her grandmother Germaine in the hospital before she died because of all the tour contracts.|$|E
25|$|In March 1983, {{under two}} years before EastEnders first episode was broadcast, the show was a vague idea {{in the mind of}} a handful of BBC executives, who decided that what BBC1 needed was a popular {{bi-weekly}} drama series that would attract the kind of mass audiences that ITV was getting with Coronation Street. The first people to whom David Reid, then head of series and serials, turned were Julia Smith and Tony Holland, a well established producer/script editor team who had first worked together on Z-Cars. The outline that Reid presented was vague: two episodes a week, 52 weeks a year. After the concept was put to them on 14 March 1983, Smith and Holland then went about putting their ideas down on paper; they decided it would be set in the East End of London. Granada Television gave Smith unrestricted access to the Coronation Street production for a month so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a sense how a continuing drama was produced.|$|E
25|$|Chloe Lane {{returns to}} Salem. She had {{previously}} {{given birth to}} a son, whom she had named Parker Jonas. The supposed truth came out at Parker's baptism in front of family and friends that Philip Kiriakis was Parker's father, leading {{to the end of the}} marriage between Chloe and Daniel. Having lost him, Chloe sank into a state of post partum depression and tried to commit suicide. Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, Chloe attempts to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, revealing to Daniel that Parker really is his son and that the earlier supposed DNA test results had been fake. Hoping <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Daniel back, Chloe blackmails Jennifer into rejecting Daniel by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker. Chloe goes so far as to have her mother Nancy prepare to take Parker to Brazil without telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital to protect Daniel from losing access to his son while never revealing her true feelings.|$|E
60|$|Gyp {{listened with}} a bitter smile. Money, too! But {{what did it}} matter? <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> out {{of what she had}} done. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> never <b>get</b> out. Tonight he would kiss her; and she would pretend it was all right. And so it would go on and on! Well, it was her own fault. Taking twelve shillings from her purse, she put them aside on the bureau to give the maid. And {{suddenly}} she thought: 'Perhaps he'll get tired of me. If only he would get tired!' That was a long way the furthest she had yet gone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why ARE you {{behaving}} in this IMPOSSIBLE and ridiculous fashion.' But she was sullen, she half shoved the question out of herself. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> it clean away, so she felt self-conscious.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the family}} members told {{investigators}} that civilians in Villa Purificación were scared {{to reach out to the}} government for help because they feared reprisals from the Army. They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on May 1 in Villa Purificación. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Peña Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One {{of the family}} members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> close to the bodies to see if any of them corresponded to her missing relative, the soldier told her that they were not getting their bodies back and that they would let the corpses rot. The lady claimed that the soldier told her that they killed those people because they were responsible for death of their comrades.|$|E
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
500|$|Gore's abrupt {{decision}} {{to run for}} the open seat surprised even himself; he later said that [...] "I didn't realize myself I had been pulled back so much to it." [...] The news came as a [...] "bombshell" [...] to his wife. Tipper Gore held a job in The Tennesseans photo lab and was working on a master's degree in psychology, but she joined in her husband's campaign (with assurance that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> her job at The Tennessean back if he lost). By contrast, Gore asked his father to stay out of his campaign: [...] "I must become my own man," [...] he explained. [...] "I must not be your candidate." ...|$|E
50|$|Corazon {{suffered}} embarrassment as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not pay her bills {{plus the}} fact that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> along well with her neighbors.

500|$|Hügel-Marshall {{performed}} well at school, often finishing {{top of the}} class, and taught herself to swim, but was still patronised by the nuns teaching her, who said [...] "we never expected much from you". Teachers told her she would never amount to anything: she would be promiscuous, have children out of wedlock, become an alcoholic, and do no better than find a job in childcare. She begged {{to go to a}} school where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> higher education and become a teacher, but instead she was transferred to a boarding school where she was taught how to work with young children. After two years of training she was unable to find employment, although her white roommate immediately found a position.|$|E
500|$|Agudath Israel hired Cynthia [...] "Cyndie" [...] Culpeper as rabbi in 1995. Culpeper, {{a convert}} from Catholicism and former nurse, had been posted at Agudath Israel as a rabbinical intern, and was hired there {{full-time}} upon graduation from the JTSA, the first Conservative woman rabbi in Alabama. However, {{the following year}} she revealed that she had AIDS, {{the result of an}} accidental needle prick while working as a nurse. The congregation rallied around her, insisting she continue to work, and wearing red AIDS awareness ribbons, but in 1997 she gave up her position and moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> [...] "cutting edge" [...] treatment at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's AIDS research clinic. Culpeper died in 2005.|$|E
500|$|During Adams' tenure, {{the college}} {{acquired}} a new mascot, {{the first since}} the original Reveille died in 1944. Reveille II, like the original Reveille, was cared for and attended to by band members. During halftime performances, the young dog was allowed {{to be on the}} field with the band without her leash. During these breaks where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> out and run, she had a tendency to [...] "do her business" [...] on Kyle Field's playing surface. This didn't bother the band members much, as Reveille stayed away from the band, but Adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yardline the dog would defecate. He quickly ended the practice and turned the responsibility of caring for Reveille over to Company E-2, which has since been called the Mascot Company.|$|E
