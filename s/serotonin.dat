5|$|<b>Serotonin</b> {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), <b>serotonin</b> norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess <b>serotonin</b> on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra <b>serotonin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic side effects and <b>serotonin</b> toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. <b>Serotonin</b> syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from <b>serotonin</b> syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system <b>serotonin</b> will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have clinically significant potency as <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E
5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the <b>serotonin</b> reuptake transporter, which increase <b>serotonin</b> concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding <b>serotonin</b> receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} <b>serotonin</b> {{syndrome}} are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of <b>serotonin</b> syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase <b>serotonin</b> levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop <b>serotonin</b> syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{consists of}} discontinuing medications {{which may be}} contributing. In those who are agitated benzodiazepines may be used. If this is not sufficient, a <b>serotonin</b> antagonist such as cyproheptadine may be used. In those with a high body temperature active cooling measures may be needed. The {{number of cases of}} <b>serotonin</b> syndrome that occur each year is unclear. With appropriate treatment the risk of death is less than one percent. The high-profile case of Libby Zion, who is generally accepted to have died from <b>serotonin</b> syndrome, resulted in changes to graduate medical education in New York State.|$|E
5|$|It is {{theorized that}} the use of birth control pills should affect eating {{behaviour}} as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The neurotransmitter <b>serotonin</b> is also thought {{to play a role in}} food intake. <b>Serotonin</b> is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of <b>serotonin</b> syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of <b>serotonin</b> syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of <b>serotonin</b> antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from <b>serotonin</b> antagonists. The <b>serotonin</b> antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for <b>serotonin</b> syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from <b>serotonin</b> antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with <b>serotonin</b> antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of <b>serotonin</b> toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. <b>Serotonin</b> is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess <b>serotonin.</b> The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of <b>serotonin</b> syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch <b>serotonin.</b> In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
5|$|Other neurotransmitters, such as <b>serotonin</b> and {{glutamate}} {{also show}} {{a decline in}} output with aging.|$|E
5|$|Serotonergic drugs (such as most antidepressants) co-administered with {{amphetamine}} {{increases the}} risk of <b>serotonin</b> syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Several {{articles}} published {{near the end}} of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone, compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone. Dopamine and <b>serotonin</b> were collected using microdialysis, and increases in dopamine and <b>serotonin</b> were measured using HPLC. Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, and drug half-life plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in <b>serotonin.</b> They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in <b>serotonin</b> at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in dopamine. Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in dopamine, peaking at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in <b>serotonin.</b> Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine (DA) and <b>serotonin</b> (5-HT) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a <b>serotonin</b> releaser, with a ratio of 1.22:1 (<b>serotonin</b> vs. dopamine). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. Mephedrone had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{recognized}} example of <b>serotonin</b> syndrome was {{the death of}} Libby Zion in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Tryptophan is a {{precursor}} of the neurotransmitter <b>serotonin.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 2015 review found {{a larger}} effect with {{medications}} than talk therapy. Medications with benefit include serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{medications}} and street drugs can cause <b>serotonin</b> syndrome when taken alone at high doses or {{in combination with other}} serotonergic drugs. The table below lists some of these drugs.|$|E
5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective <b>serotonin</b> {{receptor}} agonist {{on a wide variety}} of <b>serotonin</b> receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|Cases have {{reported}} muscle pain and weakness persisting for months, and antidepressant discontinuation {{may contribute to}} ongoing features. Following appropriate medical management, <b>serotonin</b> syndrome is generally associated with a favorable prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{does not}} support the use of {{selective}} <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), antipsychotics, or gabapentin.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone is a monoamine {{releasing}} agent. It is a chiral {{compound and}} both of its enantiomers display similar potency as substrates at dopamine transporters. R-Mephedrone is much less potent than S-mephedrone as a substrate at <b>serotonin</b> transporters.|$|E
5|$|Premature or {{spontaneous}} ejaculation {{is treated}} with antidepressants including selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors, which {{are known to}} delay ejaculation as a side effect.|$|E
5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} <b>serotonin,</b> a marker of platelet activation. If this <b>serotonin</b> release assay (SRA) shows high <b>serotonin</b> release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion {{has been found}} to be more effective than selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms. There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} with medications {{similar to those used}} in the general population. Selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while atypical antipsychotic drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.|$|E
5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of <b>serotonin.</b> This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release <b>serotonin,</b> which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, <b>serotonin</b> and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{discontinuation}} of serotonergic drugs, {{most cases}} of <b>serotonin</b> syndrome resolve within 24 hours, although {{in some cases}} delirium may persist {{for a number of}} days. Symptoms typically persist for a longer time frame in patients taking drugs which have a long elimination half-life, active metabolites, or a protracted duration of action.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A <b>serotonin</b> receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective <b>serotonin</b> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. Swarming behaviour {{is a response to}} overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of <b>serotonin.</b> This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E
5|$|Neurotoxic {{effect of}} {{mephedrone}} on <b>serotonin</b> (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems remains controversial. Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to DA nerve endings in the striatum and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is a {{tryptamine}} compound with {{a chemical}} structure containing an indole ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter <b>serotonin.</b> Psilocybin {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several <b>serotonin</b> receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high {{affinity}} for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. <b>Serotonin</b> receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E
5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to <b>serotonin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The human {{dopamine}} transporter {{contains a}} high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. binding site with three coordinating residues on its extracellular face (His193, His375, and Glu396).... Thus, when Zn2+ is co-released with glutamate, it may greatly augment the efflux of dopamine.}} The human <b>serotonin</b> transporter and norepinephrine transporter {{do not contain}} zinc binding sites.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, <b>serotonin</b> syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
