40|$|The {{objective}} of the work was to select a suitable methodology for accelerated corrosion tests of single-layer coating compositions (hereinafter referred to as CC), to assess the condition of coatings during corrosion tests and to evaluate {{the resistance of the}} monitored single-layer CCs after the completion of the tests in selected corrosive environments. The results were used for the determination of the potential use of the selected single-layer coating compositions in agricultural environments. The following single-layer, water-based CCs were applied to sheet steel samples: V 2026, Aquapol_J and Denapox EZ. The following synthetic CCs were selected: AR 40 - 00, Krahokryl_J and ACS 20 -ST. The resistance of these coatings was tested in 5 corrosive environments: in NaCl environment according to CSN EN ISO 7253, in SO 2 environment according to CSN EN ISO 3231 and in the environment of a condensation chamber with de-ionized water according to CSN 03 8131. To simulate agricultural environments, solutions of the Cererit fertilizer and pig <b>semi-liquid</b> <b>manure</b> were selected. The samples were left in the condensation chamber in aqueous environment according to CSN 03 8131 for 8 hours and then soaked in Cererit or <b>semi-liquid</b> <b>manure</b> and left in the laboratory environment for 16 hours. Samples were evaluated according to CSN EN ISO 4628 - 1, 2, 3. The water-based CC Denapox EZ and the synthetic CC AR 40 - 00 reached the best results...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} a field {{experiment}} established in 1995 and still on going. It is located in Lodi, in the irrigated lowlands of Lombardy, Northern Italy. The experiment compares two rotations: the annual double cropping system, Italian ryegrass + silage maize (R 1); and the 6 -year rotation, in which three years of double crop Italian ryegrass + silage maize are followed by three years of alfalfa harvested for hay (R 6) Each rotation have received two types of dairy manure: i) farmyard manure (FYM); ii) <b>semi-liquid</b> <b>manure</b> (SLM). The intent was to apply to each unit land area the excreta produced {{by the number of}} adult dairy cows sustained, in terms of net energy, by the forage produced in each rotation, corresponding to about 6 adult cows ha- 1 for R 1 and 4 adult cows ha- 1 for R 6. Manure was applied with (N 1) or without (N 0) an extra supply of mineral N in the form of urea. The objectives of this study were: i) to assess whether the recycling of two types of manure in two forage rotation systems can sustain crop yields in the medium and long term without additional N fertilization; ii) to evaluate the nutrient balance of these integrated forage rotations and manure management systems; iii) to compare the effects of farmyard manure and <b>semi-liquid</b> <b>manure</b> on soil organic matter. The application of FYM, compared to SLM, increased yield of silage maize by 19 % and alfalfa by 23 %, while Italian ryegrass was not influenced by the manure treatment. Yet, silage maize produced 6 % more in rotation R 6 compared to rotation R 1. The mineral nitrogen fertilization increased yield of Italian ryegrass by 11 % and of silage maize by 10 %. Alfalfa, not directly fertilized with mineral nitrogen, was not influenced by the nitrogen applied to the other crops in rotation. The application of FYM, compared to SLM, increased soil organic matter (SOM) by + 37 % for the rotation R 1, and by + 20 % for the rotation R 6. Conversely, no significant difference on SOM was observed between R 1 and R 6 with the application of SLM. However, the maize stover used for composting FYM was produced by crops not included in the rotations R 1 and R 6, consequently the increase of soil carbon was counterbalanced by a deprivation of carbon in other land areas...|$|E
40|$|Application {{of animal}} manure is {{restricted}} in water protection areas in Germany to avoid microbial contamination {{of drinking water}} supplies. The potential of a newly designed AD process scheme for the control of pathogens in cattle manure is being investigated in a joint project of Bavarian research institutions and local water suppliers. Experiments are being conducted in a pilot plant (total digester volume: 250 m 3) located on a dairy cattle farm sized {{for the treatment of}} <b>semi-liquid</b> <b>manure</b> (7 to 10 % m/m dry matter) from 100 livestock units (approximately 2, 000 m 3 /a). The plant consists of a sequence of three anaerobic digesters operating at different temperature levels (mesophilic-thermophilic-mesophilic â€“ "MesTherMes") to optimize the destruction {{of a wide range of}} pathogenic organisms. Using solely semi-liquid cattle manure as it was produced on the farm, the AD process in the pilot biogas plant could be established within about 2. 5 months. Technical and operational problems particularly with the heating system prevented the plant from reaching steady-state conditions during the time period reported here. In preliminary experiments the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) -method in parallel with conventional cultivation techniques was successfully applied to determine the fate of indicator microorganisms in the pilot biogas plant. The required time for a complete qPCR-analysis was only 6 - 8 h as opposed to 24 - 72 h for cultivation. Higher values from the qPCR-analyses compared to cultivation assays for certain bacteria / bacterial groups indicated differences in specificity, and detection of microorganisms in a dormant, non-cultivable state by the qPCR-method...|$|E
40|$|Fish pond {{manuring}} {{is often}} used in fish farming for intensification of fish production by balancing the ratio between carbon and other nutrients. However, the using of manure, classified as hazardous organic matter originating from animal faeces, poses a risk to the water environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>semi-liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> application on faecal pollution and related potential health risk of fish pond utilization. The evaluation of faecal pollution was made during 6 years; the microbiological monitoring was completed with the water chemistry data. Our results showed that a better situation was in ponds, processes of which can be regulated by changes in nutrient contents, i. e., by controlled manure application. The absolute counts of microbial indicators were not significantly different in the control non-manured and manured fish ponds, but sporadically detected high faecal indicators counts in summer can represent a potential health risk. According to our results, the water quality of fish ponds is influenced due to manuring but the immediate impact of manuring in fish ponds and recipients in our study proved neither in deterioration of microbiological quality and health risk enhancement nor in the water quality assessed by chemical analyses...|$|R
40|$|Our {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the framework of EFFICOND project, with the aim of evaluating the environmental effectiveness of GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions) standards with particular focus to the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM) levels through the appropriate crop rotation. The study analyzed the effect of crop rotation on the build-up of soil organic matter in three different areas of Italy, located in the North (Lodi), Centre (Fagna, Firenze) and South (Foggia) of Italy, characterized by different climate, soil, and cropping systems. In the two experiments conducted in the South of Italy, in a dry Mediterranean climate, the stock of C was kept steady in most of the rotations compared with the monoculture of durum wheat. In such environment, with very dry and hot summers, introducing a year of fallow seems to improve SOM content, but these data need further investigation. In the Centre of Italy (Fagna), with less extreme climate than in Foggia, the effect of rotation compared to the monoculture of maize is negligible, but investigation on the soil organic matter composition, showed that in the rotation the SOM appeared to be more stable and, in the long term, probably more resistant to degradation. Eventually, experiments conducted in the North of Italy, showed that the monoculture, despite the application of FYM (Farm Yard Manure) or <b>semi-liquid</b> <b>manure,</b> led to a decrease of SOM. To an increase of the rotation complexity, corresponded an increase in the stock of C in soil. Summarizing, results showed that crop rotation could guarantee the maintenance of SOM level, given that the input of C to the soil is maintained at a good level or, in other word, that productivity of the system is high. Other practices such as conservation tillage, appropriate management of residues, and manure application could enhance the positive effect of rotations. Moreover, preliminary investigation of soil microbial diversity, suggests the positive effect of rotations on soil biological fertility...|$|E
