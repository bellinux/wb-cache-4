50|$|In 2002, while {{a senior}} {{scientist}} at ORNL, Taleyarkhan published {{a paper on}} fusion achieved by bombarding a container of liquid solvent with strong ultrasonic vibrations, {{a process known as}} <b>sonofusion</b> or bubble fusion. In theory, the vibrations collapsed gas bubbles in the solvent, heating them to temperatures high enough to fuse hydrogen atoms and release energy. Following his move from Oak Ridge to Purdue in 2003, Taleyarkhan published additional papers about his research in this area.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} that multibubble sonoluminescence (MBSL) <b>sonofusion</b> {{is necessary for}} the industrial use of <b>sonofusion.</b> In 2002, Taleyarkhan et al. [Science, 295, 1868, (2002) ] reported neutron radiation from single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL), thereafter <b>sonofusion</b> has been discussed. However, SBSL, as described in the literature, is only one bubble, then the energy of <b>sonofusion</b> has a strict limitation for industrial use, that is, very little production of energy. MBSL is a cluster of bubbles; therefore, if <b>sonofusion</b> occurs in MBSL, a large amount of energy can be obtained. We assume the difference between SBSL and MBSL is temperature, thus we propose experimental setup of <b>sonofusion,</b> in which sonoplasma raises the temperature of MBSL.

40|$|Years of data {{collected}} from First Gate’s various <b>sonofusion</b> systems gain fundamental support from recent extrapolations of hot fusion research. Consider the velocity, 3 x 10 4 m/sec, of a high density low energy jet plasma of deuterons that originates from {{the collapse of the}} TCB, transient cavitation bubble, in D 2 O that implants a target foil [1 -Many ICCF & APS]. The foil generates heat via DD fusion events that produce 4 He and T. We compare our <b>sonofusion</b> to the jet plasma of Tokamak type plasma fusion systems with all their stability problems. Since <b>sonofusion</b> is a compilation of billions single fusion events per second and not a continuous fusion system like Tokamak, Stellarator, and Jet fusion systems; a comparison gives <b>sonofusion</b> a decided advantage. Also consider the relevance of the imploding wire and fiber technology where the MHD, magnetohydrodynamic, pressures exceed the crystal forces that bind atoms in solid state conductors. These are the same compression pinching pressures that compress the micro TCB jet plasmas which operate on a much smaller physical scale. The compression pressures delivered to the jet plasma seem to be the same magnitude. <b>Sonofusion</b> is more like ICF, inertial confinement fusion but also differs in scale with probably higher plasma densities. Sonofusion’s implanted cluster deuterons with a few massive vaporous lattice atoms provide a transient fusion environment for low energy DD fusion events. Applying the developments ICF and muon fusion technologies to the <b>sonofusion</b> TCB jet plasmas makes some aspects in the comparison between hot and “cold ” fusion more understandable. One hurdle our system must adjust to is that our measurements show there is no long range radiation (gammas or neutrons) and the main channel for nuclear DD fusion products is the 4 He channel. These problems are addressed via coherence in the implanted high density, transient, deuteron clusters. One can also apply transient BEC and Fermion theory to models of the implanted clusters. Finally, these <b>sonofusion</b> systems should be viewed as a beginning replacement for hydrocarbon fuels...|$|E

This paper reviews {{the status of}} {{our understanding of the}} bubble dynamics involved in these interesting phenomena. In particular, the experimental and analytical evidence supporting the observed production of neutrons and tritium due to thermonuclear fusion within imploding bubble clusters is reviewed. Moreover, potential methods to scale-up the neutron yield and some potential applications of this exciting new technology are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Genie”, a 40 KHZ <b>sonofusion</b> reactor {{consists}} of 2 opposing 40 KHz piezos separated by 4 mm of D 2 O, with a centered Ti target foil, with one piezo transmitting, the other receiving and taking that signal, amplifying it, then feeding {{it back to}} the transmitter as the resonating frequency of the reactor. This process makes for efficient watt input, Qi, where 80 % of these watts will be used as the acoustic input, Qa, to the “Genie ” <b>sonofusion</b> reactor. In the reactor the transient cavitation bubbles, TCBs, produce billions of low energy high density jets per second that accelerate deuterons into foil targets producing excess heat, Qx. The Qx is determined by calorimetric measurements of experiments that use coolant water circulated {{to the surface of the}} well insulated reactor and data collected in the form of T in and T out at steadystate temperatures and coolant flow rate. The total watts out, Qo, minus Qa ideally should equal zero, and we know that this calorimetry method has several losses that are not measured. This makes the method very conservative when looking for Qx. The Qx must make up those heat losses before making its presence known. The result from experiments of system I using flow x DT x 4. 184 for Qo–Qi = Qx shows that Qx values over unity are the norm. System II used a more realistic calculation for Qx where flow x DT x 4. 184 for Qo–Qa = Qx showed increased results. The calibration of the reactor with a Joule heater, JH, and substituting H 2 O for D 2 O produced measurements that showed the reactor calorimetry was close to zero Qx production as one would expect. These measurements showed that heat in = heat out, a good zero indicating no Qx, for the operation of the “Genie ” <b>sonofusion</b> reactor...|$|E

The interior temperature of the produced bubbles in Deuterated acetone is 1. 6 × 106 K in hydro-chemical model and it is reached up to 1. 9 × 106 K in the laser induced SBSL bubbles.

40|$|Cavitation-induced fusion (also {{known as}} bubble fusion or <b>sonofusion)</b> {{has been a}} topic of much debate and {{controversy}} and is generally (albeit incorrectly) perceived as unworkable. In this paper we present the theoretical foundations of cavitation-induced fusion and summarize the experimental results of the research conducted in the past 20 years. Based on the systematic study of all available data we conclude that the cavitation-induced fusion is feasible, doable, {{and can be used}} for commercial power generation. In this talk we present the results of our own research including neutron detection in singlebubble and multi-bubble experiments.

40|$|The sizing {{of simple}} {{resonators}} like guitar strings or laser mirrors is {{directly connected to}} the wavelength and represents no complex optimisation problem. This {{is not the case}} with liquid-filled acoustic resonators of non-trivial geometries, where several masses and stiffnesses of the structure and the fluid have to fit together. This creates a scenario of many competing and interacting resonances varying in relative strength and frequency when design parameters change. Hence, the resonator design involves a parameter-tuning problem with many local optima. As its solution evolutionary algorithms (EA) coupled to a forced-harmonic FE simulation are presented. A new hybrid EA is proposed and compared to two state-of-theart EAs based on selected test problems. The motivating background is the search for better resonators suitable for <b>sonofusion</b> experiments where extreme states of matter are sought in collapsing cavitation bubbles...|$|E
40|$|Experimentally, {{heat and}} 4 He are the fusion {{products}} of <b>sonofusion</b> (SF). SF controls a naturally occurring phenomenon with cavitation-induced bubbles and their {{high energy density}} transferred to transient jets that implant deuteron clusters into a matrix or lattice. The SF path to clusters can be extrapolated from high-density experiments of inertial confined fusion, ICF, Bose Einstein Condensates, BEC, muon fusion, MF, and astrophysical phenomena, to explain our ejecta sites, Qx, 4 He, and no measureable longrange radiation results. The fusion events emanate from deuteron clusters implanted into target foils. Clusters are squeezed and cooled via electromagnetic, EM, compression pressures and evaporative cooling of cluster surface deuterons producing the fusion environment. Evidence of these cluster fusion events {{is found in the}} millions of target foil ejecta sites in SF target foils. Introduction (See Appendix list) The first experiments in SF started early in 1989, although not initially known by that name, when the announcement of Fleischmann and Pons, FP, discovery was first announced. It was a week after the FP announcement that my first experiments began in cavitating D 2 O with Pd targets. The initial experiment...|$|E
40|$|Resonant Acoustic Chambers (RACs) have {{important}} applications in sonoluminescence, <b>sonofusion</b> and particularly nuclear particle detection. The motivation {{for this work}} was to develop reliable numerical multiphysics models to simulate transient acoustically driven metastable states, and structural responses in the chambers so that the design of RACs can be optimized for future studies. ^ In this thesis research, structural-acoustic-electromagnetic coupled numerical models were developed for RACs. Simulations and benchmarking experiments were also developed both for Open Chamber System (OCS) and Closed Chamber System (CCS), respectively. In the OCS, acoustic pressure profiles in the liquid involving pressure probe’s influence were researched; the influences of scattering centers in the liquid were studied as well. In the CCS, {{the performance of the}} system was studied as neutron radiation interacted with the liquid and resulted in nucleation of bubble clusters, the locations of which were found to match the predicted regions of sensitivity. A statistical study related to the experimentation revealed excellent reproducibility, when the same OCS test cell is used for repeated experiment campaigns, but the data between test cells may differ significantly. ^ The benchmarking work showed that the models can successfully predict the performance of RACs (for both OCS and CCS) at fundamental resonance modes. Experiments with scattering centers successfully showed the significant and complex influences of such inclusions on the system’s acoustic responses. Despite nominal success, significantly, more work is needed, e. g. developing 3 -D asymmetric model, to simulate the system with scattering centers. ...|$|E
