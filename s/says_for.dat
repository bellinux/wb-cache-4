5|$|Multistage rocket: Although {{there is}} still some {{ambiguity}} as to whether the earliest rockets of the 13th century were first developed in Europe (i.e. 'ignis volantis in aere' in the work of Marcus Graecus around 1232, although Needham and Davis assert it was most likely a fire lance), the Middle East (i.e. 'sahm al-Khitāi' or 'arrows of China' as referred to by Hasan al-Rhammāh in 1280) or China (i.e. 'di lao shu' or 'ground rat' mentioned in 1264 or the 'chong' mortar used by the armies of the Song Dynasty and invading Mongols during the 1270s), during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) the term 'fire arrow' once implied to mean incendiary arrows during the Tang Dynasty was then used to describe the true rocket, producing a headache, as Needham <b>says,</b> <b>for</b> historians; the Huolongjing written by military officer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and the Song dynasty Chinese philosopher and politician Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) described several types of rockets, one of them being a multistage rocket known as the 'huo long chu shui' or 'fire dragon issuing from the water' which, despite its name, was not launched from beneath the water from a primitive submarine but rather at near water-level maintaining a flat trajectory; defined as a two-stage rocket, it employed booster rockets that, when about to burn out of use, ignited a swarm of smaller rocket arrows fired from {{the front end of the}} missile shaped as a dragon's mouth.|$|E

[...] Despite its lack of commercial success, Unknown is the most lamented of all science fiction and fantasy magazines; Lester del Rey describes it as having gained [...] "a devotion from its readers that no other magazine can match". [...] Edwards comments that Unknown [...] "appeared during Campbell's peak years as an editor; its reputation may stand as high as it does partly because it died while still at its best".|$|E
500|$|Many ancient authors mention stichometry. Galen {{complains}} about the verbosity {{of a rival}} and says he can offer a description in fewer lines. In the 1st century BCE, a philosopher criticized Zeno of Citium and cited particular passages by giving their line number to the nearest hundredth line. Diogenes Laertius probably draws on the Pinakes, the published catalogue of the Library of Alexandria, when he reports {{the total number of}} lines in the oeuvres of various authors. He <b>says,</b> <b>for</b> example, that Speusippus wrote 43,475, Aristotle wrote 445,270, and Theophrastus wrote 232,808 lines. The Cheltenham Canon lists line totals for books in the Christian Bible and concludes with an anonymous note apparently written by a book dealer in the 4th century CE when the practice of stichometry was perhaps becoming less familiar: ...|$|E

500|$|Guest {{stars in}} the episode include Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator. Scully thought Robbins [...] "did a great job" [...] because the Simpsons staff wanted the {{character}} of Jim Hope to be [...] "fun and upbeat and somebody the kids would love." [...] Clemons narrates a few scenes {{at the end of}} the episode, telling the viewers how the story ends. When Coleman agrees to spend Christmas with the Simpsons, Clemons <b>says,</b> <b>for</b> example: [...] "And Gary Coleman was as good as his word, and as for old Mr. Burns, he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants."

2500|$|In [...] "Even Sociologists Fall in Love" [...] (1993), Jackson takes {{scholars}} of [...] "ideal romances" [...] {{to task for}} conflating two competing ideas about love—the need for nurturing, which she <b>says</b> <b>for</b> heterosexual women is frequently not fulfilled, and [...] "romantic desire experienced as overwhelming, insatiable". The latter desire is frequently found in romances, and [...] "the hero often rapes the heroine in these novels"—novels in which [...] "spectacularly masculine" [...] heroes hurt and humiliate women characters but reveal their [...] "softer side" [...] when they [...] "declare love" [...] for their victims. Such novels portray male desire as uncontrollable, thus proposing that it is actually the woman, as a motor for male desire, {{who is in charge}} of the man; [...] "the attraction of romance for women may well lie in their material powerlessness".|$|E
2500|$|Avicenna generalizes youth {{as having}} a [...] "hot" [...] temperament, but {{comments}} that there is controversy over which periods of youth are hotter. The general notion that youth are [...] "hot" [...] in temperament is due to youth's supposed relationship {{to members of the}} body that are hot. For example, blood was considered [...] "hot" [...] as was mentioned earlier, therefore youth is assumed to be hot partially due to blood being more [...] "plentiful" [...] and [...] "thicker", according to Avicenna. Evidence for youth having an excess of blood is suggested by Avicenna's observation that nose bleeds are more frequent within youth. Other contributing factors are the youth's association with sperm and the consistency of their bile. Further description of youth in regards to heat and moisture is given with respect to sex, geographical location, and occupation. The Canon <b>says,</b> <b>for</b> example, that females are colder and more moist.|$|E

Aubrey surrenders {{to him after}} HMS Sophie is taken, but Christy-Pallière, impressed with {{the resistance of the}} Sophie, refuses to take his sword and insists that he continue to wear it. He is apparently promoted to Admiral, as we hear from his nephew Lt. Dumesnil (affectionately called Pierrot), lieutenant of the French frigate Cornélie in The Thirteen Gun Salute. When he appears again in The Hundred Days, he is again a post captain, who renounces Napoleon, declares his loyalty for King Louis XVIII and places his frigate at the disposal of the Royal Navy.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{maintain that}} people only engage in survival sex {{when they have}} no other options. Psychologist and anti-prostitution activist Melissa Farley, writing in the New York Times, says that prostitution is nearly always coercive and lacking in full consent. She says {{this is the biggest}} issue, not simple inequalities between buyers and sellers, nor health and safety risks. Farley says women rarely have viable alternative means of paying for the basic needs of themselves and their loved ones. Farley argues that even having the [...] "job option" [...] is immoral because it will most likely hurt women who are very vulnerable (psychologically, economically, or otherwise). Farley <b>says</b> <b>for</b> women looking to survive, the experience can be traumatizing, and she describes it as [...] "Becoming objects for masturbation". She also warns that the men who pay for prostitution the most are usually the most violent towards women.|$|E
2500|$|On Metacritic, which assigns a {{weighted}} average score out of 100 to ratings and reviews from mainstream critics, My Everything received {{an average of}} 64, based on 19 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Rob Sheffield, writing for Rolling Stone, says, [...] "My Everything proves, she's already a major force" [...] on a release showing how Grande is growing up because [...] "It's a confident, intelligent, brazen pop statement, mixing bubblegum diva vocals with EDM break-beats." [...] Adam Markovitz <b>says</b> <b>for</b> Entertainment Weekly how [...] "Grande has picked a set of songs so lyrically bland, sonically inoffensive, and artistically empty that they produce a zero-impact experience—musical vanilla fro-yo poured directly into your ears." [...] Markovitz states, [...] "It's by no means painful; there are even moments of fun, including the thigh-high-boot swagger of summer smashes 'Problem' and 'Bang Bang,' both of which borrow their strut from coheadliners Iggy Azalea and Jessie J with Nicki Minaj, respectively." [...] Mikael Wood, writing {{on behalf of the}} Los Angeles Times, finds Grande in impressive form because she is [...] "deeply cheerful yet with guns blazing, an innocent newcomer no more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dance {{competition}} {{had been}} a part of American television for decades before the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, but usually in the form of all-around talent searches, (such as Star Search, Soul Train, or Showtime at the Apollo). [...] However, [...] a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. [...] Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. [...] Series judge Mary Murphy <b>says,</b> <b>for</b> example, [...] "Of course you hope you can make a living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship." [...] A number of dance-themed competition shows have been produced for American television since the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, including America's Best Dance Crew, Superstars of Dance, and Live to Dance.|$|E
2500|$|Elysa Gardner, {{on behalf}} of USA Today, writes that Grande [...] "digs into ballads and more emotionally earnest fare" [...] simultaneously, doing so with a [...] "girlish playfulness... {{and a sense of}} growing confidence", and she is [...] "Blending sugar and spice" [...] {{together}} to create a pleasing concoction to satisfy the varying palates of her supporters." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine <b>says</b> <b>for</b> AllMusic that [...] "Grande doesn't embody the songs the way an old-fashioned diva would, but she functions as a likeable pop ringleader, stepping aside when the track calls for it and then unleashing a full-throated wail when it's her time to shine." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard writes that the album [...] "turned Grande into a dance artist, pop artist, and soul artist" [...] with a more uniformed and more mature sound. Gary Graff says {{on behalf of}} The Oakland Press that it is [...] "a solid step forward for Grande, which makes 'there's more to see' an intriguing promise rather than a threat." [...] In a 7.7 out of ten review for Pitchfork, Meaghan Garvey explains how it [...] "feels like Grande's arrival as a true pop fixture, not just a charming novelty... and while the best songs here may not be timeless, they certainly feel right for right now." [...] The album was placed at number eleven on Digital Spys Best Albums of 2014 list. Jessica Goodman and Ryan Kistobak of The Huffington Post included the album on their list of 2014's best releases, commenting that the album makes sure [...] "Grande's sheer talent did not go unnoticed".|$|E
