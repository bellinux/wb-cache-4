40|$|Effect of <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> on {{mechanical}} properties (tension, compression and bending) of oriented strand lumber (OSL) made of rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) was reported. Three strand lengths of 50 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm with 1 mm thickness and 15 mm width were used. The strands were mixed with 5 % pMDI glue (weight basis) in a tumble mixer. The OSL specimens were formed by hot pressing process of unidirectionally aligned strands. Average specific gravity and moisture content were 0. 76 and 8. 34 %, respectively. Tension and compression tests {{were carried out}} for directions both parallel and perpendicular to grain while bending test was performed only in parallel direction. Ultimate stresses and moduli of elasticity were examined from the stress-strain curves. It was found that for the parallel-to-grain direction, the longer strand OSL gave higher strength. The role of the <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> did not appear for the direction normal to the grain. The relationship between the {{mechanical properties}} of OSL and <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> was well described by the modified Hankinson formula...|$|E

The strandboard was fabricated in a laboratory using diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) resin and laboratory-made strands of four lengths and four different structures. Strand alignment distributions and concentration parameter (k) values were greatly affected by <b>strand</b> <b>length.</b> A linear correlation {{was found between the}} value of k and the modulus of rupture (MOR), with correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.93 for unidirectional boards and three-layer boards, respectively. This correlation may be used to predict the strength properties of boards. Bending properties were significantly affected by both the <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> and the layer structure of the bamboo strandboard tested. Elasticity data from unidirectional boards and random boards can be used to predict the elastic properties of three-layer boards. The linear expansion (LE) of the random boards increased with decreasing <b>strand</b> <b>length.</b> The difficulty in mat forming and resin distribution for longer strands could cause deviation in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and LE, especially in strand lengths around 80 mm.|$|E

The mol. wt. were calculated by two methods: from measurements of trand lengths in the electron micrographs and from the observed sedimentation rates (s-rates). RNA extracted from virus by dialysis against water usually had three to four prominent <b>strands</b> of different <b>lengths.</b> Mol. wt. calculated from s-rates (and con-verted to <b>strand</b> <b>lengths)</b> generally agreed with those measured on electron micro-graphs. Differences which occurred appeared to be attributable tofurther breakage during processing for electron microscopy. Major fragment <b>strand</b> <b>lengths</b> range from 0 " 65 to 2. 45 /~m. The modal lengths of RNA fragments were preparation-dependent, ranging from I' 25 to 1. 95 #m for AI ~ I I 9, I'o 5 to 1 - 75 #m for Ca Resende, and 1. 65 to 2. 45 #m for O ~ Brugge.

Here, we use designed peptides to examine the effect of <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> on antiparallel β-sheet stability. α-Helices become more stable as they grow longer. Our data show that a two-stranded β-sheet (“β-hairpin”) becomes more stable when the strands are lengthened from five to seven residues, but that further strand lengthening to nine residues does not lead to further β-hairpin stabilization for several extension sequences examined. (In one case, all-threonine extension, there may be an additional stabilization on strand lengthening from seven to nine residues.)

40|$|The fate of label {{introduced}} as donor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into competent cells of Diplococcus pneumoniae was determined immediately after entry at 25 C, {{as a function}} of the size of the donor DNA. Part of the label is found to be acid soluble, part has been incorporated into chromosomal DNA, apparently through reincorporation of degraded donor DNA, and part is found in single strands of length smaller than that of the input donor DNA strands. The last fraction apparently constitutes the precursor for integration of intact donor genetic markers and is referred to as the intact fraction. For large donor DNA the intact fraction contains over 80 % of the total intracellular label, but the median <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> has been reduced to 2. 2 × 106 daltons. For small donor molecules (1 × 105 to 6 × 105 daltons per strand) the fraction intact increases with donor size from 10 to 50 % of the total intracellular label, and the median <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> of this fraction is half that of the donor strands. By combining these results with earlier data on the size dependence of the yield of transformants per unit of total intracellular donor label, we have calculated the probability that a marker in the intact fraction will be integrated, {{as a function of}} the length of the donor strand after entry. This probability has a linear dependence on <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> for activities below 40 % of maximum, and extrapolates to zero activity at 77, 000 daltons per strand...|$|E

We also demonstrated that contrarily to natural DNA, the synthesized oligonucleotides present stable bonds with complementary DNA strands. Frequency responses of both grafting and hybridization have shown the same shape: an exponential decay with different time constants, (187 ± 1) s and (68 ± 19) s for grafting and hybridization respectively.

40|$|DNA {{renaturation}} is the recombination of two complementary single strands to form {{a double}} helix. It is experimentally known that renaturation proceeds through {{the formation of a}} double stranded nucleus of several base pairs (the rate limiting step) followed by a much faster zippering.

40|$|The remarkably high {{toughness}} of double network (DN) hydrogels {{is related to}} the energy dissipation that occurs due to the scission of network strands in the most tightly crosslinked of its two interpenetrating networks. The loading curve during tensile testing of DN hydrogels usually takes a complex shape and sometimes shows yielding. Wang and Hong recently proposed a model [1] based on the successive scission of the shortest remaining elastically active strands during tensile loading that predicts the shape of the loading curve of one DN hydrogel reasonably well. In the present study, the model was modified slightly and applied to five different DN gels prepared with different crosslink densities in the first (tight) network. The model fit parameters provide a description of the network <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> distribution in the tight network and show that the network strand concentration increases and the network <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> decreases when a higher crosslinker concentration was used to prepare the tight network.

40|$|We {{have used}} the ciliate Euplotes to study the role of DNA {{polymerase}} in telomeric C strand synthesis. Euplotes provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study C strand synthesis without the complication of simultaneous DNA replication because millions of new telomeres are made at a stage in the life cycle when no general DNA replication takes place. Previously we showed that the C-strands of newly synthesized telomeres have a precisely controlled length while the G-strands are more heterogeneous. This finding suggested that, although synthesis of the G-strand (by telomerase) {{is the first step in}} telomere addition, a major regulatory step occurs during subsequent C strand synthesis. We have now examined whether G- and C strand synthesis might be regulated coordinately rather than by two independent mechanisms. We accomplished this by determining what happens to G- and C <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> if C strand synthesis is partially inhibited by aphidicolin. Aphidicolin treatment caused a general lengthening of the G-strands and a large increase in C strand heterogeneity. This concomitant change in both the G- and C <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> indicates that synthesis of the two strands is coordinated. Since aphidicolin is a very specific inhibitor of DNA polα and polδ, our results suggest that this coordinate length regulation is mediated by DNA polymerase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Measurement of the {{compressive}} strength of parallel strand lumber!PSL " is conducted on specimens of varying size with nominally identical mesostructure. The {{mean of the}} {{compressive strength}} is found to vary inversely with the specimen size, and the coefficient of variation of the strength is found to decrease with increasing specimen size, and to be smaller than the coefficient of variation of strength for solid lumber. The correlation length of the compressive strength is approximately 0. 5 m, and this correlation length leads to significant specimen-to-specimen variation in mean strength. A computational model is developed that includes the following properties of the PSL mesostructure: the <b>strand</b> <b>length,</b> the grain angle, the elastic constants, and {{the parameters of the}} Tsai-Hill failure surface. The computational model predicts the mean strength and coefficient of variation reasonably well, and predicts the correct form of correlation decay, but overpredicts the correlation length for compressive strength, likely because of sensitivity to the distribution of <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> used in the model. The estimates of the statistics of the PSL compressive strength are useful for reliability analysis of PSL structures, and the computational model, although still in need of further development, can be used in evaluating the effect of mesos-tructural parameters on PSL compressive strength...|$|E

However, as the DNA used in these experiments was isolated from mitochondrial fractions, the findings may indicate that continuation of synthesis beyond specific points on the nucleotide strands requires a factor which is not available after cell disruption...|$|R

One way to control nanoparticle assembly is by functionalizing the nanoparticle with ligands, such as polymers, DNA, and proteins, that can manipulate the interactions between the nanoparticles in the medium the particles are placed in. This thesis research aims to design ligands to provide a new route to the programmable {{assembly of}} nanoparticles. We first investigate using Monte Carlo simulation the effect of copolymer ligands on nanoparticle assembly. We first study a single nanoparticle grafted with many copolymer chains to understand how monomer sequence (e. g. alternating ABAB, or diblock AxBx) and chemistry of the copolymers affect the grafted chain conformation at various particle diameters, grafting densities, copolymer chain lengths, and monomer-monomer interactions in an implicit small molecule solvent. We find that the size of the grafted chain varies non-monotonically with increasing blockiness of the monomer sequence for a small particle diameter. From this first study, we selected the two sequences with the most different chain conformations [...] alternating and diblock [...] and studied the effect of the sequence and a range of monomer chemistries of the copolymer on the characteristics of assembly of multiple copolymer-functionalized nanoparticles. We find that the alternating sequence produces nanoclusters that are relatively isotropic, whereas diblock sequence tends to form anisotropic structures that are smaller and more compact when the block closer to the surface is attractive and larger loosely held together clusters when the outer block is attractive. Next, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of DNA ligands on nanoparticle assembly. Specifically we investigate the effect of grafted DNA strand composition (e. g. G/C content, placement and sequence) and bidispersity in DNA <b>strand</b> <b>lengths</b> on the thermodynamics and structure of assembly of functionalized nanoparticles. We find that higher G/C content increases cluster dissociation temperature for smaller particles. Placement of G/C block inward along the strand decreases number of neighbors within the assembled cluster.

40|$|The {{tegument}} of all herpesviruses {{contains a}} high-molecular-weight protein homologous to {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) UL 36. This large (3, 164 amino acids), essential, and multifunctional polypeptide {{is located on the}} capsid surface and present at 100 to 150 copies per virion. We have been testing the idea that UL 36 is important for the structural organization of the tegument. UL 36 is proposed to bind directly to the capsid with other tegument proteins bound indirectly by way of UL 36. Here we report the results of studies carried out with HSV type 1 -derived structures containing the capsid but lacking a membrane and depleted of all tegument proteins except UL 36 and a second high-molecular-weight protein, UL 37. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that, compared to capsids lacking a tegument, these capsids (called T 36 capsids) had tufts of protein located at the vertices. Projecting from the tufts were thin, variably curved <b>strands</b> with <b>lengths</b> (15 to 70 nm) in some cases sufficient to extend across the entire thickness of the tegument (∼ 50 nm). Strands were sensitive to removal from the capsid by brief sonication, which also removed UL 36 and UL 37. The findings are interpreted to indicate that UL 36 and UL 37 are the components of the tufts and of the thin strands that extend from them. The <b>strand</b> <b>lengths</b> support the view that they could serve as organizing features for the tegument, as they have the potential to reach all parts of the tegument. The variably curved structure of the strands suggests they may be flexible, a property that could contribute to the deformable nature of the tegument...|$|R

Increasingly, morphological studies of museum specimens are using X-ray computed tomography to visualize internal morphology, because of its ‘non-destructive’ nature. However, it is not known whether CT can fragment the size of DNA extracted from museum specimens, as has been demonstrated to occur in living cells. This question is of paramount importance for collections based research because X-rays may reduce the amount of data obtainable from specimens. In our study, we tested whether exposure of museum bird skins to typical CT X-ray energies (for visualization of the skeleton) increased DNA strand fragmentation, a key factor for the success of downstream molecular applications. For the present study, we extracted DNA from shavings of 24 prepared and dried bird skins (100 + years) footpads before and after CT scanning. The pre- and post-CT fragmentation profiles were assessed using a capillary electrophoresis high-precision instrument (Agilent Bioanalyzer). Comparison of the most common <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> in each DNA sample (relative mass) revealed no significant difference unexposed and exposed tissue (paired t-test p = 0. 463). In conclusion, we found no further quantifiable degradation of DNA <b>strand</b> <b>length</b> under standard X-ray exposure obtained from our bird skins sample. Differences in museum preservation techniques probably had a greater effect on variation of pre-CT DNA fragmentation...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years we have {{developed}} an empirical potential function that solves the protein structure recognition problem : given the sequence for an n -residue globular protein and a collection of plausible protein conformations, including the native conformation for that sequence, identify the correct, native conformation. Having determined this potential on the basis of only some 6500 native/nonnative pairs of structures for 58 proteins, we find it recognizes the native conformation for essentially all compact, soluble, globular proteins having known native conformations in comparisons with 10 4 to 10 6 reasonable alternative conformations apiece. In this sense, the potential encodes nearly all the essential features of globular protein conformational preference. In addition it “knows” about many additional factors in protein folding, such as the stabilization of multimeric proteins, quaternary structure, the role of disulfide bridges and ligands, pro proteins vs. processed proteins, and minimal <b>strand</b> <b>lengths</b> in globular proteins. Comparisons are made with other sorts of protein folding problems, and applications in protein conformational determination and prediction are discussed. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Batik {{industry}} produces {{waste water}} containing chromium {{which can be}} harmful for ecosystem and human health. There had been research aimed {{to find out the}} influence of batik dye waste water in Parakannyasag Tasikmalaya on the growth of Pistia stratiotes L. Material of P. stratiotes was obtained from Indihiang rice field, Tasikmalaya. Waste water was taken from disposal of home batik dye industry in Parakannyasag Tasikmalaya. Study design used a Complete Randomized Design (RAL) with 5 treatments (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %) and 5 replications. The growth parameter include root length, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, leaf broad, stolon number, stolon length, fresh weight and calculated of Relative Growth Rate (RGR), Doubling Time (DT) and leaf chlorophyll content were observed,  The result showed growth of P. stratiotes at 25 % concentration of wastewater was root length 2, 2 cm, leaf number 3, 5 <b>strands,</b> leaf <b>length</b> 0, 3 mm, leaf width 0, 4 mm, leaf broad 1, 7 mm, stolon number 1, 3 pieces, stolon length 1, 8 cm and fresh weight 4, 4 g; At 50 % consentration of waste water showed root length 11, 2 cm, leaf  number 5, 7 <b>strands,</b> leaf <b>length</b> 0, 39 mm, leaf width 0, 17 mm, leaf broad 1, 3 mm, stolon number 1, 6 pieces, length of stolon 2, 6 cm and fresh weight 3, 6 g. At 75 % of waste water consentration showed, root length 5, 5 cm, lef number 4, 8 <b>strands,</b> leaf <b>length</b> - 0, 1 mm, leaf width 0, 1 mm, leaf broad - 0, 4 mm, stolon number 1, 1 pieces, stolon length 2, 0 cm and fresh weight 3, 0 g; At 100 % consentration of waste water showed root length 6, 6 cm, leaf number 3, 8 <b>strands,</b> leaf <b>length</b> - 0, 3 mm, leaf width - 0, 2 mm, leaf broad - 0, 5 mm, stolon number 0, 9 pieces, length 1, 9 cm stolon and fresh weight 2, 9 g. The highest RGR value at 25 % of wastewater concentration demonstrated 0, 02 g/day and the highest DT value at 75 % concentration of waste water demonstrated 48, 0 days.
