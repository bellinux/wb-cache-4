5|$|During {{an autopsy}} on Susan Snow, Assistant Medical Examiner Janet Miller {{detected}} {{the scent of}} bitter almonds, an odor distinctive to cyanide. Tests verified that <b>Snow</b> <b>had</b> died of acute cyanide poisoning. Investigators examined {{the contents of the}} Snow-Webking household and discovered the source of the cyanide: the bottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules that both Snow and Webking had used the morning of Snow's death. Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities.|$|E
5|$|The alpine runs (Le piste alpine) {{were built}} {{on the slopes of}} Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men's and women's {{downhill}} and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. It took nearly two years to complete construction of the runs. In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> to be transported {{from other parts of the}} mountains by the Italian army.|$|E

5|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} memorable for its extreme weather, most notably {{on the final}} climb of the Gavia Pass. Overnight, {{a large amount of}} <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> {{accumulated}} on the Gavia, but the roads were cleared in time for the riders. Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided {{to go ahead with the}} stage. As snow fell on the riders climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink, who eventually caught up and passed the American with seven kilometers to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the music for}} the film, <b>Snow</b> <b>had</b> {{a couple of months}} to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked {{the first time in the}} history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{anthropologist}} Clyde Snow {{learned of}} the massacre {{during his visit to}} Zagreb in October 1992. Snow travelled there as a United Nations (UN) team member sent to investigate reports of war crimes. In a meeting <b>Snow</b> <b>had</b> with the dean of the Zagreb University School of Medicine, he was introduced to a former soldier who claimed to have survived the massacre and told Snow where it took place. Three days later, Snow went to Vukovar and drove to Ovčara accompanied by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Larry Moore who was deployed to the region with the UNPROFOR. At the site, Moore spotted a human skull in the mud. A few days later, the UN declared the site a crime scene and deployed Russian UNPROFOR troops to guard it.|$|E

5|$|The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22February, {{with eight}} men, seven sledges and forty-two dogs. Conditions on the Barrier had {{deteriorated}} sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9°C (16°F), and rough <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes {{as low as}} , on 3March the party reached 81°S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°S on 8March. Amundsen {{could see that the}} dogs were exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending polar night made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°S depot with six slaughtered seals— of meat. The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, Sandy {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west, weakening below hurricane force {{by the time it}} reached Pennsylvania. Because the system was non-tropical, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) – known at the time as the Hydrometeorogical Prediction Center (HPC) – took over the responsibility of issuing advisories on the low. The remnants of Sandy brought heavy snow and high winds to the central Appalachian Mountains, resulting in blizzard warnings being issued. The system continued to weaken as it moved across western Pennsylvania, and by 0300UTC on October31, the storm's movement had shifted to the northwest. Blizzard conditions continued in the Appalachians, bringing more snow to the region that had already seen high amounts the day before. By 0900UTC on October31, the circulation degenerated into a trough of low pressure, with no discernible center of low pressure. Later that day, the remnants of Sandy spread into the Great Lakes, and the WPC issued its last advisory. By the time the system had moved out of the region, nearly three feet of <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> fallen in some areas of West Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, with lesser amounts elsewhere in the region. During the next two days, Sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over Ontario, before merging with another low pressure area over Eastern Canada, on November 2.|$|E

25|$|While light snowfalls are {{not unusual}} on {{the peaks of}} the Porongurup and Stirling Range, it is very unusual for snow to fall to ground level {{anywhere}} in Western Australia. However, snow has been recorded in Mount Barker on several occasions. On 28 August 1992, with a maximum temperature of 7.2 degrees Celsius, two falls of snow were recorded.

25|$|In 2008, due to {{a series}} of heavy snowstorms, Seattle's {{transportation}} was paralyzed for a few days, and Crunican's inadequate response to the snowstorm was criticized. Among other things, her decision to use sand instead of salt to clear out the accumulated snow (to limit environmental damage to the Bay) was implicated as a reason for the snow not being cleared out quickly enough. Crunican was also criticized for going on vacation while the <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> not cleared out, and for failing to take responsibility and lacking a customer service mindset.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 December 2009, during the December 2009 European snowfall, five London-bound Eurostar trains failed inside the tunnel, {{trapping}} 2,000 passengers for approximately 16 hours, during the coldest temperatures in eight years. A Eurotunnel spokesperson explained that <b>snow</b> <b>had</b> evaded the train's winterisation shields, and the transition from cold air outside to the tunnel's warm atmosphere had melted the snow, resulting in electrical failures. One train was turned back before reaching the tunnel; two trains were hauled {{out of the tunnel}} by Eurotunnel Class 0001 diesel locomotives. The blocking of the tunnel led to the implementation of Operation Stack, the transformation of the M20 motorway into a linear car park.|$|E
25|$|Australia needed quick {{runs for}} a declaration, but Lawry spent {{two and a}} half hours making 42 and Ian Chappell over two hours for 30. John Snow bowled 12 eight ball overs for a mere 21 runs and the wickets of Lawry and Redpath. He was warned for intimidatory bowling by Max O'Connell after bowling short at Doug Walters (39 not out), despite no action having been taken against Thomson's bouncers earlier in the Test. Snow was also photographed picking at the seam of a Kookaburra cricket ball, which caused a furore in the Australian press until it was {{realised}} that the Kookaburra did not have a seam and <b>Snow</b> <b>had</b> been playing a practical joke on the cameraman.

The reconnaissance could be mounted quickly and paid for out of the existing funds of £1,400 so that all the new funds raised could be allocated to the 1936 bid for the summit. Shipton was offered the leadership of the 1935 slot with Ruttledge's approval.

From 2000 to 2008 KLOU FM 103.3 was the Rams' flagship station with Savard as the play-by-play announcer. Until October 2005, Jack <b>Snow</b> <b>had</b> been the color analyst since 1992, {{dating back to the}} team's days in the Los Angeles area. Snow left the booth after suffering an illness and died in January 2006. Former Rams offensive line coach Jim Hanifan joined KLOU as the color analyst the year after Jack Snow's departure. Before the Rams moved to KLOU, from 1995 to 1999 the Rams games were broadcast on KSD 93.7 FM. Preseason games not shown on a national broadcast network were seen on KTVI in St. Louis; preseason games are produced by the Kroenke-owned Denver-based Altitude Sports and Entertainment, which shares common ownership with the Rams.|$|E
