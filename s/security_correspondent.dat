500|$|Based on 55 reviews {{collected}} from notable publications by popular review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 84% [...] "fresh" [...] approval rating, with the consensus, [...] "As history, Oliver Stone's JFK is dubious, but as filmmaking it's electric, cramming {{a ton of}} information and excitement into its three-hour runtime and making great use of its outstanding cast." [...] However, the film's production and release were subject to intense scrutiny and criticism. A few weeks after shooting had begun, on May 14, 1991, [...] Jon Margolis wrote in the Chicago Tribune that JFK was [...] "an insult to the intelligence." [...] Five days later, The Washington Post ran a scathing article by national <b>security</b> <b>correspondent</b> George Lardner titled, [...] "On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland" [...] that used {{the first draft of}} the JFK screenplay to blast it for [...] "the absurdities and palpable untruths in Garrison's book and Stone's rendition of it." [...] The article pointed out that Garrison lost his case against Clay Shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use Shaw's homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association. Stone responded to Lardner's article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues. Other critical articles soon followed. Anthony Lewis in The New York Times stated that the film [...] "tells us that our government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a Presidential assassination." [...] Washington Post columnist George Will called Stone [...] "a man of technical skill, scant education and negligible conscience." ...|$|E
