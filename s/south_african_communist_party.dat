5|$|Burger's Daughter details a {{group of}} white anti-apartheid activists in South Africa seeking to {{overthrow}} the South African government. It {{is set in the}} mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's internal monologue (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted {{in the history of the}} anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including Nelson Mandela and the 1976 Soweto uprising.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} African National Congress (ANC), {{supported by}} its Tripartite Alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP), have held {{a majority of}} the seats in the National Assembly since 1994. They were re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a slight fall in its majority from 69% to 65.9% in 2009. The ANC is led by Jacob Zuma. In 2012, Zuma was re-elected to a second five-year term as President of the African National Congress, beating his only rival and deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, by a wide margin. Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Motlanthe who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 {{while in}} her second {{year at the}} University of the Western Cape, she left South Africa to go into exile in Zimbabwe. Fraser-Moleketi {{was elected to the}} <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> Central Committee in 1988. She {{returned}} to South Africa in July 1990 when the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was unbanned and helped set up their national offices.|$|R
50|$|Williamson {{ordered the}} {{assassination}} of Ruth First, who was an exiled campaigner for the Anti-Apartheid Movement, close friend of Sweden's prime minister, Olof Palme, and the ANC author of a pioneering study of Namibia. She was also {{the wife of the}} <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> leader, Joe Slovo. She was killed by a letter-bomb in Maputo, Mozambique on 18 August 1982.|$|R
50|$|Internationally, Lenin School {{students}} can be traced {{as late as the}} 1960s and beyond exercising significant responsibilities either as heads of communist governments, like Yugoslavia’s Josip Broz Tito, Poland’s Władysław Gomułka and the GDR’s Erich Honecker, or as leaders of significant oppositional parties elsewhere, such as the general secretaries of the French, Greek and <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>communist</b> <b>parties,</b> Waldeck Rochet, Nikolaos Zachariadis and Moses Kotane. Other important students of the Lenin School include such figures as Harry Haywood and David Alfaro Siqueiros.|$|R
5|$|A Xhosa, Mandela {{was born}} in Mvezo to the Thembu royal family. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became {{involved}} in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for {{his involvement in the}} 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. In 1962, he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the state and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial.|$|E
25|$|Tutu's {{critical}} view of Marxist-oriented {{communism and}} {{the governments of}} the Eastern Bloc, and the comparisons he drew between these administrations and far-right ideologies like Nazism and apartheid brought criticism from the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Zuma has {{described}} himself as a socialist and became president with the support of a left-wing coalition of trade unions and the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> as well as the ANC Women's League and the ANC Youth League.|$|E
25|$|Mbeki {{was finally}} given {{permission}} {{to undergo a}} year of military training at the Lenin International School in Moscow. He arrived in Moscow in February 1969 and became {{a student at the}} Lenin Institute, which was established exclusively for communists, the exception being non-communist members of liberation movements who could get ideological training at the Institute. Mbeki excelled at the Institute and regularly addressed the Institutes' weekly assembly. While in Moscow, he continued writing articles, documents and speeches for the ANC and its organs. In June 1969, Mbeki was chosen to be secretary of a high-level SACP delegation to the International Conference of <b>Communist</b> and Workers <b>Parties</b> in Moscow. In June 1970, Mbeki was secretly shuttled from his military camp north-west of Moscow to the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of the Soviet Union (CPSU) guest house in Volynskoye, where the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> (SACP's) Central Committee was holding its meeting. This was indeed significant because, up to this point, the SACP leadership had been largely non-African. Mbeki and several Africans were now included in the committee, including Chris Hani. Both Hani and Mbeki celebrated their 28th birthdays at this meeting, making them the youngest members to ever serve on the committee. While in Moscow, Mbeki was trained in advanced guerrilla warfare at Skhodnya, and although he was more comfortable with a book rather than a gun, the training was considered a necessary requirement if he was to be accepted as a leader. His military training was cut short as he was sent back to London to prepare for a new post in Lusaka. Throughout Mbeki's training, he kept in constant contact with Zanele.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011 he {{launched}} a similar scheme in India, called MMM India, again stating clearly that the vehicle is a pyramid. He has also launched MMM in China. He {{was reported to be}} trying to expand his operations into Western Europe, Canada, and Latin America. [...] As of September 2015 it had spread rapidly in South Africa with a claimed 1% per day or 30% per month interest rate scheme and warnings from both the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> and Russian <b>Communist</b> <b>Parties</b> for people not to participate in it. In early 2016, he continued the same model in Zimbabwe (the accounts were frozen in September 2016), and later, in Nigeria (accounts frozen in December, 2016).MMM Nigeria reopened activities on the 13th January, 2017.|$|R

25|$|The RCG {{recognised}} {{the progressive}} {{role played by}} some of the traditional communist parties such as the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and from that position developed into a more orthodox communist grouping supporting the socialist revolution in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, comrade {{emerged as}} a popular revolutionary form of address in South Africa among those {{involved}} in anti-apartheid political activities. For example, members of the African National Congress and <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> frequently referred {{to each other as}} comrade.|$|E
25|$|The Moses Mabhida Stadium is {{a stadium}} in Durban, South Africa, named after Moses Mabhida, a former General Secretary of the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> It is a multi-use stadium. The stadium became {{a venue for}} several events, like bungee jumping, concerts, cricket, football, golf practice, {{motorsports}} and rugby union.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, the CNETU {{with the}} African National Congress and the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{pushed for the}} African Mine Workers' Strike to become a General Strike. The strike was broken by the police {{brutality}} {{which was part of}} the rise of the National Party (NP) and their slogan of apartheid as all black trade unions were violently suppressed.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rape}} trial proceeded, reports {{surfaced}} that the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was severely divided {{over how to}} address the issue of Zuma and the SACP's relationship to him. Many members of the party's youth wing supported Zuma while others in the SACP were sceptical about the value of rallying behind a particular person as opposed to emphasizing principles of governance.|$|E
25|$|Today {{trade unions}} are still an {{important}} force in South Africa, with 3.11 million members representing 25.3% {{of the formal}} work force. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is {{the largest of the}} three major trade union centres, with a membership of 1.8 million, and is part of the Tripartite alliance with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP).|$|E
5000|$|Sam Kahn (15 December 1911 [...] - [...] 25 August 1987) was a <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> and MP from 1949 to 1952, {{for one of}} the {{constituencies}} representing African voters. Born in Cape Town, {{he joined}} the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of South Africa and earned a LLB degree from the University of Cape Town in 1932. From 1938 onwards, he was nearly continuously a member of the central executive committee of the CPSA.|$|R

25|$|While {{serving as}} deputy president, Zuma enjoyed {{considerable}} support {{in parts of}} the left wing of the ANC, including many in the ANC Youth League, the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). While Zuma faced corruption charges, these organisations remained supportive of him. The influence of the semi-autonomous structures within the party helped Zuma retain support even as he was removed from the deputy presidency of the country.|$|E
25|$|The ANC holds a {{historic}} {{alliance with the}} <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP) and Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), known as the Tripartite Alliance. The SACP and COSATU have not contested any election in South Africa, but field candidates through the ANC, hold senior positions in the ANC, and influence party policy and dialogue. During Mbeki's presidency, the government took a more pro-capitalist stance, often running counter {{to the demands of}} the SACP and COSATU.|$|E
25|$|Zuma is also {{referred}} to by his initials JZ and his clan name Msholozi. Zuma became the President of the ANC on 18 December 2007 after defeating incumbent Thabo Mbeki at the ANC conference in Polokwane. He was re-elected as ANC leader at the ANC conference in Mangaung on 18 December 2012, defeating challenger Kgalema Motlanthe by a large majority. Zuma was {{also a member of}} the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP), briefly serving on the party's Politburo until he left the party in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1980s, the RCG's {{most notable}} {{activity}} was its {{participation in the}} non-stop picket of the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> embassy in London calling {{for the release of}} Nelson Mandela. [...] This was organized by the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group, within which the RCG played a leading role alongside elements of the Workers' Revolutionary Party, the Humanist Party and members of the Kitson family. City AA, as it became known, had been founded by Norma Kitson, the wife of the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> activist David Kitson who served 19 years and 5 months in prison in a <b>South</b> <b>African</b> prison for his work in the National High Command of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the military wing of the African National Congress.|$|R
50|$|Under Terre'Blanche, the AWB {{swore to}} use {{violence}} to preserve minority rule, opposing any concessions {{offered to the}} African National Congress - an organisation AWB supporters repeatedly branded as Marxist terrorists - and gaining notoriety for storming the Kempton Park Trade Centre during bilateral negotiations in 1993. AWB loyalists also clashed with <b>South</b> <b>African</b> security forces at the Battle of Ventersdorp, a bloody 1991 skirmish in which police opened fire on a white crowd {{for the first time}} since the Rand Rebellion, leaving three Afrikaners dead. Immediately prior to South Africa's first multiracial elections, Terre'Blanche's followers were linked to a number of bombings and assassinations targeting the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> Party; armed AWB commandos even participated in Bophuthatswana's abortive 1994 coup d'état.|$|R
500|$|In Herndon v. Lowry (1937), the Court {{heard the}} case of <b>African</b> American <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{organizer}} Angelo Herndon, who had been convicted under the Slave Insurrection Statute for advocating black rule in the southern United States. In a 5–4 decision, the Court reversed Herndon's conviction, holding that Georgia had failed to demonstrate {{that there was any}} [...] "clear and present danger" [...] in Herndon's political advocacy.|$|R
25|$|In 1955, the Congress of the People officially {{adopted the}} Freedom Charter, stating the core {{principles}} of the South African Congress Alliance, which consisted of the African National Congress and its allies the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP), the South African Indian Congress, the South African Congress of Democrats (COD) and the Coloured People's Congress. The government claimed {{that this was a}} communist document, and consequently leaders of the ANC and Congress were arrested. 1960 saw the Sharpeville massacre, in which 69 people were killed when police opened fire on anti-apartheid protesters.|$|E
25|$|Madlala-Routledge {{joined the}} {{underground}} African National Congress in 1979 and in 1983, she participated {{in establishing the}} Natal Organisation of Women, becoming its first chair. After a prolonged period of imprisonment without trial, including a year in solitary confinement, she joined the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> first as regional chair in Natal, later {{as a member of}} its central committee. In 1990, following the unbanning of political organisations, she {{became a member of the}} executive committee of the Women's National Coalition. She also contributed to the work of the sub-council on the status of women and helped to prepare policy on the empowerment of women under the Reconstruction and Development Programme. In 1993, she won a seat in the country's revamped parliament.|$|E
25|$|Zuma began {{engaging}} in politics {{at an early}} age and joined the African National Congress in 1959. He became an active member of Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1962, following the South African government's ban of the ANC in 1961. Zuma joined the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (SACP) in 1963. That year, he was arrested with a group of 45 recruits near Zeerust in the western Transvaal, currently part of the North West Province. Convicted of conspiring to overthrow the Apartheid government, a government led by the white minority, Zuma was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which he served on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela and other notable ANC leaders also imprisoned during this time. Whilst imprisoned, Zuma served as a referee for prisoners' association football games, organised by the prisoners' own governing body, Makana F.A.|$|E
500|$|Burger's Daughter took Gordimer {{four years}} to write, {{starting}} {{from a handful of}} what she called [...] "very scrappy notes", [...] "half sentences" [...] and [...] "little snatches of dialogue". Collecting information for the novel was difficult because at the time little was known about <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>communists.</b> Gordimer relied on clandestine books and documents given to her by confidants, and her own experiences of living in South Africa. Once she got going, she said, writing the book became an [...] "organic process". The Soweto riots in 1976 happened while she was working on the book, and she changed the plot to incorporate the uprising. Gordimer explained that [...] "Rosa would have come back to South Africa; that was inevitable", but [...] "here would have been a different ending". During those four years she also wrote two non-fiction articles to take breaks from working on the novel.|$|R
500|$|Over the {{following}} years, Mugabe taught at various schools around Southern Rhodesia, {{among them the}} Dadaya Mission school in Shabani. There {{is no evidence that}} Mugabe was involved in political activity at the time, and did not participate in the country's 1948 general strike. In 1949 he won a scholarship to study at the University of Fort Hare in South Africa's Eastern Cape. There he joined the African National Congress, and attended African nationalist meetings, where he met a number of Jewish <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>communists</b> who introduced him to Marxist ideas. He later related that despite this exposure to Marxism, his biggest influence at the time were the actions of Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement. In 1952, he left the university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English literature. In later years he described his time at Fort Hare as the [...] "turning-point" [...] in his life.|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{is poised}} {{at a moment}} of {{reflection}} and evaluation. In contrast to the conventional liberal narrative that separates and isolates apartheid as a specific aberration, this essay argues that the regime of separate development inaugurated in 1948 was a particular intensification of systemic racism whose main contours were established by British imperialism fifty years earlier. The bedrock of what became apartheid is the highly exploitative mining industry that pre-dates and post-dates it. The essay examines the relation between movement strategy and theory over the long durée of modern imperialism and racial capitalism in South Africa. The interaction has been in both directions, how South Africa figured in the classical theories of imperialism, and how theories of imperialism affected (or not) particular theories of how to end apartheid. Was the movement to be just anti-apartheid, or anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist as well? There were major but inconclusive debates between the ANC/South <b>African</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and more radical anti-imperialist or anti-capitalist currents, with the ANC nonetheless repeatedly emerging as the best organised, most recognised anti-apartheid protagonist. Yet this narrow political focus conditioned the transition {{that took place in the}} 1990 s In the contemporary context, liberalism focuses on political corruption and the failings of Mbeki and Zuma, but these are outcomes of the deal, servicing the capitalist economic model that Mandela’s ANC accepted in 1994. There is a deeper anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist social critique of the continuing exploitation of African working class which is finding new modes of grass roots resistance. Theory needs to catch up with these developments, specifically we need an integrated analysis of capitalist imperialism in which the concept of super-exploitation is fundamental...|$|R
