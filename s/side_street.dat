25|$|In 1906, St. Francis Lutheran Church St. Francis Lutheran Church {{was erected}} at 152 Church Street, between Market Street and Duboce Avenue. The {{construction}} work {{was completed by}} immigrants from the Nordic countries, where Lutheranism is the largest religious group. The project overseen primarily by Danes {{took place in the}} heart of what was then the Nordic-dominated Duboce-Market neighborhood of San Francisco. Facing the backside of St. Francis Lutheran Church, a small and light-colored Finnish church served Finnish-speaking church-goers on the one-block-long <b>side</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{that had}} nurtured Main Street eventually caused its decline. In 1928, {{now part of}} the New York Central, the line was expanded from one track to two, and in the process Main Street's grade crossing was eliminated in favor of a new overpass called Bridge Street, one block to the north. Traffic to what little commercial activity remained at the riverfront simply followed the new street straight to it, turning Main into a short <b>side</b> <b>street</b> that remained important to the community only as the location of its general store.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{completion}} of Rope, Goldwyn cast Granger, Teresa Wright, David Niven and Evelyn Keyes in Enchantment, which was panned for a weak script and indifferent direction by Irving Reis. It failed at the box office, as did his next project, Roseanna McCoy, during which he and Laurents parted ways. While filming <b>Side</b> <b>Street</b> on location in Manhattan for Anthony Mann, Granger briefly became involved with Leonard Bernstein, who invited him to join him on his South American tour. By the time Granger completed the film, the composer/conductor had married Costa Rican pianist and actress Felicia Montealegre. The two men remained friends until Bernstein's death.|$|E

25|$|Haig {{was born}} in a house on Charlotte Square, Edinburgh but {{technically}} it was addressed as 19 Hope Street, the <b>side</b> <b>street</b> to the south-west (a plaque exists). He was not an aristocrat by birth, or landed gentry. His father John Haig—an irascible alcoholic—was middle class ("in trade"), and as head of the family's successful Haig & Haig whisky distillery had an income of £10,000 per year, an enormous amount at the time. His mother (Rachel, daughter of Hugh Veitch of Stewartfield) was from a gentry family fallen on straitened circumstances. Rachel's cousin, Violet Veitch, was mother of the playwright, composer and performer Noël Coward.|$|E
25|$|By July 1934, Dillinger {{had dropped}} {{completely}} out of sight, and the federal agents had no solid leads to follow. He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, {{he was able to}} lead an anonymous existence for a while.

25|$|Simpson's successor, as {{architect}} to the Leith School Board, was {{his former}} apprentice George Craig (1852–1928). In 1888, Craig, a Freemason, designed the Trafalgar Masonic Hall on St Anthony Lane, just off Henderson Street. According {{to a report}} in The Scotsman, a time capsule was buried in the building during the ceremony that took place for the laying of the Foundation Stone. This sandstone building, which is still in use as a Masonic Lodge, has been C Listed since 1995 and has many masonic symbols and decorative motifs carved into the stonework on the front elevation. The basement still contains fragments from St. Anthony's Priory (which gives its name to the <b>side</b> <b>street).</b>|$|E
25|$|After Dietrichson breaks his leg, Phyllis {{drives him}} {{to the train station}} for his trip to Palo Alto for a college reunion. Neff is hiding in the {{backseat}} and kills Dietrichson when Phyllis turns onto a deserted <b>side</b> <b>street.</b> Then, Neff boards the train posing as Dietrichson and using his crutches. He makes his way to the last car, the observation car, and steps outside to the open platform to supposedly smoke a cigarette. A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Continuing north, 208 {{goes around}} some mild bends past woods and fields. Here the highway offers its first {{view to the}} Shawangunks. In 2 miles (3.2km) it reaches Walden, the largest {{community}} on 208 after Monroe. After crossing the old WVRR main line, now {{the north end of}} a lightly used freight spur, it becomes Orange Avenue with a mix of residential and commercial properties. In the center of town NY52 comes in from the east at an oblique angle more like a merger than a junction; traffic at rush hour there is made more difficult by vehicles attempting to cross 52 and enter the adjacent Hess station as well as a local one-way <b>side</b> <b>street.</b> Since 52 comes in at a slightly lower elevation, it has the right of way, guaranteed by the stop sign greeting drivers on 208.|$|E

Major Hughes-Onslow rushed to the sentry box and raised the alarm.

Hakim and Bet-Zuri were determined not to injure any Egyptians in their operation, and so did not attempt to shoot him off his motorcycle. Rather, Bet-Zuri fired a volley of warning shots in his direction, which he ignored. Abdullah then dismounted and ordered him to drop his weapon. Bet-Zuri attempted to shoot out the motorcycle's tires, but found that his pistol had run out of ammunition, and as he attempted to reload it, Abdullah fired, hitting Bet-Zuri in the chest. Hearing the commotion, Hakim turned back to help Bet-Zuri, and within minutes, another policeman appeared, and the two were placed under arrest.|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a <b>side</b> <b>street,</b> Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E
25|$|Australia now {{had three}} and a half days to set England an {{unreachable}} target and bowl them out. Ken Archer ran a four off Alec Bedser in the first over and Arthur Morris struck two boundaries off Doug Wright when he replaced John Warr in the sixth over. Archer called Morris for a run off Bedser, but they both hesitated in the middle and Morris was run out for 16 by a left-handed throw from David Sheppard. Lindsay Hassett was almost bowled first ball, but survived and Australia were 34/1 at stumps. Archer (32) and Hassett (31) returned in the morning to take the score along to 95/3, but it was Neil Harvey (68), Keith Miller (99) and debutant Jim Burke (101 not out) who put the match beyond doubt. Harvey and Miller ran the bowling ragged and added 99 for the fourth wicket until Harvey was bowled by Brown (1/14) and Miller chopped a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Doug Wright (2/109) and Roy Tattersall (1/116) were heavily punished and Bedser (0/62) was wicketless. Australia ended the fourth day 384 runs ahead and that evening Freddie Brown and Brigadier Green were hospitalised after a car crash returning from dinner with Sir Willoughby Norrie, the Governor of South Australia. A car had pulled out suddenly from a <b>side</b> <b>street</b> and Brown swerved into a post for holding electric tram lines. Brown left the hospital early in the morning, but was unfit to play and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional captain to lead England since Jack Hobbs when Arthur Carr was injured in 1924–25. He was unable to prevent Jim Burke from making a Test century on debut, the ninth Australian to do so (compared to 10 Englishmen at the time). John Warr took his first and only Test wicket when Ian Johnson cut the ball to Evans, who knocked it up on the first attempt then ran forward to catch it on the rebound. Umpire Cocks took so long to make a decision that Johnson walked (almost unheard in Australia) to give the long-suffering Warr his first Test wicket and a bowling average of 281.00, the highest by an England bowler. The 12th man Sam Loxton was sent out by Hassett to tell Burke that he could take all the time he wanted over his hundred and the dour stock clerk reached his target after 245minutes at the crease. Hassett then declared at 403/8 to give England {{a day and a half}} to make 503 to win.|$|E
