40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} credit supply of banks in {{response}} to domestic and foreign real estate price changes. Using a large international dataset of multinational banks, we find evidence of a significant transmission of domestic real estate shocks into lending abroad. A 1 % decrease in real estate prices in home country, in particular, leads to a 0. 2 - 0. 3 % decrease in credit growth in the foreign subsidiary. This response, however, is asymmetric: only negative house price changes are transmitted. Stricter regulation of activities of parent banks can reduce this effect, indicating a role for regulation in alleviating the transmission of real estate shocks. Further, {{the analysis of the}} impact of real estate shocks on foreign <b>subsidiary</b> <b>funding</b> indicates that shocks are transmitted through changes in long-term debt funding and equity. ...|$|R
