50|$|This type is {{produced}} by using a mixture of whole milk and skim milk. First the raw milk is heated at about 35 C and rennet and enzymes are added as a liquid solution to make it coagulate. The batter obtained is then kneaded and partially cooked: the curd is broken into many small parts (of {{the size of a}} grain of rice). At this stage there are two other firings: to 40 and 47 C. The paste is removed from the heat, stirred with a large whisk and then the curd is extracted and placed in molds lined with cheese cloth for forming. It is divided up and left to rest {{for a couple of hours}} on a draining table and then the cheese is turned several times. The pre-salting stage then takes place where the last whey is removed and the DOP logo is impressed onto the side. This process takes a couple of days (at least 48 hours) and during this time the wheels are turned several times. The cheese is then salted in one of two ways: by <b>spreading</b> <b>salt</b> over the surface of the cheese or by soaking it in brine. The last step is the ageing process which lasts at least 60 days and must take place within the area of origin in warehouses where the storage temperature and relative humidity are meticulously controlled (optimal values are 10 - 15 C and 80-85%).|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen roads {{may become}} dangerously {{slippery}} due to frost, ice or snow, local authorities treat the roads by spreading a de-icing agent (usually salt) on them. In order {{to treat a}} road, a winter gritting vehicle must travel down the road once, <b>spreading</b> <b>salt</b> on to {{both sides of the}} carriageway. An application is described where routes were constructed for gritters in a local authority area. The formulation of the model is presented which involves dealing with multiple depot locations, limited vehicle capacities, and roads with different priorities (for example, some must be treated within two hours and others within four hours of the start of gritting). The objective function to be optimised depends on both the total distance travelled, and the number and capacity of the gritters. The solution method is a heuristic algorithm, which involves, as a first stage, the optimal solution of an unconstrained Chinese Postman Problem for the network, and followed by the use of Simulated Annealing for the constrained problem...|$|E

To provide the amount of salt needed to all counties of Ohio; individual counties stock up {{during the summer and}} fall, re-order to maintain inventory through the winter time, and finally allowing inventories to reduce towards the end of winter. During a mild winter salt not used and left in inventory ties up capital and requires the county to hold the salt until the next winter at a cost. An (R,S) -inventory policy was constructed to match salt inventories more closely with the demand in each Ohio county. The new salt ordering policies tie current decisions making to historical usage, and result in lower inventory levels in the simulation results, while maintaining required levels of service. The parameters for the inventory policy are derived using a demand model based on a linear regression model. The demand model was used to match past usage from 7 winter seasons with weather variables to calculate predictions of salt usage. A second method allows the inventory policy to be derived directly from the usage data when weather data is unavailable. A simulation approach was used to test the effectiveness of the policies and to establish several parameters in the implementation of the policies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSalt {{tectonics}} at passive margins {{is currently}} {{interpreted as a}} gravity-driven process but according to {{two different types of}} models: i) pure spreading only driven by differential sedimentary loading and ii) dominant gliding primarily due to margin tilt (slope instability). A comparative analysis of pure spreading and pure spreading is made using simple mechanics as well as available laboratory experiments and numerical models that consider salt tectonic processes at the whole basin scale. To be effective, pure spreading driven by sedimentary loading requires large differential overburden thicknesses and therefore significant water depths, high sediment density, low frictional angles of the sediments (high fluid pore pressure) and a seaward free boundary of the salt basin (salt not covered by sediments). Dominant gliding does not require any specific condition to be effective apart from the dip on the upper surface of the salt. It can occur for margin tilt angles lower than 1 ° for basin widths in the range of 200 - 600 km and initial sedimentary cover thickness up to 1 km, {{even in the absence of}} abnormal fluid pressure. In pure <b>spreading,</b> <b>salt</b> resists and sediments drive whereas in dominant gliding both salt and sediments drive. In pure spreading, extension is located inside the prograding sedimentary wedge and contraction at the tip. Both extension and contraction migrate seaward with the sedimentary progradation. Migration of the deformation can create an extensional inversion of previously contractional structures. In pure spreading, extension is located updip and contraction downdip. Extension migrates downdip and contraction updip. Migration of the deformation leads to a contractional inversion of previously extensional structures (e. g. squeezed diapirs). Mechanical analysis and modelling, either analogue or numerical, and comparison with margin-scale examples, such as the south Atlantic margins or northern Gulf of Mexico, indicate that salt tectonics at passive margins is dominated by dominant gliding down the margin dip. On the contrary, salt tectonics driven only by differential sedimentary loading is a process difficult to reconcile with geological evidence...|$|E

50|$|The {{de-icing}} {{of roads}} {{has historically been}} accomplished by snowplows or specially-designed dump trucks that <b>spread</b> <b>salt,</b> often mixed with sand and gravel, onto slick roads. Rock salt is normally used because it is inexpensive and readily available in large quantities. However, brine freezes at −18 °C (0 °F), {{and so it is}} ineffective at these low temperatures. It also has a strong tendency to cause corrosion, rusting the steel used in most vehicles and the rebar in concrete bridges. More recent snowmelters use other salts, such as calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, which not only decrease the freezing point of water to a much lower temperature but also produce an exothermic reaction, whose dissipated heat further aids in melting. In addition, they are somewhat safer for concrete sidewalks, but excess should still be removed.|$|R

40|$|Road salt or {{rock salt}} {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} known, is a commonly used de-icing material and is used throughout Ireland by local authorities (i. e. county councils), private road operators {{and members of the}} public during times of freezing weather. County councils, road authorities and private road operators apply road salt as required as part of their winter road maintenance programs. The road salt used is predominantly sodium chloride (NaCl) as it is relatively inexpensive when compared to other de-icing agents, easy to manufacture and readily available. A number of negative environmental effects and a loss in water quality have been associated with stormwater (melt water) containing dissolved road salt entering fresh waterbodies in the vicinity of roads which are de-iced with sodium chloride. This study uses the M 3 motorway in County Meath as a case study. International findings from other studies on road salt are used to illustrate the potential pollution threat posed by <b>spreading</b> road <b>salt.</b> Recognised best practice for the mitigation of this pollution threat is reviewed and stormwater treatment methods along the M 3 are evaluated with regard to reducing sodium chloride levels in stormwater run-off. This study has found that treated stormwater from the M 3 does not cause a significant elevation in chloride levels. The treatment methods applied to the stormwater may remove the chloride from road salting and the receiving waterbodies dilute the chloride in the stormwater to concentrations that are below recognised toxic limits. A ‘Salt Management Plan’ is the key mitigation measure. Awareness of maintenance companies and staff to the pollution potential of road salt, training of employees, well maintained <b>salt</b> <b>spreading</b> equipment, pre-wetting of salt and active management of road maintenance particularly in areas where roads run in close proximity to waterbodies are essential to limit the threat of road salt to water quality and the environment...|$|R

5000|$|The salt {{tectonics}} off the Louisiana {{gulf coast}} {{can be explained}} through two possible methods. The first method attributes <b>spreading</b> of the <b>salt</b> because of sedimentary loading while the second method points to slope instability as {{the primary cause of}} gliding of the salt. [...] The first method results in the formation of growth faults in the overlying sediment. [...] Growth faults are normal faults that occur simultaneously with sedimentation, causing them to have thicker sediment layers on the downthrown sides of the faults. In the second method both the salt and the sediment are moving, making it more likely to migrate.|$|R
5000|$|Salt has two key {{characteristics}} {{that make it}} unique in a tectonic setting, and important economically. The first is that salt (and other evaporites) deform plastically over geologic time, and thus behaves as a fluid rather than a rigid structure. This allows structures with salt components to deform more easily and have a slightly different appearance. Take, for example the Appalachians, which contain some salt deposits, and the Rocky Mountains, which is an accretionary terrain with little to no salt. This also allows {{for the creation of}} structural traps for oil and gas, as well as metals [...] which makes them sought after targets in industry.The second, which is the fact that evaporites are often less dense, or more buoyant, than the surrounding rock, which aids in its mobility and creates a Rayleigh Taylor instability. This means that the less dense substance {{will find a way to}} rise through or away from the more dense one. In salt tectonics, this occurs in three ways; the first is differential loading, where the salt flows from an area of high pressure to lower pressure, the second is gravitational <b>spreading,</b> where the <b>salt</b> <b>spreads</b> out laterally under its own gravitational weight, the last is thermal convection, where warmer - and thus less dense - salt rises through colder and more dense salt. This is only seen in laboratory settings due to the unlikely occurrence of salt bodies with great enough temperature variance.|$|R
