25|$|As {{the speed}} of an object increases, so does the drag force acting on it, which also depends on the {{substance}} it is passing through (for example air or water). At some speed, the drag or force of resistance will equal the gravitational pull on the object (buoyancy is considered below). At this point the object ceases to accelerate and continues falling at a constant speed called the terminal velocity (also called <b>settling</b> <b>velocity).</b> An object moving downward faster than the terminal velocity (for example because it was thrown downwards, it fell from a thinner part of the atmosphere, or it changed shape) will slow down until it reaches the terminal velocity. Drag depends on the projected area, here, the object's cross-section or silhouette in a horizontal plane. An object with a large projected area relative to its mass, such as a parachute, has a lower terminal velocity than one with a small projected area relative to its mass, such as a bullet.|$|E

40|$|Vertical {{redistribution}} of HNO 3 through large HNO 3 -containing particles associated with polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) {{plays an important}} role in the chemistry of the Arctic winter stratosphere. During the RECONCILE (Reconciliation of essential process parameters for an enhanced predictability of Arctic stratospheric ozone loss and its climate interactions) campaign, apparently very large NAT (nitric acid trihydrate) particles were observed by the airborne in situ probe FSSP- 100 (Molleker et al., 2014). Our analysis shows that the FSSP- 100 observations associated with the flight on 25 January 2010 cannot easily be explained assuming compact spherical NAT particles due to much too short growing time at temperatures below the existence temperature of NAT (T NAT). State-of-the-art simulations using CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere; Grooß et al., 2014) suggest considerably smaller particles. We consider the hypothesis that the simulation reproduces the NAT particle masses in a realistic way, but that real NAT particles may have larger apparent sizes compared to compact spherical particles, e. g. due to non-compact morphology or aspheric shape. Our study focuses on the consequence that such particles would have reduced <b>settling</b> <b>velocities</b> compared to compact spheres, altering the vertical {{redistribution of}} HNO 3. Utilising CLaMS simulations, we investigate the impact of reduced <b>settling</b> <b>velocities</b> of NAT particles on vertical HNO 3 redistribution and compare the results with observations of gas-phase HNO 3 by the airborne Fourier transform spectrometer MIPAS-STR associated with two RECONCILE flights. The MIPAS-STR observations confirm conditions consistent with denitrification by NAT particles for the flight on 25 January 2010 and show good agreement with the simulations within the limitations of the comparison. Best agreement is found if <b>settling</b> <b>velocities</b> between 100 and 50 % relative to compact spherical particles are considered (slight preference for the 70 % scenario). In contrast, relative <b>settling</b> <b>velocities</b> of 30 % result in too weak vertical HNO 3 redistribution.

Specifically we calculate the post-mortem lateral transport undergone by planktic foraminifera and a range of other biological proxy carriers (diatoms, radiolaria and fecal pellets transporting coccolithophores) in several regions with high current velocities.
