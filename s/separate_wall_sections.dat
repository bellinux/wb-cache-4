40|$|The massive gravity {{wall of the}} “Beli Iskar ” dam was {{constructed}} as a high-mountain hydro-technical facility in the period 1939 - 1945. It is 1900 m above the sea level and {{is part of the}} system of water supply of the city of Sofia. The wall bars the valley of the Beli Iskar river, and its length is 570 m, maximal height- 40 m, and dam live volume- about 15 millions m 3. The wall was built of non-reinforced concrete and its approximate volume is over 220 000 m 3, while <b>separate</b> <b>wall</b> <b>sections</b> were revetted with granite blocks. Dam durable exploitation accompanied by the intensive action of inflowing soft waters, {{as well as that of}} environmental factors, resulted in serious concrete corrosion. The report presents a synthesized analysis of the basic results of various inspections- technical, visual, destructive and non-destructive tests, complex structural analysis identifying potential corrosion development and its impact on the products of hydration, technical evaluation of the state of the wall concrete. Basic conclusions are drawn and specific recommendations to facility future exploitation are made.

40|$|The {{ecosystem}} service delivery of urban green infrastructure (UGI) is now manifest. Types {{and level of}} service provision, however, can alter radically, based on factors such as location, species choice, planting design and vegetation management. The value of vegetation to provide a cooling service is generally understood in hot climates, but the merit in temperate climates remains ambiguous. Indeed, policy makers within cooler countries (e. g. UK) remain to be convinced that expenditure on UGI is justified, {{at least from the}} point of view of city cooling alone. Occasional warm days do occur of course, and climate change models predict that heat wave events will become more frequent within the UK, including those that pose a risk to human health. To help UK policy makers make better-informed decisions around UGI, a number of our research programmes have targeted the role vegetation plays in regulating temperature, but specifically within the context of a maritime-temperate climate. Two examples of ‘green interventions’ are discussed here. The first documents the role of green façades to cool a wall system and the second illustrates the cooling influence conferred by roadside trees. Both experiments used a replicated sampling approach to ensure statistical robustness, and hence convince policy makers that data is representative of UK scenarios and results are reproducible. In the first experiment, 10 <b>separate</b> <b>wall</b> <b>sections</b> are used to investigate the cooling influence of two different plant genotypes (Prunus and Phaseolus) on both exterior and interior wall spaces. In the second study, road surface temperatures are documented with respect to both built and green infrastructure, i. e. we compare the influence of buildings and street trees on the surface temperatures across a road profile. Again replicate data are used to provide a ‘generic’ summer temperature profile for the city of Sheffield, rather than just specific locations at one point in time. Results show that green facades can reduce exterior and interior (cavity) wall air temperature by 3 oC and 5 oC respectively. Likewise, large street trees have a mean cooling influence of 4. 5 oC on road surfaces near their base compared to comparable sections adjacent to buildings. To maximise cooling, the data suggests that trees need to be provided on both sides of a roadway, i. e. a single tree did not manage to cool the pavement at th...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of on-site wastewater treatment systems is one means {{to meet the}} infrastructure needs of the rapidly expanding urban population. With space at a premium, the existing technologies for on-site systems should be reexamined and adapted to fit {{the needs of the}} urban setting. This study examined the potential to combine the existing wastewater treatment technology of the intermittent media filter with the new architectural trend of green walls, creating a treatment system with minimal spatial footprint and with a built-in urban greening component. A novel vegetated intermittent media filter wall was constructed in Ås, Norway and dosed with domestic greywater for a period of three months. Overall treatment performance and removal trends over the 175 cm filter depth were monitored. Three <b>separate</b> <b>wall</b> <b>sections</b> were constructed to monitor the treatments effects of containing wall material choice and presence of vegetation. Despite a daily dosing rate of nearly 1000 l/m 2 the system achieved average reduction rates of over 95 %, 80 %, 90 %, 30 %, and 69 % for BOD 5, COD, TSS, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively, as well as approximately two log unit reduction of bacteria indicator E. coli. Examination over the depth of the system showed that most organic (COD) and solids removal takes place in the upper 15 cm, but with a sudden increase in loading a greater removal was seen at lower depths. With regard to nitrification, increased nitrate levels did not appear before 100 cm filter depth, likely suppressed by high organic loading at the surface. The findings suggest that the great filter height associated with the wall design was useful for buffering sudden increases in hydraulic loading, as well as for facilitating nitrification under extreme loading conditions. Wall material with a more permeable construction (geotextile grid) preformed slightly better in the treatment of organics than non-permeable wall material (plastic liner), but confounding variables reduce the confidence in this finding. The vegetated wall section showed the greatest removal rates in almost every parameter measured, especially removal of E. coli. A difference in hydraulic retention times as shown by (NaCl) tracer tests is the likely cause of this phenomenon, rather than the vegetation itself. The significant reduction of constituents of concern using only a small spatial footprint make this system a worthy candidate for further research and development regarding urban wastewater treatment applications...|$|E

40|$|For {{active control}} {{purposes}} a double wall structure enables {{the measurement of}} a time advanced reference signal for a feedforward system because the reference signal can be measured at the primary panel and the control system {{can be applied to}} the second panel. In aerospace engineering these double <b>wall</b> <b>sections</b> are often filled with absorbent materials. These materials have an influence on the structural dynamics of the double <b>wall</b> <b>section.</b> In order to guarantee the function of the feedforward control system the damped double <b>wall</b> <b>section</b> has to show a linear system behavior. In order to analyze the linearity of double wall panels with different absorbent materials this study experimentally investigates different damping concepts on a simple double wall structure. The double wall structure is a buildup with two 0. 8 x 0. 6 m² aluminum plates and different damping concepts are applied to the cavity between. The absorbent material is added to the secondary panel where glass wool in different configurations or constraint layer damping is applied. The linear system behavior up to 500 Hz can be verified with the coherence function for all concepts. Above 500 Hz it can be shown that the test set-up has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the double <b>wall</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R
