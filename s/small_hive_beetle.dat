5|$|A few {{species of}} beetles are ectoparasitic on mammals. One such species, Platypsyllus castoris, parasitises beavers (Castor spp.). This beetle lives as a {{parasite}} {{both as a}} larva and as an adult, feeding on epidermal tissue and possibly on skin secretions and wound exudates. They are strikingly flattened dorsoventrally, no doubt as an adaptation for slipping between the beavers' hairs. They are wingless and eyeless, as are many other ectoparasites. Others are kleptoparasites of other invertebrates, such as the <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetle</b> (Aethina tumida) that infests honey bee nests, while many species are parasitic inquilines or commensal in the nests of ants. A few groups of beetles are primary parasitoids of other insects, feeding off of, and eventually killing their hosts.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1980s, most U.S. hobby beekeepers were farmers or {{relatives}} of a farmer, lived in rural areas, and kept bees with techniques passed down for generations.

40|$|Foraging {{animals can}} choose to act as predators or not {{depending}} {{on the level of}} defensiveness of the potential prey. This requires prior evaluation of prey defensiveness, which can be variable, e. g. young insects are usually less able to defend themselves. Here we show that <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles,</b> Aethina tumida, which are scavengers and parasites of honey bee, Apis mellifera, colonies, are facultative predators of young adult host workers. Adult female beetles mounted and attacked young workers more often than their older nestmates, indicating that the beetle is assessing the defensiveness of the host and is adjusting its behaviour accordingly. Since adult female beetles need proteins to activate their ovaries, predation on defenceless young alive host workers offers another rewarding food source, which can obviously not be exploited by beetle larvae. In conclusion, adult <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> {{seem to be able to}} assess the trade-off between safety and food reward.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{identifies}} {{differences in}} the effects of <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> on flight activity and nests of European-derived honey bees (Apis mellifera) in the United States and Cape honey bees (Apis mellifera capensis) in South Africa. Treatments consisted of control colonies ($<$ 5 beetles/colony) and experimental colonies receiving beetles (treatment). Absconding day {{did not differ significantly}} between treatment or bee race but absconding was greater between the two treatments in European colonies than in Cape ones. Cape bees used significantly more propolis than European bees. Honey stores were significantly greater in Cape honey bee colonies than in European ones. Bee weight did not differ significantly between treatments or bee race. Treatment did not significantly affect bee populations, brood area, or average flight activity in Cape colonies but it did significantly lower all of these in European colonies. The effects of treatment in European colonies are symptomatic of absconding preparation. Treatment significantly lowered the amount of pollen stores in Cape colonies, but this effect was not found in European colonies. The number of beetles in control colonies was significantly higher in European colonies than Cape ones while the percentage of beetles remaining in non-absconding treated colonies was higher in Cape colonies than European ones. These data indicate that adult <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> are sufficient to cause significant harmful effects on colonies of European, but not Cape, honey bees...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{the current and}} past distributions of North American <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> (Aethina tumida) having two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplotypes.

Later collections from this {{and other parts of}} South Carolina appear more similar to those found in other states. The body size of beetles was not correlated with their haplotype, suggesting that differences in haplotype frequency do not reflect selection pressures on covarying differences in the genomes of these beetles.

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> (SHBs) are generalists {{native to}} sub-Saharan Africa and {{reproduce}} {{in association with}} honeybees, bumblebees, stingless bees, fruits and meat. The SHB has recently become an invasive species, and introductions have been recorded from America, Australia, Europe and Asia since 1996. hile SHBs are usually considered a minor pest in Africa, they can cause significant damage to social bee colonies in their new ranges. Potential reasons for differential impact include differences in bee behaviour, climate and release from natural enemies. Here, we provide an overview on biology, distribution, pest status, diagnosis, control and prevention to foster adequate mitigation and stimulate future research. SHBs have become a global threat to both apiculture and wild bee populations, but our knowledge of this pest is still limited, reating demand for more research {{in all areas of}} its biology...|$|R
40|$|Workers {{from social}} insect colonies use {{different}} defence strategies to combat invaders. Nevertheless, some parasitic species {{are able to}} bypass colony defences. In particular, some beetle nest invaders cannot be killed or removed by workers of social bees, thus creating the need for alternative social defence strategies to ensure colony survival. Here we show, using diagnostic radioentomology, that stingless bee workers (Trigona carbonaria) immediately mummify invading adult <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> (Aethina tumida) alive by coating them {{with a mixture of}} resin, wax and mud, thereby preventing severe damage to the colony. In sharp contrast to the responses of honeybee and bumblebee colonies, the rapid live mummification strategy of T. carbonaria effectively prevents beetle advancements and removes their ability to reproduce. The convergent evolution of mummification in stingless bees and encapsulation in honeybees is another striking example of co-evolution between insect societies and their parasites...|$|R

40|$|Multiple infections {{of managed}} honeybee, Apis mellifera, colonies are {{inevitable}} {{due to the}} ubiquitous ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and might be an underlying cause of winter losses. Here we investigated the role of adult <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles,</b> Aethina tumida, alone and in combination with V. destructor for winter losses and for infections with the microsporidian endoparasite Nosema ceranae. We found no significant influence of A. tumida and V destructor alone or in combination on the numbers of N. ceranae spores. Likewise, A. tumida alone had no significant effects on winter losses, which is most likely due to the observed high winter mortality of the adult beetles. Therefore, our data suggest that A. tumida is unlikely to contribute to losses of overwintering honeybee colonies. However, high losses occurred in all groups highly infested with V. destructor, supporting {{the central role of}} the mite for colony losses...|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} of honeybee pathogens by free-flying pests, such as <b>small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> (=SHB), would {{be independent of}} bees and beekeepers and thereby constitute a new challenge for pathogen control measures. Here we show that larval and adult SHB become contaminated with Paenibacillus larvae spores when exposed to honeybee brood combs with clinical American foulbrood (=AFB) symptoms in the laboratory. This contamination persists in pupae and newly emerged adults. After exposure to contaminated adult SHB, honeybee field colonies showed higher numbers of P. larvae spores in worker and honey samples after five weeks. Despite these results, the rather low number of P. larvae spores on adult SHB suggests that clinical AFB outbreaks are not likely. However, even small spore numbers can be sufficient to spread P. larvae. Therefore, our data clearly show that SHB are vectors of P. larvae. We suggest considering the role of SHB in AFB control in areas where both pests are established...|$|R

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>hive</b> <b>beetles</b> (SHBs) are {{a global}} pest of European {{honeybee}} colonies.

Low RH reduced survival. The application of DE reduced survival in addition to RH. Adults treated with corn flour (control) showed no difference in survival from untreated beetles. Scanning electron microscopy images showed no scarification of adult beetle cuticle after exposure to DE; therefore, water loss is likely facilitated through non-abrasive means such as the adsorption of cuticular lipids. The data agree with the hypothesis that DE causes mortality through water loss from treated insects. Egress, ingress, mortality and the egg-laying behaviours of beetles were observed {{in relation to a}} popular in-hive trench trap with and without the addition of DE.

Regardless {{of the number of}} males available for mating, egg-laying varied through time. Overall, females that were presented with two males for a 5 -day mating period had higher fecundity than females provided with one male or three male partners. High temperature accelerated ovary activation and egg-laying regardless of female to male ratio during a 15 -h mating period. Knowledge of these factors that influence fecundity helps elucidate why SHBs are very successful pests of honey bees...|$|R
