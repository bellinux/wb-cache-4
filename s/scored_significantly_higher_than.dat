Correlational and inferential statistical analyses were used. A stratified random sample of 1, 102 mainly black and female learners participated in the study. The Adult Learner Self-Directedness Scale (ALSDS) identified four constructs of adult learner self-directedness in an Open Distance Learning Higher Education (ODLHE) milieu, namely the strategic utilisation of officially provided resources, engaged academic activity, success orientation for ODLHE, and academically motivated behaviour. The research indicated that significant differences exist between the gender, race and age groups with regard to self-directedness.

In addition, the authors implemented a survey and study that included additional categories relating to career maturity. The study was performed on 250 university students, using an anonymous questionnaire that graded resp onses using criteria to measure a sense of belonging, psychological apathy characteristics, areas of decreased motivation, and career maturity. The subjects were classified by the school year to which they belonged, their gender, {{and whether or not they}} had a boyfriend/girlfriend, and consideration was given to the relationship between psychological apathy, decreased motivation, career maturity and a sense of belonging. In terms of gender difference in regard to each of the criteria, partially, the study indicated that male students <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> female students in terms of a sense of belonging, females <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> males for decreased motivation in regard to classes, and males <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> females in relation to career maturity.

40|$|Beliefs about voices {{have been}} shown to be more {{important}} than voice content in determining an individual's emotional and behavioural responses to command hallucinations (CH). Inflated responsibility beliefs (IRB) and thought-aCtion fusion (TAF), originally implicated in QCD, have been found in psychosis. The current study examined whether IRB and TAF are relevant in CH, and whether there is a relationship between the two constructs in voice hearers. 18 people with CH, 17 with non-CH, and 23 non-clinical controls (NCC) completed measures of IRB, TAF, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression and anxiety. People with CH were also interviewed about their responsibility beliefs for compliance with voices, using the pie chart technique commonly used in anxiety disorder treatments. For the auditory hallucination (AH) group, a significant positive relationship was found between IRB and both TAF-Moral and TAF-Likelihood, however only TAF-Moral remained significant after controlling for potential confounds. In terms of differences in IRB, the AH group <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> NCC. The CH group had significantly higher IRB than non-CH and NCC on both measures of IRB. The non-CH group <b>scored</b> <b>Significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> NCC on one measure of IRB only. In terms of TAF, the AH group <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> NCC across all TAF subscales. The CH group had a significantly higher TAF bias than NCC on all TAF subscales, and <b>scored</b> <b>Significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> non-CH on T AF-Moral, but not TAF-Likelihood beliefs. The non-CH group had a significantly higher TAF bias than NCC for TAF- Likelihood domains, but not TAF-Moral. The results suggested IRB and TAF are relevant in command hallucinations, which are not simply accounted for by the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Further research into the role of IRB and TAF in compliance with commands is needed, as well as research into more targeted assessment and treatment approaches for command hallucinations. 3 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The questionnaire identifies five major patient safety factors: Teamwork climate, Safety climate, Job satisfaction, Perceptions of management, and Working conditions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Statistical analysis included multiple linear regression and independent samples t-tests. SETTING: Seven OOH casualty clinics and 17 GP practices in Norway. SUBJECTS: In October and November 2012, 510 primary health care providers working in OOH casualty clinics and GP practices (316 doctors and 194 nurses) {{were invited to participate}} anonymously. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To study whether patterns in patient safety attitudes were related to professional background, gender, age, and clinical setting. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 52 %; 72 % of the nurses and 39 % of the doctors answered the questionnaire. In the OOH clinics, nurses <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> doctors on Safety climate and Job satisfaction.
