5|$|Coventry were relegated in 1951–52, with Taylor {{having made}} 29 appearances. Coventry {{finished}} {{sixth in the}} Third Division South in 1952–53, with Taylor only appearing eight times. It proved to be Storey's final season as manager, and Taylor later cited <b>Storer</b> as his managerial mentor, and {{would go on to}} quote <b>Storer</b> numerous times throughout his career. Taylor played 42 games as Coventry posted a 14th-place finish under Jack Fairbrother in 1953–54, then played ten matches as they finished ninth in 1954–55. Taylor decided to leave the club after losing his first team place to future Coventry City Hall of Famer and England international Reg Matthews.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Lunar Lander {{game was}} a 1969 text-based game called Lunar, or alternately the Lunar Landing Game. It was originally {{written in the}} FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer by Jim <b>Storer</b> while a student at Lexington High School {{in the fall of}} 1969. <b>Storer</b> submitted the game to the DEC users' newsletter, which distributed the source code to readers. Other versions of the concept were written soon after: a version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC, among others.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} Ivy Lane club, he married Sidney <b>Storer,</b> heir to a 20,000 pound fortune with Hawkins {{receiving}} an addition 10,000 pound dowry, in 1753 {{and his career}} started to quickly pick up: he bought a home on the Thames at Twickenham near Horace Walpole; he published Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler in 1760; he was appointed as a magistrate in 1761; in 1765 became Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for the County of Middlesex; and wrote a A General History of the Science and Practice of Musicin 1776. He was knighted in 1772, and served as Chairman of the Quarter Session.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins {{was also}} {{committed}} {{to education and}} conservation. He made appearances on the TV series Science in Action, traveled to Asia to promote science education, and chaired a U.C. elementary school science project which recommended that science be taught to children as early as six. In conjunction with the Sierra Club he produced two educational films: Nature Next Door (1962) and No Room for Wilderness? (1967). Stebbins co-authored revisions of the widely used textbooks General Zoology (5th ed.,1972; 6th ed., 1979) and Elements of Zoology (4th ed., 1974), books originally written by Tracy <b>Storer</b> and Robert Usinger.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction of}} storage and futures trading when producers make decisions covering many harvests. In this more general context, by examining how risks are distributed between <b>storers</b> and growers, results are obtained that differ dramatically from previous models in the literature. When storage is costly, <b>storers</b> may reduce risk by taking long hedging positions, rather than selling inventories short. Contrary to the conventional view (in a tradition beginning with J. M. Keynes and J. R. Hicks), costless storage does not imply downward bias of futures prices (" normal backwardation"). Hedging against the optimally varying planting costs promotes upward price bias (" contango"), while hedging against storage costs to be incurred promotes downward bias. When the risks faced by growers and <b>storers</b> are negatively correlated, futures trading can substitute for vertical integration {{as a means of}} reducing risk.

5|$|The other game Ahl {{originally}} ported to BASIC, Lunar Lander, {{appeared in}} the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim <b>Storer</b> while {{a high school student}} in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC. Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. A year or so later, all three BASIC versions of the game appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (<b>Storer</b> version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to the textual summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of BASIC Computer Games.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 saw {{upheaval}} at the Bruins. Coach Sinden {{became the}} general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and Johnny McKenzie joined the upstart World Hockey Association. Coach Tom Johnson was fired fifty-two games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin, {{who had once}} coached Orr. The Adams family, which had owned the team {{since its founding in}} the 1920s, sold it to <b>Storer</b> Broadcasting. The Bruins' season came to a premature end in a first-round loss in the 1973 playoffs, losing Esposito to injury in that first round. Orr amassed 101 points during the regular season (he only played 63 games to due injury) but had only two points in the playoff loss.|$|E
5|$|The 1975–76 {{season was}} Orr's final {{season with the}} Bruins and it was tumultuous. Orr's {{contract}} was ending after the season, potentially making him a free agent. The Bruins were sold by <b>Storer</b> Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it.|$|E

50|$|WAGA-TV {{originally}} {{broadcast from}} studios and transmission facilities located at 1018 West Peachtree Street NW. This building {{would later become}} home to pioneering superstation and leading Atlanta independent station WTBS (channel 17, now WPCH-TV). On June 21, 1966, channel 5 opened its current facilities on Briarcliff Road Northeast, in Druid Hills. The studio resembles an antebellum Southern mansion, a type of architecture that was typical for <b>Storer's</b> broadcasting facilities. While this design was somewhat {{out of place in}} most of <b>Storer's</b> other markets (which also included Toledo, Detroit, Cleveland and Milwaukee) it was a perfect fit for Atlanta.|$|R
5|$|Harry <b>Storer,</b> {{appointed}} {{just before}} the war ended, won the championship of the 1945–46 Football League South wartime league and the Second Division title two years later. Under Bob Brocklebank Birmingham were relegated from the First Division, but they reached the semifinal of the 1951 FA Cup and Brocklebank signed many of the players moulded by Arthur Turner into a successful team. Turner won promotion in 1955, the next season led the team to their highest league finish of sixth place and their second FA Cup final, and in 1957 reached the semifinals of both the FA Cup and the inaugural Inter-Cities Fairs Cup competition. In 1958 the club experimented with a joint appointment, hiring Pat Beasley to work alongside Turner; the experiment annoyed Turner and after six months prompted his resignation. Beasley and successor Gil Merrick took the club to successive finals of the Fairs Cup in 1960 and 1961. Merrick managed the club to their first major trophy, the League Cup in 1963, beating local rivals Aston Villa 3–1 on aggregate, but {{four years in the}} bottom six places earned him the sack.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} playing career at Nottingham Forest during World War II, before joining Coventry City in July 1945. He spent the 1953–54 season as Coventry's first choice goalkeeper, but was {{otherwise}} mostly used a reserve player. He was sold on to Middlesbrough for £3,500 in 1955, and kept {{goal for the}} Second Division club for four full seasons after being promoted to the first team in the 1956–57 campaign. He lost his first team place in 1960, and in June 1961 joined Port Vale for a £750 fee. He took a free transfer to non-league Burton Albion in May 1962, where he ended his playing career. Throughout his playing career he built for his future management career by learning from Coventry manager Harry <b>Storer</b> and building {{a close relationship with}} Middlesbrough striker Brian Clough, six years his junior.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Storer's</b> {{paintings}} are richly textured, mixed-media collages that often include a playful juxtaposition between contemporary cultural icons and historical objects or references. She paints in a faux-naïve style. The process she uses to create her work involves creating many layers and then [...] "peeling away {{the surface to}} come back to the first marks." [...] Writing that appears in her work is considered [...] "childlike." [...] An article in the Philadelphia Weekly pointed to the influence of <b>Storer's</b> ancestry in her art, saying, [...] "The frustration at being kept from the truth has given <b>Storer's</b> art a kind of angry edge." [...] Her 2004 exhibition at the National Museum of American Jewish History was organized by the museum at Santa Clara University and concerned personal identity and the discovery of her heritage. A 2003 review in the San Jose Mercury News said, [...] "Pictures, we like to think, should yield up their meanings easily - at least pictures of the real world: flowers, animals, people and the like. So it can be a bit discomfiting when our expectation of such instant understanding is thwarted, as so often happens in the art of Inez Storer." [...] Her art is also influenced by Hollywood stage design and can be in seen in the [...] "theatrical space" [...] that her female figures inhabit in much of her work. <b>Storer's</b> art often deals with difficult issues that are hidden within symbols and children's stories. Her work has been compared to that of artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Henri Rosseau, Marc Chagall and Salvador Dalí.|$|R
