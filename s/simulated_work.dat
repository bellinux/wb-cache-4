40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the changes in work-related {{abilities}} of members after attending the Clubhouse program for 12 weeks. The extent to which the changes would contribute to members' performance on <b>simulated</b> <b>work</b> tasks was also investigated. A total of 39 people with mental illnesses, primarily schizophrenia, attending Phoenix Clubhouse participated in the study. Seventeen were newly recruited members to the Clubhouse. The other 22, who served as the control group, were existing members who had been attending the Clubhouse for more than three months. All the participants were assessed by the McCarron-dial System (Observational Emotional Inventory-Revised, McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development), Cognistat, Chinese Work Personality Profile, WHO Disability Assessment Schedule and WHOQOL-Bref-HK at the baseline and 12 weeks after attending the Clubhouse program. They were required to complete a set of <b>simulated</b> <b>work</b> tasks after 12 weeks. New members showed significant improvement in emotional-coping abilities (impulsive-frustration and depression-withdrawal) and work personality (task orientation, social skills, and team work) after attending the Clubhouse program for 12 weeks. The increase in emotional-coping skills (depression-withdrawal) was found to contribute to better performance on typing tasks, whereas emotional coping (anxiety) contributed to better performance on cleansing tasks. Three months' participation in the Clubhouse program appears to have positive effects on emotional-coping abilities and work personality. The emotional-coping abilities were found to predict good performance in simulated clerical and maintenance jobs. Recommendations and suggestions for further research are discussed.

40|$|The {{increase}} in world population {{leads to the}} growthin energy demand. The primary sources of this energycome from the combustion of fossil fuel which producing oxides of nitrogen and other harmful greenhouse gas emission. However, biodiesel offers a solution as an alternative fuel for internal combustion engine but higher in NOx emission. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system is used to lower the NOx emission. This paper focuses on determining the effect of EGR and palm biodiesel on fuel consumption (SFC), exhaust gas temperature (EGT) and exhaust emissions (NOx, CO, UHC, and CO 2). Experimental works using a multi-cylinder diesel engine with EGR and <b>simulated</b> <b>works</b> using Diesel-RK were performed at a constant engine speed of 2500 rpm in full load condition. The results showed that, from the <b>simulated</b> and experimental <b>works,</b> palm biodiesel significantly increased fuel consumption, increased NOx and slightly decreases in other emissions including CO 2, CO, and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimization of the lifetime and energy consumption of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). These two competing objectives {{have a deep}} influence over the service qualification of networks and according to recent studies, cluster formation is an appropriate solution for their achievement.

40|$|Abstract Epic is {{an image}} {{retrieval}} system that im-plements a novel spatial-querying mechanism. A user-centred, task-oriented, comparative evaluation of Epic was undertaken in which {{two versions of the}} system [...] one set up to enable spatial queries only, the other allowing textual queries only-were compared. Use was made of the two systems by design professionals in <b>simulated</b> <b>work</b> task situations, and quantitative and qualitative data col-lected as indicators of the levels of users ’ satisfaction. Re sults demonstrated that users often had a ‘mental image’ of a potentially satisfying picture in mind, that they were happy to express this need in visual terms, and that in doing so they preferred to have access to Epic’s spatial-querying facility. Success in obtaining statistically signif-icant results appears to support validation of the novel methodological framework adopted. ...|$|E
