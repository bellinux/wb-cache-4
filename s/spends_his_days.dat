5|$|An angry Shekhar {{comes back}} home to play a {{favourite}} tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing Rabindranath Tagore’s tune on his piano while young Lalita and Koel are around. Lalita, with her parents having {{died in a car}} accident, lives with Gurcharan’s family. Koel is her cousin whereas Charu is her neighbour. As this scene flashes across Shekhar’s mind, he sings a song full of sadness and loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. The rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar <b>spends</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> playing the music of Rabindranath Tagore or Elvis Presley and composing his own songs with Lalita rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantiya, the beautiful but devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Charu’s house. Girish seems smitten by Lalita while Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lolita’s close friendship with Girish.|$|E

However, his wife is often resentful {{of the time he}} spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.|$|E

He <b>spends</b> <b>his</b> <b>days</b> working as a chauffeur and hustling for prescription drugs along the border between Texas and Mexico. He and fellow mutant Caliban live in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, where they care for a senile Charles Xavier, who had inadvertently killed several of his X-Men in a seizure-induced psychic attack one year earlier. He is tasked by Gabriela, a nurse for Transigen, to escort an 11-year-old girl, Laura, to a place in North Dakota called [...] "Eden."

After accepting shelter from a family they helped on the highway, Xavier is killed by X-24, a perfect clone of Logan. Logan and Laura escape and bury Xavier's body near a lake. Eventually, Logan and Laura arrive at Eden, which is a safe haven run by Rictor and former Transigen test subjects. There, Logan learns that the children will make an eight-mile journey across the forest to the Canadian border and entrusts Laura to them before departing on his own.

He then plows through the Reavers, but the serum quickly wears off before he meets Zander Rice, the head of the Transigen project, who sought to avenge his father's death during the Weapon X program by creating the virus. Logan kills Rice and confronts X-24. However, with his healing factor now gone, Logan is no match for X-24, who impales him through a tree. Laura shoots X-24 in the head with an adamantium bullet that Logan had kept with him for years, destroying his brain and half his skull. After Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies in Laura's arms, Laura and the children bury him before continuing their journey across the border.
