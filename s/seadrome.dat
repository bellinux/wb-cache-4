50|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} the depression, Mr Armstrong {{made a number of}} rebids for the program and eventually the project was downsized from eight to five <b>seadromes</b> as planes became more advanced. By WWII, the advent of long range passenger flight made the concept obsolete. However, Mr Armstrong's efforts with DuPont and Sun Ship Building, owned by Sun Oil, led his ideas and basic designs to be used by the oil industry to create the Semi-submersible off shore oil rig.|$|R
50|$|The first {{discussion}} of a floating airport was for trans-Atlantic flights. At that time a passenger aircraft capable of making the trip could be built {{but because of the}} massive need for fuel for the flight, it had a limited payload. An article appeared in the January 1930 issue of Popular Mechanics in which a model of a floating airport located in the Atlantic was proposed. To make safe flight possible with the aviation technology of that time, it called for eight such airports in the Atlantic. But unlike future floating airport ideas which were free floating, this 1930 concept had a floating airport platform, but with stabilizer legs which prevent the flight deck from pitching and rolling, similar in concept to some of today's off shore oil rigs. The cost of establishing eight such floating airports in 1930 was estimated at approximately USD$12,000,000. The idea of floating airports was forgotten until in 1935 the famous French aviation pilot and builder Bleriot gave one of his last interviews in which he made the case for floating airports in mid-Atlantic; he called them <b>Seadromes</b> as a solution to economical trans-Atlantic passenger flights.|$|R

50|$|Rehoboth retransited the Panama Canal on 18 August 1945, {{and after}} calls at San Diego and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she arrived off Okinawa on 2 October 1945. There {{for two weeks}} she tended planes of Air-Sea Rescue Squadron 6 (VH-6), then steamed to Jinsen (now Incheon), Korea, where she took command of a <b>seadrome</b> and tended planes of Patrol Bombing Squadron 20 (VPB-20). In mid-November 1945 she crossed the Yellow Sea, and from 18 November 1945 to 21 December 1945 she tended a {{detachment}} of VH-6. On 25 December 1945 she arrived at Shanghai, China, to tend Air-Sea Rescue Squadron 1 (VH-1) and Patrol Bombing Squadron 25 (VPB-25) seaplanes. On 25 January 1946, Rehoboth got underway for Nagoya, Japan, thence proceeded to Kobe, Japan, on 17 February 1946, where she set up an auxiliary <b>seadrome</b> area.

50|$|A <b>seadrome</b> {{was to be}} a {{floating}} steel landing strip, the size of an aircraft carrier, anchored to the ocean floor by steel cables. It would rise 70 ft or more above the surface of the ocean by tubular columns that would allow waves to pass underneath. The columns would terminate in ballast tanks 100 ft below the surface. The runway platform would provide a 1200 ft runway by 200 ft wide with extended midsides to allow for a hotel, restaurant, and other facilities. The plan was to position a series of seadromes across the Atlantic Ocean about 350 mi apart to allow for refueling of airplanes. He had been thinking of the idea as early as 1913. In 1915 he completed the first design, and in 1922 he built a 1/300 scale model. In 1926 he performed a test that he filmed, with scale models of his <b>seadrome</b> and the ocean liner Majestic in a tank of water. He used a fan to create the equivalent of 40 ft waves, and the <b>seadrome</b> was stable. In 1927 when the Lindbergh and other transatlantic flights were made, newspapers started running stories of his concept. He had financial backing until The Depression of the 1930s. The last time he made the proposal was in 1943, during World War II. By that time long range aircraft had already been designed for the war effort, and aircraft carriers were already in use.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, air crews from Salem flew {{neutrality}} patrols {{along the}} coast and the Air Station roster grew to 37 aircraft. Anti-submarine patrols were flown on a regular basis. In October 1944, Air Station Salem was officially designated as the first Air-Sea Rescue station on the eastern seaboard. The Martin PBM Mariner, a hold-over from the war, became the primary rescue aircraft. In the mid-1950s helicopters came as did Grumman HU-16 Albatross amphibious flying boats (UFs).

5000|$|Yakutat reached Wakanoura Wan, Honshū, on 22 September 1945, finding {{seaplane}} tender [...] {{already there}} and operating as a tender for seaplanes.

To be believable in their shots the girls must get tired doing physical efforts so they compete through a running contest, a bicycle race and a wall-climbing challenge. Valeria always results in being left behind and refuses to complete her wall-climbing task. Just after this each girl poses in the photo shoot to advertise the energy drink.|$|E
50|$|Yakutat tended the PBM Mariners of Patrol Bomber Squadron 27 (VPB-27) for {{the rest}} of World War II. She {{established}} <b>seadrome</b> operations at Kerama Retto on 28 March 1945 and {{spent the rest of the}} important Okinawa campaign in seaplane tending duties. The presence of Japanese aircraft in the vicinity on numerous occasions meant many hours spent at general quarters stations, lookouts' eyes and radar alert for any sign of approaching enemy planes. Yakutat provided quarters and subsistence for the crews of the Mariners and furnished the planes with gasoline, lubricating oil, and jet-assisted take-off (JATO) units. The Mariners conducted antisubmarine and air-sea rescue ("Dumbo") duties locally, as well as offensive patrols that ranged as far as the coast of Korea.|$|E
50|$|Cumberland Sound was {{underway}} on 28 October 1944, bound for Pearl Harbor carrying six planes, passengers, and cargo.

From 13 December 1944 to 1 January 1945 she completed her training at Eniwetok, then loaded spare parts at Guam and arrived at Ulithi 12 January. She operated search patrols from this base until 24 June, then returned to Eniwetok, where until 7 August she tended the seaplanes of Patrol Bomber Squadron 22. Cumberland Sound rendezvoused with elements of the 3rd Fleet at Okinawa 18 August and sailed to Tokyo Bay, arriving 28 August {{to set up a}} <b>seadrome.</b> She remained on occupation duty, conducting search operations and special flights until 24 November when she headed for the United States.|$|E

Following voyage repairs and alterations at the Boston Navy Yard, she sailed to Norfolk in early July 1944 and then made passenger and freight voyages to Bahia Praia and Horta, Azores, and to Casablanca, before returning to Norfolk on 16 August 1944. On 7 September 1944, Barnegat departed Norfolk and proceeded to Eastern Bay, in Maryland {{at the mouth of}} the Patuxent River, where she laid out a seaplane operating area, placing mooring buoys and <b>seadrome</b> lights to prepare for training operations with Patrol Wing 5 (VP-5). She worked with these aircraft over the next two weeks and returned to Norfolk on 23 September 1944.|$|E

5000|$|... 24 December 1941: VP-13 {{dispatched}} a Coronado to Pearl Harbor carrying Admiral Ernest King and Admiral Chester W.

Upon arrival, both aircraft were attached to PatWing-2, as the Flag Detachment of VP-13, based at NAS Ford Island, Pearl Harbor. Duties assigned were generally those of long, 14 to 15 hour patrols, broken by occasional trips to Australia and areas of the South Paciﬁc needing quick deliveries of supplies or important personnel. The runs to Sydney became so frequent that a maintenance unit was set up at the Qantas Empire Airways <b>seadrome</b> on Rose Bay. By June 1942, four PB2Ys were in constant service ﬂying 12 round trips a month from NAS Kaneohe Bay to Rose Bay, over 4000 mi one-way.|$|E
