5000|$|In typical {{high-volume}} bread-production, {{the dough}} is cut (divided) into individual pieces and allowed to [...] "recover" [...] for 5-8 minutes (intermediate proofing). Each piece of dough is then shaped (moulded), placed in a baking tin {{and moved to the}} humidity- and temperature-controlled proofing chamber, where it sits for about 45-50 minutes. It is now ready to be baked. Baking takes 17-25 minutes at 450 °F (about 230 °C). After baking, the loaves are removed from the baking tin (de-panning) and then go to the cooler, where, about two hours later, they are, where necessary, <b>sliced</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged</b> <b>and</b> ready for despatch. In UK-standard bread, the dough piece is [...] "cross-panned" [...] at the moulding stage; this involves cutting the dough piece into four and turning each piece by 90° before placing it in the baking tin.

40|$|Background: Ready-to-eat (RTE) {{foods are}} {{considered}} a high risk food group, since they are often consumed without a cooking step. Luncheon meat, a RTE food widely consumed in Brazil, is traditionally produced as industrially vacuum-packaged loaves <b>and</b> afterwards is <b>sliced</b> <b>and</b> re-packaged at retail stores. Since this practice may pose an additional hazard of contamination, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate total coliform counts (TCC), coagulase-positive staphylococci counts (CPS), and the occurrence of Escherichia coli and Listeria sp. in luncheon meat samples <b>sliced</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged</b> at supermarkets. Materials, Methods & Results: Three supermarket stores belonging to either regional or national chains located in Porto Alegre were intentionally chosen, and luncheon meat samples were purchased from the same sampled stores weekly during a 20 -week period. In each sampling event, five store-packaged luncheon meat samples were obtained and analyzed. Individual samples (25 g) were homogenized, decimally diluted in buffered peptone water and submitted to TCC in Violet Red Bile Agar. Thermotolerant coliform (FC) were confirmed in EC broth incubated at 45 °C. Confirmed tubes were streaked on McConkey agar and submitted to E. coli identification. Isolation and enumeration of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) were performed on Baird-Parker agar. The presence of Listeria sp. was tested in pooled samples submitted to pre-enrichment in University of Vermont (UVM) Listeria Enrichment broth, followed by incubation in Fraser broth and isolation on tryptose agar with nalidixic acid and Palcam agar. TCC mean varied from 1. 2 log 10 CFU. g- 1 (store B) to 5. 5 log 10 CFU. g- 1 (store C), while CPS mean counts were similar (0. 63; 0. 65 and 0. 86 log 10 CFU. g- 1) for samples purchased at the three stores. Considering Brazilian standards for FCC, in stores A (n= 6) and C (n= 8) samples considered unsafe (above 3 log. g- 1) were found, while all samples purchased at store B are considered sound according to that standard. Moreover, three samples from each store (A and C) confirmed for the presence of E. coli. Samples contaminated with Listeria sp. (n= 16) were also found. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from six samples, and was found in all sampled supermarkets. A trend of Listeria sp. isolation frequency in samples with higher TCC was observed. Discussion: The results demonstrated that bacteria may be introduced in luncheon meat during the <b>slicing</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaging</b> at supermarkets. Our data are in accordance with other reports that indicate slicing as a critical control point of contamination and transfer of pathogen, including L. monocytogenes, to foods during processing. Differences observed on extend of product contamination may have resulted from variable levels of cleanliness during handling <b>and</b> <b>slicing</b> procedures at the three supermarkets. Specifically, the cleaning of equipment surfaces represents a challenge for sanitation programs, since most equipment is not hygienically designed and must be unassembled prior to sanitization procedures. This fact may lead to the decrease of cleaning and disinfection frequency and to the hazard of biofilm formation. In conclusion, luncheon meat <b>sliced</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged</b> in supermarkets may pose a hazard to the consumers, and the adoption of more rigorous disinfection protocols for equipment and surfaces in contact with ready-to-eat foods in these stores is advisable...|$|R
50|$|Natamycin {{has been}} used for decades in the food {{industry}} as a hurdle to fungal outgrowth in dairy products and other foods. Potential advantages for the usage of natamycin might include the replacement of traditional chemical preservatives, a neutral flavor impact, and less dependence on pH for efficacy, as is common with chemical preservatives. It can be applied in a variety of ways: as an aqueous suspension (such as mixed into a brine) sprayed on the product or into which the product is dipped, or in powdered form (along with an anticaking agent such as cellulose) sprinkled on or mixed into the product. While not currently approved for use on meats in the United States, some countries allow natamycin to be applied to the surface of dry and fermented sausages to prevent mold growth on the casing. Also, natamycin is approved for various dairy applications in the United States. More specifically, natamycin is commonly used in products such as cream cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, shredded cheeses, cheese <b>slices,</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged</b> salad mixes. One of the reasons for food producers to use natamycin is to replace the artificial preservative sorbic acid.|$|R

40|$|The {{microbiota}} {{associated with}} a highly-perishable Belgian artisan-type cooked ham was analyzed through plating and (GTG) (5) -fingerprinting of isolates throughout its processing chain. The raw tumbled meat was characterized {{by the presence of}} a versatile microbiota around 4. 8 log(cfu g(- 1)), consisting of lactic acid bacteria, staphylococci, Brochothrix thermosphacta. Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. Pasteurisation of the ham logs reduced bacterial counts below 2 log(cfu g- 1) and subsequent manipulations selected for leuconostocs and carnobacteria. Also, B. thermosphacta and several Enterobacteriaceae were found at this stage. During storage in an intermediate high-care area for 2 days, a selection towards certain Enterobacteriaceae (Hafnia alvei, Enterobacter spp., and Pantoea agglomerans) and lactic acid bacteria (mainly vagococci and Streptococcus parauberis) was observed. B. thermosphacta, Leuconostoc carnosum and carnobacteria were also detected, but only after allowing bacterial outgrowth by incubating the meat logs at 7 degrees C for four weeks. After a mild post-pasteurisation process and subsequent handling, incubation of the meat logs at 7 degrees C for four weeks led to outgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae (mainly Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp.). B. thermosphacta, and lactic acid bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Leuc. carnosum, and Carnobacterium maltaromaticum) were also found.

40|$|Molecular typing {{was applied}} to an {{in-plant}} lactic acid bacterium (LAB) contamination analysis of a vacuum-packaged sliced cooked whole-meat product. A total of 982 LAB isolates from the raw mass, product, and the environment at different production stages were screened by restriction endonuclease (EcoRI and HindIII) analysis. rRNA gene restriction patterns were further determined for different strains obtained from each source. These patterns were used for recognizing the spoilage-causing LAB strains from the product on the sell-by day and tracing the sources and sites of spoilage LAB contamination during the manufacture. LAB typing resulted in 71 different ribotypes, of which 27 were associated with contamination routes. Raw material was distinguished {{as the source of}} the major spoilage strains. Contamination of the product surfaces after cooking was shown to be airborne. The removal of the product from the cooking forms was localized as a major site of airborne LAB contamination. Food handlers and some surfaces in contact with the product during the manufacture were also contaminated with the spoilage strains.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} salt reduction on microbiological composition and quality characteristics of deli-style turkey breast and roast beef. Turkey breast and roast beef were manufactured with four different salt concentrations: 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2. 0 %, and 2. 5 % on a meat block basis in addition to sugar, phosphate, and water. Samples were cooked, chilled overnight, <b>sliced,</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged.</b> On the day of slicing, samples were evaluated for water activity, cooking yield, proximate composition and percent salt. Samples were evaluated throughout 18 w of refrigerated storage for pH, texture profile analysis, aerobic plate count (APC), and anaerobic plate count. Bacterial communities were analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Beef with 2. 5 % salt had the lowest APC. Aerobic plate count increased until week 6 and then reached a plateau. Family Pseudomonadaceae was the dominant flora on all samples. Relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae was 46. 4 % of all sequences in beef samples and 36. 0 % in turkey samples after <b>slicing,</b> <b>and</b> increased at week 2 {{for the remainder of}} storage time. Salt reduction negatively impacted cooking yield and increased water activity. Beef samples had a lower pH than turkey, and 1. 5 % salt had a lower pH than all other salt concentrations. Decreasing salt concentration increased hardness. In beef, gumminess and cohesiveness increased as salt decreased. In turkey samples, the greatest gumminess and cohesiveness was observed with 1. 5 % salt while turkey with 2. 5 % salt had the least gumminess and cohesiveness. Beef samples with 1. 0 % salt had the greatest chewiness, followed by beef with 1. 5 % salt. Turkey samples with 2. 5 %, 2. 0 %, and 1. 0 % had the lowest chewiness values. Salt reduction decreased springiness, and turkey samples had lower values than beef. These results show that bacterial population dynamics of cooked deli meat may be more dependent on initial load than salt concentration. Furthermore, reducing salt alters the textural properties of cooked deli meats, changes the proximate composition of cooked meat products, and reduces cooking yields. Advisor: Gary A. Sulliva...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{foodborne}} pathogen, able {{to survive}} and proliferate at refrigeration temperatures. As a result, ready-to-eat meat products {{have been associated with}} major outbreaks. Producing meat products involves lethal preservation treatments, e. g. thermal treatments. Listeria contamination, however, may be introduced when products are <b>sliced</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged</b> at retail businesses or delicatessens. In Brazil, sliced bologna is very popular at retail markets. After slicing, however, bologna has a short shelf-life. The aim of this work was to study the effects of pediocin incorporation on the load at break, water vapor permeability rate and structure, by microscopic analysis, of antimicrobial cellulosic packaging. The potential application of the developed packaging for the preservation of bologna and inhibition of Listeria biofilm formation was also studied. Cellulosic antimicrobial packaging films were produced with cellulose acetate and acetone. Pediocin (commercially available concentrate ALTA TM 2341) was incorporated at 30, 40 and 50 % w/w. The load at break of films was studied using the Universal Testing Machine (Instron) at 10 °C and 25 °C. The water vapor permeability was determined by gravimetric method. A scanning electron microscope was used to study the developed packaging structure. Antimicrobial activity of films against Listeria innoucua and L. monocytogenes was tested both in vitro and in bologna samples. Results showed that values of load at break decreased with increasing concentrations of pediocin at 10 °C and 25 °C. Regarding water vapor permeability, only the control and 50 % pediocin films presented statistical difference, with the 50 % pediocin film being more permeable. In vitro tests showed antimicrobial activity against L. innocua. Cellulosic film with 50 % pediocin reduced L. monocytogenes growth on sliced bologna by 1. 2 log cycles after 9 days and prevented biofilm formation on <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> bologna surfaces.

It’s used for various processes like cooking, expansion, texture alteration, mixing and utilization of various ingredients. By extrusion technology cereals, tubers, and their derivatives can be transformed into snack foods and deboned meat can be firmly compressed and reshaped into sticks and links. Historically extrusion cooking of 19 th century was used to shape sausage products. Extrusion technology has been widely used for the manufacture of meat and flour based snacks by blending meat with various non-meat products like flours (Prinyawinatkul et al. 2007; Shaviklo et al. 2011).|$|R

During the first week of storage at 4 or 8 °C, L. monocytogenes populations declined by an average 0. 89 log CFU/g in pressurized Iberian ham and 2. 09 log CFU/g in pressurized Serrano ham. After 60 days at 4 or 8 °C, the respective populations in pressurized and control hams were 3. 24 and 4. 70 log CFU/g for Iberian ham and 2. 73 and 5. 07 log CFU/g for Serrano ham. The color parameters L and a were not influenced by high-pressure treatment, and parameter b was increased only in Iberian ham. Sensory characteristics of hams were not affected by high-pressure treatment. Treatment of Iberian and Serrano hams at 450 MPa for 10 min significantly reduced the population of L. monocytogenes Scott A without a detrimental effect on the sensory characteristics of the hams.

40|$|Translocation of {{foodborne}} pathogens {{into the interior}} tissues of pork through moisture enhancement may be of concern if the meat is undercooked. In the present study, a five-strain mixture of Campylobacter jejuni orSalmonella enterica Typhimurium was evenly spread {{on the surface of}} fresh pork loins. Pork loins were injected, <b>sliced,</b> vacuum <b>packaged,</b> <b>and</b> stored. After storage, sliced pork was cooked by traditional grilling. Survival ofSalmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni in the interior tissues of the samples were analyzed by enumeration. The populations of these pathogens dropped below the detection limit (10 colony-forming units/g) in most samples that were cooked to 71. 1 °C or above. The general linear mixed model procedure was used to model the association between risk factors and the presence/absence of these pathogens after cooking. Estimated regression coefficients associated with the fixed effects indicated that the recovery probability of Salmonella Typhimurium was negatively associated with increasing level of enhancement. The effects of moisture enhancement and cooking on the recovery probability of C. jejuni were moderated by storage temperature. Our findings will assist food processors and regulatory agencies with science-based evaluation of the current processing, storage condition, and cooking guideline for moisture-enhanced pork...|$|R
