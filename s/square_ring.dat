2500|$|Aquathlon (also {{known as}} {{underwater}} wrestling) is an underwater sport where two competitors wearing masks and fins wrestle underwater {{in an attempt}} to remove a ribbon from each other's ankle band in order to win the bout. The [...] "combat" [...] takes place in a 5-metre (16 ft) <b>square</b> <b>ring</b> within a swimming pool, and is made up of three 30-second rounds, with a fourth round played {{in the event of a}} tie. The sport originated during the 1980s in the former USSR (now Russia) and was first played at international level in 1993. It was recognised by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) in 2008.|$|E

The fight headlined the [...] "Island Fights 38" [...] card, an ongoing series that combines boxing matches and MMA bouts on the same show. Jones last fought in Pensacola in March 2015, when he knocked out Paul Vasquez in the first round. Moore did not fight between 2005 and 2012 and has lost nine consecutive fights, although {{only one of them}} came by knockout. That was a second-round stoppage to top cruiserweight contender Murat Gassiev 13 months ago. On fight night, in front of more than 5,000 fans in attendance, in a slow-paced affair, Jones won a one-sided 10 round unanimous decision with shutout scores of 100-90 on all three cards.|$|E
2500|$|Although Connery {{had secured}} several roles as extras, he was {{struggling}} to make ends meet, {{and was forced to}} accept a part-time job as a babysitter for journalist Peter Noble and his actress wife Mary, which earned him 10 shillings a night. He met Hollywood actor Shelley Winters one night at Noble's house, who described Connery as [...] "one of the tallest and most charming and masculine Scotsmen" [...] she'd ever seen, and later spent many evenings with the Connery brothers drinking beer. Around this time Connery was residing at TV presenter Llew Gardner's house. Henderson landed Connery a role in a £6 a week Q Theatre production of Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution, during which he met and became friends with fellow-Scot Ian Bannen. This role was followed by Point of Departure and A Witch in Time at Kew, a role as Pentheus opposite Yvonne Mitchell in The Bacchae at the Oxford Playhouse, and a role opposite Jill Bennett in Eugene O'Neill's production of Anna Christie. During his time at the Oxford Theatre, Connery won a brief part as a boxer in the TV series The <b>Square</b> <b>Ring,</b> before being spotted by Canadian director Alvin Rakoff who gave him multiple roles in The Condemned, shot on location in Dover in Kent. In 1956, Connery appeared in the theatrical production of Epitaph, and played a minor role as a hoodlum in the [...] "Ladies of the Manor" [...] episode of the BBC Television police series Dixon of Dock Green. This was followed by small television parts in Sailor of Fortune and The Jack Benny Program.|$|E

Rngs which satisfy Fermat’s two-square theorem are called sum of <b>squares</b> <b>rings</b> and have been studied previously. The present study considers a related property called square property one. It is shown that this holds in an infinite class of rings which includes the integers, polynomial rings over many fields and Z n where p is a prime P such that- 3 is not a square rood p. Finally, it is shown that the class of sume of <b>squares</b> <b>rings</b> and the class satisfying square property one are non-coincidental...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} vortex {{structure}} in a Pb film deposited {{on top of}} a periodic array of ferromagnetic square microrings by combining two high resolution imaging techniques: Bitter decoration and scanning Hall probe microscopy (SHPM). The periodicity and strength of the magnetic pinning potential generated by the square microrings are controlled by the magnetic history of the template. When the <b>square</b> <b>rings</b> are in the magnetized dipolar state, known as the onion state, the strong stray field generated at the domain walls prevents the decoration of vortices. SHPM images show that the stray field generated by the dipoles is much stronger than the vortex field in agreement with the results of simulations. Real space vortex imaging has revealed that, in the onion state, the corners of the <b>square</b> <b>rings</b> act as effective pinning centers for vortices. Comment: To be published in Phys.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of phase variation and phase range of concentric split <b>ring</b> <b>square</b> element for broadband reflectarray antenna {{is presented in}} this paper. This is realized by exploiting the physical geometry of three element shapes namely <b>square</b> element, concentric <b>ring</b> <b>square</b> element and concentric split <b>ring</b> <b>square</b> element. Modifying the current distribution of basic concentric <b>ring</b> <b>square</b> element, leads to a less steep phase variation and also the bandwidth performance. An analysis of frequency response is described and analysed. The physical interpretation of the elements is also discussed. The proposed antenna element effectively covers two frequency operations (13. 44 GHz and 18. 36 GHz) in Ku-band range. Bandwidth broadening is achieved by introducing the <b>ring</b> <b>square</b> combination of element and the practical phase range is achieved {{through the use of}} RF 35 (thickness = 1. 524 mm) as the substrate. The new concept of split initiates to a wider bandwidth (up to 67. 6 %) for the antenna and can applied to any two frequency operations of Ku-band applications. </p...|$|R
