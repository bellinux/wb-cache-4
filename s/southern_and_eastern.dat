5|$|In the North, {{urbanization}} and {{an unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} <b>Southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.

5|$|According to estimates, around 77,980 Armenians {{lived in}} the US by 1919. An {{unprecedented}} number of Armenians entered the country in 1920, but the Immigration Act of 1924 that restricted immigration from <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US. Most of the post-World War I immigrants were women and children, {{in contrast to the}} prewar immigration, which was predominantly young and male. Like Italians, for whom this practice was known as campanilismo, Armenian communities were often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. This practice almost entirely disappeared after World War II.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> Africa, the blue {{wildebeest}} {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion.

Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{remaining}} {{colonies in}} Africa, except for self-governing Southern Rhodesia, were all granted independence by 1968. British {{withdrawal from the}} <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year Mau Mau Uprising. In Rhodesia, the 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the white minority resulted {{in a civil war}} that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Cindy brought {{considerable}} rainfall to <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> {{parts of}} the Dominican Republic, with totals of 4–10in (100–255mm). Upon the storm's landfall in the country, winds reached 35mph (55km/h) in Barahona. The rain filled rivers and caused scattered street flooding, affecting hundreds of houses. In Villa Altagracia, onefatality occurred when a child drowned in flood waters; the final death toll for the country stood at two. There were no reports of damage elsewhere after Cindy's rapid demise over Hispaniola, though its remnants likely produced localized showers in Haiti.|$|E

In anticipation for the typhoon, schools and businesses in <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> Taiwan were closed, along with the delaying of rail and air traffic. Kaohsiung International Airport was closed during the morning of December4.|$|E
5|$|John Alexander Macdonald {{was born}} in Ramshorn parish in Glasgow, Scotland, on 11 January 1815.

After Hugh Macdonald's business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to Kingston, in Upper Canada (today the <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> portions of Ontario), in 1820, where there were already a number of Macdonald relatives and connections.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} taxa can {{be divided}} into three main groups; the S. e. caesia group of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, the S. e. europaea group of Scandinavia, Russia, Japan and northern China and the S. e. sinensis group of <b>southern</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> China and Taiwan. These may have been geographically isolated from each other until relatively recently. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the group ranges overlap. The descriptions below are of the male. The female is usually slightly duller with a brown tint to the eyestripe and paler underparts, although the sexes are very similar in the S. e. sinensis group.|$|E
