30|$|When the on-site {{shoreline}} {{survey for}} inland pollution <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the drainage {{area of the}} Hansan-Geojeman area was performed in 2013, there were 758 potential pollution <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the area. Among them, 40 sources had discharged water as actual contamination sources, including eight <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> Dundeok-myeon, 18 <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> Geoje-myeon, 10 <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> Dongbu-myeon, and four <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> Hansan-myeon (Fig.  1; Tables  1, 2). The diffusion range of discharged water from inland pollution <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> 2013 was estimated according to the formula in the “Methods” section, {{and the results are}} summarized in Tables  1 and 2. For the 40 inland water samples, the total flow rate was 22, 167  L/min with a range of 10 – 5300  L/min. The discharges were composed of 19, 647  L/min of stream water, 280  L/min of domestic wastewater, 240  L/min of small food processing plant wastewater, and 2000  L/min of land-based fish farm wastewater. The FC concentrations of discharges ranged between 1.8 and 700, 000 MPN/ 100  mL. The FC daily load ranged from 1.9  ×  106 to 5.0  ×  1011 MPN/day. According to the formula, the affected radii of discharges in this sea area ranged from 3 to 600  m, among which radii greater than 500  m were found at stations L 30, L 47 and L 48; however, the pollutants did not reach the boundary line of the designated area because of a buffer zone between the shoreline and boundary line.|$|R

40|$|How does affective {{conflict}} influence {{identification of}} knowledge <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> MNE teams? We apply social exchange theory {{and consider the}} effect of two types of affective interpersonal conflict: relational tension and self-interest on identification of knowledge <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> MNE teams. We further analyse how these effects are related to geographic and nationality differences. We test our hypotheses with a field study of 1181 dyadic interactions between 160 members within 40 MNE teams engaged in product innovation, human resources, and operational improvement in three large diversified MNEs. We find that affective conflict has a direct negative relationship to identification of knowledge <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> MNE teams. This relationship is further negatively moderated by geographic differences and nationality differences. Our study contributes to theoretical and empirical micro-foundations of conflict and identification of knowledge <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> MNE teams...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to {{the general}} {{attitude}} {{that the role of}} written <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> archaeological research marks the separation between two distinct fields of research – prehistorical and historical archaeology, the critical research into the history of the discipline points that the development of archaeology has not followed this pattern. Rather, the dominant role of the written <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the study of classical past has been transferred onto the practices of prehistorical archaeology. Discussing the role of ancient <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the research of the so-called "Illyrian question", this paper addresses the consequences of this dominant role of written <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> the archaeological study of the past and points {{to the ways in which}} the interpretation of the classical texts influenced the theoretical- methodological framework of research of the late prehistory of the Balkans...|$|R
