40|$|Injection of CO {{subsurface}} {{may lead}} to chemical reactivity of rock where CO is dissolved in groundwater. This process can modify pore networks to increase or decrease porosity through mineral dissolution and precipitation. A lattice Boltzmann (LB) based computational model study on the pore scale reactive transport in three dimensional heterogeneous porous media (sandstone consisting of both reactive and non-reactive minerals) is described. This study examines how fluid transport in porous materials subject to reactive conditions is affected by unsteady state local reactions and unstable dissolution fronts. The reaction of a calcite cemented core <b>sub-plug</b> from the Hutton Sandstone of the Surat Basin, Australia, {{is used as a}} study case. In particular, the work studies the interaction of acidic fluid (an aqueous solution with an elevated concentration of carbonic acid) with reactive (e. g. calcite) and assumed non-reactive (e. g. quartz) mineral surfaces, mineral dissolution and mass transfer, and resultant porosity change. The proposed model is implemented in our custom LBM code and suitable for studies of multiple mineral reactions with disparate reaction rates. A model for carbonic acid reaction with calcite cemented sandstone in the CO-water-rock system is verified through laboratory experimental data including micro-CT characterization before and after core reaction at reservoir conditions. The experimentally validated model shows: (1) the dissolution of calcite cement forms conductive channels at the pore scale, and enables the generation of pore throats and connectivity; (2) the model is able to simulate the reaction process until the reaction equilibrium status is achieved (around 1440 days); (3) calcite constituting a volume of around 9. 6 % of the whole core volume is dissolved and porosity is consequently increased from 1. 1 % to 10. 7 % on reaching equilibrium; (4) {{more than a third of}} the calcite (constituting 7. 4 % of the total core volume) is unaffected, which suggests that this calcite is not connected with open pores (at the resolution of the model) that the acidic fluid can access. The model enables exploration of the porosity change in systems as they react, which has applications for analysis of the induced permeability change at the macroscale...|$|E
40|$|Reservoir and cap-rock core samples with {{variable}} lithology 2 ̆ 7 s {{representative of}} siliciclastic reservoirs used for CO storage have been characterized and reacted at reservoir conditions with an impure CO stream and low salinity brine. Cores from a target CO storage site in Queensland, Australia were tested. Mineralogical {{controls on the}} resulting changes to porosity and water chemistry have been identified. The tested siliciclastic reservoir core samples can be grouped generally into three responses to impure CO-brine reaction, dependent on mineralogy. The mineralogically clean quartzose reservoir cores had high porosities, with negligible change after reaction, in resolvable porosity or mineralogy, calculated using X-ray micro computed tomography and QEMSCAN. However, strong brine acidification and {{a high concentration of}} dissolved sulphate were generated in experiments owing to minimal mineral buffering. Also, the movement of kaolin has the potential to block pore throats and reduce permeability. The reaction of the impure CO-brine with calcite-cemented cap-rock core samples caused the largest porosity changes after reaction through calcite dissolution; to the extent that one sample developed a connection of open pores that extended into the core <b>sub-plug.</b> This has the potential to both favor injectivity but also affect CO migration. The dissolution of calcite caused the buffering of acidity resulting in no significant observable silicate dissolution. Clay-rich cap-rock core samples with minor amounts of carbonate minerals had only small changes after reaction. Created porosity appeared mainly disconnected. Changes were instead associated with decreases in density from Fe-leaching of chlorite or dissolution of minor amounts of carbonates and plagioclase. The interbedded sandstone and shale core also developed increased porosity parallel to bedding through dissolution of carbonates and reactive silicates in the sandy layers. Tight interbedded cap-rocks could be expected to act as baffles to fluids preventing vertical fluid migration. Concentrations of dissolved elements including Ca, Fe, Mn, and Ni increased during reactions of several core samples, with Mn, Mg, Co, and Zn correlated with Ca from cap-rock cores. Precipitation of gypsum, Fe-oxides and clays on seal core samples sequestered dissolved elements including Fe through co-precipitation or adsorption. A conceptual model of impure CO-water-rock interactions for a siliciclastic reservoir is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Copyright 2015, Unconventional Resources Technology Conference. Diffusion {{is a key}} {{mechanism}} of gas recovery from unconventional reservoirs. Spatial and temporal monitoring of the progress of diffusion would also aid in characterizing the local variations in pore size and tortuosity, of broad relevance to all unconventionals and transport processes. In this study the technique recently developed for contrast- enhanced, micro-CT static imaging of the pore volume distribution in shale plugs, after saturation of their accessible pore space with the X-ray opaque liquid diiodomethane (CH 2 I 2), was extended to dynamic imaging of diffusion over these micron-centimeter scales. The CH 2 I 2 -saturated plug was immersed in the miscible, X-ray transparent liquid toluene, for diffusion to be monitored by continuous micro-CT scanning via the progressive advance in attenuation loss. This sequence of dynamic tomograms was then spatially registered to the static tomograms of the dry state and the initial CH 2 I 2 -saturated state to visualize and quantify the CH 2 I 2 attenuation decrease at each voxel over time. Results are presented for vertically cored, cleaned <b>sub-plugs</b> of 3 - 12 mm diameter of two shale gas and one shale oil samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between CO 2, water and rock in low-salinity host formations remain largely unexplored for conditions relevant to CO 2 injection and storage. Core samples and <b>sub-plugs</b> from five Jurassic-aged Surat Basin sandstones and siltstones of varying mineralogy have been experimentally reacted in low-salinity water with supercritical CO 2 at simulated in situ reservoir conditions (P= 12 MPa and T= 60 °C) for 16 days (384 h), {{with a view}} to characterising potential CO 2 -water-rock interactions in fresh or low-salinity potential siliclastic CO 2 storage targets located in Queensland, Australia. CO 2 -water-rock reactions were coupled with detailed mineral and porosity characterisation, obtained prior to and following reaction, to identify changes in the mineralogy and porosity of selected reservoir and seal rocks during simulated CO 2 injection. Aqueous element concentrations were measured from fluid extracts obtained periodically throughout the experiments to infer fluid-rock reactions over time. Fluid analyses show an evolution of dissolved concentration over time, with most major (e. g. Ca, Fe, Si, Mg, Mn) and minor (e. g. S, Sr, Ba, Zn) components increasing in concentration during reaction with CO 2. Similar trends between elements reflect shared sources and/or similar release mechanisms, such as dissolution and desorption with decreasing pH. Small decreases in concentration of selected elements were observed towards the end of some experiments; however, no precipitation of minerals was directly observed in petrography. Sample characterisation on a fine scale allowed direct scrutiny of mineralogical and porosity changes by comparing pre- and post-reaction observations. Scanning electron microscopy and registered 3 D images from micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) indicate dissolution of minerals, including carbonates, chlorite, biotite members, and, to a lesser extent, feldspars. Quantitative mineral mapping of <b>sub-plugs</b> identified dissolution of calcite from carbonate cemented core, with a decrease in calcite content from 17 vol. % to 15 vol. % following reaction, and a subsequent increase in porosity of 1. 1 vol. %. Kinetic geochemical modelling of the CO 2 -water-rock experiments successfully reproduced the general trends observed in aqueous geochemistry for the investigated major elements. After coupling experimental geochemistry with detailed sample characterisation and numerical modelling, expected initial reactions in the near-well region include partial dissolution and desorption of calcite, mixed carbonates, chloritic clays and annite due to pH decrease, followed in the longer-term by dissolution of additional silicates, such as feldspars. Dissolution of carbonates is predicted to improve injectivity in the near-well environment and contribute to the eventual re-precipitation of carbonates in the far field...|$|R
