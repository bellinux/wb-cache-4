40|$|Abstract. Rotary {{ultrasonic}} machining process, {{regarded as one}} of the effective processing methods for hard-brittle materials, is introduced into drilling K 9 glass in this paper. The effective cutting velocity, cutting depth, and cutting length of single diamond particle are determined by analyzing the kinematics characteristic of diamond tool in rotary ultrasonic drilling (RUD). Experiments are conducted to study the influences of process variables (spindle speed, feedrate) on cutting force, chipping size, and surface roughness in RUD. As comparison study, the processing performances between RUD and diamond drilling are also discussed. The experimental results show that the RUD process can significantly reduce cutting force and the value <b>of</b> <b>chippings</b> size, which inferred that RUD process can improve machining efficiency and make the machining cost lower. It is also concluded that the effective cutting depth of diamond particles is the main factor for surface roughness in RUD of K 9 glass...|$|R

Another aim of the research was to test the applicability of the developed measurement method and the precision of the body representing the volume loss caused by chipping. The surface edges of the milled specimens were digitised using a laser scanner and chipped volumes were defined {{on the basis of a}} body generated with the help of a point cloud, and then the errors of the volumes produced by the evaluation-purpose software were examined using a digital microscope. The investigations proved that the proposed measurement method is accurate and that the replacement body defined through measurements appropriately approximates the volume <b>of</b> <b>chippings</b> in the case of milled granite surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this review}} was to {{systematically}} evaluate and compare the frequency of veneer chipping and core fracture of zirconia fixed dental prostheses (FOPS) and porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) FDPs and determine possible influencing factors. Materials and Methods: The SCOPUS database and International Association of Dental Research abstracts were searched for clinical studies involving zirconia and PFM FDPs. Furthermore, studies that were integrated into systematic reviews on PFM FDPs were also evaluated. The principle investigators of any clinical studies on zirconia FDPs were contacted to provide additional information. Based on the available information for each FOP, a data file was constructed. Veneer chipping was divided into three grades (grade 1 = polishing, grade 2 = repair, grade 3 = replacement). To assess the frequency of veneer chipping and possible influencing factors, a piecewise exponential model was used to adjust for a study effect. Results: None of the studies on PFM FDPs (reviews and additional searching) sufficiently satisfied the criteria of this review to be included. Thirteen clinical studies on zirconia FDPs and two studies that investigated both zirconia and PFM FDPs were identified. These studies involved 664 zirconia and 134 PFM FDPs at baseline. Follow-up data were available for 595 zirconia and 127 PFM FDPs. The mean observation period was approximately 3 years for both groups. The frequency of core fracture was less than 1 % in the zirconia group and 0 % in the PFM group. When all studies were included, 142 veneer chippings were recorded for zirconia FDPs (24 %) and 43 for PFM FDPs (34 %). However, the studies differed extensively with regard to veneer chipping of zirconia: 85 % <b>of</b> all <b>chippings</b> occurred in 4 studies, and 43 % <b>of</b> all <b>chippings</b> included zirconia FDPs. If only studies that evaluated both types of core materials were included, the frequency of chipping was 54 % for the zirconia-supported FDPs and 34 % for PFM FDPs. When adjusting the survival rate for the study effect, the difference between zirconia and PFM FDPs was statistically significant for all grades <b>of</b> <b>chippings</b> (P =. 001), {{as well as for}} chipping grade 3 (P =. 02). If all grades <b>of</b> veneer <b>chippings</b> were taken into account, the survival of PFM FDPs was 97 %, while the survival rate of the zirconia FDPs was 90 % after 3 years for a typical study. For both PFM and zirconia FDPs, the frequency of grades 1 and 2 veneer chippings was considerably higher than grade 3. Veneer chipping was significantly less frequent in pressed materials than in hand-layered materials, both for zirconia and PFM FDPs (P =. 04). Conclusions: Since the frequency of veneer chipping was significantly higher in the zirconia FDPs than PFM FDPs, and as refined processing procedures have started to yield better results in the laboratory, new clinical studies with these new procedures must confirm whether the frequency of veneer chipping can be reduced to the level of PFM.

Thus far, modeling of pandemics {{has focused on}} either large-scale difference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed micro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> infections. We hypothesize that the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> an infectious disease between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> pandemics considering the con-nections between regions for the global <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the local <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a simulation study for the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> SARS pandemic of 2002 - 2003 using available data on popula-tion, population density, and traffic networks between different regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global traffic patterns significantly influence the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> pandemics, our results show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly improve the results <b>of</b> modeling disease <b>spread.</b> ...|$|R
