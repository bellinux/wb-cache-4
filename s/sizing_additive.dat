Before the {{processing}} of wood pulp and chemical wood pulps in the mid-19th century, the dominant fibre source for paper making was cotton and linen rags. The cotton rag sheet produced for conversion to vulcanized fibre is made like a sheet suitable for saturating. A paper is made for saturating by omitting any <b>sizing</b> <b>additive,</b> either beater added or surface applied. Today most paper sheets made for writing, printing, and coating have internal (beater added) sizing provided by rosin, alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA), or alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and surface sizing provided by starch. A sheet made for saturating {{would have none of}} those chemical ingredients. The unsized saturating cotton fibre paper prepared for vulcanized fibre would be passed through a vat containing a zinc chloride solution.|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Gas {{hydrates}} in the Alaska North Slope, with {{a potential}} of 590 TCF gas-in-place near existing infrastructures of Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk River and Milne Point Units, have sparked interest among unconventional energy experts. Drilling through gas hydrates has always been critical {{as a source of}} heat into the formation, leading to dissociation of hydrates. Moreover, the recent drive toward open hole completions and highly deviated or horizontal wells have emphasized the need for evaluation of drilling or completion fluids suitability from a perspective of formation damage. A significant decrease in well productivity near the well-bore can occur due to the invasion of fine solids from drilling fluids, forming external and internal filter cake under dynamic conditions. An experimental setup for the evaluation of formation damage at in-situ conditions was designed. The dynamic filtration experiments were conducted with Berea sandstone cores. The absolute permeability was measured {{both before and after the}} drilling fluid circulation.

40|$|Genome-wide pathway {{association}} studies provide novel {{insight into}} the biological mechanism underlying complex diseases. Current pathway association studies primarily focus on single important disease phenotype, which is sometimes insufficient to characterize the clinical manifestations of complex diseases. We present a multi-phenotypes pathway association study(MPPAS) approach using principle component analysis(PCA). In our approach, PCA is first applied to multiple correlated quantitative phenotypes for extracting a set of orthogonal phenotypic components. The extracted phenotypic components are then used for pathway association analysis instead of original quantitative phenotypes. Four statistics were proposed for PCA-based MPPAS in this study. Simulations using the real data from the HapMap project were conducted to evaluate the power and type I error rates of PCA-based MPPAS under various scenarios considering sample <b>sizes,</b> <b>additive</b> and interactive genetic effects. A real genome-wide association study data set of bone mineral density (BMD) at hip and spine were also analyzed by PCA-based MPPAS.

Although DDGS is an inexpensive, biodegradable and abundant co-product, it has limited industrial applications. DDGS is a mixture of carbohydrates, proteins and oil which are used as sizing agents or as <b>size</b> <b>additives.</b> The effects of DDGS extraction conditions on sizing evaluation parameters such as fiber adhesion, film properties, viscosity and fabric abrasion were studied in comparison with commercially available PVA or starch based size. Among the various conditions studied, DDGS that was extracted in 0. 5 % alkali concentration solution for 1 hour was most suitable for textiles sizing, based on the improvement in the strength and elongation of rovings and fabric abrasion resistance. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of DDGS size decreased 80 % in 3 days compared to 25 % for PVA demonstrating that DDGS was easily biodegradable in activated sludge. Although DDGS contains up to 30 % protein, the total nitrogen and ammonia released from DDGS sizing agent had negligible effect on biodegradability.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the two bio-inspired approaches, confinement and additives, to manipulate the crystallization of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. The first experimental chapter deals with the investigation of calcium phosphate rods grown in confined environments in the absence and presence of polyaspartic acid. Although similar results were obtained in the absence and presence of the additive, growing calcium phosphate in confinement allowed formation of polycrystalline rods with an orientation comparable to bone. This demonstrated that confinement may play a more significant role in bone formation than previously anticipated. The second chapter deals with the effect of positively charged additives on the crystallisation of CaCO 3. Although neglected before in literature, this chapter demonstrates that positively charged additives {{have a profound effect on}} the crystallisation of CaCO 3 changing the morphology to films and fibers. This morphology change was linked to a phase separation process, forming hydrated amorphous droplets of calcium carbonate by a carbonate-polymer interaction, which had the tendency to coalesce and form films. Fiber formation was attributed to oriented attachment of anisotropic particles due to unequal distribution of charge. In the third chapter, based on bone, the mineralisation of collagen by CaCO 3 was investigated. By formation of a highly hydrated liquid-like amorphous phase of CaCO 3, it was possible to infiltrate the nanoscale gaps of collagen. After crystallisation, nanocrystals of calcite and vaterite were formed, 5 nm thick, but randomly oriented, demonstrating collagen templates the shape but not the orientation of the crystals. In a final chapter hollow rods of CaCO 3 were formed by templating them inside membrane pores. The influence of time, pore <b>size,</b> <b>additives</b> and surface chemistry was investigated. Most hollow rods were formed at early timescales which filled up at later times. By changing the surface chemistry, the amount of hollow rods increased significantly in the 200 nm pore...|$|R

Moreover, the areas occupied by the enterprises and the safety of their products are also analyzed. In particular, the author analyzes surface flows and the air inside residential houses, soil layers, as well as the indoor air of factories. Methods of research applicable to each component of the environment are described in detail. The findings are pre-sented as tables and charts. The author presents photomicrographs and radiographs of the soil and building materials containing formaldehyde. The author insists on immediate reduction of the use of phenol formaldehyde resins. The findings serve as the basis for three groups of actions focused on reduction of phenol-formaldehyde binders: 1) abandonment of use of binders (for example, some wood-based bio-composites), 2) replacement of toxic components of binders (new polymeric and mineral types of binders), and 3) injection of special additives (including atomic particle <b>size</b> <b>additives)</b> of phenolformaldehyde resins or surface treatment of ready products using special compositions (whereby emissions are reduced using chemi-sorption effects).

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{the need for a}} clean and {{renewable}} fuel has sharply risen. This is due to increasing fossil fuel costs and the desire to limit or eliminate harmful by-products which are created during the burning of these fuels. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and can be used in either fuel cells or traditional internal combustion engines to produce energy with no harmful emissions. One of the main obstacles facing the implementation of a hydrogen economy is its storage. Classical methods of storage involve either high and unsafe pressures or liquid storage involving a large amount of energy. Two alternative hydrogen storage methods are investigated - physisorption, which is the weak chemical bonding to a material, as well as chemisorption, which is a strong chemical bond of hydrogen to a host material. Polyaniline, a conducting polymer, is investigated in both its bulk form as well as in nanostructured forms, more precisely nanofibers and nanospheres, to store hydrogen via physisorption. It is found the bulk form of polyaniline can store only approximately 0. 5 wt. % hydrogen, which is far short of the 6 wt. % required for practical applications. Nanofibers and nanospheres, however, have been developed, which can store between 4 wt. % and 10 wt. % of hydrogen at room temperature with varying kinetics. A new complex metal hydride comprised of LiBH 4, LiNH 2 and MgH 2 has been developed to store hydrogen via chemisorption. While the parent compounds require high temperatures and suffer of slow kinetics for hydrogen sorption, the work performed as part of this dissertation shows that optimized processing conditions reduce the hydrogen release temperature from 250 °C to approximately 150 °C, while the addition of nano sized materials has been found to increase the kinetics of hydrogen sorption as well as further decrease the hydrogen release temperature, making this one of the first viable hydrogen storage materials available.
