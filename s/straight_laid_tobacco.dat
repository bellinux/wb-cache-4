50|$|The {{original}} {{surface of}} Carrigrohane Straight was limestone. In 1927, the County Council and Corporation, who both controlled {{sections of the}} <b>Straight,</b> <b>laid</b> reinforced concrete. The Straight {{was one of the}} first concrete road surfaces in Ireland, or even Great Britain. In the early days, concrete surfaces were laid in slabs, with expansion joints of bitumen to take up expansion and contractions as the temperature affected them. The reinforced concrete consisted of a layer of mesh steel covered with concrete in sections approximately 20 to 30 ft long, and several inches thick. Concrete was used because it was thought to be suitable for boggy ground. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, a number of concrete roads were constructed over bog in Northern Ireland, for example the Ballymena to Ballymoney road.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, a {{concrete}} road and houses were {{built on the}} original 2.5 acre mission grounds. The City of Buffalo {{was involved in this}} action, as water and sewer lines were <b>laid</b> <b>straight</b> through the old mission church grounds in the early 1890s as well. An 1894 City of Buffalo atlas shows a 6 in water pipe and sewer line already in place at that time.|$|R
50|$|Westinghouse, Stanley and {{associates}} soon developed an easier to manufacture core, {{consisting of a}} stack of thin 'E‑shaped' iron plates, insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Prewound copper coils could then be slid into place, and <b>straight</b> iron plates <b>laid</b> in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse applied for a patent for the new low-cost design in December 1886; it was granted in July 1887.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} crops, most notably Nicotiana species. The tobacco budworm {{is one of}} the most {{destructive}} pests of the <b>tobacco.</b> Eggs are <b>laid</b> on the <b>tobacco</b> leaves. The emerging larvae are light to dark green and have several longitudinal pale stripes. They may chew small holes in the leaves before they reach the buds. Larvae then damage the bud or growing tip of the plant. The leaves that expand from the buds are often ragged and distorted.|$|R
50|$|In this construction, a scrim or strands (inserts) are {{sandwiched}} between layers of film. Thus load-bearing members are <b>laid</b> <b>straight,</b> which maximizes the high modulus of the fibers, where a woven material {{will have some}} inherent stretch to the weave. Laminating film to film around the strands creates a very strong and dependable bond {{reducing the amount of}} adhesive needed. In high quality cloth, the strands or scrim are tensioned during the lamination process.|$|R
2500|$|From the {{evidence}} of the preserved towns, it appears that the formal structure of many of these towns was willfully planned. The newly founded towns often show a marked regularity in their plan form, {{in the sense that the}} streets are often <b>straight</b> and <b>laid</b> out at right angles to one another, and that the house lots are rectangular, and originally largely of the same size. One very clear and relatively extreme example is Elburg in the Netherlands, dating from the end of the 14th century. (see illustration) Looking at town plans such as the one of Elburg, it clearly appears that it is impossible to maintain that the straight street and the symmetrical, orthogonal town plan were new inventions from ‘the Renaissance,' and, therefore, typical of ‘modern times.' ...|$|R
50|$|Dolly tracks {{used for}} heavy cameras have {{traditionally}} been constructed of steel or aluminium. Steel, although heavier than aluminum, is less expensive and withstands heavier use. Longer track segments, while heavier to transport, allow track to be <b>laid</b> <b>straighter</b> with less effort. Curved track is also available. Plastic versions of track have been used with lightweight dolly systems. In the 2000s, flexible rubber track allowed quicker set up and easier transportation for use with light cameras.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the eruption, the town may have had some 11,000 inhabitants, and was located in an area where Romans had holiday villas. William Abbott explains, [...] "At {{the time of}} the eruption, Pompeii had reached its high point in society as many Romans {{frequently}} visited Pompeii on vacations." [...] It is the only ancient town of which the whole topographic structure is known precisely as it was, with no later modifications or additions. Due to the difficult terrain, it was not distributed on a regular plan as most Roman towns were, but its streets are <b>straight</b> and <b>laid</b> out in a grid in the Roman tradition. They are laid with polygonal stones, and have houses and shops {{on both sides of the}} street. It followed its decumanus (main east/west road) and its cardo (main north/south road), centred on the forum.|$|R

Once, in an Omaha cash game at The Vic in 1997, he successfully read that Jon Shoreman had a <b>straight</b> flush and <b>laid</b> down a four of a kind. Ulliott was also considered the best five-card stud player in Northern England. However, Ulliott indicated that his real preference was for four card Omaha.|$|R
50|$|The blacksmiths shop {{is a long}} {{rectangular}} building {{constructed of}} coursed rubble sandstone bocks <b>laid</b> <b>straight</b> on the ground. It has an iron roof and an encircling verandah set on a hardwood frame. Most of the verandah posts have been replaced with steel posts. The building has three similarly sized rooms at the eastern end, comprising a butcher's, store and office. At the western end are the former stables and between there is a semi-open area which was the blacksmith's shop and harness room.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} lavvu {{consists of}} two types of wooden poles: 1) three or more forked poles and; 2) several straight poles. The forked poles have a two-stem fork at the top end. These three poles are interlocked so that they form a tripod. Upon this assembly of the forked poles, the <b>straight</b> poles are <b>laid</b> in a circular fashion. Reindeer hides were used as a cover until the mid-19th century when large amounts of inexpensive manufactured British textiles were {{made available to the}} Sami.|$|R
50|$|The area {{surrounding}} {{the building was}} fenced as Jægersborg Dyrehave on the initiative of Frederick III, beginning in 1699. The project was not completed in his lifetime, and Christian V, who {{was influenced by the}} time he had spent at the court of Louis XIV in France, changed the plans for the fencing to include a much larger area in order to facilitate a new style of driven hunt. This style of hunting involved having hounds run the prey tired and hold it down until a hunter would step off his horse and make the kill at little effort. In order for the hunters to be able to keep track of the hounds, a landscape with <b>straight</b> paths <b>laid</b> out to meet in star-shaped intersections, from which the hunters would be able to see the prey and the hounds whenever they crossed one of the paths, was required.|$|R
40|$|Cotton growing landscapes in Australia {{have been}} {{dominated}} by dual-toxin transgenic Bt varieties since 2004. The cotton crop has thus effectively become a sink for the main target pest, Helicoverpa armigera. Theory predicts {{that there should be}} strong selection on female moths to avoid laying on such plants. We assessed oviposition, collected from two cotton-growing regions, by female moths when given a choice of tobacco, cotton and cabbage. Earlier work in the 1980 s and 1990 s on populations from the same geographic locations indicated these hosts were on average ranked as high, mid and low preference plants, respectively, and that host rankings had a heritable component. In the present study, we found no change in the relative ranking of hosts by females, with most eggs being <b>laid</b> on <b>tobacco,</b> then cotton and least on cabbage. As in earlier work, some females laid most eggs on cotton and aspects of oviposition behaviour had a heritable component. Certainly, cotton is not avoided as a host, and the implications of these finding for managing resistance to Bt cotton are discussed. Full Tex...|$|R

The passage of trains has, {{and still does}} cause the track to very gradually sink due to the clay. The problem sections have been gradually removed & improved. The double track section between the loops {{at either end of}} the line was also slewed during this period to allow for multiple train operation in the future, although this was not a possibility until February 1986 with the arrival of a second locomotive in the form of ‘Lady of the Lakes’.|$|R
50|$|The Yellow Horse, {{with four}} pavilions and two bowling courses, only survived because it also went into tobacco manufacturing. Part {{of the area}} between the Vestre Landevej and Frederiksberg Allé was <b>laid</b> out as <b>tobacco</b> fields and a horse-driven mill was {{constructed}} for the processing of tobacco into snus. Other exotic produce cultivated on the estate included peaches, apricots, mulberries and grapes. In the mid-19th century the property was acquired {{by a couple of}} akvavit manufacturers who had realized that real estate was a much more lucrative business. They became rich from selling off the land in parcels to developers to use for the construction of multi-story apartment buildings, turning Vestre Landevej into urban Vesterbrogade.|$|R

There was a table covered with papers, another piled with newspapers. There were books upon the floor, pipes and <b>tobacco</b> <b>laid</b> about haphazard. A space had been swept clear upon the larger table for a typewriter, a telephone instrument stood against the wall. A man whose likeness to Felicia was at once apparent, swung round in his chair as Hunterleys entered. He had taken off his coat and waistcoat and his trousers seemed smothered with dust.|$|R
50|$|The rising {{demand for}} these fiber-optic cables outpaced the {{capacity}} of providers such as AT&T. Having to shift traffic to satellites resulted in poorer quality signals. To address this issue, AT&T had to improve its cable laying abilities. It invested $100 million in producing two specialized fiber-optic cable laying vessels. These included laboratories in the ships for splicing cable and testing its electrical properties. Such field monitoring is important because the glass of fiber-optic cable is less malleable than the copper cable that had been formerly used. The ships are equipped with thrusters that increase maneuverability. This capability is important because fiber-optic cable must be <b>laid</b> <b>straight</b> from the stern (another factor copper cable laying ships {{did not have to}} contend with).|$|R
5000|$|Gold Flex is a {{non-woven}} fabric manufactured by Honeywell from Kevlar and {{often used in}} ballistic vests and body armor.Gold Flex is lighter than woven Kevlar, Twaron and other Ballistic material. According to the manufacturer Gold Flex offers superior bulletproof protection. Gold Flex is a laminated material consisted of cross-laid non-wovenfibersin a resin matrix. Because the fibers are <b>laid</b> <b>straight</b> {{and not in a}} woven fabric configuration superior bullet penetration resistance is claimed by the manufacturer. When an object strikes this material a [...] "web" [...] of its clusters absorb the impact by a good percentage and minimizes penetration. Per the manufacturer since this is a straight fibre-based creation, all fibres on the GoldFlex works together on the vest or material to stop the impact.|$|R

5000|$|PEN (Polyethylene naphthalate), {{commonly}} known by Honeywell's trade name [...] "Pentex", is {{another kind of}} polyester fiber, which stretches only 40% as much as standard PET fibers, but about {{twice as much as}} Kevlar 29. Because it only shrinks about a third as much as a good PET, PEN can not be woven as tightly; thus, woven PEN must be impregnated with resin making sails prone to damage from improper use and handling. PEN is better suited for making laminated sailcloth, where the fibers are <b>laid</b> <b>straight</b> for strength and are bonded to sheets of film for stability (e.g., PET film often called by one of its trade names Mylar), or as a taffeta outer layer of a laminate, protecting a PET film.
