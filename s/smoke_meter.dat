In {{order to}} solve the {{difficult}} problem of the transmission-type <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> response time, which needs to be settled urgently, response time testers have been developed, according to China's metrological verification regulation JJG 976 - 2010 《 Calibration procedures of transmission-type <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> 》. The tester integrated several communication protocols of transmission-type <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> manufacturers, takes measurements at every 20 ms, draws absorptance N curves in real time and displays the final response time in man-machine interface. The measuring range of the tester is (600 ~ 2000) ms, and the error is ± 20 ms. It is very convenient, fast, and accurate to verify for transmission–type <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> and traffic analyzer...|$|E

40|$|Smoke meters with {{increased}} sensitivity, improved accuracy, and rapid response {{are needed to}} measure the smoke levels emitted by modern jet engines. The standard soiled tape meter in current use is based on filtering, which yields long term averages and is insensitive to low smoke levels. Two new optical <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> techniques that promise to overcome these difficulties have been experimentally evaluated: modulated transmission (MODTRAN) and photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS). Both techniques are based on light absorption by smoke, which {{is closely related to}} smoke density. They are variations on direct transmission measurements which produce a modulated signal that can be easily measured with phase sensitive detection. The MODTRAN and PDS techniques were tested on low levels of smoke and diluted samples of NO 2 in nitrogen, simulating light adsorption due to smoke. The results are evaluated against a set of ideal <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> criteria that include a desired smoke measurement range of 0. 1 to 12 mg cu. m. (smoke numbers of 1 to 50) and a frequency response of 1 per second. The MODTRAN instrument is found to be inaccurate for smoke levels below 3 mg/cu. m. and is able to make a only about once every 20 seconds because of its large sample cell. The PDS instrument meets nearly all the characteristics of an ideal smoke meter: it has excellent sensitivity over a range of smoke levels from 0. 1 to 20 mg/cu. m.

40|$|The use {{of diesel}} engine has been {{increasing}} in agricultural and industrial applications. The unfavorable diesel smoke, however, discourage the wide-spread use due to health hazards. The smoke also limits the maximum power output. Reduction of diesel smoke by adaptive control was {{the ultimate goal of}} this research. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a fuel metering valve perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel metering pump, an in-line <b>smoke</b> opacity <b>meter,</b> and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages. Temperatures at various engine locations and air/fuel flow were also measured. The spectral analysis was implemented to find the frequency response of system for the pseudo-random binary signal. The multi-frequency binary input and the output signals were Fourier transformed. The resulting frequency domain signals were plotted on Bode plot and postulated transfer functions were fitted using the Box nonlinear optimization procedure;The higher order of transfer function between smoke opacity and fuel metering rate was obtained for 9 operating points. These models can be utilized in development of an electronic injection pump for the reducing smoke level and increasing fuel economy. With sufficiently fast computation, on-line identification might be possible and adaptive control of fuel metering could be implemented.

In order {{to control the}} equivalence ratio, the O- 2 mole fraction of intake gas was reduced from 21 to 11. 16 % by adding only N- 2 to intake gas while the injected fuel quantity was held constant. The test was used a single-cylinder compression ignition (Cl) engine with a displacement volume of 373. 3 cc, a compression ratio of 17. 8, a re-entrant type piston-bowl. The emission measurement instruments consisted of emission bench (MEXA- 9100 D, HORIBA) and <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> (AVL- 415 S, AVL). In the result, the maximum IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) and fuel conversion efficiency gradually decreased when the equivalence ratio was richer. In particular, the stoichiometric condition (i. e. 1. 0 equivalence ratio) had around 15 % and 11 % losses, respectively. The stoichiometric diesel combustion had a positive ignition dwell over the whole operating condition, leading to {{a large amount of}} THC (total hydrocarbons) and CO emission.

40|$|Nitric oxide {{and smoke}} {{emissions}} in diesel engine {{can be controlled}} by optimising the air/fuel mixture and combustion temperature. Early in-cylinder diesel injection that produces premixed charge can simultaneously reduce NOx and smoke emissions. However, there could {{be an increase in}} hydrocarbons and CO emissions due to fuel impinged to the cylinder wall. The focus of the present work is on the effects of a variation of pilot injection timing with EGR to NOx and smoke level of a modern V 6 common rail direct injection. This study is carried out at two different engine load conditions of 30 Nm and 55 Nm, at constant engine speed of 2000 rpm. Emissions of NOx are measured from the exhaust sample line by an exhaust gas analyzer (Horiba MEXA- 7100 EGR). Smoke level is measured by using an AVL 415 S <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> which provides results directly as a Filter Smoke Number (FSN) unit. The results show that the early pilot injection timing contributed to the lower smoke level and higher NOx emissions. The higher level of NOx is due to higher combustion temperatures resulting from the complete combustion. Meanwhile, the lower smoke level is due to complete fuel combustion and soot oxidation. The early pilot injection timing produces an intermediate main ignition delay which also contributed to complete combustion. The formation of smoke is higher at a high engine load compared with low engine load is due to the higher amount of fuel being injected, resulting in higher smoke formatio...|$|E

One acceptable method for managing the medical waste is incineration but uncontrolled incinerators can cause emission of pollutants to atmosphere. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate pollutants emission from hospital waste incinerators in Hamadan. Materials and methods: In this investigation, samples were collected from Emam, Syna, Fatemieh, Mobasher Kashani hospital incinerators to determine the level of lead, mercury, cadmium, benzene, toluene. Xylene, carbon monoxide, sulphour dioxide and particulate. Collected samples were analysed using gas chromatograph, atomic absorbtion, spectrometer and <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> in the laboratory or by SO 2 and CO meter as a direct method in the field. Results: Results show that Mobasher hospital has maximum concentration of metals fume such as lead, mercury, cadmium (1113, 540, 3340 mg/m 3, respectively). Mean concentration of sulphour dioxide was 127 ppm and for suspended particulate concentration was 639 mg/m 3. In Syna hospital, the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene, xylene and carbon monoxide were maximum (77. 46, 108. 64, 33. 6 mg/m 3 and 1041 ppm respectively).

A single cylinder four stroke diesel engine (Kirloskar) was tested at various loads with the blended fuel at the rated speed of 1500 rpm.

40|$|This study {{described}} the combustion and exhaust emissions characteristics of biodiesel fuel with multiple-injection strategies. Also, this investigation included the free spray characteristics and in-cylinder spray {{behaviors of the}} multiple-injection modes. Free spray and in-cylinder spray images {{were obtained from the}} spray visualization system. Combustion and exhaust emissions characteristics were analyzed using a single cylinder diesel engine with a displacement volume of 373. 33 Â cm 3 and a compression ratio of 17. 8. The exhaust emissions were analyzed using a <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> and an exhaust gas analyzer. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was utilized to measure the particle number and size distribution of the nano-sized particle matter. It revealed that the injected spray before BTDC 25 Â° developed toward the piston bowl region, and then progressed along the piston wall. When the biodiesel spray was injected at BTDC 25 Â°, the spray targeted the piston lib. In single-injection combustion, the combustion pressure and rate of heat release at an injection timing of BTDC 30 Â° dramatically decreased. These characteristics influenced on the decrease of the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and the increase of soot, HC, and CO emissions because of the incomplete combustion. The multiple-injection modes showed a higher IMEP than the single-injection mode. In addition, the pilot injection strategy represented a higher IMEP than the split injection mode. The analysis of exhaust emissions characteristics of the multiple-injection modes showed that a short injection interval induced a decrease in soot, HC, and CO emissions, while NOx emission increased. On the other hand, when the multiple-injection modes applied to the diesel engine, particles with large sizes were significantly decreased compared to single-injection combustion.

40|$|In this study, {{diesel exhaust}} (DE) was {{measured}} in real time using a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) {{to determine the effect}} of an after-treatment catalyst on gas phase volatile organic compounds (VOCs). DE after-treatment catalysts are being designed to reduce the pollutants in exhaust, which contains both particulate matter and gas phase constituents. The PTR-MS can make in-situ real time measurements of hydrocarbons in the air, from concentrations in the parts per million by volume (ppmV) down to the low part per trillion by volume (pptV) range. Spectrum scans were performed at varied engine loads from mass range m/z (mass to charge ratio) = 20 to 200. This showed the relative abundance of gas phase VOCs produced as the engine ran between idle mode and 80 % of its maximum load. The mass spectrum was complex and appeared to be composed of aromatic species ionized by PTR (M+ 1) through the anticipated proton transfer reactions as well as unexpected alkane fragments, evidenced by a strong 14 n+ 1 ion pattern showing intense peaks at m/z = 43, 57, and 71. A number of protonated M+ 1 masses could be identified. These compounds displayed M+ 2 peaks consistent with known 13 C isotopic abundance. As the engine load increased, the concentrations of over 90 % of the species decreased. An attached <b>smoke</b> <b>meter</b> showed that soot concentrations increased over the same conditions. In addition, the decrease in the concentration of compounds with a larger molecular weight (m/z> 100) was greater than the rate that the smaller compounds experienced. This appears to be due to the affinity of VOCs, larger masses in particular, to adhere to soot particles. Further PTR-MS measurements of VOCs on soot confirmed this by producing a mass spectrum comprised of masses predominantly over 100 amu. On-line analysis of diesel exhaust by PTR-MS is a practical tool for quantifying selected organic species in diesel exhaust and should prove useful for developing better diesel exhaust after-treatment system...|$|E
