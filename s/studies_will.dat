5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. <b>Studies</b> <b>will</b> commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to interpret}} the Old Saxon Heliand {{as a catalyst for}} change. Whereas recent studies have interpreted the poem as an agent of spiritual change, this <b>study</b> <b>will</b> examine the Heliand as an agent of social and political change. The basis of this <b>study</b> <b>will</b> be the text itself, with consideration of its main source, the Diatessaron. The approach will not only be textual in nature, but historical as well. The first order of the <b>study</b> <b>will</b> be to place the poem in its proper historical and cultural context. This will generate two possible contexts, as current scholarship is divided over the date of composition. This <b>study</b> <b>will</b> discuss both dates, but will select only one with which to continue. Following this, the <b>study</b> <b>will</b> examine the medium of epic and its influence on the poem. Here, significant motifs and elements of the epic will be outlined, discussed and applied to the text. In addition, this <b>study</b> <b>will</b> analyze significant figures of the poem, such as Jesus Christ, the apostles, King Herod, and Pontius Pilate. The <b>study</b> <b>will</b> also examine significant episodes of the poem, such as the birth and execution of Christ, Christ's battle with Satan in the forest, and the elimination of John the Baptist. Through examples from the text, the <b>study</b> <b>will</b> also demonstrate the poet's ability to reconcile pre-Christian concepts of spirituality with Christian Scripture, Germanic notions of power and authority with those of the Franks, and the social status of the Saxon as subjects of Frankish rule. In all, the <b>study</b> <b>will</b> demonstrate how the Heliand marks confluence of varying and conflicting notions of social order into a seamless reorganization of society...|$|R

Then the areas within a business where CLV modelling within the ambit of Customer Value Management (CVM) can have a positive impact will be explored in more depth through interviews, discussion, short questionnaires and various company based literature. The risks and obstacles involved in using CLV models and implementing CVM will be briefly mentioned, but no in depth <b>study</b> <b>will</b> be made of these evident risks and obstacles. Finally, strategic recommendations will be made with regards to using the model based on a combination of literature and empirical research...|$|R

Studies following this design can provide a model of dialogue journal research that addresses issues of selection and maturation.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Bellen’s current {{research}} focuses on an effort to decipher the mechanisms by which mutations in specific genes cause neurodegeneration, and to this end, {{he and his colleagues}} performed unbiased forward genetic screens in fruitflies that detect the progressive decline in function and morphology of photoreceptor neurons. To date over 165 genes that cause a neurodegenerative phenotype when mutated have been uncovered by Dr. Bellen’s group using this strategy. Many of these genes encode homologues of human genes that are known to cause neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Lou Gehrig's disease), Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Leigh syndrome, and others, and these <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> help provide a much better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which neurodegeneration occurs. A prevailing theme among these mutants seems to be dysfunction of the neuronal mitochondria and an increasing inability to deal with oxidative stress, which manifests as lipid droplets.|$|E

25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} article by Pierce & Buxbaum (2002), they {{concluded}} that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches, which focuses on moving the limb {{on the side of}} the neglect, has conflicting evidence in the literature. The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb, which may not be possible for many patients. Constraint-Induced Therapy (CIT), appears to be an effective, long-term treatment for improving neglect in various studies. However, the use of CIT is limited to patients who have active control of wrist and hand extension. Prism Glasses, Hemispatial Glasses, and Eye-Patching have all appear to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests. Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect; however, the effects are generally short-term. The review also suggests that Optokinetic Stimulation is effective in improving position sense, motor skills, body orientation, and perceptual neglect on a short-term basis. As with Caloric Stimulation treatment, long-term <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> be necessary to show its effectiveness. A few Trunk Rotation Therapy studies suggest its effectiveness in improving performance on neglect tests as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Some less studied treatment possibilities include treatments that target Dorsal Stream of visual processing, Mental Imagery Training, and Neck Vibration Therapy. Trunk rotation therapies aimed at improving postural disorders and balance deficits in patients with unilateral neglect, have demonstrated optimistic results in regaining voluntary trunk control when using specific postural rehabilitative devices. One such device is the Bon Saint Côme apparatus, which uses spatial exploratory tasks in combination with auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to develop trunk control. The Bon Saint Côme device has been shown to be effective with hemiplegic subjects due to the combination of trunk stability exercises, along with the cognitive requirements needed to perform the postural tasks.|$|E
