5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline <b>silica</b> {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ <b>silica</b> as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline <b>silica.</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the synthesis of}} <b>silicas</b> containing cetyltrialkylammoniun surfactants in their mesopores. Initially, the aqueous dispersions of these surfactants were characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The hybrid <b>silicas</b> obtained from these dispersions were evaluated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and nitrogen physisorption. The XRD showed that, increasing the head size, there is a shift of the peak corresponding to the (100) diffraction plane to smaller 2 θ angles, which indicates {{an increase in the}} <b>silicas</b> porous diameter. The increasing of the <b>silicas</b> porous diameter was confirmed by nitrogen physisorption. The base catalytic properties of these hybrid <b>silicas</b> were evaluated in the transesterification reaction showing that those containing the cations C 16 Et 3 + and C 16 Pr 3 + showed better performance...|$|R

5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their <b>silica</b> content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% <b>silica</b> that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in <b>silica</b> (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a <b>silica</b> content between 55-69%.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces <b>silica</b> {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The <b>silica</b> is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
40|$|Mesoporous <b>silicas</b> were {{synthesized}} from {{sodium silicate}} (Na₂Si₃O₇) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) with Pluronic F 127 (polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide, EO₁₀₆PO₇₀EO₁₀₆) triblock copolymer using sub- and {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (SubCO₂ and SCO₂) respectively, as solvents. Templates were removed using liquid carbon dioxide (LCO₂) and SCO₂. The most efficient template removal was achieved by LCO₂ − 92. 7 % (w/w), followed by LCO₂ with ethanol entrainer − 85. 6 % (w/w), and by methanol − 78. 8 % (w/w). The best efficiency of template removal by SCO₂ was 50. 7 %. Values of specific surface areas, ABET, were increased by 10 % {{with the increase of}} an ageing time from 6 to 24 hours for Na₂Si₃O₇-based <b>silicas</b> at aqueous synthesis conditions, whereas the use of SCO₂ reduced this value by 19. 4 %. For TEOS-based <b>silicas</b> synthesized using SCO₂, A BET values increased by 3. 8 times. Application of SCO₂ for synthesis of TEOS-based <b>silicas</b> resulted in higher mesopore volumes of 0. 719 and 1. 241 mL/g with an average mesopore width varying from 3. 4 to 3. 9 nm. Although Na₂Si₃O₇-based <b>silicas</b> have almost similar mesopore width range, their mesopore volumes were 7 times less than those for TEOS-based <b>silicas.</b> Formation of mesopores in Na₂Si₃O₇- and TEOS-based <b>silicas</b> was at the expense of micropores when synthesized in SCO₂.

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of <b>silica</b> in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more <b>silica</b> tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use.

The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of <b>silica,</b> which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E

5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible <b>silica</b> (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores.
