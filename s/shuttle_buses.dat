5|$|AirTrain JFK is free {{within the}} {{terminal}} area {{and to the}} hotel and car rental <b>shuttle</b> <b>buses</b> at Federal Circle.

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and <b>shuttle</b> <b>buses</b> provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death during one of the system's test runs.|$|E

On September 20, 2002, {{as part of the}} Montclair Connection, merging the Montclair Branch and Boonton Line, the Arlington station in Kearny was closed, resulting in the lack of a station in Kearny. As a result, a rail shuttle bus was created by the town of Kearny to bus passengers from Arlington station up to Kingsland via Route 76 bus route, giving rail passenger service to New York Penn Station and Hoboken Terminal. <b>Shuttle</b> <b>buses</b> were aligned at that time with the 5:02 AM, 6:03 PM and 7:08 PM.

5|$|The Port Authority {{voted to}} proceed with the {{scaled-down}} system in 1996. A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, conducted by the Port Authority and released in 1997, examined eight possible transport improvements that could be constructed in order to provide this direct connection. Ultimately, a light rail with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System, was selected as the most feasible mode of transportation for the new system. It would replace the <b>shuttle</b> <b>buses</b> that traveled between the terminals as well as to and from Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent headways was the most optimal design. The light rail would run from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. It had been almost 30 years between the first JFK rail link proposal and the approval of the light rail system; within that time period, there had been 21 proposals for direct rail links to New York-area airports, which were all canceled.|$|E
