This species may bear either the purple flowers of alfalfa or the yellow of <b>sickle</b> <b>medick,</b> {{and is so}} called for its ready growth in sandy soil. Traits for insect resistance have also been introduced from M. glomerata and M. prostrata, members of alfalfa's secondary gene pool.|$|E

Multileaf alfalfa varieties have more than three leaflets per leaf, giving them greater nutritional content by weight because there is more leafy matter for the same amount of stem.|$|E

It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, which is capable of nitrogen fixation. Its common names include yellow lucerne, sickle alfalfa, yellow-flowered alfalfa, yellow alfalfa, <b>sickle</b> <b>medick</b> and yellow medick.|$|E
