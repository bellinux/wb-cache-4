5|$|Elsewhere, the Allies {{landed at}} Arawe on New Britain on 15 December, while the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade, having {{commenced}} its advance {{up the coast}} from Gusika on 3 December, continued on passing through Bald Hill, Lakona and Kiligia {{on its way to}} Fortification Point as it led the opening phase of the Australian advance towards Sio. In late December, the 20th Infantry Brigade, which had largely been rested during the advance on Wareo, took over from the 4th. After <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> the coast quickly against light Japanese resistance, they captured Sio in early January 1944, having suffered only very light casualties.|$|E
25|$|In Welsh mythology, Cadair Idris is {{also said}} {{to be one of}} the hunting grounds of Gwyn ap Nudd and his Cŵn Annwn. The howling of these huge dogs foretold death to anyone who heard them, the pack <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> that person's soul and herding it into the underworld.|$|E
25|$|As {{he crosses}} the bridge {{in the early morning}} darkness, the young man meets a group of women leaving the city. They ask him {{questions}} about the outside world and give him a weapon: a bladed “orchid,” worn around the wrist with its blades <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> in front of the hand.|$|E

60|$|A {{tall woman}} or girl--red-haired, {{with one of}} those {{wonderful}} white skins that go therewith; and brown--yes, brown eyes; Gyp could see those eyes <b>sweeping</b> her <b>up</b> and down with a sort of burning-live curiosity. Bryan's hand was thrust under her arm at once.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, after protesters burned an American flag {{during the}} Republican National Convention, Walker {{retrieved}} the leftover remains. He buried {{them in his}} backyard according to official military guidelines. Walker said, [...] "I didn’t want somebody <b>sweeping</b> it <b>up</b> with a broom and putting it in an ashcan." ...|$|R
25|$|McLeod played most of 2007 {{again as}} a half-back flanker, <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> loose balls and {{creating}} his trademark run out of defense with his smooth skills. McLeod, however, was well held in his {{final game of the}} season, finishing with just 12 disposals after being heavily tagged by Hawthorn's Richard Vandenberg in Adelaide's elimination final loss to the Hawks.|$|E
25|$|Before {{hitting the}} main part of Johnstown, the flood surge hit the Cambria Iron Works at the town of Woodvale, <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> {{railroad}} cars and barbed wire in its moil. Of Woodvale's 1,100 residents, 314 died in the flood. Boilers exploded when the flood hit the Gautier Wire Works, causing black smoke seen by the Johnstown residents. Miles of its barbed wire became entangled in the debris in the flood waters.|$|E
25|$|A French fleet {{carrying}} 15,000 troops {{set sail}} for Ireland in 1796, under General Hoche and spent days {{in sight of}} the Cork coast at Bantry Bay but weather conditions prevented its landing, and its remnants not wrecked or captured returned to France. The British government responded to the threat it represented by <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> much of the United Irish leadership. It imposed martial law from 2 March 1797 {{in an attempt to}} break the movement by the widespread use of terror during searches for weapons.|$|E
60|$|He had, this time, {{turned his}} face towards the shore he had quitted. The tide, he knew, was <b>sweeping</b> him <b>up.</b> He kept under water {{as long as he}} {{possibly}} could, swimming his hardest. When he could keep under no longer, he turned on his back, and permitted himself to rise slowly to the surface.|$|R
25|$|Basket-work panels {{were put}} around beds and shaken {{out in the}} morning in the UK and in France in the 19th century. Scattering leaves of plants with {{microscopic}} hooked hairs around a bed at night, then <b>sweeping</b> them <b>up</b> in the morning and burning them, was a technique reportedly used in Southern Rhodesia and in the Balkans.|$|R
50|$|One day, George {{plans to}} take a patient with a very rare disease to Colombo. Dawltry takes the {{opportunity}} to invite Philippa to dinner. Before that time, Rene invites herself into his bungalow. When she refuses to leave, Dawltry frightens her into fleeing by <b>sweeping</b> her <b>up</b> {{in his arms and}} carrying her into his bedroom.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{practice}} of trawling started (around the 15th century), there have been concerns over trawling's lack of selectivity. Trawls may be non-selective, <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> both marketable and undesirable fish and fish of both legal and illegal size. Any part of the catch which cannot be used is considered by-catch, some of which is killed accidentally by the trawling process. By-catch commonly includes valued species such as dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks, and may also include sublegal or immature individuals of the targeted species.|$|E
25|$|Just then, {{disaster}} struck. Further {{south along}} the center of Bragg's line, Federal troops under General Thomas smashed through Confederate positions {{at the base of}} the ridge, <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> the hill and driving Bragg's men before them. With his army disintegrating before his eyes, Bragg ordered Cleburne to hold the Federals off long enough to let the rest of his men escape. The 33rd Alabama attacked approaching skirmishers in the gathering darkness, allowing the remainder of Bragg's army to cross Chickamauga Creek to the east, and retreat into Georgia. Since his forces had held more-or-less together during the rout, Cleburne now found his divisionincluding the 33rd Alabamaserving as the rearguard of the Army of Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Cooper's own route into Formula One was {{somewhat}} unorthodox. Following on from producing the Vanwall Maddock {{began work on}} a new sportscar, designed around Coventry Climax's new FWA 1,098 cc inline-four engine. Maddock and John Cooper decided to adapt the Mark IX Formula Three chassis to accept the larger, more powerful engine, retaining the engine mounted behind the driver and the driver's seat on the car's centre-line, per the single-seater's arrangement. The T39 chassis consequently featured Cooper's curved tube design, with the upper longerons <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> from the front suspension mounts, passing {{on either side of}} the driving position and engine, before looping back down the rear suspension. The passenger seat, mandated by sportscar rules of the time, was mounted outboard of the chassis on the driver's left.|$|E
50|$|Trouble is {{stirring}} {{in the world}} of Noor. After centuries-long exile, the dragons are uneasy and about to return. A strange wind has been blowing, <b>sweeping</b> children <b>up</b> into the sky. Among the missing is Miles's and Hanna's younger brother. They go after him and find themselves fighting alongside the dragons in a life- altering revolution.|$|R

50|$|In the 2004 ALCS, the New York Yankees lost a {{commanding}} 3-0 series lead to their archrival Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox ended <b>up</b> <b>sweeping</b> the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series.|$|R
25|$|Roman {{influences}} may {{be found}} around us today, in banks, government buildings, great houses, and even small houses, perhaps {{in the form of}} a porch with Doric columns and a pediment or in a fireplace or a mosaic shower floor derived from a Roman original, often from Pompeii or Herculaneum. The mighty pillars, domes and arches of Rome echo in the New World too, where in Washington DC we see them in the Capitol Building, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial and other government buildings. All across the US the seats of regional government were normally built in the grand traditions of Rome, with vast flights of stone steps <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> to towering pillared porticoes, with huge domes gilded or decorated inside with the same or similar themes that were popular in Rome.|$|E
500|$|Flowers {{occur in}} Banksias {{characteristic}} [...] "flower spike", an inflorescence {{made up of}} several hundred flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. This is roughly cylindrical, 10 to 12 centimetres (4–5in) high and five centimetres (2in) wide. Flowers are usually pale yellow to yellow, but may be greenish or pinkish in bud. Each individual flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals, and one long wiry style. Characteristic of the taxonomic section {{in which it is}} placed, the styles are straight rather than hooked. The style ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at anthesis. This process starts with the flowers {{at the bottom of the}} inflorescence, <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> the spike at an unusually high rate of between 96 and 390 flowers per 24 hours.|$|E
500|$|Supernovae may expel much, if not all, of the {{material}} away from a star, at velocities up to [...] or 10% {{of the speed of}} light. This drives an expanding and fast-moving shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, and in turn, <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> an expanding shell of gas and dust, which is observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae create, fuse and eject the bulk of the chemical elements produced by nucleosynthesis. Supernovae {{play a significant role in}} enriching the interstellar medium with the heavier atomic mass chemical elements. Furthermore, the expanding shock waves from supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars. Supernova remnants are expected to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays, but direct evidence for cosmic ray production was found only in a few of them so far. They are also potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves.|$|E
60|$|As {{the autumn}} came on, a great {{south-west}} gale burst over Madeira, and went <b>sweeping</b> away <b>up</b> the Bay of Biscay. It blew {{for three days}} and nights, {{and was one of the}} heaviest on record. When it first began, the English mail was due; but when it passed there were still no signs of her, and prophets of evil were not wanting who went to and fro shaking their heads, and suggesting that she had probably foundered in the Bay.|$|R
5000|$|... "The artist {{thinks of}} his recent works on panel {{as a form of}} collage, in which, as he describes, he adds and subtracts {{different}} forms until the work feels finished. The results could be described as an elegantly choreographed cacophony, in which loosely geometric forms jostle one another and, in some of his paintings, rub up against kaleidoscopic patches of pigment. At their generous size, these works engulf viewers, <b>sweeping</b> us <b>up</b> in their visual rhythms—in which you just might detect the pulse of the street." ...|$|R
60|$|This was done, and {{the boat}} glided along silently. Keeping {{in the middle of}} the channel, they passed through the passage between the shore and the rocky island that protects the harbour; and then, <b>sweeping</b> round, stole <b>up</b> behind the latter and lay to, close to the rocks.|$|R
500|$|Encounters between workers {{last for}} 15 seconds. Ritualised {{fighting}} only occurs with two worker ants who {{come into contact}} with each other, but if both ants are from the same colony, they break contact and groom themselves. Afterwards they walk around until they make contact with another ant. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation (the act of touching with the antennae) and gaping of the mandibles, and stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants will do this in a display of size-matching. Workers perform a behaviour known as [...] "front leg boxing"; both workers have their front legs <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> and down, where it would flex at the coxal joint in a paddling motion. This paddling motion is aimed at each other during the fight, going on for three to five seconds on average. From this point on, this would determine who is a [...] "loser" [...] and who is the [...] "winner".|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Richardson of The Observer of 8 November 1959 said, [...] "Some nice school {{scenes with}} bogus sheikhs <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> in lilac Cadillacs to deposit highly scented and busted houris for education, and backwoods peers shoving hockey-stick-toting daughters out of {{battered}} Austins. It's far from vintage Christie, but you'll {{want to know}} who." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1989 BBC {{comedy series}} , Haig, played by Geoffrey Palmer, makes an {{appearance}} in the final episode. Referring to the limited gains made during the 1915–1917 offensives, Blackadder says: [...] "Haig is about to make yet another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin". Haig is also portrayed <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> model soldiers from a large map with a dustpan and brush, and tossing them casually over his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} seeker," [...] he cried. [...] "I possess. It {{seems to}} me that all the {{beautiful}} things of life are here to-night. Listen! Do you hear the sea, the full tide <b>sweeping</b> softly <b>up</b> into the land, a long drawn out undernote of breathless harmonies, the rustling of leaves there in the elm trees, the faint night wind, like the murmuring of angels? Lift your head! Was there anything ever sweeter than the perfume from that hedge of honeysuckle? What can a man want more than these things--and--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Wisdom is [...] "to {{know the}} thought by which {{all things are}} steered through all things", which must not imply that people are or can be wise. Only Zeus is wise. To some degree then Heraclitus {{seems to be in}} the mystic's {{position}} of urging people to follow God's plan without much of an idea what that may be. In fact there is a note of despair: [...] "The fairest universe ( [...] kallistos kosmos) is but a heap of rubbish ( [...] sarma, <b>sweepings)</b> piled <b>up</b> (κεχυμένον kechumenon, i.e. [...] "poured out") at random ( [...] eikê, [...] "aimlessly")." ...|$|R
60|$|Callopy, {{the famous}} spiker, who had put many a player {{out of the}} game for weeks at a time, strode into the batter's place, and he, too, was not at the moment making any funny remarks. The Rube {{delivered}} a ball that all but hit Callopy fair on the head. It was the second narrow escape for him, and the roar he let out showed how he resented being threatened with a little of his own medicine. As might have been expected, and very likely as the Rube intended, Callopy hit the next ball, a <b>sweeping</b> curve, <b>up</b> over the infield.|$|R
2500|$|In 1896, the Iron Palace {{was bought}} by John Wanamaker and reopened as [...] "Wanamaker's". The Philadelphian Wanamaker had long been an admirer of Stewart and stated {{that one of his}} best qualities was his [...] "personal {{attention}} to the details of the business... He could have had others to look after the details — they have to be looked after, but few attend to <b>sweeping</b> <b>up,</b> and that's what Stewart did." [...] In 1917 the New York Sun newspaper bought Stewart's Marble Palace for its main offices. In 1966 the building was designated a landmark by the City of New York.|$|E
2500|$|Leoni's {{commissions}} for royal portraiture in Spain were {{an extension}} of his Habsburg patronage. On his return from Spain, where he executed the series of royal portraits, he brought a purse of 2000 scudi, according to Vasari. [...] He pioneered what became a common Baroque format for a portrait bust; mounted on a pedestal, and truncated at mid-chest, or {{the bottom of the}} stomach (often defined by an armoured breast-plate), <b>sweeping</b> <b>up</b> at the sides to just below the shoulders. He also made life-size full-length portrait bronzes, like that of Charles V, which were not intended as funerary effigies, as nearly all previous examples had been.|$|E
2500|$|The Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan (2007–2013) is a {{gigantic}} cultural and conference centre containing three auditoriums, a library and museum, {{with a total}} space of 10,801 square metres on a surface of 15,514 square metres, and a height of 74 metres. Hadid wrote that [...] "its fluid form emerges from {{the folds of the}} natural topography of the landscape and envelops the different functions of the centre," [...] though the building when completed was largely surrounded by Soviet-era apartment blocks. Peter Cook in Architectural Review called it [...] "a white vision, outrageously total, arrogantly complete'... a unique object that confounds and contradicts the reasonable...a wave form <b>sweeping</b> <b>up,</b> almost lunging, into the sky...here is architecture as the ultimate statement of theatre...It is the most complete realisation yet of the Iraqi-born architect's vision of sweeping curves and flowing space." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{walked through}} the {{plantation}} side by side. The ground was still soft with the winter's rains, but everywhere the sunlight came <b>sweeping</b> in, <b>up</b> the glade and across the many stretching arms of tender blossoming green. The ground was starred with primroses, and in every sheltered nook were violets. A soft west wind blew in their faces as they emerged into the country lane. Below them was the valley, hung with a faint blue mist; all around them the song of birds, the growing sounds of the stirring season. Stephen Hurd came cantering by, and {{stopped for a moment}} to speak about some matter connected with the estates.|$|R
50|$|Jerry then dives into {{a corner}} pocket. Tom gropes through the pocket to find Jerry, but grabs his own tail, pulling himself through the pockets. Tom then sticks a hose down the holes, <b>sweeping</b> Jerry <b>up,</b> and swings a {{mechanical}} bridge to hit Jerry, but Jerry, latching onto the end, climbs up onto a wire and steals the bridge. Jerry uses the bridge as a balancing stick, but Tom throws two cues at Jerry. The first hits the wire dead centre and shreds in two, but the second scrapes Jerry's rear to an alarming red. Angry, Jerry then shoots the mechanical bridge into Tom's mouth.|$|R
5000|$|Contrary to the {{automatic}} infection of feelings described above, {{there are times}} when others' emotions are being manipulated by a person or a group in order to achieve something. This can be a result of intentional affective influence by a leader or team member. Suppose this person wants to convince the others of something, he may do so by <b>sweeping</b> them <b>up</b> in his enthusiasm. In such a case, his positive emotions are an act with the purpose of [...] "contaminating" [...] the others' feelings. A different kind of intentional mood contagion is by giving the group a reward, or treat, in order to alleviate their feelings.|$|R
