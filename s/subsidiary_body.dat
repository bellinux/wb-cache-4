25|$|In 1995, Agenda Progress {{was renamed}} D.C. Agenda, {{and led by}} former Barry {{administration}} official James O. Gibson. Its original purpose was {{to serve as an}} unofficial transition committee at the start of Marion Barry's fourth term (1995 to 1999) as mayor. It represented the interests of large corporations and nonprofits doing business with city, providing them with research and technical assistance. In time, D.C. Agenda shifted its focus to building coalitions to support its agenda on city governance and financial/tax reform, improved support for economic development, neighborhood redevelopment, and at-risk youth intervention. In some cases, D.C. Agenda mimicked or implemented city functions and acted as a liaison with corporations or nonprofits to implement public policy. D.C. Agenda also had a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>body,</b> the D.C. Agenda Support Corporation, led by former District of Columbia Administrator Carol Thompson Cole. D.C. Agenda had several subcommittees as well, including an Economic Development Strategy Group (organized in 1996 and led by local attorney Dana Stebbins).|$|E
500|$|Supporters {{have set}} forth {{possible}} UNPA implementations, including promulgation {{of a new}} treaty; creation of a UNPA as a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>body</b> of the UN General Assembly; and evolution of a UNPA from the Inter-Parliamentary Union or another non-governmental organization. Several proposals for apportionment of votes have been raised to address disparities in UN members' population and economic power. CEUNPA advocates initially giving the UNPA advisory powers and gradually increasing its authority over the UN system.|$|E
500|$|Another {{possibility}} is establishing the UNPA as a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>body</b> of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly has {{authority to do}} this under Article 22 of the UN Charter. Erskine Childers and Sir Brian Urquhart endorsed this approach in their 1994 book, Renewing the United Nations System. The Committee for a Democratic UN also recommended the establishment of UNPA by Article 22 or by transformation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in its report, Developing International Democracy, authored by Andreas Bummel, co-founder {{and director of the}} UNPA campaign. In 2006, the Council of Europe passed a resolution noting, [...] "A decisive step towards the development of a UN parliamentary dimension could be the establishment of an experimental parliamentary committee with consultative functions for General Assembly committees." ...|$|E

500|$|Herbert W. Briggs {{points out}} that while a UNPA could be {{established}} as a UNGA <b>subsidiary</b> <b>body</b> without any changes to international law, granting it the power to pass binding legislation would require UN Charter amendment or a new treaty. The UNGA {{plays a role in}} admitting, suspending and expelling UN members, approving the budget, and electing members to other UN bodies, but its powers as set forth in Chapter IV of the UN Charter are mostly advisory in nature. These include the power to [...] "discuss," [...] "make recommendations," [...] "consider," [...] "call the attention of the Security Council to situations," [...] "initiate studies," [...] "receive...reports," [...] etc., as well as [...] "establish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance of its functions." [...] The Charter contains no provision allowing the UNGA to delegate any powers it does not itself possess. And while Article 25 states, [...] "The Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council," [...] there is no requirement that members abide by the recommendations of the UNGA. On the other hand, Article 13(1)(a) of the Charter tasks the UNGA with [...] "encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification." ...|$|E

60|$|But, my Lords, the {{prisoner}} thinks, that, when, under any pretence, {{any sort of}} means could be furnished of interfering {{in the government of}} the country, he has a right to avail himself of them, to use them at his pleasure, and to govern by his own arbitrary will. The Vizier, he says, by this treaty was reduced to a state of vassalage; and he makes this curious distinction in proof of it. It was, he says, an optional vassalage: for, if he chose to get rid of our troops, he might do so and be free; if he had not a mind to do that, and found a benefit in it, then he was a vassal. But there is nothing less true. Here is a person who keeps a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>body</b> of your troops, which he is to pay for you; and in consequence of this Mr. Hastings maintains that he becomes a vassal. I shall not dispute whether vassalage is optional or by force, or in what way Mr. Hastings considered this prince as a vassal of the Company. Let it be as he pleased. I only think it necessary that your Lordships should truly know the actual state of that country, and the ground upon which Mr. Hastings stood. Your Lordships will find it a fairy land, {{in which there is a}} perpetual masquerade, where no one thing appears as it really is,--where the person who seems to have the authority is a slave, while the person who seems to be the slave has the authority. In that ambiguous government everything favors fraud, everything favors peculation, everything favors violence, everything favors concealment. You will therefore permit me to show to you what were the principles upon which Mr. Hastings appears, according to the evidence before you, to have acted,--what the state of the country was, according to his conceptions of it; and then you will see how he applied those principles to that state.|$|E
