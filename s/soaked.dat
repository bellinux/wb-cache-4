5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting <b>soaked</b> with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper <b>soaked</b> with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E

5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, <b>soaked</b> into the ground, or evaporated.

40|$|LectureHeat <b>soak</b> {{is defined}} as heat {{transfer}} from the metal of a seal chamber to the fluid within the seal chamber. Many variables affect heat <b>soak</b> including materials, surface configurations, and film coefficients. Heat <b>soak</b> can be from the seal chamber to the fluid within, or from the fluid to the seal chamber. Typically, the term heat <b>soak</b> is used to describe heat transfer from a hot pump to a cooler liquid within the seal chamber. During {{the development of the}} API 682 seal standard (2004), the API 682 Task Force adopted an equation for estimating heat <b>soak</b> but recommended that the coefficients in the equation should be based on tests. However, there are still little data available and most users simply estimate heat <b>soak</b> using the API 682 default values. For a number of service conditions, the API 682 default equation produces unnecessarily high estimates for heat <b>soak</b> but default estimates are not always high. As a result, auxiliary systems can be incorrectly sized by using the API 682 default equation for heat <b>soak.</b> Improvements are needed in the API 682 heat <b>soak</b> equation. The first step toward improving the API 682 heat <b>soak</b> equation was to use simple one-dimensional find theory to derive a heat transfer equation. Surprisingly, this one-dimensional fin equation could be recast into a form that approximated the API equation but included additional parameters. The theoretical fin equation was checked and further improved using two-dimensional finite element analysis and again by using computational fluid dynamics. The predicted heat transfer compares favorably to measurements in the test lab. Based on these studies, the authors have prepared and offer a table of adjustment factors to be applied to the default API 682 heat <b>soak</b> equation...|$|R
