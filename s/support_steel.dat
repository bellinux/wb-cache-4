25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components <b>support</b> <b>steel</b> perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E
2500|$|The Caspian Mine Headframe is a steel mining {{building}} {{located at}} north of Caspian Road. [...] The Caspian Mine opened in 1903, {{the second of}} three mines opened by the Verona Mining Company. [...] Verona later sold the mine to the Pickands-Mather Company. [...] The original headframe was wooden; the current structure was built as a replacement in 1920. The headframe is a 106foot high steel-framed structure clad in corrugated steel siding. It is about 25feet by 10feet at the base and tapers to about 10feet by 10feet at the top.

2500|$|On April 24, 2013, the Port Authority's Board of Commissioners {{awarded a}} $743.3 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Skanska Koch and Kiewit Infrastructure Company. The bridge's clearance would be raised approximately , from [...] to , {{with the construction of}} a new roadway above the existing roadway within the current arch structure. The construction involved building support columns first, then adding prefabricated road segments using a gantry crane that rolled on top of the arch. The gantry crane would construct one rope-supported section of the new roadway at a time, using a temporary beam to support the existing roadway while each rope was replaced. The existing roadway would then be removed. Temporary bridge closures allowed new floor beams to be attached to the arch's ropes in order to <b>support</b> <b>steel</b> stringers that would hold up the new roadway. This work was expedited by Barack Obama's presidential administration due to the importance of the project to national commerce, being one of the first applicants to Obama's [...] "We Can't Wait" [...] initiative of important infrastructure projects. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also considered the project a high priority for his state.|$|E
30|$|The {{combination}} of rock bolting and <b>steel</b> <b>supports</b> {{is commonly used}} in complex roadways.

50|$|The {{plan layout}} {{is based on}} an ellipse, a section of cone with {{inclined}} vertex. The coved granite wall follows the curvature of the cone’s surface, but its external facing is implemented through flat slabs having the same size. The opposite southern wall is made up of two undulating surfaces, but since these complex curves are derived from lined systems, they are implemented via simple elements: rectilinear steel pillars placed each under a different angle, which <b>support</b> <b>steel</b> modular and rectilinear connecting elements.|$|E
50|$|The design {{calls for}} a {{cone-shaped}} pyramid 840 meters high, with a base about {{as big as the}} Tokyo Olympic Stadium and glass sides for natural lighting. It is intended to be constructed on water, with boat and bridge access. Since the tower was planned for an area with frequent earthquakes and hurricane-strength winds, the shape is aerodynamic to reduce wind stress, and helical bands are wrapped around the tower for structural <b>support.</b> <b>Steel</b> tanks {{at the top of the}} tower are filled with water, and can be rotated as a counterweight against wind.|$|E

30|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>supports</b> used in German {{coal mines}} {{can be divided}} into four types {{according}} to their shapes: (1) U-shape steel arches (open in the floor); (2) U-shape steel arches with a yieldable inverted-arch component in the floor; (3) ring steel supports; (4) rectangular <b>steel</b> <b>supports.</b> The first type is applicable to various gateroads, the second type is applicable to haulage roadways, the third type is applicable to development roadways, and the rectangular support is applicable to the open-off cuts. In Germany, the importance of backfilling behind the supports is stressed especially in the interaction relations between supports and surrounding rocks. Backfilling behind the <b>supports</b> makes the <b>steel</b> <b>supports</b> fully contact with rock surface, increases the stiffness of media transferring resistance forces from <b>steel</b> <b>supports</b> to surrounding rocks, and greatly improves the performance of the <b>steel</b> <b>supports.</b> Testing results showed that backfilling can increase the bearing capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>supports</b> by more than one time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{excavation}} of city subway pit breaking the original {{balance of the}} soil, affecting the safety of existed buildings and the surface subsidence of construction are important and direct factors which react to construction impacts. Using the Gray Relational Analysis Theory, through monitoring measured data of factors, building gray correlation analysis among {{excavation of}} subway construction surface subsidence, horizontal displacement of pile top, deep displacement, the groundwater level, the support axial force, the anchor cable tension and other factors, get the collective degree of different monitoring program. The results show that, the factors, from maximal to minimum correlation degree, which affect surface subsidence includes horizontal displacement of pile top, anchor cable tension, the groundwater level, deep displacement, strut axial forces. It provides a theoretical basis for law of surface subsidence and similar monitoring program optimization for the future projects. The excavation of city subway pit breaks the original balance of the soil. Before the excavation and construction process, {{in order to prevent}} pit deformation, measures has been taken, such as diaphragm wall, concrete <b>support,</b> <b>steel</b> support, anchor and so on. However, it does not eliminate the impact of excavation on the surrounding environment. Construction causes the movement o...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to propose}} a {{methodology}} to remove inherent implicit creep from the Eurocode 3 material model for steel and to present a creep-free analysis on simply <b>supported</b> <b>steel</b> members. Design/methodology/approach – Most of the available material models of steel are based on transient coupon tests, which inherently include creep strain associated with particular heating rates and load ratios. Findings – The creep-free analysis aims to reveal the influence of implicit creep by investigating the behaviour of simply <b>supported</b> <b>steel</b> beams and columns exposed to various heating regimes. The paper further evaluates the implicit consideration of creep in the Eurocode 3 steel material model.
