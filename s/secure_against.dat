5|$|When Nixon took office, about 300 American {{soldiers}} were dying each week in Vietnam, {{and the war}} was broadly unpopular in the United States, with violent protests against the war ongoing. The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions, but this agreement never fully took force. According to Walter Isaacson, soon after taking office, Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and {{he was determined to}} end the war quickly. He sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw, while leaving South Vietnam <b>secure</b> <b>against</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonald Liberals easily won {{re-election}} in 1949 and 1953, but the Conservatives made steady gains under Robert Stanfield, their new leader. The Conservatives for example, {{drew attention to}} kickback schemes under which brewing companies, wineries and distilleries contributed to the Liberal party {{in exchange for the}} right to sell their products in government liquor stores. The Liberals seemed <b>secure</b> <b>against</b> such allegations however, {{as long as they were}} led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald. However, Macdonald suffered a slight heart attack on April 11, 1954, and was admitted to hospital where he died in his sleep two nights later, just four months before his 64th birthday.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, the French {{military}} reclaimed the Maginot Line {{with the}} aim of renovating and improving it against a possible attack by Warsaw Pact forces. Four-à-Chaux and Lembach were grouped with Hochwald and Schoenenbourg from the SF Haguenau. They were designated the môle de Bitche ("breakwater") in 1951 and were placed back into service after a period of rehabilitation. Schiesseck, Otterbiel (in the SF Rohrbach) and Grand-Hohékirkel, located at the Camp de Bitche army training center, were used for training in fortress systems and weapons. During Exercise Turenne at Grand-Hohékirkel in 1953, firing exercises cast doubt on the combat viability of the exposed cloches, which had proved vulnerable to German fire in the war. A follow-up exercise (Hoche) did, however, confirm that casemate positions remained <b>secure</b> <b>against</b> 90mm-equivalent gunfire, using AMX-13 and M47 Patton tanks to fire on embrasures.|$|E
25|$|Across the Seine {{from the}} Louvre, Louis XIV built the Collège des Quatre-Nations (College of the Four Nations) (1662–1672), an {{ensemble}} of four baroque palaces and a domed church, to house students coming to Paris from four provinces recently attached to France (today {{it is the}} Institut de France). He built a new hospital for Paris, the Salpêtrière, and, for wounded soldiers, a new hospital complex with two churches: Les Invalides (1674). In the centre of Paris, he constructed two monumental new squares, the Place des Victoires (1689) and the Place Vendôme (1698). Louis XIV declared that Paris was <b>secure</b> <b>against</b> any attack and no longer needed its walls. He demolished the main city walls, creating the space which eventually became the Grands Boulevards. To celebrate {{the destruction of the}} old walls, he built two small arches of triumph, the Porte Saint-Denis (1672) and the Porte Saint-Martin (1676).|$|E

500|$|Agincourt {{was working}} up until 7September 1914, when {{she joined the}} 4th Battle Squadron (BS) of the Grand Fleet.

500|$|To {{prevent that}} threat {{from coming to}} pass, Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, chief {{engineer}} of the defenses of Washington, directed that a line of forts be constructed on the heights southeast of the Anacostia River. From Fort Greble at the western end to Fort Mahan at the eastern end, the forts along the Eastern Branch River (as the Anacostia was then known) were not intended to constitute a continuous defensive line as was the Arlington Line that defended the Virginia approaches to the city. Instead, they were merely intended to deny Confederate artillery the position and to provide warning of any sneak attack upon Washington from the southeast. General Barnard illustrated this in an October 1862 report, saying, [...] "As the enemy cannot enter the city from this direction, {{the object of the}} works is to prevent him seizing these heights, and occupying them long enough to shell the navy-yard and arsenal. For this, the works must be made <b>secure</b> <b>against</b> assault, and auxiliary to this object is the construction of roads by which succor can be readily thrown to any point menaced." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{studying}} the basic aspects of establishment {{and development of the}} land market. A mechanism for <b>securing</b> <b>against</b> the leasehold estate and a model of an agricultural land market have been proposed. It has been specified that the most important component on formation of land market in our State is to work to change public opinion, people attitudes regarding the private ownership of land and deals with it. The proposed mechanism for <b>securing</b> <b>against</b> the leasehold estate has not only economic, but also social significance, which, above all, is that <b>securing</b> <b>against</b> the leasehold estate does not change the owner of the land, and, consequently, does not threaten villagers with dispossession of land. With introduction of the presented model of an agricultural land market {{it can be argued that}} such a market is an open, complex system based on the interaction between its actors over the use, disposal and market turnover of agricultural lands...|$|R
