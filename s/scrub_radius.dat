50|$|Negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> {{decreases}} {{torque steer}} and improves {{stability in the}} event of brake failure. SLA suspensions usually have a positive <b>scrub</b> <b>radius.</b> With this suspension, the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is not adjustable. The greater the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> (positive or negative), the greater the steering effort and the more road shock and pivot binding that takes place. When the vehicle has been modified with offset wheels, larger tires, height adjustments and side to side camber differences, the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> will be changed and the handling and stability of the vehicle will be affected.|$|E
50|$|The {{line through}} the {{steering}} axis creates a pivot point around which the tire turns. If these lines intersect at the road surface, a zero <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> would be present. When the intersection is {{below the surface of}} the road, this is positive <b>scrub</b> <b>radius.</b> Conversely, when the lines intersect above the road, negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is present. The point where the steering axis line contacts the road is the fulcrum pivot point on which the tire is turned. <b>Scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is changed whenever there is a change in wheel offset. For example, when the wheels are pushed out from the body of the car the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> becomes more positive. Older cars tended to have very close to zero <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> but often on the positive side, while newer cars with ABS tend to have a negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> (this is why most newer cars have wheels offset more inboard).|$|E
50|$|MacPherson strut {{equipped}} vehicles {{usually have}} a negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius.</b> Even though <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> in itself is not directly adjustable, it will be changed if the upper steering axis point or spindle angle is changed when adjusting camber. This is the case on a MacPherson strut which has the camber adjustment at the steering knuckle. Because camber is usually kept within 1/4° side to side, the resulting <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> difference is negligible.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> {{is small}} then the contact patch is spun in place when parking, which {{takes a lot}} more effort. The {{advantage}} of a small <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is that the steering becomes less sensitive to braking inputs, in particular.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is the {{distance}} {{at the road}} surface between the tire center line and the SAI line extended downward through the steering axis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is the {{distance}} in front view between the king pin axis {{and the center}} of the contact patch of the wheel, where both would theoretically touch the road.|$|E
5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual king pin angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is zero. Zero <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply dished wheel so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less dished wheel, which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Squirm {{occurs when}} the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is at zero. When the pivot point is in the exact center of the tire footprint, this causes {{scrubbing}} action in opposite directions when the wheels are turned. Tire wear and some instability in corners is the result.|$|E
50|$|Dual-pivot {{steering}} geometry (also known as virtual pivot) is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the steering {{of a car}} designed to reduce or eliminate <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> by moving the pivot point of the king pin outboard, {{in order to improve}} steering precision and straight line stability.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} of a negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> is that the geometry naturally compensates for split µ (mu) braking, or failure {{in one of the}} brake circuits. It also provides center point steering {{in the event of a}} tire deflation, which provides greater stability and steering control in this emergency.|$|E
50|$|Large {{positive}} {{values of}} <b>scrub</b> <b>radius,</b> 4 inches/100 mm or so, {{were used in}} cars for many years. The advantage {{of this is that}} the tire rolls as the wheel is steered, which reduces the effort when parking. This also allows greater width in the engine bay, which is very important in some compact sports cars.|$|E
50|$|If the kingpin axis {{intersection}} point is outboard {{of the center}} of the contact patch it is negative, if inside the contact patch it is positive. The term <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> derives from the fact that either in the positive or negative mode, the tire does not turn on its centerline (it scrubs the road in a turn) and due to the increased friction, more effort is needed to turn the wheel.|$|E
50|$|RevoKnuckle is Ford's {{variation}} of the MacPherson strut suspension design which separates steering and suspension movements to provide lower <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> ref1 and kingpin offset than traditional MacPherson struts. Ford claims that it weighs less and costs less than double wishbone and multi-link suspension arrangement. The kingpin offset compares favorably to that of double wishbone suspensions (20-30mm vs 40mm).The main advantage of RevoKnuckle compared to MacPherson struts is the reduction in torque steer, especially for high powered FWD applications.|$|E
50|$|In automobiles, {{a double}} {{wishbone}} suspension {{is an independent}} suspension design using two (occasionally parallel) wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. Each wishbone or arm has two mounting points to the chassis and one joint at the knuckle. The shock absorber and coil spring mount to the wishbones to control vertical movement. Double wishbone designs allow the engineer to carefully control {{the motion of the}} wheel throughout suspension travel, controlling such parameters as camber angle, caster angle, toe pattern, roll center height, <b>scrub</b> <b>radius,</b> scuff and more.|$|E
50|$|The kingpin axis is {{the line}} between the upper and lower ball joints of the hub. On a MacPherson strut, the top pivot point is the strut bearing, and the bottom point is the lower ball joint. The {{inclination}} of the steering axis is measured as the angle between the steering axis and the centerline of the wheel. This means that if the camber angle is adjustable within the pivot points the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> can be changed, this alters the width and offset of the tires on a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{occurred}} for the 1987 model year. On the interior, the 1987 944 Turbo for North America {{became the first}} production car {{in the world to}} be equipped with driver and passenger side air bags as standard equipment. A low oil level light was added to the dash as well as a 180 mi/h km/h speedometer as opposed to the 170 mi/h km/h speedometer on the 1986 model Turbos. Also included is the deletion of the transmission oil cooler, and a change in suspension control arms to reduce the car's <b>scrub</b> <b>radius.</b> The engine remained the same M44/51 as in the 1986 model.|$|E
50|$|The two arms, the spindle, and the body, form a four-bar link. Use of {{the linkage}} {{at the lower}} {{suspension}} connection of either a MacPherson strut or a short long arms suspension readily gives an effective virtual ball joint outboard of the spindle, which is very useful for a suspension designer, allowing negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> whilst allowing the ball joints to move in and thus {{out of the way}} of the brakes. Some manufacturers use a double ball joint arm to replace both wishbones on a short long arms suspension. This provides further opportunity for optimising the geometry.|$|E
50|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright.

5000|$|The Renault Fuego {{was heavily}} {{based on the}} Renault 18, sharing its floorpan and drivetrain, but {{featuring}} a new front suspension design developed from the larger Renault 20/30. The design kept the familiar double wishbone layout common with the Renault 18 but no parts were interchangeable and the design incorporated negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> geometry. The new suspension design would later be introduced in the facelifted Renault 18, and with minor refinements (larger bushings, etc.), it {{was used in the}} Renault 25. In 1984, the Fuego dashboard was added to the facelifted R18. European production continued into 1986 (to 1985 in France and 1986 in Spain), while Renault Argentina produced the Fuego from 1982 until finally ending production in 1995 with the 2.2-litre [...] "GTA Max" [...] (the final phase III facelift introduced in 1990).|$|E
50|$|When {{selecting}} aftermarket wheels, a {{wheel with}} too little positive offset will {{be closer to}} edge of the fender, and one with too much positive offset will tuck inside the fender and {{be closer to the}} suspension components. Wheel width, offset and tire size all determine the way a particular wheel/tire combination will work on a given car. Offset also affects the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> of the steering and it is advisable to stay within the limits allowed by the vehicle manufacturer. Because wheel offset changes the lever-arm length between the center of the tire and the centerline of the steering knuckle, the way bumps, road imperfections and acceleration and braking forces are translated to steering torques (bump-steer, torque-steer, etc.) will change depending on wheel offset. Likewise, the wheel bearings will see increased thrust loads if the wheel centerline is moved away from the bearing centerline.|$|E

A larger Borg Warner K16 turbo now delivers up to 20.3-psi of boost, exactly double that of the 225-hp ST's engine. A new air-to-air intercooler has been developed as a complement, while the forged crankshaft, silicon-aluminum pistons, graphite-coated cylinder bores, 8.5:1 compression ratio and variable valve timing also up the power output. The car remains front wheel drive, but to reduce torque steer uses a Quaife Automatic Torque Biasing LSD, and a specially designed MacPherson strut suspension at the front called RevoKnuckle, which provides a lower <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> and kingpin offset than traditional designs while avoiding the increased weight and complexity of double wishbone and multi-link suspension setups.

5000|$|Have both driveshafts of {{the equal}} length by using an {{intermediate}} shaft (or [...] "lay shaft") {{on one side of}} the transmission. This is already implemented on most modern cars. When the driveshafts have different length and excessive torque is applied, the longer half shaft flexes more than the shorter one. However, this is a short term transient effect. To avoid fatigue failure, the amount of drive shaft torsional deflection must necessarily be small. Effects due to one wheel spinning more slowly than the other are usually negligible. Equal lengths of the driveshafts, in the case of no asymmetric suspension deflection due to roll or bump, keep the drive shaft angles equal. The main component of torque steer occurs when the torques in the driveshaft and the hub are summed vectorially, giving a resultant torque vector around the steering pivot axis (kingpin). These torques can be substantial, and in the case of shafts making equal angles to the hub shafts, will oppose one another at the steering rack, and so will cancel. These torques are strongly influenced by the position of the driveshaft universal joint (CV joint) in relation to the steering axis, however due to other requirements such as achieving a small or negative <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> an optimum solution is not generally possible with simple suspension configurations such as MacPherson strut.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{roll center}} {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} for designing a suspension. Several driving characteristics are affected significantly by the migration of the roll center during the suspension’s motion. The strut/SLA (strut/short-long-arm) suspension, which is widely used in production cars, combines the space-saving characteristics of a MacPherson strut suspension with some of the preferred handling characteristics of an SLA suspension. In this study, a front strut/SLA suspension is modeled by ADAMS/Car software. Kinematic roll analysis is then employed to investigate how the rolling characteristics change under the wheel travel and steering input. The related parameters, including the roll center height, roll camber gain, toe change, <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> and wheel track width change, are analyzed and discussed. It is found that the strut/SLA suspension clearly has a higher roll center than strut and SLA suspensions do. The variations in the roll center height under roll analysis are very different as the wheel travel displacement and steering angle are added. The results of the roll camber gain, <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> and wheel track width change are considered satisfactory. However, the toe change is too large and needs fine-tuning through a sensitivity analysis. Keywords—roll analysis, roll center height, steering, strut/SLA suspension, wheel travel I...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Mechanical engineeringThe aim of {{this thesis}} is to use manual calculations, ADAMS/Car and other CAE {{software}} to analyze the dynamic of the suspension system for Formula Student car. Manual calculations have been done to find the suitable suspension design load, such as normal, lateral and longitudinal load. The importance of software analysis is to get more accurate results {{which can be used}} to build the actual race car. The challenge is to design the 3 D model of the car, use the coordinates to build similar model in ADAMS/Car and simulate to find out the optimum suspension properties such as roll center, <b>scrub</b> <b>radius,</b> camber, caster and toe angle. Results from manual calculations reveal that highest load at front wheel can be up to 3. 1 kN, occurs during cornering. At the rear wheel highest load can be up to 3. 0 kN during acceleration. Normal load will be transferred through push-rod with safety factor taken into account. Force can be nearly as high as 3. 9 kN at the front and 7. 3 kN at the rear push-rod. The big difference is due to 35 ° angle at the front compared to 17 ° angle at the rear push-rod. Results from software simulation have shown that camber angle of 2 ° is enough to maintain good contact patch between the tires and the ground. Caster angle of 5 ° combined with 0. 5 ° toe-out will enhance the cornering ability of the car. <b>Scrub</b> <b>radius</b> has shown to be 57. 5 mm which is slightly higher than expected. When taken into account the minimum wheel travel requirement, the suspension properties changed by only few percent.

40|$|The front double {{wishbone}} suspension parameters are related as a multi-body model.

The strut position is directly related to Kingpin inclination angle and <b>scrub</b> <b>radius.</b> The increase the amount of these two parameters has an effect on steering performance in low speed and negative displacement, such as camber, caster and Kingpin inclination angles in negative displacement of wheels. Moreover, the same tests in rear {{double wishbone}} suspension show that the growth has no effect on camber, caster and Kingpin inclination angles.

40|$|This report aims {{to explain}} the full design and {{analysis}} of the front upright -the car component which links suspension wishbones and steering bar with wheels- of the TAU Racing’s 2012 car. The first step is to find the worst load case that might affect the upright. Due {{to the fact that the}} study only covers the front ones, the worst load case occurs when the car is cornering and braking at the same time (load transfer effect). Once the loads are studied, the next step is to design the upright and all the components involved in the assembly which will link the wishbones and the wheels. The first problem appears in this point because there is not enough space for all the components. A little change in the suspension geometry (increase of the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> length), solves the problem. The next step is to carry out the bearings life calculations and the finite element analysis (stress and displacements). The results are correct but, after showing to the team leaders the design, another problem appears: the assembly is heavier than expected. The solution agreed is to reduce the bearings size which affects all the assembly. Therefore, another full design is suggested. The bearings life is calculated and the finite element analysis is carried out once again. This time the results are worse: the bearings life is short but, since the competition only lasts a weekend, it is accepted; and the upright has a factor of safety lesser than expected. Hence the last step is an optimization of the upright and, as a result, the factor of safety increases above the minimum required. The overall weight is reduced in almost 20...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} the potential in utilizing the brakes on a vehicle to perform a small-overlap avoidance maneuver as a potential future active safety system and is done through both experimental and simulated testing. A strong reason for using brakes instead of steering is the availability of a powerful actuator that can be controlled by-wire while being less intrusive than a mechanically connected steering-actuated system. A 2008 SAAB 9 - 3 test vehicle is equipped with a separate electronic hydraulic brake system, enabling differential braking that can be implemented in a way to generate a yawing motion of the vehicle similar to turning the steering wheel. Simulink was used to develop a controller to autonomously perform the avoidance maneuver, requiring only an input describing the desired lateral displacement. In order to verify the functionality of the controller without experimental testing the vehicle dynamic simulation software, CarSim, was used. The developed avoidance maneuver controller was identical in both simulation and in the test vehicle to ensure proper correlation between the two. In order to evaluate and quantify the differential braking potential, the experimental tests were conducted in different conditions and levels of intervention. Parameters such as velocity, vehicle load, road friction, and lateral displacement were varied to achieve a good performance estimation. To minimize driver intrusiveness during a differential braking avoidance maneuver tests were also conducted with spacers installed between the front wheels and hubs to remove the lateral component of the <b>scrub</b> <b>radius</b> and thereby decrease the torque steer effect during braking. However the results proved that self-aligning moment is more dominant than torque steer and the installed spacers had a negligible effect on both driver intrusiveness and avoidance maneuver performance. To evaluate the potential of differential braking, the maneuvers were compared to corresponding simulated and experimental front wheel steered maneuvers to generate a reliable and quantifiable assessment of the differential braking potential. The experimental steered maneuvers were performed with a steering robot to ensure high accuracy and consistency. The results show that there is indeed potential in utilizing differential braking to perform an avoidance maneuver. At higher velocities, differential braking has the potential to perform avoidance maneuvers both at a shorter distance as well as duration compared to steering, especially for smaller lateral displacements. Differential braking decelerates the vehicle, shortening the traveled distance {{while at the same time}} increasing the duration to perform the maneuver. At lower velocities, a steered maneuver is performed at both a shorter distance as well as duration, compared to differential braking since the vehicle is not as sensitive to steering inputs and larger steering amplitudes can be applied, resulting in more effective lateral movement...|$|E
