50|$|Some early 1900s battery holders {{were often}} {{no more than}} a {{cardboard}} box with copper contacts. By the 1920s, battery holders used twin metal clips (like fuse holders) to hold the battery in place while making electrical contact. Patent no. 1439429 was granted in Dec., 1922 for an assembly with two <b>spring</b> <b>arm</b> clips, a small switch and a lamp assembly on the end of connected wires.|$|E
50|$|See drawing, right. The stackfreed {{consists}} of a stiff <b>spring</b> <b>arm</b> (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the <b>spring</b> <b>arm</b> against the cam exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring.|$|E
40|$|A {{double face}} sealing device for {{mounting}} between two surfaces {{to provide an}} airtight and fluid-tight seal between a closure member bearing one of the surfaces and a structure or housing bearing the other surface which extends around the opening or hatchway to be closed. The double face sealing device includes a plurality of sections or segments mounted {{to one of the}} surfaces, each having a main body portion, a pair of outwardly extending and diverging, cantilever, <b>spring</b> <b>arms,</b> and a pair of inwardly extending and diverging, cantilever, <b>spring</b> <b>arms,</b> an elastomeric cover on the distal, free, ends of the outwardly extending and diverging <b>spring</b> <b>arms,</b> and an elastomeric cover on the distal, free, ends of the inwardly extending and diverging <b>spring</b> <b>arms.</b> The double face sealing device has application or use in all environments requiring a seal, but is particularly useful to seal openings or hatchways between compartments of spacecraft or aircraft...|$|R
5000|$|A {{conventional}} buckle that {{is formed}} {{by a male}} buckle member (the hook end) and a female buckle member (the catch end). The male buckle member consists of a center guide rod forwardly extending from the front side with two <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> equally spaced from the center rod. The two <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> each have a retaining block that terminates at the front end. The female buckle member has a front open side and two side holes which hold and secure the two <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> of the male buckle member. This sort of buckle may be found on backpacks, belts, rifle slings, boots, {{and a host of}} other common but overlooked items. It is also known as the [...] "parachute buckle".|$|R

5000|$|A {{feature of}} the Type 11 machine gun is its {{detachable}} hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. Instead of a belt or box magazine, the Type 11 was designed to hold up to six of the same cartridge clips used on the Type 38 rifle. The five-round clips were stacked lying flat above the receiver, secured by a <b>spring</b> <b>arm,</b> and the rounds were stripped from the lowest clip one at a time, with the empty clip thrown clear and the next clip automatically falling into place as the gun was fired. The system had the advantage that any squad member could supply ammunition and that the hopper could be replenished at any time. The relatively short barrel (17.5 inches) produced excessive flash with standard ammunition (initially intended for Type 38 rifles with barrel {{more than a foot}} longer). A new loading was introduced for this reason, which had a slightly lower muzzle velocity (under 100fps), but burned much more completely in the Type 11 short barrel and produced much less flash as a result. This new round was called the 6.5×50mm Arisaka genso round, the cartons identified by a circled [...] "G".|$|E

40|$|The {{actuator}} element has a piezoelectric element or {{a heating element}} formed on four <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> (3), and bending joists firmly clamped with each other. The bending joists are bent in a direction of deflection movement of a deflection element (1). An electrode (2) of the deflection element is arranged within a housing (8). The deflection element {{and a part of}} the housing made of ceramic material comprise sintering layers, and the <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> are made of sintered ceramic layers. An aperture is formed in the housing, and the deflection element is vertically to a plane of the aperture. An independent claim is also included for a method for manufacturing a hybrid {{actuator element}}...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a leaf spring for an electromagnetic actuator and {{to such an}} electromagnetic actuator. The leaf spring {{is formed as a}} whole from a disc of plate-shaped, resilient material. The leaf spring comprises a central fastening part, an outer fastening part extending therearound and at least two leaf <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> extending between the central and outer fastening part. Viewed from the central fastening part, the leaf <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> (23) have a first zone (24) originating from the central fastening part (21), in which they extend as far as the outer part (22) but for a first clearance (R). The first zone (24) is followed by a second zone (25) in which, without contacting the outer fastening part (22) and proceeding in tangential direction, they bend back as far as the central fastening part (21) but for a second clearance (T).; A third zone (26) follows the second zone (25), in which the <b>spring</b> leaf <b>arms</b> (23) extend towards the outer fastening part (22) to merge therein...|$|R

50|$|Thomas Spring Esquire (died 1440) of Lavenham {{was granted}} a {{coat-of-arms}} in the first reign of Henry VI, thus elevating his family {{into the ranks of}} armigerous society. As the family moved from the merchant class to the minor nobility, the coat-of-arms was employed to convey the newly bestowed rank of the family. As such it is prominently displayed, alongside the arms of the Earl of Oxford, over thirty times on Lavenham church. Examples of the <b>Spring</b> <b>arms,</b> often quartered with other local noble families, can be found across Suffolk. The coat-of-arms is now borne by Thomas Spring's descendants.|$|R

5000|$|Occupying 10.5 inches (6U) {{of space}} in a {{standard}} 19-inch rack, the drive was competitive at the time. The cartridge contained a single, 14" [...] aluminum platter coated with iron oxide in an epoxy binder. The two ferrite and ceramic read/write heads were pressed towards the disk by <b>spring</b> <b>arms,</b> floating on an air bearing maintained by {{the rotation of the}} disk. They were positioned by a voice coil actuator using a linear optical encoder for feedback. The track density was 100 tracks-per-inch. The bit density along the track was about 2200 bits-per-inch. Discrete electronics computed the velocity profile for seeks commanded by the controller. An absolute filter (HEPA filter) provided pressurized air to the cartridge, excluding most contaminants that would otherwise cause head crashes.|$|R
