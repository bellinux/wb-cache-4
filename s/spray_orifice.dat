40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Continued success in {{treatment}} of asthma and COPD requires {{development of new}} formulations, which may alter spray characteristics and atomisation quality of atomiser devices such as pMDI. Fundamental understanding of the underlying physical phenomena and the dynamic nature of pMDI aerosol plumes is essential to maintain pMDI device atomisation quality. In this paper, we describe a simulation of pMDI aerosol generation and plume development using a model of two-phase flow and atomisation of HFA 134 /ethanol formulation. The model is implemented within a CFD simulation to study the dynamic aerosol development and predict spray velocity and temperature. The CFD result shows plume velocity slows down over a relatively short distance and droplet temperature settles at a steady value of 291 K approximately {{at a distance of}} 30 mm from the <b>spray</b> <b>orifice.</b> This means that droplets reach their final size before reaching the exit of the mouthpiece...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{fabrication}} and analytical evaluation {{of two new}} electrospray emitters utilized for mass spectrometry analysis is presented. The emitters {{are based on a}} new concept, where the <b>spray</b> <b>orifice</b> can be varied in size. The thesis is based on two papers. All present-day nanoelectrospray emitters have fixed dimensions. The range of the applicable flow rate for such an emitter is therefore rather limited and exchange of emitters may be necessary from one experiment to another. Optimization of the signal of the analyte ions is also limited to adjustments of the applied voltage or the distance between the emitter and the mass spectrometer inlet. Furthermore, clogging can occur in emitters with fixed dimensions of narrow orifice sizes. In this thesis, electrospray emitters with a variable size of the <b>spray</b> <b>orifice</b> are proposed. An open gap between two thin substrates is filled with sample solution via a liquid bridge from a capillary. Electrospray is generated at the end point of the gap, which can be varied in width. In Paper I, electrospray emitters fabricated in polyethylene terephthalate have been evaluated. Triangular tips are manually cut from the polymer film. The tips are mounted to form a gap between the edges of the tips. The gap wall surfaces are subjected to a hydrophilic surface treatment to increase the wetting of the gap walls. In Paper II, silicon electrospray chips with high precision are fabricated and evaluated. A thin beam, elevated from the bulk silicon chip is fabricated by means of deep reactive ion etching. The top surfaces of the beams of two chips act as a sample conduit when mounted in the electrospray setup. An anisotropic etching step with KOH of the intersecting crystal planes results in a very sharp spray point. The emitters were given a hydrophobic surface treatment except for the hydrophilic gap walls. For both emitter designs, the gap width has been adjusted during the experiments without any interruption of the electrospray. For a continuously applied peptide mixture, a shift towards higher charge states and increased signal to noise ratios could be observed when decreasing the gap width. The limit of detection has been investigated and the silicon chips have been interfaced with capillary electrophoresis. QC 2010110...|$|E

The reactor consists of two concentric cylinders, the inner cylinder having a series of orifices which act {{in a manner similar}} to a venturi.

From the visualizations, the near <b>orifice</b> <b>spray</b> structures are classified into three modes: discrete bubble explosions, continuous bubble explosions and annular conical spray. The breakup of the spray is quantified {{in terms of the}} mean bubble bursting distance from the orifice. The parametric study indicates that the mean bubble bursting distance mainly depends on airflow rate, jet diameter and mixture velocity. It is also observed that the jet diameter has a dominant effect on the bubble bursting distance when compared to mixture velocity at a given airflow rate. The mean bubble bursting distance is shown to be governed by a nondimensional two-phase flow number consisting of all the aforementioned parameters. The location of bubble bursting is found to be highly unsteady spatially, which is influenced by flow dynamics inside the injector. It is proposed that this unsteadiness in jet breakup length is a consequence of varying degree of bubble expansion caused due to the intermittent occurrence of single phase and two-phase flow inside the orifice...|$|R

The mechanism responsible for droplet generation from bulk propellant liquid is poorly understood, mainly because the small length scales and short time scales {{make it difficult to}} characterise transient spray formation events.

40|$|Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) are {{the most}} widely-prescribed inhaler devices for {{therapeutic}} aerosol delivery {{in the treatment of}} lung diseases. In spite of its undoubted therapeutic and commercial success, the propellant flow mechanics and aerosol formation by the pMDIs is poorly understood. The process involves a complex transient cavitating turbulent fluid that flashes into rapidly evaporating droplets, but details remain elusive, partly due to the difficulty of performing experiments at the small length scales and short time scales. The objective of the current work is the development of a numerical model to predict the internal flow conditions (pressure, temperature, velocity, void fraction, quality, etc.) and provide deeper insight into the atomization process and fluid mechanics involved in the twin-orifice of pMDIs. The main focus is propellant metastability, which has been identified by several past authors as a key element that is missing in accounts of pMDI performance. First the flashing propellant flow through single orifice systems (both long and short capillary tubes) was investigated using three different models : homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM), delayed equilibrium model (DEM) and improved delayed equilibrium model (IDEM). Both, the pure propellants and the propellant mixtures were used as working fluid. The numerical results were compared with the experimental data. For long capillary tubes the three models gave reasonable predictions, but the present results showed that DEM predicts the mass flow rate well for pure propellants and IDEM predicts the mass flow rate well for propellant mixtures. For short capillary tubes, the present results showed that DEM predicts the mass flow rate and pressure distribution along the short tube better compared to HEM and IDEM. The geometry of the twin-orifice system of a pMDI is complex and involves several singularities (sudden enlargements and sudden contractions). Various assumptions were made to evaluate their effect on the vaporisation process and to evaluate the flow variables after the shock at the exit of the <b>spray</b> <b>orifice</b> when the flow is choked. Also, three different propellant flow regimes were explored at the inlet of the valve orifice. A specific combination of assumptions, which offers good agreement with the experimental data was selected for further computations. Numerical investigations were carried out using delayed equilibrium model (DEM) with these new assumptions to validate the two-phase metastable flow through twin-orifice systems with continuous flows of various propellants studied previously by Fletcher (1975) and Clark (1991). A new correlation was developed for the coefficient in the relaxation equation. Along with this correlation a constant coefficient was used in the relaxation equation to model the metastability. Both the coefficients showed good agreement against the Fletcher's experimental data. The comparison with the Clark s experimental data showed that the new correlation coefficient predicted the mass flow rate well in compare to that of the constant coefficient, but over predicted the expansion chamber pressure. The DEM with both the coefficients for continuous discharge flows were applied to investigate the quasi-steady flashing flow inside the metered discharge flows at various time instants. The DEM results were compared with the Clark s metered discharge experimental data and the well established homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM). The comparison between the HEM and DEM with Clark s (1991) experimental data showed that the DEM predicted the mass flow well in compare to that of HEM. Moreover, both the models underpredicted the expansion chamber pressure and temperature. The findings of the present thesis have given {{a better understanding of the}} role played by the propellant metastability inside the twin-orifice system of pMDIs.

Diesel engine injectors and numerous industrial sprays operate in regimes where cavitation is present and can dominate the overall {{characteristics of the}} internal flow field. ^ A test facility is constructed to conduct experiments and flow visualization in a three-dimensional circular orifice at pressures up to 200 MPa (30, 000 psi). The diameters of orifices used in this test are 0. 2 mm to 0. 4 mm and {{are similar to the}} real size of Diesel fuel injectors. Two types of orifices are studied, one with the hole normal to the surface and the other with the hole at an angle. The tilted orifices are used to simulate the real working geometry of Diesel engine injectors. An imaging system is used to obtain high resolution photographs of cavitation in these orifices.

The mass flow for different orifices has also been measured at different injection pressures. ^ Present computer models cannot completely predict details such as unsteady three-dimensional flows with phase changes and turbulence.

Cavitation images, droplet size measurements, discharge coefficient, unsteadiness measurements and CFD are incorporated {{to find out}} the causes resulting in small droplets. ^ A flow rig delivering pressurized water flow to an orifice is constructed. A secondary flow is introduced through an annular slot in the orifice wall to control the cavitation, and thus the spray, at pressures up to 550 kPa driving pressure difference. The orifice used is nominally axisymmetric with a diameter 0. 81 mm and length 5. 08 mm. Two types of orifices are made. Orifice 1 has the slot located 0. 81 mm below the orifice inlet, and the slot orientation is angled at 67. 5 ° to the hole axis. Orifice 2 has the slot situated at 0. 41 mm below the orifice inlet, and the slot orientation is angled at 15 ° to the hole axis. Devices, including a CCD camera, a particle-sizer and a He-Ne laser system, were utilized for flow visualization and relevant measurements. The cavitation and spray were photographed with a high resolution CCD digital camera. Droplet size measurements were made with a laser diffraction particle-sizer. Moreover, the cavitation frequencies were explored using a He-Ne laser along with a photodiode and an oscilloscope. ^ CFD codes developed by Chen and Heister were used to model the internal flow. 54 cases were run, including 5 slot locations, 5 slot orientations, and 4 secondary flow rates. Compared with the experimental results, the agreement between CFD and experimental results is good except for hydraulic flip. Generally the high pressure region upstream of the slot, the large high pressure variation over time, and the long cavitation length are the favorable conditions for creating small droplets. ^ The CFD together with experimental measurements correlate the flow structures with droplet sizes. Understanding the relationship between flow structures and droplet sizes can help to design orifices to create desired droplet sizes. ...|$|E

In {{the first part of}} this thesis, a new emitter, based on the generation of electrospray from a <b>spray</b> <b>orifice</b> with variable size, is presented. Electrospray is generated from an open gap between the edges of two individually mounted, pointed tips. The fabrication and evaluation of two different types of such emitters is presented; an ESI emitter fabricated from polyethylene terephtalate (Paper I), and a high-precision silicon device (Paper II). Both emitters were surface-treated in a selective way for an improved wetting of the gap and to confine the sample solution into the gap. In the second part of this thesis, different methods for improved sensitivity of nESI-MS analysis have been developed. In Paper III, a method for nESI-MS analysis from discrete sample volumes down to 1. 5 nL is presented, using commercially available nESI needles. When analyzing attomole amounts of analyte in such a small volume of sample, an increased sensitivity was obtained, compared to when analyzing equal amounts in conventional nESI-MS analysis. To be able to analyze smaller sample volumes, needles with a narrower orifice and a higher flow resistance were needed. This triggered the development of a new method for fabrication of fused silica nESI needles (Paper IV). The fabrication is based on melting of a fused silica capillary by means of a rotating plasma, prior to pulling the capillary into a fine tip. Using the described technique, needles with sub-micrometer orifices could be fabricated. Such needles enabled the analysis of sample volumes down to 275 pL, and a further improvement of the sensitivity was obtained. In a final project (Paper V), nESI-MS was used to study the aggregation behavior of Aβ peptides, related to Alzheimer’s disease. An immunoprecipitation followed by nESI-MS was employed. This technique was also utilized to study the selectivity of the antibodies utilized. QC 2010111...|$|E

WolfTraditionally, growers spray uniform {{application}} of pesticides over the target area regardless of variations in pest infestations. In recent years, variable rate application (VRA) technologies {{have made it possible}} to apply pesticides in variable rates across the field. In pesticide application, nozzles play a vital role. In general, pesticides are applied using conventional nozzles. Most conventional nozzles vary flow rates only over a 2 : 1 range when operated within the recommended pressure range due to a fixed <b>spray</b> <b>orifice.</b> Conventional nozzles vary droplet sizes tremendously when there are speed and application rate changes which results in inefficient application. Conventional nozzles have limitations when used for VRA. A new nozzle called Varitarget nozzle (U. S. Patent No. 5, 134, 961) was developed and marketed by Bui, (2005) to overcome the limitations with conventional nozzles. Varitarget nozzles have a variable orifice that changes in size in response to pressure changes, allowing varying flow rates with a minimal change in droplet size. Laboratory tests and field tests were conducted to study the performance of Varitarget nozzle. Varitarget black/blue and clear/yellow caps were evaluated in this study. Lab studies were conducted to measure Varitarget characteristics compared to conventional nozzles. The flow rate ratios of Varitarget nozzle black and clear caps were 12 : 1 and 10 : 1 while the conventional nozzles produced flow rate ratios ranging from only 3 : 1 to 4 : 1. The measured flow rate of Varitarget nozzle black and clear caps was similar to that published by the manufacturer up to 40 psi and varied higher after 40 psi. Both Varitarget black and clear cap nozzle was within the standard VMD requirements until 40 psi and showed increasing trend while the conventional nozzles matched the standard VMD requirements. The VT black and clear cap nozzles showed better coverage at higher pressures when compared to conventional nozzles. CV values for VT black and clear capped nozzles were less than 10 % which indicates capability of good uniform distribution. Spray angle of 110 degrees for VT black and clear capped nozzles was consistent over a range of pressures. Field studies were also conducted to compare the Varitarget to conventional nozzles.

40|$|This thesis has {{provided}} {{some insight into}} spray droplet formation after atomization of a drug formulation from a nasal spray device. A commercial nasal spray device was tested under a constant flow {{in order to better}} understand its spray formation and characteristics. External characteristics such as the spray cone angle define the range of spray that exits from the device, while the internal characteristics such as the droplet size distribution help to determine the probability of inertial impaction within the nasal cavity. The experimental method makes use of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle/droplet image analysis (PDIA) to obtain droplet diameters and spray velocities in different spray regions. Image processing techniques were applied to enhance visualization and a droplet concentration field. It was shown that there is some variation in the droplet diameters with respect to its radial and axial position from the <b>spray</b> <b>orifice.</b> Empirical curve fits for the particle size distribution were formulated to allow easier adoption of the data into CFD models. The dimensions of the external spray were shown to be much larger in comparison with the dimensions of a nasal cavity, which means that only a narrow portion of the spray will fit within the narrow cross sections of the nasal cavity. The results of another unsteady spray experiment using an in-house experimental test station to simulate the hand operations by patients have showed that there are three main phases of spray development (pre-stable, stable, and post-stable) that can be correlated by examining the spray width. A comparison with a human nasal cavity is made to put into perspective the dimensions and geometry that the spray atomization produces. The spray droplet size was analysed under different back pressures to mimic the drug delivery by adult and paediatric patients. It was found that the spray droplet size from the device operated by adult has smaller averaged Sauter mean diameter (SMD) which implies better drug absorption in nasal cavity. Also, the spray cone has less variation during stable stage. By prolonging the duration of this stage can improve the drug delivery performance and stability. The outcome has extended the current existing set of data to contribute toward a better understanding in nasal spray drug delivery. The numerical part of this thesis has presented the fine-tuned spray model constants of the linear instability sheet atomization model (LISA) and evaluated its performance for low pressure application. Some parameters that were evaluated include the dispersion angle and the liquid sheet constant that influences the droplet size distribution and dispersion. The simulation results were evaluated against experimental data that has been previously performed. It was found that the LISA model provided good comparisons when a dispersion angle of 3 ◦ and a liquid sheet constant of 1 were used.

Sprays from water and Freon- 11 jets were analyzed for drop sizes, drop velocities, and spray patterns. The breakup mechanism was analyzed and data presented to show some of the controlling factors. A critical superheat was found, above which the jet of liquid is shattered by rapid bubble growth within it. The bubble-growth rate was correlated with the Weber number, and a critical value of the Weber number was found to be 12. 5 for low-viscosity liquids. The mean drop size was also correlated with Weber number and degree of superheat. The <b>spray</b> from rough <b>orifices</b> and sharp-edged orifices was compared with sprays produced from cold liquids by other techniques and was found to be comparable in all respects except temperature...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of tests made with the pintle-type injection nozzles, one having a pintle angle of 8 degrees, the other a pintle angle of 30 degrees. The fuel was injected into a glass-windowed pressure chamber and the spray photographed by means of the N. A. C. A. spray photography apparatus. Curves are presented that give the penetration of the spray tips when fuel oil is injected by pressures of 1, 500 to 4, 000 pounds per square inch into air at room temperature and densities of 11 to 18 atmospheres. High-speed spark photographs show the appearance of the sprays in air at a density of 18 atmospheres. The results indicate that the pintle angles have little effect {{on the size of the}} spray cone angle, which is about the same as that of sprays from plain round hole orifices. The penetration of the spray from the nozzle with an 8 degree pintle is slightly higher than that of the spray from the nozzle with a 30 degree pintle. The penetration of the sprays from the pintle nozzles, for comparable conditions of injection pressure and air density, is about the same as that of <b>sprays</b> from round-hole <b>orifices.</b> Increase in air density decreases the penetration in about the same ratio with all the injection pressures...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} process of sub kilogram class missile interceptors will greatly {{benefit from the}} advancement of power MEMS based propulsion systems. The envisioned concept and technology for this class of interceptors are a package of 20 – 40 miniature kill vehicles (MKVs) each {{the size of a}} softball and weighing less than two kilograms. Suggested MKV design could be utilized with liquid bipropellant propulsion systems because of higher effectiveness, better range, maneuverability, and kill performance. Successful miniaturization of liquid propulsion components demands a more complete and broader understanding of micro-fluid dynamics and micro-combustion phenomena associated with the micro-injector design. ^ This thesis numerically investigated novel coaxial micro-rocket injector phenomena with changing physical variables such as inlet pressure changes, different orifice size and number by fixing the injector area, and various impinging angles. Non-turbulent streamlines (particles paths) and mixing behavior have been studied through the use of STAR-CD. Similar streamline behavior was observed when inlet pressure varied, however orifice configuration highly influenced the streamline behavior. The diversified streamlines occurring at the end of combustion chamber were further investigated where it was observed that diversification increased with smaller orifice diameter. The penetration length of both oxygen and RP 1 increased greatly when the inlet pressure rose, where oxygen always traveled further than RP 1 in the chamber. Conversely, by increasing the number of <b>orifices,</b> <b>spray</b> penetration decreased for both RP 1 and oxygen in the chamber. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{actual signal}} {{recorded}} with an analytical instrument {{is not always}} a true reflection of the analysed sample. In this thesis a further insight of the atmospheric pressure ionisation processes electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) has been endeavoured, to provide a deeper understanding of and ways to minimize this bias. A response model for ESI has been modified and used to study the influence of solvent composition on the observed mass spectrometric signal. The response model divides the response into an analyte partitioning coefficient and an instrumental response factor. A number of experimental parameters influencing the response were investigated including spray position relative to the <b>orifice,</b> <b>spray</b> potential, nebulizer and curtain gas flow rates, ionic strength and organic content of the sprayed solution. The history of the generated droplets turned out to be of significant importance to both the partitioning coefficients and the instrumental response factor. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} total ionic strength and not only the electrolyte concentration will influence the instrumental response factor. In addition, based on the importance of hydrophobicity and electrophoretic mobility, a model was proposed for the ion distribution within the electrosprayed droplets. The coupling of an electrochemical (EC) cell to a mass spectrometric (MS) system has been evaluated. The coupling of the EC cell to the MS was made to decouple the cell from the high voltage circuit of the ESI. The feasibility for analyte ionisation, sample pre-concentration and solvent exchange as well as studying redox reaction products was shown...|$|R
40|$|Droplet size, {{which is}} {{affected}} by nozzle type, nozzle setups and operation, and spray solution, {{is one of the}} most critical factors influencing spray performance, environment pollution, food safety, and must be considered as part of any application scenario. Characterizing spray nozzles can be a timely and expensive proposition if the entire operational space (all combinations of <b>spray</b> pressure and <b>orifice</b> size, what influence flow rate) is to be evaluated. This research proposes a structured, experimental design that allows for the development of computational models for droplet size based on any combination of a nozzle’s potential operational settings. The developed droplet size determination model can be used as Decision Support System (DSS) for precise selection of sprayer working parameters to adapt to local field scenarios. Five nozzle types (designs) were evaluated across their complete range of orifice size (flow rate*) and spray pressures using a response surface experimental design. Several of the models showed high level fits of the modeled to the measured data while several did not as a result of the lack of significant effect from either orifice size (flow rate*) or spray pressure. The computational models were integrated into a spreadsheet based user interface for ease of use. The proposed experimental design provides for efficient nozzle evaluations and development of computational models that allow for the determination of droplet size spectrum and spraying classification for any combination of a given nozzle’s operating settings. The proposed DSS will allow for the ready assessment and modification of a sprayers performance based on the operational settings, to ensure the application is made following recommendations in plant protection products (PPP) labels...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that cross flow fuel {{injection}} is widely used in gas turbine engines combustors, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanisms that control the spray breakup within the cross flow. In spite of a lot of work done in this field, very few studies have been carried out under conditions typical of aerospace applications. This thesis describes a series of experiments carried out to simulate these conditions in order to characterize the formation of spray within a high speed, high pressure and high temperature cross flow close to conditions typical of aerospace applications. 	 Fuel spray characteristics were studied for Jet-A fuel injected into a crossflow (M= 0. 2 and M= 0. 35) of preheated (T= 555 K) air at a chamber pressure of 4 atm. It was seen that larger droplets could be found in the periphery of the spray while smaller droplets could be found closer to the injection plate. In most cases, the droplet velocities were seen to lag the incoming air flow velocity by 20 - 40 % and a spray hat structure was created by the jet in crossflow near the injection wall most likely caused by vortex flow created around the liquid column (jet). 	The influence of Weber number was then studied. It was seen that shear breakup mechanism dominates at We greater than about 100. Droplets diameters were found to be in the range of 15 - 30 microns for higher values of We, while larger droplets (100 - 200 microns) were observed at Weber number of 33. The initial sharp-edged injector was then replaced by a smooth-edged injector having. Spray characteristics from the two injectors were compared. The spray produced by the smooth countersunk injector penetrated further into the test section away from the injector orifice by approximately 2 mm. This injector also produced droplets with a significantly smaller mean diameter (D 10). The average droplet velocities in the vertical direction deviated from the incoming air flow velocity to a lesser degree using the countersunk injector. Meanwhile, droplets from this injector had a higher average velocity in the direction of fuel injection between the core of the <b>spray</b> and the <b>orifice</b> wall. M. S.

40|$|Many {{workers have}} {{observed}} that under standardized conditions {{only part of the}} fat present in spray-dried milk can be extracted by fat solvents. This fat is usually called 'free fat' and has been related to other powder properties which are of practical importance. Contradictory results obtained by different workers have raised doubts concerning the practical significance of free fat. Moreover the explanation generally accepted in the literature, that free fat is 'unprotected fat' mainly situated on the particle surface, is not altogether satisfactory. An experimental study of the properties of free fat and its relation to powder properties of practical significance was carried out. The results of this study were described in a series of papers in Netherlands Milk and Dairy Journal and are collected in this thesis. In Chapter 1 a general outline of the problem and a brief review of the literature are given. It seemed desirable to investigate the influence of the experimental conditions during the determination of the free-fat content because earlier authors used widely varying conditions. In Chapter 2 it is shown that the extraction time and temperature influence considerably the amount of fat which is extracted but its influence may depend strongly on the powder under investigation. Because it was not clear which experimental conditions yielded free-fat contents relevant to other powder properties, two methods were usually applied, differing widely in contact time and extraction temperature. Particle size is of major importance for the physical properties of most powders. In Chapter 3 two methods are described to determine the mean particle size and the particle size distribution of spray powders, viz gas permeametry and microscopic counting, respectively. With these methods the influence of certain process parameters on particle size and the influence of particle size on the free-fat content of spray-dried whole milk were studied. It is shown that the mean particle size increases inversely with Vp, p being the <b>spray</b> pressure. <b>Orifice</b> diameters appeared to be of minor importance. Increasing the dry-solids content of the concentrated milk in the range of 30 - 45 % resulted in a reduction of the number of small particles. No influence of the particle size on the fat content and the moisture content was observed, but both the mean particle density and the free-fat content strongly increase with decreasing particle size. It is suggested that the influence of some processing parameters on the free-fat content of spray-dried whole milk may be attributed to their influence on particle size. With 20 powders, widely differing in free-fat content, the possible relationship between free fat and other powder properties of practical importance is investigated (Chapter 4). From the results the following conclusions were drawn: 1. There is no influence of the free fat on the development of oxidation flavour during 6 months' storage at 30 °C in the presence of air; 2. The solubility of spray-dried whole milk is usually better if its free-fat content is higher, but probably there is no causal relationship between the two quantities; 3. Below a free-fat content of 20 % (of the fat) there is a tendency for the dispersibility to increase with decreasing amount of free fat. This is not the case above 20 % free fat. Because both particle size and homogenization may effect dispersibility as well as free-fat content, no causal influence of free fat on dispersibility could be observed; 4. Neither cream rising nor foam formation during reconstitution is materially influenced by the amount of free fat in the powder. Churning of the butterfat by vigorously stirring during reconstitution was observed only with powders containing much free fat, prepared from unhomogenized concentrated milk. No quantitative correlation was observed between the amount of churned butterfat and the free-fat content of the powder. Chapter 5 treats the stickiness of spray-dried whole milk and a simple test to determine the cohesion of such powders is described. Good agreement between this cohesion and the visual observation of stickiness was found. It is shown that the cohesion of spray-dried whole milk increases with decreasing particle size as expected. Unexpected, however, was that the cohesion is independent of fat content in the range of 20 - 45 % fat, and of free-fat content. In spite of this, experiments at different temperatures showed that the milk fat {{is an important factor in}} the cohesion, and it is suggested that only a small amount of surface fat on the particles is already sufficient to give cohesion to whole milk powders. Probably fat contents higher than 20 % result in more surface fat, but this does not increase the cohesion. It is shown that an increase of moisture content decreases the cohesion in the range of 2 - 4 %, but a strong rise of cohesion occurs in the range of 4 - 7 %, probably due to increased plasticity of the powder particles and to lactose crystallization. In Chapter 6 it is shown that the free-fat content decreases considerably when the moisture content of spray-dried whole milk is increased in the range of 2 - 8 %. The effect appeared to be reversible. It is suggested that part of the fat is extracted from the milk powder particles via capillary pores or cracks, which close when the powder absorbs water. With a scanning electron microscope photographs were taken of dried milk particles without water being used, this to avoid artefacts. The method is described in Chapter 7 and a few photographs are shown. From measurement of the penetration speed of nitrogen into the powder particle porosity factor was calculated (Chapter 8). There appeared to be a strong correlation (r = 0. 94) between the free-fat content and this particle porosity. From this observation it is concluded that the particle porosity is of major importance for the extraction of fat from milk powders. Photographs taken with a scanning electron microscope show cracks and pores in particles with high porosity, whereas in less porous powder particles only surface folds and occasional cracks could be observed. Possible explanations of particle porosity are discussed. Chapter 9 contains the fat globule size distributions in concentrated milk and in milk reconstituted from whole milk spray powders with various free-fat contents as determined with a Coulter counter. It is concluded that the spraying of concentrated milk causes a considerable size reduction of the fat globules. Some coalescence of fat globules takes place during drying or during reconstitution of milk from the powders. A rather good relationship is obtained between the free-fat content of the powders and the percentage of fat present as fat globules> 2 μm in milk reconstituted from the same powders. The phenomenon that only part of the fat in spray-dried whole milk can be extracted by fat solvents is usually explained by the assumption that this 'free fat' is unprotected surface fat. In Chapter 10 it is shown that surface fat in such powders is dissolved in a few seconds by organic solvents. The amount of fat extracted by the majority of the extraction methods with much longer contact times applied until now, consists for only a minor part of surface fat in many cases. Experiments with spray powders consisting only of lactose and anhydrous butterfat show that fat globules without protein membranes can be protected by the amorphous lactose against fat solvents. A new model for the occurrence of free fat in spray-dried whole milk, based on the accessibility of the fat in the powder particles, is proposed. The relationship between fat content and free-fat content of spray-dried whole milk is investigated, and the curves which were obtained are explained with the new model. Finally the practical consequences of the model are discussed and compared with the results of earlier experiments. The conclusion is that only the surface fat is relevant because of its possible influence on dispersibility and the cohesion of spray-dried whole milk. This fat can be determined approximately with a very short extraction (e. g. 10 seconds) at room temperature...|$|R
