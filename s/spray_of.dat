5|$|Via a live news report, a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging her head against the car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> blood across the window.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} randomized complete block design with six treatments and four replications at loamy soil of Regional Agriculture Research Station, Tarahara, Nepal during 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99 seasons {{to find out the}} effect of bioagent Trichoderma viride as compared to fungicide Bavistin (carbendazim) for management of Botrytis gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) of chickpea (Cicer arietinum). Treatments were use <b>of</b> water <b>spray</b> (check), three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> T. viride (10 7 - 108 spores/ml <b>of</b> water), three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin @ 0. 2 %, three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin @ 0. 1 % + T. viride, two <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin @ 0. 2 % and two <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> T. viride. The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was the least (193. 6) with three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin (0. 2 %) followed by two <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin (0. 2 %) and three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin + T. viride (216. 9). The highest mean grain yield of 267. 3 kg ha- 1 was produced by three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin + T. viride followed by three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin. Three <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> T. viride was inferior to three and two <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> Bavistin but it was at par with two <b>sprays</b> <b>of</b> T. viride with respect to grain yield production and reduction of Botrytis gray mold severity. When AUDPC was regressed against grain yield, a negative correlation was obtained between the disease and the grain yield. The correlation coefficients for the disease and yields during 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99 respectively were- 0. 583, and- 0. 490...|$|R

5|$|Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn), Sergeant Apone's second-in-command, {{takes over}} when Apone {{and most of}} the Colonial Marines are {{captured}} by the Aliens and commanding officer Lieutenant Gorman is incapacitated. Hicks looks for options for holding out with the survivors of the Hadley's Hope colony until aid arrives, and he and Ripley bond when he teaches her to use a pulse rifle. He is one of four survivors of the military mission. As the survivors escape, Hicks is injured when a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> acid blood from an Alien hits his chest and face. He is apparently killed during the crash of the Sulaco in Alien 3, after which a body impaled on a broken support brace is found in his cryochamber. In the video game , Hicks is revealed to be alive and was actually kidnapped by mercenaries working for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. His body is replaced by an anonymous victim to cover up the kidnapping, and he is rescued by Colonial Marines.|$|E
25|$|A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a {{multistage}} evaporative cooler. The air {{is passed}} through a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, {{and that can be}} done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50°F (28°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} {{a method for}} the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into plant cells. In vitro synthesized siRNAs that were designed to target the coding region of a GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) transgene were applied by various methods onto GFP-expressing transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants to trigger RNA silencing. In contrast to mere siRNA applications, including spraying, syringe injection and infiltration of siRNAs that all failed to induce RNA silencing, high pressure <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> siRNAs resulted in efficient local and systemic silencing of the GFP transgene, with comparable efficiency as was achieved with biolistic siRNA introduction. High-pressure <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> siRNAs with sizes of 21, 22 and 24 nucleotides (nt) led to local GFP silencing. Small RNA deep sequencing revealed that no shearing of siRNAs was detectable by high-pressure spraying. Systemic silencing was basically detected upon <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> 22 nt siRNAs. Local and systemic silencing developed faster and more extensively upon targeting the apical meristem than <b>spraying</b> <b>of</b> mature leaves...|$|R
25|$|The rocket flew {{across the}} flight deck, {{striking}} a wing-mounted external fuel tank on an A-4E Skyhawk awaiting launch, aircraft No. 405 from VA-46, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Fred D.

The Zuni rocket's warhead safety mechanism prevented it from detonating, but the impact tore the tank off the wing and ignited the resulting <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> escaping JP-5 fuel, causing an instantaneous conflagration. Within seconds, other external fuel tanks on White's aircraft overheated and ruptured, releasing more jet fuel {{to feed the}} flames, which began spreading along the flight deck.|$|E
25|$|To {{convince}} Hitchcock {{that the}} scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting {{of the final}} shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh’s stand-in Marli Renfro to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor George Tomasini, he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> blood on the chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{also ordered}} the storm {{door at the}} {{entrance}} to the White House beneath the North Portico removed so that the coffin would pass more easily through the portal. The door was removed, but the frame (embedded in concrete) was not. Black crepe was tacked around the door to cover it. Shriver had the White House driveway lit with small firepots. Kennedy's body arrived at the White House at about 4:30 A.M. The military casket team moved the coffin into the East Room and set it on the catafalque.

25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans the lenses with a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> windshield washer fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.|$|E
25|$|The queen spent {{heavily on}} fashion, luxuries and gambling, though {{the country was}} facing a grave {{financial}} crisis and the population was suffering. Rose Bertin created dresses for her, and hair styles such as poufs, up to three feet (90cm) high, and the panache (a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> feather plumes). She and her court also adopted the English fashion of dresses made of indienne (a material banned in France from 1686 until 1759), percale and muslin. By {{the time of the}} Flour War of 1775, a series of riots against the high price of flour and bread, her reputation among the general public was no better than that of the favorites of the previous kings. In fact, many in the country were beginning to blame her for the degrading economic situation, suggesting the country’s inability to pay off its debt was the result of her wasting the crown’s money. Through correspondence, Marie Antoinette's mother, Maria Theresa, expressed concern over her daughter's spending habits, citing the civil unrest it was beginning to cause.|$|E
25|$|Public {{holidays}} on 15 and 16 August: August 15th is {{the patron}} saint's day of Terre-de-Haut Island (Our-Lady-of-Assumption). The Mayor, his municipal council and officials are dressed {{as much as}} the boats in the bay. There are artillery salvos, drum majorettes, a torchlight procession, and bugle reveille. The island celebrates the 15 August 1666 victory of the French fleet against the English occupying the archipelago. A procession with the status of Our-Lady-of-Assumption is led through the streets of the island before ending on the beach where the priest throws a <b>spray</b> <b>of</b> flowers to the sea. It is the signal for the regatta of saintoise sail (traditional boat of les Saintes). A ship of the French Navy is present for the occasion, particularly la Fougeuse a Patrol boat, of which Terre-de-Haut island is the godmother. Officers and sailors wearing their bachis (Seaman (Matelot) and Quartermaster (Quartier-maître) hat in French navy characterised by a small red pom-pom) walk on the island. In the past, French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (R97) attended the festivities.|$|E
