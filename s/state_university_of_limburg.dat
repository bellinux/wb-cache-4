50|$|The newly {{established}} school {{chose not to}} await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education {{in the form of}} problem-based learning.

The advantage of a topological canonization is that it contains precisely the information one needs if one is only interested in topological properties of the spatial data. In this paper we represent semi-algebraic sets using plane graph structures. Canonizations are represented by plane graph structures as well (the so-called canonical structures). We discuss the basic properties of canonical structures and of canonization. We then present a met [...] ...|$|R
