40|$|AbstractThe {{promotion}} of domestic consumption in China will gradually ramp up {{the small and}} medium-sized port container industry, and this will require greater port efficiency and an updated development strategy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate operational and productivity efficiency change in 21 coastal small and medium sized-port container terminals in China. The first step was carried out using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist productivity index (MPI), and the factors affecting productivity efficiency change were then estimated and quantified using Tobit regression. The empirical results indicate that the most efficient terminals are the Rizhao and Lianyungang port terminals. Furthermore, the terminals that hold a share of more than 50 % of Chinese <b>state-owned</b> <b>shipping</b> line show the highest increase in productivity efficiency change. Lastly, the results indicate manpower structure; Chinese <b>state-owned</b> <b>shipping</b> line shareholding; registered capital; and shipping routes have positive effect and the factor, number of terminal operators, have a negative correlation...|$|R

25|$|The <b>state-owned</b> <b>shipping</b> company Arctia Shipping Oy and its {{predecessors}} have been heavily criticized {{over the years}} for the financial losses from the offshore business. Due to design compromises the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers are unable to compete with purpose-built platform supply vessels — the open-water performance of the spoon-shaped bow is very poor due to slamming. As a result, the ships have been left without contracts and have spent {{long periods of time}} in foreign ports even during the Finnish winter navigation season, forcing the Finnish Government to hire icebreakers from the commercial market to keep the ports open. However, according to an internal memorandum of the Finnish Maritime Administration, the offshore business, while not profitable, has covered {{at least some of the}} expenses from icebreaking during the winter seasons in the late 1990s, resulting in lower overall operating costs for the multipurpose icebreakers than for traditional icebreakers.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, the Finnish Maritime Administration {{announced}} that it would start planning a replacement for Voima. However, the new icebreaker that was expected to cost 100-120 million euro {{was not included in the}} budget proposals until 2012. While Arctia <b>Shipping,</b> the <b>state-owned</b> <b>shipping</b> company that operates the Finnish icebreaker fleet, stated that the company would prefer to replace the retiring traditional icebreakers with new multipurpose ships that could be chartered to support offshore drilling during the summer months, the Finnish Minister of Transport Merja Kyllönen voiced her opposition to a ship that would be 50% more expensive to build than a traditional icebreaker. There is also a growing public opposition to Arctic drilling which could result in an ecological disaster in case of a major oil spill. Some Finnish politicians have even proposed that instead of purchasing a new icebreaker to replace Voima, Finland should try to manage with a smaller icebreaker fleet and accept that some ports would likely be closed during the coldest winters.|$|R
50|$|On 25 November 2014, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy {{published}} a statement regarding {{the future of}} the <b>state-owned</b> <b>shipping</b> company, Arctia, and its fleet of aging icebreakers. According to the statement, the company's existing conventional and multipurpose icebreakers would require replacement by 2029 at an overall cost of about 1 billion euro. In order to keep the cost of icebreaking services in the Baltic Sea at a reasonable level, the shipping company should improve the annual utilization rate of its icebreakers by investing in multi-role vessels that could be improved elsewhere during the summer months. While more expensive to build, such multipurpose icebreakers would result in savings ranging from 20 to 30 million euro over the 30-year lifetime of the vessel. Generally, this statement was seen as a major change in government policy regarding the use of Finnish icebreakers to support potentially controversial operations such as oil exploration in the Arctic.|$|R
