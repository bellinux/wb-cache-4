2500|$|It can {{be shown}} that any {{sufficiently}} fast decaying smooth solution will eventually split into a finite superposition of solitons travelling to the right plus a decaying dispersive part travelling to the left.

2500|$|In this expression, the {{parameter}} [...] {{is called}} the [...] "Gribov parameter". The integration over this Gribov parameter is then performed using the method of <b>steepest</b> <b>descent.</b> This method gives an equation for the Gribov parameter, which {{is called the}} gap equation.

2500|$|The {{name and}} {{inspiration}} of the algorithm demand an interesting feature {{related to the}} temperature variation to be embedded in the operational characteristics of the algorithm. This necessitates a gradual reduction of the temperature as the simulation proceeds. The algorithm starts initially with [...] set to a high value (or infinity), and then it is decreased at each step following some annealing schedule—which may be specified by the user, but must end with [...] {{towards the end of}} the allotted time budget. [...] In this way, the system is expected to wander initially towards a broad region of the search space containing good solutions, ignoring small features of the energy function; then drift towards low-energy regions that become narrower and narrower; and finally move downhill according to the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> heuristic.|$|E

2500|$|Eltham has {{a varied}} topography. Map 6 shows contours, spot heights and water courses. The centre of Eltham is on a plateau {{at about the}} 60m level with the High Street running along its centre. [...] There is a scarp slope {{to the west of}} the plateau from the top of which are {{unrestricted}} views across South London. Eltham Palace occupies a commanding position on the edge of the scarp. Eltham Hill offers the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> from the plateau, starting at Eltham High Street and descending 30m over 1km due west at the Yorkshire Grey (now a McDonald's outlet). The land to the north of Eltham rises to form the southern slope of Shooter's Hill, one of the highest points in London at a height of 130m. The recently (2014) restored 18th century belvedere Severndroog Castle offers wide views from its observation platform which is 150m above sea level.|$|E
6000|$|Guert Ten Eyck {{looked at}} me expressively, as the sleigh whirled round an angle of the {{building}} and disappeared. He then proposed that we should proceed. On ascending the main street, I was not a little surprised at discovering the sort of amusement that was going on, and in which it seemed to me all the youths of the place were engaged. By youths, I do not mean lads of twelve and fourteen, but young men of eighteen and twenty, the amusement being that of sliding down hill, or [...] "coasting," [...] as I am told it is called in Boston. The acclivity was quite sharp, and of sufficient length to give an impetus to the sled, that was set in motion at a short distance above the English church; an impetus that would carry it past the Dutch church--a distance that was somewhat {{more than a quarter of}} a mile. The hand-sleds employed, were of a size and construction suited to the dimensions of those that used them; and, as a matter of course, there was no New Yorker that had not learned how to govern the motion of one of these vehicles, even when gliding down the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent,</b> with the nicest delicacy and greatest ease. As children, or boys as late in life as fourteen even, every male in the colony, and not a few of the females, had acquired this art; but this was the first place in which I had ever known adults to engage in the sport. The accidental circumstance of a hill's belonging to the principal street, joined to the severity of the winters, had rendered an amusement suited to grown people, that, elsewhere, was monopolized by the children.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steepest</b> <b>descent.</b> Although a {{reduction}} in the sum of squares is guaranteed when the shift vector points in the direction of <b>steepest</b> <b>descent,</b> this method often performs poorly. When the parameter values are far from optimal the direction of the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> vector, which is normal (perpendicular) to the contours of the objective function, {{is very different from the}} direction of the Gauss-Newton vector. This makes divergence much more likely, especially as the minimum along the direction of <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> may correspond to a small fraction of the length of the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> vector. When the contours of the objective function are very eccentric, due to there being high correlation between parameters, the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> iterations, with shift-cutting, follow a slow, zig-zag trajectory towards the minimum.|$|E

5000|$|With a pure {{quadratic}} function {{the minimum}} is reached within N iterations (excepting roundoff error), but a non-quadratic function will make slower progress. Subsequent search directions lose conjugacy requiring the search direction to be reset to the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> direction {{at least every}} N iterations, or sooner if progress stops. However, resetting every iteration turns the method into <b>steepest</b> <b>descent.</b> The algorithm stops when it finds the minimum, determined when no progress is made after a direction reset (i.e. in the <b>steepest</b> <b>descent</b> direction), or when some tolerance criterion is reached.|$|E
