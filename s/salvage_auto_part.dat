40|$|The Thai <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> {{industry}} {{is considered to}} be, along with the automotive industry, {{the driving force of}} the nation’s economy. Dating back to the 1960 s, the government has started an initiative to establish Thailand as the “Detroit of Asia”.

This paper analyzes interviews conducted with firms in the <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> and automotive industries along with the secondary data to identify the source of competitive advantage of the <b>auto</b> <b>parts</b> industry and its contribution to the development of the automotive industry. The findings, which utilized the national diamond model, five forces framework, and network theory, has demonstrated an interesting result. The role of the government is much more important than expected.
