40|$|Introduction The aim of my {{research}} {{is to find out}} a general model for airborne and <b>satellite</b> digital optical <b>sensors,</b> to transform their imagery from image space to object space and viceversa. The need of such a model {{comes from the fact that}} all models already existing are specific for a few numbers of sensors, while a general model could be used for images of different origins. So at first the sensors of interest have been studied by a photogrammetric point of view and then the models already existing have been analysed.

The Open Geospatial Consortium Sensor Model Language (SensorML) has a clear hierarchy in describing the metadata framework, and it is adopted as the carrier to formalize our proposed meta-model into the Atmospheric Satel-lite Sensor Observation Information Model (A-SSOIM).

Especially, there are two precision agriculture related projects: HASSAS (Widespread application of sustainable precision agriculture practices in Southeastern Anatolia Project Region (GAP) Project) and AKTAR (Smart Agriculture Feasibility Project). The HASSAS project aims to study development of precision agriculture practice in GAP region. Multi-spectral satellite imagery and aerial hyperspectral data along with ground measurements was collected to analyze data in an information system. AKTAR aims to develop models for irrigation, fertilization and spectral signatures of crops in Inner Anatolia. By the end of the project precision agriculture practices to control irrigation, fertilization, pesticide and estimation of crop yield will be developed. Analyzing the phenology of crops using NDVI is critical for the projects. For this reason, absolute radiometric calibration of the Red and NIR bands in space-based satellite sensors is an important issue. The Göktürk- 2 satellite is an earth observation satellite which was designed and built in Turkey and was launched in 2012. The Göktürk- 2 <b>satellite</b> <b>sensor</b> has a resolution 2. 5 meters in panchromatic and 5 meters in R/G/B/NIR bands.

Although the shoreline may be mapped accurately from fine spatial resolution imagery, {{this is an}} impractical approach for use over large areas. An alternative approach using coarse spatial resolution <b>satellite</b> <b>sensor</b> imagery, addressed here, is to fit a shoreline boundary at sub-pixel scale. This paper investigates the effects of utilizing relatively coarse spatial resolution <b>satellite</b> <b>sensor</b> imagery to produce accurate shoreline maps.

The conventional method based on hard classification provided an inaccurate and inappropriate representation of the shoreline. Super-resolution methods based on sub-pixel information derived from a soft classification provided accurate and realistic prediction of the shoreline.

So far, mainly <b>satellite</b> <b>sensors</b> such as Landsat- 5 / 7, SPOT- 3 / 4, or ASTER {{have been used}} for investigating glacial hazards. The recent emergence of commercial <b>satellite</b> <b>sensors</b> with very high spatial resolution in the sub-metre range opens new perspectives for applications in the area of natural hazards. <b>Satellite</b> <b>sensors</b> such as IKONOS, QuickBird or Orbview- 3 provide imagery comparable to aerial photography. Presumably due to the recent emergence of these <b>satellite</b> <b>sensors</b> and the high image acquisition costs, studies on the application of QuickBird and IKONOS data for high-mountain hazards are largely missing yet. This contribution therefore aims at evaluating the {{potential of}} QuickBird and IKONOS imagery for high-mountain, in particular glacial, hazard assessments. QuickBird imagery was used in relation with a major rock-ice avalanche in the Northern Caucasus in 2002 for detailed analysis of avalanche formation and dynamics, for assessment of ice dam, lake and related flood hazards, and for mass movement model support. IKONOS imagery was used in the Swiss Alps for identification of potentially unstable debris slopes and debris flow formation in combination with digital terrain modelling. Limitations of this type of satellite data for high-mountain hazard studies are related to the high acquisition cost, and problems to collect sufficiently accurate ground reference data for geocorrection. However, this study shows that for the demonstrated applications in remote areas the achieved absolute ground positional error of 20 - 30 m allows of reasonable results. It is concluded that the QuickBird and IKONOS imagery are powerful tools for high-mountain hazard assessments with a high potential in the future...|$|R
