25|$|<b>Social</b> <b>gerontology</b> is a multi-disciplinary {{sub-field}} {{that specializes}} in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in social work, nursing, psychology, sociology, demography, public health, or other social science disciplines.

25|$|Key Concepts in <b>Social</b> <b>Gerontology</b> lists four dimensions: chronological, biological, psychological, and social. Wattis and Curran add a fifth dimension: developmental. Chronological age {{may differ}} {{considerably}} from a person's functional age. The distinguishing marks {{of old age}} normally occur in all five senses at different times and different rates for different persons. In addition to chronological age, people can be considered old because of the other dimensions of old age. For example, people may be considered old when they become grandparents or when they begin to do less or different work in retirement.|$|E
25|$|The field {{first began}} {{to emerge in the}} 1930s during the first studies on {{behavioral}} and <b>social</b> <b>gerontology,</b> and were associated with deterministic explanations of the relationship between aging and environment from genetic parameters and biological. In the 1970s and 1980s, theories of different researchers, as Kurt Lewin (living space model {{as a function of the}} person and the environment) and, mainly, M. Powell Lawton (1923–2001) (ecological adaptation model), based on the influence of the interactions between the older person and their environment (adaptation – ambient pressure), confirm the importance of the physical and social environment (objective and subjective) in the understanding of the aging population and the possibility of improving the quality of life in old age.|$|E

50|$|By the 1980s Boettner's {{concerns}} about personal aging and financial education began {{to merge with}} Gregg's views {{on the need for}} more comprehensive professional education in the expanding field of financial services. A result of these joint concerns was the concept and a plan, for a new research institute that would focus on the interconnections among <b>social</b> <b>gerontology</b> and personal finance. With a small gift from Boettner, Gregg convened a study committee of nationally known gerontologists which, after two years of assessment, agreed on four organizing principles: (1) that there was in fact a need for specialized research that integrates gerontology and financial planning; (2) that a <b>social</b> <b>gerontology</b> research center could succeed at a small specialized business school; (3) that the permanent director of the institute should be an experienced gerontologist because the financial side of the relationship would be provided by the business school's faculty; and (4) that the new institute would be communicating gerontological concerns to financial professionals and financial concerns to gerontologists.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Within {{the last}} two years, the {{physical}} footprint of the University of Michigan health sciences collections has decreased from three distinct libraries to a single entity. As we have absorbed vast materials into a significantly smaller space, we are defining the University's twenty-first century health sciences research collection in some radical non-traditional ways. Because we serve multiple users from multiple subject fields, both professional (medicine, nursing, public health, pharmacy, and dentistry) and non-professional (<b>social</b> work, <b>gerontology,</b> history of medicine, psychology, etc.), we wonder if {{it is possible to}} sustain a collection that meets the needs of our users and maintain our obligations to health sciences researchers and clinicians in the state of Michigan. We're in the process of finding that answer...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{equity and}} {{efficiency}} {{in the long-term}} care of older people is an international concern, with governments attempting to ensure that policies and practice develop so that resources are used to best effect. This requires good quality evidence founded on sound theory. This volume honours the outstanding contribution of Bleddyn Davies to this field, bringing together perspectives of scholars and practitioners from many countries including the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Sweden and the USA. Contemporary policy dilemmas are considered, leavened by professional anecdote. A chapter from Davies himself, reflecting {{on the origins of}} the PSSRU (Personal Social Services Research Unit), concludes the volume that also features a full listing of his books and monographs, which will prove invaluable to those seeking to engage with his contribution to the field. This volume will greatly interest academics in social policy, <b>social</b> work, <b>gerontology</b> and <b>social</b> care as well as professionals in the field.
