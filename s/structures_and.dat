40|$|Abstract: There are {{different}} {{structure of the}} network and the variables, {{and the process of}} learning Bayesian networks has a lot of different forms. The structure of the network can be unknown or known, and the variables can be observable or hidden in {{some or all of the}} data points. Consequently, there are four cases of learning Bayesian networks from data: known <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> observable variables, unknown <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> observable variables, known <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> unobservable variables <b>and</b> unknown <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> unobservable variables. In this paper, we focus on known <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> observable variables, unknown <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> observable variables...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of word problem's context <b>and</b> <b>structure,</b> <b>and</b> capturing the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> using analogies on problem-solving. A 2 x 3 x 2 factorial design was used with two between-subjects variables -capturing the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> the use of analogies- and one within- subjects variable -structural complexity of word problem-. Two types of booklets containing two word problems that differ {{from each other in}} <b>structure</b> (<b>and</b> each type of booklet having problems of different context) and questions about capturing the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> using analogies in problem solving, were administered to 66 third-year pre-service primary teachers from the same university (University of Valencia,Spain). The results of the ANOVAs showed that: a) Problems increase in difficulty when they have complex <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> low familiarity context, and b) Capturing the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> the use of analogies are needed to solve structurally complex problems...|$|R

40|$|This article {{develops}} a distinctive critical realist analysis of <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> agency. It first describes Roy Bhaskarâ��s account of critical realism; then discusses critical realism in general; next introduces Anthony Giddensâ��s structuration theory and two particular applications of critical realism to <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> agency â�� those of Bhaskar and Margaret Archer; and, finally, presents a third such application {{based on the}} strategic-relational approach. The latter goes beyond conventional analyses of the duality, dualism, or dialectic of <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> agency by studying the recursive conditioning, mutual coupling, and complex co-evolution of <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> agency and, above all, by stressing the differential, spatio-temporal relationality of <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> agency. Its advantages over other approaches should emerge as we proceed...|$|R
