40|$|Large-scale mills {{are used}} to {{pulverise}} coal for combustion in heat and <b>steam</b> <b>raising</b> <b>plants</b> in many manufacturing and ore processing industries, and in particular in power generating utilities. The cost of mill maintenance attributable to wear of pulverising elements typically ranges from 0. 1 to 1. 0 A/t of coal pulverised, depending {{on the characteristics of}} the mill, the properties of the wearing alloys, and the properties of the coal. Abrasiveness of coal is usually assessed by any of a number of empirical indices, none of which have been related to wear in large-scale mills in any detail. The selection or evaluation of alloy materials for pulverising elements is based on field experience, or on measurement of certain properties in the laboratory. This research has been undertaken to establish a simulative test for wear in coal pulverising mills, and to gain a more fundamental understanding of the mechanistic processes associated with abrasive wear interactions in comminution systems...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} {{units used}} in <b>steam</b> <b>raising</b> power <b>plant</b> are often manufactured using many metres of {{austenitic stainless steel}} tubes that have been plastically formed (bent and swaged) and welded into complex shapes. The amount of plastic deformation (pre-straining) before welding varies greatly. This has {{a significant effect on}} the mechanical properties of the welded tubes and on the final residual stress state after welding. The aim of the present work was to measure and understand the combined effects of pre-straining and welding on the properties and residual stress levels in stainless steel tubing weldments. Effects of plastic deformation were simulated by plastically straining three identical stainless steel tubes to different strain levels (0 %, 10 % and 20 %). Then each tube was cut into two halves and welding back together. The variation in mechanical properties across weldments was measured using digital image correlation (DIC) and a series of strain gauges (SG). Residual stresses were measured on the 0 % (undeformed) and 20 % prestrained and welded tubes by neutron diffraction. It was found that the welding process had a marked effect on the tensile properties of parent material within 25 mm of the weld centre-line. Evidence of cyclic strain hardening was observed in the tube that had not been pre-strained, and evidence of softening seen in the 10 % and 20 % pre-strained tubes. Macroscopic residual stresses were measured to be near zero at distances greater than 25 mm from the weld centre-line, but measurements in the 20 % pre-strained tube revealed the presence of micro residual stresses having a magnitude of up to 50 MPa...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to test the clonal homogeneity of six month old tissue culture <b>raised</b> <b>plants</b> of grapevine cv. Crimson Seedless using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. Visible assessment of these in vitro <b>raised</b> <b>plants</b> maintained in polyhouse did not show any morphological differences among themselves. However, to test the genetic homogeneity of these plants, we screened 50 ISSR primers out of which, 22 primers produced scorable and repeatable bands. These 22 primers were used further for assessing genetic homogeneity of in vitro <b>raised</b> <b>plants</b> of Crimson Seedless. These 22 ISSR primers generated 134 distinct band classes with a total of 3216 scorable bands. All the primers showed uniform banding pattern for all the in vitro <b>raised</b> <b>plants</b> and the mother plant. In case of 5 SSR primers (VS 1, VVMD 5, VVS 2, VMCNG 4 c 8 and VVMD 31) used, a total of 288 scorable bands were obtained. The allele sizes ranged from 98 to 254 bp. Allelic composition of 23 in vitro <b>raised</b> <b>plants</b> and the mother plant at 5 SSR loci did not show any polymorphism. The results of the two marker systems in the present study revealed the genetic uniformity among the in vitro <b>raised</b> <b>plants</b> demonstrating the reliability of in vitro propagation system used for the cultivar...|$|R

40|$|Energy, exergy, and {{economic}} analyses of energy sourcing pattern in a Nigerian brewery {{have been carried}} out. The mean annual energy efficiencies have varied from 75. 62 % in 2004 to 81. 71 % in 2006, while the mean annual exergy efficiencies have varied from 42. 66 % in 2004 to 57. 10 % in 2005. Diesel fuel combustion, whether for local electricity generation via internal combustion engines or for process <b>steam</b> <b>raising</b> in boilers, has adversely affected the efficiencies of energy utilisation in the company. The negative effect of <b>steam</b> <b>raising</b> on efficient energy utilisation is more, although <b>steam</b> <b>raising</b> is unavoidable, {{due to the nature}} of the company under investigation. The annual mean energy unit costs have also varied from 27. 86 USD per Giga-Joule in 2006 to 32. 80 USD per Giga-Joule in 2004, confirming the inverse proportion of energy efficiency and costs. On the other hand, the annual mean exergy unit costs have varied from 40. 19 USD per Giga-Joule in 2005 to 58. 46 USD per Giga-Joule in 2004. The most efficient year has been 2006 energetically and 2005 exergetically. The difference in the two years lies in the proportions of generator diesel and boiler diesel utilised as the system exergy is most sensitive to boiler diesel use while the system energy is more sensitive to generator diesel utilisation due to their different device efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{detection}} and sizing {{of small and}} complex flaws is paramount in safety critical Nuclear <b>Steam</b> <b>Raising</b> <b>Plant</b> (NSRP) components and the pressure vessels of Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR). Also accurate modelling approaches are fundamental to understand the propagation and the scattering of ultrasonic waves from defects to aid interpretation of their ultrasonic responses. The objectives of this work are twofold: firstly, to assess the reliability of existing ultrasonic inspection techniques in {{detection and}} sizing of small and complex defects in ferritic steel. Secondly, to validate the finite element (FE) and CIVA simulation methods in modelling propagation of ultrasonic waves and scattering from geometrically simple defects. Experimental results {{have shown that the}} Time-of-Flight Diffraction (TOFD) technique is effective in locating and sizing linear cracks in welded ferritic components, though not arrays of small pores, and under-clad carbon cracks. It has also been shown that the pulse-echo phased array technique is efficient for defect detection. The TFM post-processed FMC data produces images of defects with a superior resolution than the pulse-echo phased array technique. Finite element simulations of waves in isotropic and transversely isotropic steels have predicted wave speeds agreeing well with theory. Similarly, the bulk elastic velocities in isotropic steel using the commercial simulation software CIVA {{have been found to be}} in close agreement with theory, however, significant discrepancies were found in the shear velocities in the transversely isotropic steel. The validations of the FE and CIVA modelling techniques for scattering from a small circular hole and a semi-infinite crack were performed. The FE predictions of the scattered and diffracted fields were in good agreement with analytical solutions. The corresponding CIVA predictions also agreed well with theory, though not close to the specular direction and at large receiving angles. Finally, FE and CIVA simulations of the TOFD technique were carried out on an ultrasonically smooth crack and a pore. The results were presented as B-scan images; the simulated B-scan images were in harmony with the experimental studies. Open Acces...|$|E
