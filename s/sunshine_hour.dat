In this study, based on the daily meteorological data of 18 meteorological stations in Shanxi Province from 1961 to 2000, the daily ET 0 values were calculated using Penman-Monteith equation recommended by FAO- 56. The trends of climate variables were detected by using Mann-Kendall test. Sensitivity coefficients were employed to predict responses of ET 0 to five climatic variables, combined with annual of meteorological factors quantitative analysis of ET 0 changes. The results show that statistically significant decreasing trends are observed in wind and daily sunshine hours in Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi.

Objective: We describe the pattern and investigate if year-to-year irregularities are associated with meteorological factors using data from 50 000 children diagnosed {{under the age of}} 15 yr in 23 population-based European registries during 1989 – 2008. Methods: Tests for seasonal variation in monthly counts aggregated over the 20 yr period were performed. Time series regression was used to investigate if <b>sunshine</b> <b>hour</b> and average temperature data were predictive of the 240 monthly diagnosis counts after taking account of seasonality and long term trends. Results: Significant sinusoidal pattern was evident in all but two small centers with peaks in November to February and relative amplitudes ranging from ± 11 to ± 38 % (median ± 17 %). However, most centers showed significant departures from a sinusoidal pattern. Pooling results over centers, there was significant seasonal variation in each age-group at diagnosis, with least seasonal variation in those under 5 yr. Boys showed greater seasonal variation than girls, particularly those aged 10 – 14 yr. There were no differences in seasonal pattern between four 5 -yr sub-periods. Departures from the sinusoidal trend in monthly diagnoses in the period were significantly associated with deviations from the norm in average temperature (0. 8 % reduction in diagnoses per 1 °C excess) but not with sunshine hours. Conclusions: Seasonality was consistently apparent throughout the period in all age-groups and both sexes, but girls and the under 5 s showed less marked variation.

40|$|Introduction: Solar {{radiation}} on {{the earth}} surface has {{a wide range of}} applications in hydrology, agriculture and meteorology. Solar radiation is an important parameter of estimated models of reference crop potential evapotranspiration such as the Penman–Monteith equation. Also, total <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours</b> {{are one of the most}} important factors affecting climate and environment, and its long-term variation is of much concern in climate studies. Reference crop potential evapotranspiration is one of the most important parts of water cycle in the nature but, direct measurement of this crop parameter is so difficult and not practical. Therefore, equations that can estimate the value of evapotranspiration only by using meteorological data are necessary. As mentioned before, the Penman–Monteith equation can be used for estimating reference crop potential evapotranspiration, however this equation needs solar radiation data, and the measurement of solar radiation is done in a limited numbers of weather stations in Iran, and also in Fars province, south of Iran. Since, the measurement of solar radiation is expensive, therefore many models have been derived for its estimation in different climates of the world., Many investigators also have been tried to estimate solar radiation for different locations of the world based on more simple measured weather data such as air temperature (minimum, maximum or mean) and <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours.</b> Hence, the derived equations for estimating solar radiation based on other weather data can be used for estimating reference crop potential evapotranspiration with the Penman–Monteith equation. Materials and Methods: In this study, solar radiation was estimated in Shiraz, central part of the Fars province in south of Iran. For this purpose, the daily measured of solar radiation data in Shiraz synoptic station were used. Also, other needed weather data were used. All available data was for the years 2006 to 2010. Measured data of years 2006 to 2008 were used for calibrating fourteen estimated models of solar radiation in seasonally and annual time steps and the measured data of years 2009 and 2010 were used for evaluating the obtained results. The equations were used in this study divided into three groups contains: 1) The equations based on only <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours.</b> 2) The equations based on only air temperature. 3) The equations based on <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours</b> and air temperature together. On the other hand, statistical comparison must be done to select the best equation for estimating solar radiation in seasonally and annual time steps. For this purpose, in validation stage the combination of statistical equations and linear correlation was used, and then the value of mean square deviation (MSD) was calculated to evaluate the different models for estimating solar radiation in mentioned time steps. Results and Discussion: The mean values of mean square deviation (MSD) of fourteen models for estimating solar radiation were equal to 24. 16, 20. 42, 4. 08 and 16. 19 for spring to winter respectively, and 15. 40 in annual time step. Therefore, the results showed that using the equations for autumn enjoyed high accuracy, however for other seasons had low accuracy. So, using the equations for annual time step were appropriate more than the equations for seasonally time steps. Also, the mean values of mean square deviation (MSD) of the equations based on only <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours,</b> the equations based on only air temperature, and the equations based on the combination of <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours</b> and air temperature for estimating solar radiation were equal to 14. 82, 17. 40 and 14. 88, respectively. Therefore, the results indicated that the models based on only air temperature were the worst conditions for estimating solar radiation in Shiraz region, and therefore, using the <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours</b> for estimating solar radiation is necessary. Conclusions: In this study for estimating solar radiation in seasonally and annual time steps in Shiraz region, three groups of equations were used (1 : based on only <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours.</b> 2 : based on only air temperature, and 3 : based on <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours</b> and air temperature). Final results of this study for estimating solar radiation in Shiraz region were: 1) For autumn season the best equation was based on the extraterrestrial radiation, the ratio of daily actual <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours</b> to daily maximum <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours,</b> and minimum and maximum air temperatures. 2) For annual time step the best equation was based on the extraterrestrial radiation and the ratio of daily actual <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours</b> to daily maximum <b>sunshine</b> <b>hours...</b>|$|R
