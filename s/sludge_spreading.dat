When conventional production is substituted by the MSWA recycling, the eutrophication and land-use impacts are avoided, while the impacts in other categories are considerable.

However, availability of nitrogen and phosphorus from sludge-amended soils and their transfer in runoff may lead to eutrophication of downstream surface water. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish and compare the effect of two different sludges on these transfers: an anaerobically digested and thermically stabilised sludge (Seine-Aval treatment plant, sludge no. 1), and a limed sludge (Saint-Quentin treatment plant, sludge no. 2). Experiments were performed on 12 sloping micro-plots (1 m × 1 m) submitted to <b>sludge</b> <b>spreading</b> and controlled rainfall simulation. Runoff water was sampled and analysed for concentrations in nitrogen species and phosphorus. Results show that spreading of sludge no. 1 increased both ammonium nitrogen (mean of 1. 1 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 vs. 0. 2 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 for control micro-plots) and particulate phosphorus concentrations (mean of 2 mg L− 1 P vs. 1. 1 mg L− 1 P for control micro-plots) in runoff water. On the other hand, sludge no. 2 did not induce any significant effect on nutrient concentrations in runoff. These results are related to chemical composition and physical treatment of sludges.

In order to evaluate and quantify the potential environmental risks associated with the xenobiotic introduction into biological life cycle, the EU BIOWASTE project (QLK 5 -CT- 2002 - 01138) devotes one task {{to the study of}} the fate of xenobiotic in a sandy soil after <b>sludge</b> <b>spreading</b> on a 30 -year field-scale record experiment. Experimental maize crop fields from Bordeaux (France) have been amended with 100 tons per hectare each 2 years from 1974 to 1992. From 1992 to 2004, the fields were maintained and cropped with maize. This experiment shows that the concentration fluctuations in the sludge amended soil follow the same pattern of those in the sewage sludge showing that there is a real impact of the present xenobiotics in the sewage sludge on the concentration of the xenobiotics in the soil. Nonetheless, 12 years after the last addition of sewage sludge, the residual concentrations remain from 2 to 10 times higher than the content of the control soil, even though these levels are inferior to the Predicted Non Effect Concentration (PNEC). Only LAS level went back to the level in the control soil. However, only the LAS concentration is above the PNEC during all the experiment due to the very high level of LAS in the sludge (20 g/kg dry weight). These results show that even though this compound is much more degradable than NPE and PAE, it may have a long term effect in soil if high quantities are spread. To conclude, this study underlines the importance to fix maximum level for xenobiotic compounds for sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>spreading</b> on agricultural land, and also the central role of the sewage sludge processes in reducing the xenobiotic concentrations before spreading...|$|E

Heavy metals accumulate in deep soil horizons in relation to important clay content in the dystric planosol and stagnic luvisol. The concentration of each heavy metal is always controlled by different parameters (soil pH, iron and aluminum oxide content, clay content, organic matter and cation exchange capacity), which are heavy metal specific. This study highlights the metal-trapping character of andosol and calcaric soil, the weak heavy metal retention in acid soils, the leaching and trapping character in leached clayed soils, and the migration of heavy metals in the podzol. Pb and Cr concentrations indicate a significant enrichment in surfac...|$|E
40|$|Aerobic and {{anaerobic}} biodegradation of six priority PCBs {{was investigated in}} continuous stirred tank reactors fed with naturally contaminated sewage sludge. Anaerobic and aerobic abiotic losses were higher for the lightly chlorinated PCBs but remained for all PCBs below 20 %. Under strict methanogenic conditions, PCB removals were about 40 % whatever PCB molecular weight or their degree of chlori-nation. However, considering abiotic losses, the heaviest PCBs were more efficiently anaerobically biodegraded probably because of higher dechlorination rates. The aerating sludge process enhanced removal of the lightest chlorinated PCBs from 40 % up to 100 %, while removal rates of the heaviest PCBs remained around 40 %. Although the mesophilic aerobic process exhibits better removal efficiencies because of operating conditions, {{the results suggest that}} PCB biodegradation was strongly limited by their bioavailability in naturally contaminated sludge, under both redox conditions. Indeed, since PCB removal was closely linked to the solid reduction rates, PCB bioavailability was likely the limiting factor for biodegradation. As a consequence, the raw PCB concentrations (in mg kg 1 dryweight) which are con-cerned by legislative procedures did not decrease sufficiently in both processes to reach a limit value fulfilling the current French/European regulation about PCB contents in sewage <b>sludge</b> before <b>spreading</b> on agricultural land...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} generates {{large quantities}} of sewage sludge whose disposal is expensive. Mainly because anaerobic digestion produces methane, which can be beneficially used as an energy source, this process {{has become the most}} popular means of stabilizing sewage <b>sludge</b> prior to <b>spreading</b> on agricultural land or disposal to landfills. Several pretreatment technologies have recently been developed to render sludge more degradable during anaerobic digestion. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether microwave irradiation can enhance the anaerobic degradability of aerobic sequencing batch reactor sludge. Relationships relating microwave irradiation duration, microwave intensity, sludge concentration and the temperature reached by the sludge were developed. Sludge concentration in the 1. 2 - 4. 3 % total solids range was found not to impact the temperature reached by the sludge. Three techniques were used to assess the impact of microwave irradiation on the size of the particles: visual analysis of sludge settling, microscopic analysis and particle size distribution analysis.

40|$|The {{majority}} of pollutants that affect wastewater are concentrated by treatment processes in sludge; {{it is therefore}} critical to have a suitable evaluation methodology of sludge management options to analyze if pollution is redirected from water to other media, such as air and soil. Life cycle assessment {{is one of the}} most widely known and internationally accepted methodologies to compare environmental impacts of processes and systems and to evaluate their sustainability in the entire life cycle. In this study the methodology was applied to assess and compare three scenarios of urban sewage sludge treatment and disposal: sludge anaerobic digestion followed by dedicated incineration, sludge incineration without previous digestion, and sludge anaerobic digestion followed by composting. The potential benefits of spreading the compost to soil were not included in the system boundaries even if, due to its nutrients contents and soil improving features, compost could partially replace the use of commercial products. The study was aimed at finding out the environmental critical points of the treatment alternatives selected and at providing a technical and scientific contribution for further debates with national and local authorities on the environmental optimization of sewage sludge management. Life cycle assessment results confirmed the major contribution of electricity and methane consumption on several environmental impact categories. Incineration contributes more than sludge composting to almost all categories, although the heavy metals content of urban wastewater sludge raises substantial concerns when composted <b>sludge</b> is <b>spread</b> to soil. In this paper the models adopted, the hypotheses assumed and the main findings of the study are presented and discussed. ...|$|R
