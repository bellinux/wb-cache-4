5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on <b>shore</b> and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded <b>shore</b> party.|$|E

5|$|After {{rounding}} Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly {{along the}} eastern <b>shore</b> of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile1 marker.

Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile3 is the Lake <b>Shore</b> Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile3, Scott's <b>Shore</b> Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake <b>Shore</b> Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods {{on one side and}} the beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.|$|E
