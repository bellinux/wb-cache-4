50|$|Orgelbau Pirchner builds {{instruments}} for churches, concert halls, universities and schools. The company's primary {{focus is on}} designing and building <b>slider</b> <b>chest</b> organs with tracker-action. The scales of the pipes and their voicing are a modern interpretation {{of the principles of}} Andreas and Gottfried Silbermann.|$|E
50|$|The {{organ of}} St. Marien {{was built in}} 1967 by Dutch organ {{builders}} Flentrop and underwent extensive renovation in 1998. The <b>slider</b> <b>chest</b> instrument has 47 registers across four manual stops and pedals. The stop and key actions are operated manually. The Brustwerk is fitted with a threshold mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} {{of the history of the}} pipe organ, there have been several {{different}} designs by which stops are actuated. In the longest-standing design, known as the <b>slider</b> <b>chest,</b> there is a strip of material (typically wood) called a slider which fits underneath a given rank of pipes. The slider has small holes drilled in it, one for each pipe in the rank. When the stop is set such that pipes are inactive, the holes are misaligned with the pipes, preventing the air from flowing up into the pipes above. When the stop is set such that the pipes are active, the slider moves over, aligning the holes with the pipes, allowing air to reach them. Because the <b>slider</b> <b>chest</b> was developed before the advent of electricity, it is inherently mechanical in nature. Many organs originally built with mechanical actuators have been retrofitted with electric actuators.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> {{instrument}} has 52 registers {{on three}} manuals and 32 pedals.|$|R
50|$|Moline Organ Co. {{pipe organ}} (1883) {{features}} two manuals, 18 stops, <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> and mechanical key action.|$|R
50|$|The organ in {{the gallery}} was built by Paul Hintermann and Jakob Schmidt on behalf of Kuhn Orgelbau in 1970: The <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> {{instrument}} has 46 registers on three manuals and pedals. 1) floating, comp system with 6 combinations.|$|R
50|$|A new {{choir organ}} {{will be built}} in the nave for the accompaniment of the choir, which will {{henceforth}} be in the front portion of the cathedral. The <b>slider</b> <b>chest</b> organ will have 20 registers (including a half-draw register in its main organ, {{as well as two}} borrowed stops and a derived quint in the pedal) in two manuals and a pedal. The choir organ will be capable of being played along with the main organ.|$|E
50|$|Behind the organ's 16-field façade {{with its}} 124 {{sounding}} {{and up to}} seven-metre-tall organ pipes are found several ranks of pipes in their original configuration and piping on the <b>slider</b> <b>chest,</b> reconstructed in 1982. All 14 pedal ranks are freestanding behind it. Furthermore, also standing there, in three levels, is the swell box, added in 1982, along with its attendant works. It contains an assembly of ranks added after 1868, with one dedicated {{to the sound of}} French Romantic organ music. The organ has 5,116 pipes and 30 percussion devices shared across 66 stops, and is played from four manuals and one pedalboard.|$|E
5000|$|The organ {{was built}} during the Thirty Years' War between 1621 and 1624 by the organ-builder [...] of Lich and had around 20 {{registers}} with two manuals and a pedalboard, {{as well as}} wing doors on the sides. The instrument was originally located where the Fürstenstuhl now stands. Between 1631 and 1633, the organ was expanded with the two pedal towers of the organ of Arnsburg Abbey which was probably also built by Wagner around 1607. These were brought to Lich {{to protect them from}} being plundered by Swedish troops. The Lich-based organ firm, [...] relocated the organ in 1861 from the small gallery in the ambulatory to the west gallery and modified its tuning. The instrument was modified repeatedly by the firm over time. In 1913, a substantial renovation took place in the course of which the organ received tubular-pneumatic action, cone chests, a free-standing console, an expression pedal and several new registers. A further rearrangement followed in 1941 {{in the course of the}} organ reform movement. In 1961, the empty rear housing was refilled with new registers in a <b>slider</b> <b>chest.</b> A new organ with mechanical tracker action was installed in the old housing, incorporating the old registers, in 1972. Finally, further tunings were added in 2002, so that the modern instrument contains over 39 registers and can adequately reproduce a broad range of styles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{instrument}} is entirely mechanical in both key and stop actions. The <b>slider</b> <b>chests,</b> case, pipe work and all components were manufactured directly by Metzler craftsmen {{under the supervision}} of the organ builder Joan Carles Castro (Barcelona). The instrument installation includes: ...|$|R
25|$|The third organ {{was built}} in 1903/04 by Friedrich Groll from Lucerne. While the {{exterior}} remained virtually untouched, the interior was rebuilt. Pneumatic tubes, <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> and a mechanical action {{were added to the}} organ. However, the sound produced by this new organ was unpleasant. The interior of the organ was completely rebuilt in 1930.|$|R
50|$|Today's organ {{was built}} in 2000 by the organ builder Wilhelm Sauer (Frankfurt (Oder)) in the {{historic}} case of 1812. It is a reconstruction of the previous organ, which {{was built in}} 1907 by Eberhard Friedrich Walcker (Ludwigsburg). The instrument has 53 stops, it has <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> and a mechanical key action, with electric stops and coupling.|$|R
50|$|The last {{renovation}} {{and expansion}} dates from 1982, {{when it was}} expanded to 85 registers (on <b>slider</b> <b>chests),</b> 20 of which {{date back to the}} original organ of 1863. The instrument has a total of 6,198 pipes. The main console was built in 1982 and is designed like the French Cavaillé-Coll organs. The choir organ can be played from the main console.|$|R
50|$|He {{participated in}} the organ-building working {{committee}} at the 1909 Third Congress of the International Society of Music in Vienna which drew up a directive for the building of organs; {{the result was a}} decisive recommendation {{to move away from the}} late-romantic orchestral organ and towards the use of the <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> and mechanical action typical of the classical traditions of organ-building, familiar from the many surviving baroque instruments.|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral's organ {{was built}} by Lewis & Co. of Brixton, and {{completed}} in 1897. Thomas Christopher Lewis, the company's founder, was renowned for building instruments that had a bright, vibrant tone which, in part, was due to his use of low wind pressures. Consequently, he was somewhat out-of-step with the trend at the time, which was tending towards high wind pressures and rather thicker tone. The instrument's action was, and is, electro-pneumatic with <b>slider</b> <b>chests,</b> and the main case was designed by Arthur Blomfield.|$|R
5000|$|In 1955 {{he formed}} with John Bright the Kney and Bright Organ Co to build tracker organs. Blanton (1957) {{described}} their first instrument as [...] "a handsome little organ with mechanical action, <b>slider</b> <b>chests,</b> 1-3/4" [...] pressure". They {{were at the}} vanguard of the tracker organ revival in Canada, so much so that they were then to build 30 electro-pneumatic organs before customers caught on and started ordering instruments with mechanical action. In the early 1960s, they rebuilt the organs of Aeolian Hall in London and St Michael's Cathedral in Toronto.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1817 by Franz Reinisch in Gries am Brenner, but moved to Steinach as early as 1825. In 1935 Johann Pirchner Sr. took over the company, but had to stop {{production}} during World War II. Between 1945 and 1973, the workshop built over 120 pipe organs. In 1973 his son, Johann Pirchner Jr., continued the Pirchner tradition, focusing {{on the construction of}} pipe organs with <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> and tracker action. After building a new workshop in 1997, Johann Pirchner Jr. handed the company to his son Martin Pirchner, who took the Meisterprüfung in organ building in 1996.|$|R
2500|$|The organ {{is located}} in the rear gallery of the cathedral. [...] Some of the pipes are exposed in three cases. It {{features}} a traditional style console with the mechanical action console detached from the main case. It is equipped with <b>slider</b> <b>chests,</b> mechanical key action, and electric stop action. [...] There are two manuals, 35 stops, 35 ranks, the manual compass is 61 notes, and the pedal compass is 32 notes. The drawknobs are in horizontal rows on terraced/stepped jambs. It features balanced swell shoes/pedals with standard AGO placement. The combination action is a computerized/digital system. AGO Standard (concave radiating) pedalboard, combination action thumb pistons, combination action toe studs.|$|R
5000|$|The Moline {{pipe organ}} (1883) {{is located in}} a gallery-level case {{at the back of the}} church. It {{features}} a traditional style console with a keyboard cover that can be lifted to become the music rack and an attached keydesk en fenêtre. [...] It is equipped with three manuals, 31 stops, 30 ranks, <b>slider</b> <b>chests,</b> mechanical key action, and mechanical stop action. The drawknobs are arraigned in horizontal rows on terraced/stepped jambs. The balanced swell shoes/pedals are not in standard AGO position. The combination action is a fixed mechanical system and there is a flat straight pedalboard. The historic pipe organ was restored in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Their opus 1 was {{exhibited}} at the Vienna World Exhibition in Vienna, at which it won a gold medal; this organ {{is now in the}} church of St Peter & Paul in Jaktař. One of their first changes from their father's work was the replacement of <b>slider</b> <b>chests</b> with mechanical cone chests. Their first year saw the production of three organs. Their reputation grew apace: in 1874 they won their first commission in the Imperial Capital, Vienna, followed in 1875 by a commission in Hungary. Their first commission in a non-Habsburg country was in 1876 in Norway. They exhibited two salon organs at the 1878 Paris Exposition, one of which, sold to London, marked their first overseas transaction.|$|R
25|$|The only {{entrance}} to the church is on the western side. Above it, there is the organ gallery. The original organ of 1844 had only five registers with an attached pedal. It was expanded in 1907 with more pipes, which gave it six manual and one pedal registers. It was destroyed by vandals in 1961. At {{the time of the}} general restoration of the interior in 1990, the parish could not afford a new organ. The new instrument was installed in June 2009. It is equipped with two manuals, a pedal, and 14 registers on <b>slider</b> <b>chests.</b> In order to complete the general view of the gallery, at present the organ space is held by a deceitfully real looking paper mockup.|$|R
5000|$|The Orgelbau Wech (2006) {{pipe organ}} is in a gallery-level {{case in the}} rear of the cathedral. It {{features}} a traditional style console with a mechanical action console that is detached from the main case. It is equipped with two manuals, 3 divisions, 31 stops, 29 registers, 37 ranks. The manual compass is 58 notes and the pedal compass is 30 notes. The organ has <b>slider</b> <b>chests,</b> balanced mechanical key action, and electric stop action.

50|$|Flentrop {{was born}} in Zaandam on 1 May 1903. His father Hendrik Wichert Flentrop (1866-1950) founded the Zaandam organ {{building}} company Flentrop Orgelbouw in 1903, and Dirk Flentrop learnt the art of organ building in his father's workshop and at the firm of Frobenius in Denmark.He shared his father's interest in classical organ design, assisting in restoration of old organs, and decided to devote his career to construction and renovation of organs built following these principles.He {{became involved in the}} Organ Reform Movement at an early age.In 1927 he gave a lecture to the Dutch Organist Society in which he advocated tracker action, <b>slider</b> <b>chests,</b> and the Rugpositief.Dirk Flentrop assumed direction of the family firm in 1940.This company, which is known throughout the world, operates in Europe, the United States and South America and now also sells organs to Taiwan and Japan.|$|R
50|$|The present {{pipe organ}} was {{originally}} built by Austin Organs, opus 2427 in 1965 as a 3 manual 61 rank instrument in six divisions. A new four manual console with digital enhancements were added in 1997 by Rodgers Instruments. The main organ {{is located in}} the front of the cathedral with the pipework of Great, Pedal and Positive exposed and Swell and Choir division enclosed, and an Antiphonal division (consisting of the original 1915 Austin organ) in the rear of the cathedral. It is equipped with <b>slider</b> and unit <b>chests,</b> with electric key and stop action.|$|R
