50|$|The {{growth of}} the city's tourist and {{convention}} sector accelerated appreciably during Morial's mayoralty, boosted {{in part by the}} general economic {{growth of the}} United States in the late 1990s. Tourism boomed during Marc Morial's mayoralty; the city's downtown core saw the construction of 14 new hotels during his tenure. This development was {{due in part to the}} much-publicized reduction in New Orleans’ high crime rate through the effective leadership of Morial's Superintendent of Police, Richard Pennington. Of particular significance was the 60% reduction achieved in the city's violent crime rate. These real gains enabled a resurgence of interest and investment in the city's older historic neighborhoods. New Orleans benefited from an increase in downtown population. The number of households within the city limits stabilized for the first time since beginning their decline in the 1960s, a significant accomplishment. Morial also <b>secured</b> <b>bond</b> issues for street improvements, the Canal Street streetcar line, and an expansion of the city's convention center.|$|E
40|$|Covered bonds, {{which have}} been part of European fi nance since the time of Frederick the Great, are now being widely touted as the answer to securitization’s imperfections. There is great confusion, though, about the nature of covered bonds and their {{relationship}} to <b>secured</b> <b>bond</b> fi nancing and securitization. This article attempts to demystify covered bonds, examining how they fi t within a larger fi nancing framework, analyzing their legal rights and obligations, and comparing their costs and benefi ts. The benefi ts of covered bonds {{are similar to those of}} securitization; both can access low-cost capital market funding with low risk to their investors, and both can be used to regenerate lending markets. The costs of covered bonds may be higher, though, because the “dynamic” collateral pools and “dual” recourse to the issuer that protect covered bonds shift virtually all risk to unsecured creditors. Whether that risk should be allowed to be shifted so asymmetrically is a policy question for any nascent covered bond regime...|$|E

It aims to [...] "build stronger families through (1) recruiting and strengthening parental emotional responsiveness to children, (2) accessing and clarifying children's attachment needs, and (3) facilitating and shaping caregiving interactions from parent to child".

40|$|Includes bibliographyIn {{the second}} quarter of 2002, {{conditions}} in global financial markets worsened as investor confidence deteriorated and risk aversion heightened. The revelation of corporate accounting irregularities in mature markets negatively affected investors' sentiment, causing a rebalance of portfolios in favor of higher quality assets and away from equities and low-grade bonds. Countries seen as higher risk were adversely affected by this rebalancing of portfolios. A number of Latin American countries were the focus of investors' concerns, in particular Brazil, where developments during {{the second quarter}} reflected investors' uncertainties about continuity of market friendly policies after the presidential elections, as well as worries about the possibly unsustainable dynamics of the Brazilian public sector debt. Access to international capital markets declined significantly to low-grade issuers in Latin America. Given that sovereign borrowers had covered most of their financing needs for this year, Latin American corporate borrowers, in particular, were vulnerable to the closure of international capital markets. Credit enhancements, such as <b>secured</b> <b>bond</b> issues and insurance from a third party, were required from corporate issuers in high-risk countries. By the end of the quarter, with international capital markets closed for unsecured issues, top tier corporates in Latin America started to turn to domestic markets as a source of financing. Although during most of the second quarter investors discriminated among emerging markets based on their policy stance and track record, {{toward the end of the}} quarter signs of contagion from Brazil emerged, as the correlation of emerging market bond movements with developments in Brazil increased (Table 1). In addition, contagion from Argentina was felt by neighboring countries through banking and real sector channels. A banking crisis in Uruguay was precipitated by capital outflows as liquidity constrained Argentine investors withdrew savings from their neighbor country's banks. The increased volatility in Brazil and contagion from Argentina led to a great number of credit downgrades during the second quarter. After Standard & Poor's upgraded Chile's A- foreign currency debt outlook to positive from stable in April, only downgrades followed...|$|E
40|$|New {{rules for}} bank capital {{adequacy}} {{were introduced in}} 2013. This caused a change in funding of real estate companies. The bank could not cover {{as much of the}} companies funding’s as before and they had to explore other funding opportunities, such as bonds. Bond funding in Swedish real estate companies regularly consists of unsecured corporate bonds and the secured ones are not that common. In order to cover the gap created by the bank funded parts of the companies’ capital; issuances of secured corporate bonds have to increase. Drawing from the aforementioned, this study has investigated the underlying reasons to why the secured bonds not are issued to a greater extent. The intent of the study is to increase the knowledge of how real estate companies consider whether to use unsecured or secured bonds. Further, the study is based on a deductive approach where existing theory is compared to the collected empirical facts, this to reach a conclusion. A qualitative approach has been used to create a detailed and narrow perspective of the problem formulation. Previous research has been conducted within the field of study but can only be related to the actual pricing of covered bonds, while this study presents the underlying reasons to why the attention for the product is low. Delimitations have been made to center the study around listed real estate companies with partly bond funding structures. The theoretical framework describes the theories applied to analyze the empirical facts. Our empirical evidence shows that real estate companies opt for unsecured over secured bonds. The Swedish corporate bond market is not considered to be sufficiently developed due to the great tradition of bank funding. The respondents indicate that it is considered difficult to issue a <b>secured</b> <b>bond,</b> which inhibits growth. Moreover, they clarify that the price disparity between the two options is too slight for real estate companies to include an underlying collateral in the bond. Finally, today bank funding is too good competitively priced and this is perceived as the main reason as to why the issuing of secured bonds is so low, which also is our conclusion...|$|E
