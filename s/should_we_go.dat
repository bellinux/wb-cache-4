This year we've {{come up with some}} terrific technology. And [...] a beautiful handmade wig which at that stage was the right length - <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on further we'd need to trim it back. We've looked at it really carefully. As we become more efficient it's generally about three or four hours in makeup".|$|E
500|$|Lee later lamented: [...] "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, {{sitting in}} this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian. This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... {{emotions}} are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will {{have the kind of}} warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia." [...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Jeanie, Jeanie,' cried Eleanor, turning {{round with}} a vehemence strangely {{contrasting}} with her previous language, 'wherefore <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not <b>go</b> with Glenuskie {{to be with}} Meg at Bourges?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now don't weary for us, Peterkin, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> be <b>gone</b> some time," [...] said Jack. [...] "We'll be sure {{to return}} in half-an-hour at the very latest, however {{interesting}} the cave <b>should</b> be, that <b>we</b> may relieve your mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they come}} here too {{numerous}} to fight we must fly; {{but if they are}} not too strong we will give them battle here. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to meet them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{spoke as}} an elder {{might do to}} a child. [...] "No! tell me where--exactly. Where would it be? Where <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go?</b> How should we live? Tell me. Make me see it, Stephen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> there, Uncle 'Rasmus?" [...] I cried angrily. [...] "Why shut {{ourselves}} up {{in a trap}} where the Britishers may lay hands on us whenever they may be so disposed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are no Indians {{in any of}} {{the caves}} above our heads," [...] said I. [...] "They are all used as barns and store-houses. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not <b>go</b> up now at once and spy out the land?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But, my dear fellow," [...] Morrison protested, [...] "half {{of eleven}} hundred is five hundred and fifty. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not <b>go</b> halves? That is only fair, Laverick. It is little enough. We {{ought to have}} had a great deal more." ...|$|R
60|$|Both of {{us would}} willingly have left Darbyville, but where <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go?</b> The only {{relation}} we had was an uncle,-- Captain Enos Moss,-- {{and he was on}} an extended trip to South America, and when he would return no one knew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us go a step farther. Suppose {{that all}} this should turn out true, and that you, I, and--and some lady--are in {{disguise}} {{in the midst of}} a howling mob shouting, 'Death to the Huguenots!' What should we do next? Where <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it!--I'll do it!" [...] cried Mr. Worden, hurrying {{into the}} passage, in quest {{of his hat}} and cloak. [...] "It {{is no more than}} just that you should have your own, and the supper will be either eaten, or overdone, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> for constables." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not <b>go</b> to-night?” Joyce asked. “It is {{only about}} nine o’clock now, and if we get the cocoa-nuts near here, we can make two or three {{journeys}} down to the boat with them, and be off before midnight.” ...|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to San Gabriel {{late in the}} afternoon of Christmas Day.|$|R
6000|$|... "After this <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{back to the}} station, {{and then}} came home. I thought from the map that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> through Paisley; but we did not. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> over it. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> over it, higher than {{the tops of the}} chimneys.|$|R
60|$|We now {{proceeded}} {{to put on}} all the clothes we could--frock over frock, and trousers over trousers--so as to be in readiness for removal at a moment's warning. Armed ships allow nothing superfluous to litter up the deck; and therefore, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> aboard the frigate, our chests and their contents {{would have to be}} left behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} to be harsh. If I used it, I will beg your pardon. Only let there be an end of it. As we think so {{differently}} about life in general, it was better that we should not be married. But that is settled, and why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back to words that were spoken in haste, and which are simply disagreeable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did say I {{would marry}} you, {{but it was}} wrong," [...] {{she forced herself to}} say, and she {{stiffened}} her arm as if to annul even the seeming submission of that separate part of her; [...] "for I don't love you, William; you've noticed it, every one's noticed it; why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on pretending? When I told you I loved you, I was wrong. I said what I knew to be untrue." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{a little}} more {{conversation}} I proposed to Matteo that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> out to the market-place and see the people.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> by {{the great}} road for a time, and note {{something}} {{of the difference between}} Utopian and terrestrial engineering.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's doubtful, I know it's dangerous," [...] he went on, [...] "but I am {{convinced}} that now {{we can no longer}} keep men's minds and souls in these feathered nests, these spheres of illusion. Behind these veils there is either God or the Darkness.... Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not <b>go</b> on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Such {{tears in}} her eyes, and such love in her face. I could not make my darling out. Should I go to Richard's by myself? I said. No, Ada thought I had better not go by myself. Would she go with me? Yes, Ada thought she had better go with me. <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> now? Yes, let us go now. Well, I could not {{understand}} my darling, with the {{tears in her}} eyes and the love in her face! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The first reformers had to bear such hardships. I don't exactly {{remember}} what it was that Socrates wanted to do for his ungrateful fellow-mortals; but they thought so badly of him, that they made him swallow poison. Your Galileo had a hard time when he said that the sun stood still. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> further than Jesus Christ for an example? If you are not able to bear the incidents, you should not undertake the business." ...|$|E
6000|$|Do you twit me with {{days when}} I had an Ideal, [...] And saw the sear future through {{spectacles}} green?

6000|$|... "But I've {{promised him}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> {{together}} to my lawyer to-morrow, and begin {{a suit against}} the proprietors of the 'Clarion.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We draw {{a little}} from the ship, {{according}} to rule, sir, but we can't go as many puddings latterly {{as we could}} before we touched last at the Havanna," [...] answered the laughing midshipman. [...] "There is n't a fellow among us, sir, that could pay a shore-boat for landing him, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> in again {{before the end of}} another month. I never knew such a place as Havanna. They say midshipmen's money melts there twice as soon as lieutenants' money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, now! <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on {{administering}} India if it {{were dead}} loss? No. Well, to talk about administering {{the country for the}} purpose of pocketing money is cynical, and there 's generally some truth in cynicism; but to talk about the administration of a country by which we profit, as {{if it were}} a great and good thing, is cant. I hit you in the wind for the benefit of myself--all right: law of nature; but to say it does you good at the same time is beyond me." ...|$|E
60|$|He seized {{her hand}} at this point, and--but really, reader, why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on? Is it not {{something}} like a violation of good taste to be too particular here? Is it not sufficient to say that old Mr Donnithorne came suddenly, and of course unexpectedly, on them at that critical juncture, rendering it necessary for Rose to burst away and hide her blushing face on her uncle's shoulder, while Oliver, utterly overwhelmed, turned and walked (we won't say fled) at full speed {{in the direction of}} the cove.|$|E
60|$|At last he {{proposed}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> out; and <b>we</b> {{passed in the}} street, where the shadows had begun to stretch themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, father," [...] {{continued}} Rollo, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> {{across these}} gardens, {{and keep on}} in that direction for some time, I suppose that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> come to the Arve." ...|$|R
