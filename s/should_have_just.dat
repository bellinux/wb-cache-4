[...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave it 3 out of 5, while commenting, [...] "Agneepath, less of a remake, more of a tribute. The makers of Agneepath <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> called it Dharmapath." [...] Kunal Guha of Yahoo.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying that, [...] "The biggest dilemma of remaking a movie is how much to retain and what to retain. If the new story takes violent shifts, you lose the {{audience}} who came to revisit the original. If you photocopy scene-by-scene, you risk failing to connect with the audience who is accustomed to present sensibilities. The only safe bet: a ‘khichdi’ of the past and the present, like this one." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{finding the}} right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time, the show had already begun taping around the {{character}} for two weeks. Nader spent his first weeks on All My Children working overtime to catch up. [...] "By the time we had resolved some of the terms," [...] he said, [...] "they were really against the wall in terms of back story.... In retrospect, I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day!" [...] Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene's main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes. This went on for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, [...] "They had devised this sort of 'tapestry' layered look for Dimitri {{and it was like}} doing scenes inside a sauna." [...] This was eventually rectified, but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks.|$|E

500|$|A planned film {{adaption}} of Year Zero {{became a}} television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched {{the idea to}} television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is [...] "still churning along", {{and that he had}} begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was [...] "currently in a holding state" [...] and explained, [...] "We [...] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves. [...] This project {{means a lot to me}} and will see the light of day in one form or another." [...] In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP Add Violence, Reznor said that [...] "They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer.

So we were having to promote Screaming Targets when we already had Hats Off Step Lively out here.

"The Revealing Science of God" [...] {{is based}} on the shruti class of Hindu scripture which Yogananda {{described}} as scriptures that are [...] "directly heard" [...] or [...] "revealed", in particular the Vedas. Regarding its title, Anderson said: [...] "It's always delicate to start talking about religious things ... <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been [...] "The Revealing". But I got sort of hip." [...] According to Howe, the track was originally 28 minutes in length but six minutes were cut due to the time constraints of a vinyl record. His guitar solos on the track, performed on a Gibson ES-175, were influenced by his belief that Frank Zappa performed lengthy solos [...] "because the audience wanted it. I was thinking at one stage, [...] "I'll do that. They'll love it". Anderson was inspired to open the track with voices that gradually build from listening to Gregorian chants. The ongoing Vietnam War at the time provided a source for its lyrics. The [...] "Young Christians see it..."
