50|$|The inputs to the {{algorithm}} are two waveforms represented by two data vectors containing 16 bit PCM samples. The first vector contains the {{samples of the}} (undistorted) reference signal, whereas the second vector contains the samples of the degraded signal. The POLQA algorithm consists of a temporal alignment block, a sample rate estimator of a <b>sample</b> <b>rate</b> <b>converter,</b> {{which is used to}} compensate for differences in the sample rate of the input signals, and the actual core model, which performs the MOS calculation. In a first step, the delay between the two input signals is determined and the sample rate of the two signals relative to each other is estimated. The sample rate estimation is based on the delay information calculated by the temporal alignment. If the sample rate differs by more than approximately 1%, the signal with the higher sample rate is down sampled. After each step, the results are stored together with an average delay reliability indicator, which is a measure for the quality of the delay estimation. The result from the re-sampling step, which yielded the highest overall reliability, is finally chosen. Once the correct delay is determined and the sample rate differences have been compensated, the signals and the delay information are passed on to the core model, which calculates the perceptibility as well as the annoyance of the distortions and maps them to a MOS scale. A much more detailed and comprehensive description of {{the algorithm}} can be found in. The next few sections are only intended to give an overview on the basics of POLQA’s internal structure.|$|E

Transmit/receive functionality has become an area of focus as designers attempt to address the need to move data from very high frequency sample rates to chip processing rates.

It employs low-delay finite-impulse response (FIR) and digital allpass filters to effectively reduce the system delay of the multistage decimators in SRRs. The optimal least-square and minimax designs of these low-delay FIR and allpass-based filters are formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which allows zero magnitude constraint at ω = π to be incorporated readily as additional linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By implementing the <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>converter</b> (SRC) using a variable digital filter (VDF) immediately after the integer decimators, the needs for an expensive programmable FIR filter in the traditional SRR is avoided.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 68 - 69). A fractional {{delay filter}} is a digital filter having the main function {{so as to}} delay the processed input signal as {{a fraction of the}} sampling period time. Fractional delay digital filters using the Farrow structure provide an efficient solution when real-time and variable delay of signals are required. Given the limited speed and number of multipliers on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), this thesis presents an efficient implementation of Farrow structure using the sum-of-powers-of-two (SOPOT) numerical representation of the filter coefficients. An algorithm for generating the canonical-signed-digit (CSD) numbers from their two???s complement equivalent and designing the Farrow coefficients in SOPOT form is presented. Using the SOPOT representation, multiplication by constant values can be implemented with {{a relatively small number of}} shift and addition operations. Moreover, intermediate operations can be shared among different multiplications by constant values with the help of multiplier blocks (MBs). Further optimization of the fractional delay filter is done by using sub-expression elimination and cut-set retiming. Another goal of the thesis is to efficiently implement fractional delay filters for <b>sample</b> <b>rate</b> conversion.

Present systems, while they work electronically, pose problems with regards to modulation overshoots due to <b>sample</b> <b>rate</b> <b>converters</b> and the connection method of using AES/EBU. This has been researched and documented with numerous exciters and audio processors. This problem is not limited to just one type of configuration or specific product.

What is the point of a clear, digital transmission if the source is “dirty”? Modulation performance of digital exciters for the analog, or conventional channel, continues to under-whelm broadcasters. We have found that using AES/EBU between the output of an FM audio processor and input to a digital exciter can cause modulation overshoots. This is not a unique problem to one specific processor or exciter. The fundamental problem with AES/EBU connectivity is that the audio is in separate left and right audio channels, forcing the exciter to perform the multiplex stereo generator function.

40|$|Modern {{embedded}} systems {{need to support}} multiple time-constrained multimedia applications that often employ multiprocessor-systems-on-chip (MPSoCs). Such systems need to be optimized for resource usage and energy consumption. It is well understood that a design-time approach cannot provide timing guarantees for all the applications due to its inability to cater for dynamism in applications. However, a runtime approach consumes large computation requirements at runtime and hence may not lend well to constrained-aware mapping. In this article, we present a hybrid approach for efficient mapping of applications in such systems. For each application to be supported in the system, the approach performs extensive design-space exploration (DSE) at design time to derive multiple design points representing throughput and energy consumption at different resource combinations. One of these points is selected at runtime efficiently, depending upon the desired throughput while optimizing for energy consumption and resource usage. While most of the existing DSE strategies consider a fixed multiprocessor platform architecture, our DSE considers a generic architecture, making DSE results applicable to any target platform. All the compute-intensive analysis is performed during DSE, which leaves for minimum computation at runtime. The approach is capable of handling dynamism in applications by considering their runtime aspects and providing timing guarantees. The presented approach is used {{to carry out a}} DSE case study for models of real-life multimedia applications: H. 263 decoder, H. 263 encoder, MPEG- 4 decoder, JPEG decoder, <b>sample</b> <b>rate</b> <b>converter,</b> and MP 3 decoder.

Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach provides faster DSE, better design points, and efficient runtime mapping when compared to other approaches. In particular, we show that DSE is faster by 832 ̆ 6 amp;percnt; and runtime mapping is accelerated by 932 ̆ 6 amp;percnt; for some cases. Further, we study the scalability of the approach by considering applications with large numbers of tasks...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} design, signal round-off noise, and {{complexity}} optimization {{of a new}} digital intermediate frequency (IF) architecture for a software radio receiver (SRR). The IF under study consists of digital filters with fixed coefficients, except for {{a limited number of}} multipliers required in the Farrow-based <b>sampling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>converter</b> (SRC). The fixed-coefficient filters can be implemented efficiently using sum-of-power-of-two (SOPOT) coefficients and the multiplier- block technique, which gives minimum adder realization. Apart from the multipliers required in the SRC, the digital IF can be implemented without any multiplications. While most multiplier- less filter design and realization methods address only the coefficient round-off problem by minimizing the number of SOPOT terms used, the proposed design methodology aims to minimize more realistic hardware complexity measure, such as adder cells and registers, of the digital IF subject to a given spectral and accuracy specifications. The motivation is that the complexity is closely related to the target output accuracy, which is specified statistically by its total output noise power generated by rounding the intermediate data. Two novel algorithms for optimizing the internal wordlengths of linear time-invariant systems are proposed. The first one relaxes the solution to real valued and formulates the design problem as a constrained optimization. A closed-form solution can be determined by the Lagrange multiplier method. The second one is based on a discrete optimization method called the Marginal Analysis method, and it yields the desired wordlengths in integer values. Both approaches are found to be effective and suitable to large scale systems.
