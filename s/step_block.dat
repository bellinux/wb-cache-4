50|$|Human uses of {{serration}} have copied, {{and gone}} beyond, {{those found in}} nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other serrated blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to cut cloth with a serrated edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing {{the average length of}} a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show serration in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made with serrated edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The step clamp and <b>step</b> <b>block</b> assembly in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.|$|E

Their main application is in gas turbines, chemical industry, and in all those cases where resistance to creep and the aggressive corrosion environment is required. Modern jet engines could never come into use if not for progress in the development of superalloys. Superalloys are based on iron, nickel and cobalt. The most common and the most interesting group includes superalloys based on nickel. They carry loads at temperatures well in excess of the eighty percent of the melting point.

40|$|Abstract — The {{amount of}} energy {{consumed}} for interconnect-ing the IP-blocks is increasing significantly due to the subopti-mal scaling of long wires. To limit this energy penalty, segmented buses have gained interest in the architectural community. How-ever, the netlist topology and the physical design stage signifi-cantly influence the final communication energy cost. We present in this paper an automated way to implement a netlist consist-ing of hard macro blocks, which are interconnected with heavily segmented buses in an energy optimal fashion for communication. We optimize the network wires energy dissipation in two separate, but related steps: minimizing the number of segments for active communication paths at the first <b>step</b> (<b>block</b> ordering), followed by the activity aware floorplanning step to minimize the physical length of these segments. Energy gains of up to a factor of 4 are achieved compared to a standard system implementation using a shared bus.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} heat transfer between the flame and the flame-holder on the dynamic stability characteristics in a 50 -kW backward facing step combustor. We conducted tests where we use a backward <b>step</b> <b>block</b> made of two different materials: ceramic and stainless steel whose thermal conductivities are 1. 06 and 12 W/m/K, respectively. A set of experiments was conducted using a propane/air mixture at Re = 6500 for the inlet temperature of 300 - 500 K at atmospheric pressure. We measure the dynamic pressure and flame chemiluminescence to examine distinct stability characteristics using each flame-holder material over a range of operating conditions. We find that for tests with a flame-holder made of ceramic, the onset of instability is significantly delayed in time and, for certain operating conditions, disappears altogether. Stated differently, for certain operating conditions, the combustor can be stabilized by reducing the thermal conductivity of the flame-holder. As the thermal conductivity of the flame-holder increases, the combustor becomes increasingly unstable over a range of operating conditions. These results imply that the dynamic stability characteristics depend strongly on the heat transfer between the flame and the combustor wall near the flame anchoring region.

Generalized CrossValidation or unbiased risk estimation is used to empirically assess the amount of smoothing (which controls the bias and variance trade-off) at each one-step Block SOR-Newton-Raphson iteration.

40|$|Abstract — Floorplanning is an {{essential}} design step for hierarchical building module design methodology. Floorplanning provides early feedback that evaluates architectural decisions, estimates chip area, estimates delay and congestion caused by wiring. As technology advances, design complexity is increasing and the circuit size is getting larger. To cope with the increasing design complexity, hierarchical design and Intellectual Property modules are widely used. This makes floorplanning much more critical {{to the quality of}} a Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design. For many years, floorplanning is a critical step, as it sets up the ground work for a layout. However, it is computationally quite hard. The process of determining block shapes and positions with area minimization objective and aspect ratio requirement is referred to as floorplanning. Common strategy for blocks floorplanning is to determine in the first phase and then the relative location of the blocks to each other based on connection-cost criteria. In the second <b>step,</b> <b>block</b> sizing is performed with the goal of minimizing the overall chip area and the location of each block is finalized. From the computational point of view, VLSI floorplanning is NP-hard. The solution space will increase exponentially with the growth of circuits scale, thus it is difficult to find the optimal solution by exploring the global solution space. To handle this complexity swarm based optimization method has opted in this proposed work. A generalize solution has developed to take care of area as well as interconnection wire length. To achieve this weighted objective function has defined.

40|$|<b>Stepped</b> <b>block</b> {{protection}} has considerable {{potential as}} a low-cost method {{for the construction of}} chute spillways and the protection of embankments from erosion by overtopping flow. Stepped spillways are structurally stable, resistant to water loads and significantly increase the rate of energy dissipation on the spillway face thus eliminating or greatly reducing the need for a large energy dissipation basin at the spillway toe. It can also be readily adopted for use in diversion works during dam construction and for providing additional spillway capacity to existing dams. While constructing stepped spillway over embankment dam, the <b>stepped</b> <b>block</b> is used in conjunction with an under layer which incorporates a free draining medium and a lower zone which has the function of filtering seepage flow out of the subsoil and also protecting the subsoil from erosion by flow in the draining layer.

40|$|Microcirculation {{has become}} a key factor for the study and {{assessment}} of tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Detection and assessment of the microvasculature using videomicroscopy from the oral mucosa provides a metric on the density of blood vessels in each single frame. Information pertaining to the density of these microvessels within a field of view {{can be used to}} quantitatively monitor and assess the changes occurring in tissue oxygenation and perfusion over time. Automated analysis of this information can be used for real-time diagnostic and therapeutic planning of a number of clinical applications including resuscitation. The objective {{of this study is to}} design an automated image processing system to segment microvessels, estimate the density of blood vessels in video recordings, and identify the distribution of blood flow. The proposed algorithm consists of two main stages: video processing and image segmentation. The first step of video processing is stabilization. In the video stabilization <b>step,</b> <b>block</b> matching is applied to the video frames. Similarity is measured by cross-correlation coefficients. The main technique used in the segmentation step is multi-thresholding and pixel verification based on calculated geometric and contrast parameters. Segmentation results and differences of video frames are then used to identify the capillaries with blood flow. After categorizing blood vessels as active or passive, according to the amount of blood flow, quantitative measures identifying microcirculation are calculated. The algorithm is applied to the videos obtained using Microscan Side-stream Dark Field (SDF) imaging technique captured from healthy and critically ill humans/animals. Segmentation results were compared and validated using a blind detailed inspection by experts who used a commercial semi-automated image analysis software program, AVA (Automated Vascular Analysis). The algorithm was found to extract approximately 97 % of functionally active capillaries and blood vessels in every frame. The aim of this study is to eliminate the human interaction, increase accuracy and reduce the computation time. The proposed method is an entirely automated process that can perform stabilization, pre-processing, segmentation, and microvessel identification without human intervention. The method may allow for assessment of microcirculatory abnormalities occurring in critically ill and injured patients including close to real-time determination of the adequacy of resuscitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{great promise}} that gene therapy holds is the {{opportunity}} of directly introducing genetic material into cells for a causal therapy of yet incurable diseases. One promising way to achieve that goal is the usage of non-viral delivery vehicles, constructed from amphiphilic block copolymers. This thesis presents {{the establishment of a}} multifunctional PEG-PCL-PEI block copolymer platform, designed for multifunctional gene delivery. Across the scientific disciplines of chemistry, chemical physics, pharmacy and biomedicine the underlying work covers all aspects of non-viral gene delivery: In a first <b>step,</b> <b>block</b> copolymers were synthesised and characterised. In a systematic approach a library of compounds with varying hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio was established. Subsequently, polymers were assembled into gene carriers followed by a non-invasive structural characterisation. Most importantly it was noticed, that polymers hydrophilic in nature formed smaller micelle-like carriers, whereas hydrophobic polymers aggregated to larger particle-like assemblies. In that vein, carrier features such as colloidal stability and toxicity were found to depend on chemical composition. Second, the nucleic acid loading process was optimised. Herein it was the overall goal to manufacture compactly condensed carrier complexes by understanding the basic principles of the electrostatic loading procedure. It was hypothesised that a more homogeneous fusion of charges is supposed to lead to superior carrier complexes. In that line, a microfluidic mixing technique, bringing cationic polymer and nucleic acid together at a constant ratio during the entire mixing process, was found to be the most promising technique. Ultimately, gene delivery carriers with superior colloidal stability, RNA protection and transfection efficiency were manufactured and process parameters were optimised {{with the help of a}} central composite design. Third, as a prerequisite for effective in vivo usage, carriers were transferred into stable ready-to-use formulations by lyophilisation with the help of glucose as a lyoprotectant. Unloaded nano-suspensions could be restored after rehydration by addition of small amounts of glucose. Upon loading of those rehydrated carriers, no significant difference in complex size or transfection efficiency was observed as compared to freshly-prepared ones. Moreover, the stabilisation of pre-formed carrier/siRNA complexes is feasible at elevated N/P and higher glucose concentrations. Fourth, most promising carriers where tested for their in vitro and in vivo transfection efficiency. Vectors constructed from rather hydrophobic block copolymers showed superior transfection efficiency, whereas poor performance was found in case of predominantly hydrophilic ones in a good correlation in vitro and in vivo. FACS studies revealed that this might possibly be due to reduced cell uptake of carriers with thicker PEG shell preventing cell interaction. In that way a yet active vector with diminished toxicity as compared to PEI homopolymers was evaluated. Fluorescent microscopy images of murine lung tissue revealed emission predominantly in the alveolar region, rendering this carrier system as promising for local treatment of airway diseases. Finally, the feasibility of multifunctional carrier co-loading and FRET-monitored nucleic acid unpacking was approved. Double-labelled nano-carriers emitted light at the acceptor’s emission wavelength upon donor excitation, proving successful FRET-effect and hence, complex integrity. The ability of dual loading is especially useful for “theranostic” purposes or co-delivery of nucleic acids and drugs. FRET-switching functionality may be advantageous for monitoring complex stability and nucleic acid unpacking. In view of prospective experiments, to circumvent the observed charge-toxicity-relationship, carriers are supposed to be taken up by the target tissue in a selective way. This can be achieved, up to a certain degree, via targeting ligands. Rather hydrophilic carriers with thicker PEG shells, increased colloidal stability and reduced toxicity represent the ideal candidates for this modification. In the long term, required work is evident: the development of more effective non-viral vectors and conquering the yet severe toxicity effects of current delivery systems. By a deeper understanding in the mechanistic aspects of the gene delivery process plus a rational vector design we are on the right track to achieve that goal...|$|E
