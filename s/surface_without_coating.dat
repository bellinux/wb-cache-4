Non-conventional structure DSCs have been developed by the fabricated CEs. The Pt metal was sputtered onto one surface of the membrane as the catalytic material. DSCs were assembled by attaching the TiO 2 electrode to the membrane <b>surface</b> <b>without</b> Pt <b>coating.</b> The membrane was with cylindrical pore geometry.

Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate and compare the fluoride release from conventional glass ionomer cement with and <b>without</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> agent. Settings and Design: This in vitro study comprised of total 80 samples (40 samples of each with and <b>without</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coating).</b> Materials and Methods: Specimens were prepared, G coat plus was applied and light cured. Fluoride release of the sample was measured every 24 h for 7 days and weekly from 7 th to 21 st day using Sension 4 pH/ISE/MV Meter. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive Statistics, Repeated Measure ANOVA, Paired Sample t-test, Independent Sample t-test, Scheffe post hoc test. Results: Mean values clearly reveal a significant decrease in the fluoride release from day 1 to day 21 for both groups. Non-coated group released significantly more fluoride than surface coated group (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: It can be concluded that nanofilled surface coating agent will reduce the amount of fluoride released into oral environment as compared to non-coated group and at the same time releasing fluoride into surrounding cavity walls to create zones of inhibition into the cavity floor to help internal remineralization...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} modifications of sapphire (0 0 0 1) <b>surface</b> with and <b>without</b> <b>coating,</b> induced {{by a single}} laser pulse with a 1054 nm wavelength, 2. 2 µs sources duration, 7. 75 mm spot and energy of 20 – 110 J. A holographic optical element was used for smoothing the drive beam spatially, but it induced small hotspots which initiated damage on the uncoated and coated surfaces. The individual damage effects of hotspots became less pronounced at high fluences. Due to high temperature and elevated non-hydrostatic stresses upon laser irradiation, damage occurred as fracture, spallation, basal and rhombohedral twinning, melting, vitrification, the formation of nanocrystalline phases, and solid–solid phase transition. The extent of damage increased with laser fluences. The formation of regular linear patterns with three-fold symmetry (1 1 2 ^[bar] 0) upon fracture was due to rhombohedral twinning. Nanocrystalline α-Al_ 2 O_ 3 formed possibly from vapor deposition on the coated surface and manifested linear, triangular and spiral growth patterns. Glass and minor amounts of γ-Al_ 2 O_ 3 also formed from rapid quenching of the melt on this side. The α- to γ-Al_ 2 O_ 3 transition was observed on the uncoated surface in some partially spalled alumina, presumably caused by shearing. The nominal threshold for laser-induced damage is about 47 J cm^(− 2) for these laser pulses, and it is about 94 J cm^(− 2) at the hotspots...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods and}} {{procedures}} for the determination of particle density of pellets and briquettes were tested and evaluated. Round robin trials were organized involving five European laboratories, which measured the particle densities of 15 pellet and five briquette types. The test included stereometric methods, methods based on liquid displacement (hydrostatic and buoyancy) applying different procedures and one method based on solid displacement. From the results for both pellets and briquettes, {{it became clear that}} the application of a method based on either liquid or solid displacement (only tested on pellet samples) leads to an improved reproducibility compared to a stereometric method. For both, pellets and briquettes, the variability of measurements strongly depends on the fuel type itself. For briquettes, the three methods tested based on liquid displacement lead to similar results. A coating of the samples with paraffin did not improve the repeatability and the reproducibility. Determinations with pellets proved to be most reliable when the buoyancy method was applied using a wetting agent to reduce <b>surface</b> tensions <b>without</b> sample <b>coating.</b> This method gave the best values for repeatability and reproducibility, thus less replications are required to reach a given accuracy level.

The present study describes a new image reconstruction algorithm comparing the results of bone-to-implant contact (BIC) evaluated by means of µCT with histomorphometry data. Custom-made conical titanium alloyed (Ti 6 Al 4 V) implants were inserted in the distal tibial bone of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Different surface configurations were examined: Ti 6 Al 4 V implants with plasma-polymerized allylamine (PPAAm) coating and plasma-polymerized ethylenediamine (PPEDA) coating as well as implants <b>without</b> <b>surface</b> <b>coating.</b> After six weeks postoperatively, tibiae were explanted and BIC was determined by µCT (3 D) and afterwards by histomorphometry (2 D). In comparison to uncoated Ti 6 Al 4 V implants demonstrating low BIC of 32. 4 % (histomorphometry) and 51. 3 % (µCT), PPAAm and PPEDA coated implants showed a nonsignificant increase in BIC (histomorphometry: 45. 7 % and 53. 5 % and µCT: 51. 8 % and 62. 0 %, resp.). Mean BIC calculated by µCT was higher for all surface configurations compared to BIC detected by histomorphometry. Overall, a high correlation coefficient of 0. 70 (p< 0. 002) was found between 3 D and 2 D quantification of BIC.

40|$|The {{surfaces}} of nanotube arrays were coated with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) using an imprinting method with an anodized alumina membrane as the template. The prepared nanotube array surfaces then either remained untreated or were coated with NH 2 (CH 2) 3 Si(OCH 3) 3 (PDNS) or CF 3 (CF 2) 7 CH 2 CH 2 Si(OC 2 H 5) 3 (PFO). Thus, nanotube arrays {{with three different}} <b>surfaces,</b> PDNS, PMMA (<b>without</b> <b>coating),</b> and PFO, were obtained. All three surfaces (PDNS, PMMA, and PFO) exhibited superhydrophobic properties with contact angles (CA) of 155, 166, and 1680, respectively, and their intrinsic water contact angles were 30, 79, and 1180, respectively. The superhydrophobic stabilities of these three surfaces were examined under dynamic impact and static pressures {{in terms of the}} transition from the Cassie-Baxter mode to the Wenzel mode. This transition was determined by the maximum pressure (pmax), which is dependent on the intrinsic contact angle and the nanotube density of the surface. A pmax greater than 10 kPa, which is sufficiently large to maintain stable superhydrophobicity under extreme weather conditions, such as in heavy rain, was expected from the PFO surface. Interestingly, the PDNS surface, with an intrinsic CA of only 300, also displayed superhydrophobicity, with a CA of 1550. This property was partially maintained under the dynamic impact and static pressure tests. However, under an extremely high pressure (0. 5 MPa), all three surfaces transitioned from the Cassie-Baxter mode to the Wenzel mode. Furthermore, the lost superhydrophobicity could not be recovered by simply relieving the pressure. This result indicates {{that the best way to}} maintain superhydrophobicity is to increase the pmax of the surface to a value higher than the applied external pressure by using low surface energy materials and having high-density binary nano-/microstructures on the surface. 9 2014 American Chemical Society.
