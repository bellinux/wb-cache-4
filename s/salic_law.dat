5|$|Liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture (aka <b>Salic</b> <b>law),</b> which {{completely}} excludes {{women from}} the order of succession unless there are no male heirs of any kind present, and was criticised for this by a United Nations committee for this perceived gender equality issue in November 2007.|$|E
5|$|Since 1714, Britain {{had shared}} a monarch with Hanover in Germany, but under <b>Salic</b> <b>law</b> women were {{excluded}} from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited all the British dominions, Hanover passed instead to her father's younger brother, her unpopular uncle the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who became King of Hanover. He was her heir presumptive until she married and had a child.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under <b>Salic</b> <b>law,</b> where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory {{and not have to}} share it with his brothers.|$|E
5000|$|To this end, and by extension, he {{nominated}} his own men {{of confidence}} (since the <b>Salic</b> <b>Laws</b> only permitted {{the transfer of}} title to legitimate male heirs) that would directly oversea the activities in his place. These [...] "captains" [...] or capitães dos donatários (captains of the donataries) would govern in his place, endowed with certain privileges that facilitated their stewardship and rewarded their active development of the territory. The captaincies were, therefore, a scaled-down version of the donatário system.|$|R
5|$|The same year, George {{married his}} first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby {{securing}} additional incomes {{that would have}} been outside <b>Salic</b> <b>laws.</b> The marriage of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother was at first against the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's mother (who was not of royal birth), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.|$|R

5|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, Luxembourg was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this was not possible in Luxembourg due {{to the order of}} succession being based on <b>Salic</b> <b>law</b> at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Augustus (5 June 1771– 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 {{until his}} death. He {{was the fifth}} son and eighth child of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, Ernest seemed {{unlikely}} to become a monarch, but none of his four elder brothers had a legitimate son who survived infancy. The <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> which barred succession to or through a female, prevailed in Hanover; therefore, when his elder brother King William IV died in 1837, Ernest succeeded him as King of Hanover. In the United Kingdom the succession to the monarchy was determined by primogeniture and his niece Victoria succeeded to the throne, thus ending the personal union between the British and Hanoverian crowns that had existed since 1714.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, {{had been through}} two {{unsuccessful}} marriages, and {{was assumed to be}} infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the <b>Salic</b> <b>law</b> prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E

5000|$|If {{a person}} not native to England {{comes to the}} throne, England will not wage war for [...] "any dominions or territories which {{do not belong to}} the Crown of England, without the consent of Parliament". This was far-sighted, because when a member of the House of Hanover ascended the British throne, he would retain the territories of the Electorate of Hanover in what is now Lower Saxony, then part of the Holy Roman Empire. This {{provision}} has been dormant since Queen Victoria ascended the throne, because she did not inherit Hanover under the <b>Salic</b> <b>Laws</b> of the German-speaking states.|$|R
5|$|On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, {{confirmed}} her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen {{gave birth}} to a daughter, who was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. The birth of a girl came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since <b>Salic</b> <b>Law</b> excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette {{gave birth to}} the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the queen's brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.|$|E
5|$|The Order {{remained}} in collateral {{branches of the}} family of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg until 1521, when the male line holding the two duchies and the county of Ravensberg became extinct. A daughter, Maria von Geldern, remained to inherit the duchies and the county, but, under the <b>Salic</b> <b>law</b> practiced in the northwestern German states, women could only hold property through a husband or guardian. Consequently, the territories passed to her husband—who was also her distant relative—John III, Duke of Cleves and Mark. The couple had three daughters, one of whom, Ann of Cleves, married Henry VIII of England in 1540, and one son, Wilhelm, who subsequently inherited the duchies and the administration of the Order. The duchies included most of the present-day North Rhine-Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and Münster. Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{the only}} member of the family thought to be able to beget children. His wife gave birth to a posthumous son in September, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux, nicknamed Dieudonné (God-given) by the Bourbons because he was thought to have secured the future of the dynasty. However the Bourbon {{succession}} was still in doubt. The Chamber of Deputies proposed amending <b>Salic</b> <b>law</b> to allow the Duchess of Angoulême to accede to the throne. On 12 June 1820, the Chambers ratified legislation that increased the number of deputies from 258 to 430. The extra deputies were to be elected by the wealthiest quarter of the population in each département. These individuals now effectively had two votes. Around the same time as the “law of the two votes”, Louis XVIII began to receive visits every Wednesday from a lady named Zoé Talon, and ordered that nobody should disturb him while he was with her. It was rumoured that he inhaled snuff from her breasts, which earned her the nickname of tabatière (snuffbox). In 1823, France embarked on a military intervention in Spain, where a revolt had occurred against the King Ferdinand VII. France succeeded in crushing the rebellion, an effort headed by the Duke of Angoulême.|$|E
2500|$|Paying fines {{broke the}} society into {{economic}} and social demographics in that the wealthy were free {{to do as much}} as they could afford, whereas the fines themselves placed different values on the gender and ethnic demographics. [...] This social capital is evident in the differences in the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law's</b> punishment for murder based on a woman's ability to bear children. Women who could bear children were protected by a 600 shilling fine while the fine for murdering a woman who could no longer bear children was only 200 shillings. It is also interesting that all crimes committed against Romans had lesser fines than other social classes.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Calenberg-Celle and its {{possessions}} {{were added}} to by the Congress of Vienna ending the Napoleonic war, being born anew under the name of Kingdom of Hanover (including Brunswick-Lüneburg). During {{the first half of the}} 19th century, the Kingdom of Hanover was ruled as personal union by the British crown from its creation under George III of the United Kingdom, the last elector of Hanover until the death of William IV in 1837. At that point, the crown of Hanover went to William's younger brother, Ernest, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale under the <b>Salic</b> <b>laws</b> requiring the next male heir to inherit, whereas the British throne was inherited by an elder brother's only daughter, Queen Victoria.|$|R

5|$|Queen Adelaide {{attended}} the dying William devotedly, {{not going to}} bed herself {{for more than ten}} days. William IV died {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent, the only child of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, George III's fourth son. Under <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan. Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, author and statesman Duff Cooper, and the first Duke of Fife, who married Queen Victoria's granddaughter Louise.|$|E
5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the jewels to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the jewels, claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels, but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E
25|$|The {{law of the}} Ripuarians {{contains}} 89 chapters {{and falls}} into three heterogeneous divisions. Chapters 1-31 consist of a scale of compositions; but, although the fines are calculated, not on the unit of 15 solidi, as in the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> but on that of 18 solidi, {{it is clear that}} this part is already influenced by the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law.</b> Chapters 32-64 are taken directly from the Salic Law; the provisions follow the same arrangement; the unit of the compositions is 15 solidi; but capitularies are interpolated relating to the affranchisement and sale of immovable property. Chapters 65-89 consist of provisions of various kinds, some taken from lost capitularies and from the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> and others of unknown origin.|$|E
50|$|In 1509, John III, Duke of Cleves, made a {{strategic}} marriage to Maria von Geldern, daughter of William IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg, who became heiress to her father's estates: Jülich, Berg and the County of Ravensberg, which under the <b>Salic</b> <b>laws</b> of the Holy Roman Empire caused the properties to {{pass to the}} husband of the female heir (women could not hold property except through a husband or a guardian). With {{the death of her}} father in 1521 the Dukes of Jülich-Berg became extinct, and the estate thus came under the rule of John III, Duke of Cleves — along with his personal territories, the County of the Mark and the Duchy of Cleves (Kleve) in a personal union. As a result of this union the dukes of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg controlled much of present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, {{with the exception of the}} clerical states of the Archbishop of Cologne and of the Bishop of Münster.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Catholic League, led by Henry of Guise, a {{childhood}} friend of Henry III, began {{to worry about the}} succession. The Catholic King Henry III was childless, and {{after the death of his}} younger brother Francis of Anjou in 1584, according to the <b>Salic</b> <b>Laws</b> the Protestant Henry of Navarre was the next in line of succession, being a descendant of thirteenth-century King Louis IX. Within the Catholic faction, particularly among residents of Paris, there was support for a takeover of the throne by Henry of Guise. In 1588, after a military victory over Henry of Navarre, Guise entered Paris, where he was greeted royally by the people. Henry III was forced to withdraw to the Louvre. After the French States-General proved unwilling to support him against De Guise, Henry III had Guise assassinated on 23 December 1588. The following year he reconciled with Henry of Navarre. Together they defeated the radical Catholic armies of the Catholic League and then besieged Paris, where the Catholic faction was still in power. On August 1, 1589, Henry III was fatally stabbed by a fanatical monk named Jacques Clement. Henry III died the next day from his injuries.|$|R
5000|$|The Captains were agents {{named by}} the Dontário, and after 1495, by the Crown, to a {{lifetime}} title that was passed down by the [...] "legitimate male heirs". As administrators, the Captains enjoyed various judicial and economic privileges that provided an incentive to settle and develop their captaincies. They {{had the authority to}} administer sentences, with the exception of those involving penalties of death or mutilation. Economically, they had the exclusive authority to mill, bake bread and sell salt, in addition to their entitlement to receive rent paid to the King for lands, fees and taxes due. In addition, they could receive a tithe (the tenth portion) paid to the captaincy directly. In addition to the regalia of office, the captains-major would hold title to the best parcels of lands and be able to contract renters to the donatárias (lands of the Donatários), {{in the name of the}} crown. Many of the donatários were hereditary, with a few exceptions, referred in the <b>Salic</b> <b>Laws</b> (Leis Sálicas) of the time; these laws regulated all aspects of life, including crime, taxation, indemnity, and female inheritance. The Captains were less restricted to these conditions.|$|R
25|$|Pharamond is {{mentioned}} in William Shakespeare's Henry V, Act I, Scene 2, as the originator of the <b>Salic</b> <b>law</b> banning women from succession {{to the throne}} of France.|$|E
25|$|On {{the death}} of King Henry III of France, who had no son, the crown passed to Henry IV, in {{application}} of <b>Salic</b> <b>law,</b> because Henry was the descendant of the eldest surviving male line of the Capetian dynasty.|$|E
25|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte forced Ferdinand VII to abdicate in 1808 and the Bourbons {{became a}} focus of popular {{resistance}} against French rule. However, Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812, his ministerial appointments, particularly the exclusion of liberals, gradually eroded popular support for the Spanish monarchy. With the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830, Ferdinand set aside the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> introduced by Philip V, that prohibited women from becoming sovereigns of Spain. Thereby, as had been customary {{before the arrival of}} the Bourbons, the Ferdinand VII's eldest daughter Isabella became his heiress presumptive. Opponents of the Pragmatic Sanction argued that it was never officially promulgated, claiming Ferdinand VII's younger brother, Prince Carlos, the rightful heir to the crown according to the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pons (II) William (991 [...] - [...] 1060) was the Count of Toulouse from 1037. He was {{the eldest}} son and {{successor}} of William III Taillefer and Emma of Provence.

50|$|In 1269 the duchy was divided, Albert {{receiving}} {{the southern part}} of the state around Brunswick and John the northern territories in the area of Lüneburg. The towns of Lüneburg and Brunswick remained in the overall possession of the House of Welf until 1512 and 1671 respectively. In 1571 the Amt of Calvörde became an exclave of the Duchy. The various parts of the duchy were further divided and re-united over the centuries, all of them being ruled by the Welf or Guelph dynasty, who maintained close relations with one another—not infrequently by marrying cousins— a practice far more common than is the case today, even among the peasantry of the Holy Roman Empire, for the <b>salic</b> inheritance <b>laws</b> in effect, encouraged the practice of retaining control of lands and benefits. The seats of power moved in the meantime from Brunswick and Lüneburg to Celle and Wolfenbüttel as the towns asserted their independence.|$|R
5000|$|The word baron {{comes from}} the Old French baron, from a Late Latin baro [...] "man; servant, soldier, mercenary" [...] (so used in <b>Salic</b> Law; Alemannic <b>Law</b> has barus in the same sense). The scholar Isidore of Seville in the 7th century thought the word was from Greek βαρύς [...] "heavy" [...] (because of the [...] "heavy work" [...] done by mercenaries), but the word is presumably of Old Frankish origin, cognate with Old English [...] meaning [...] "warrior, nobleman". Cornutus {{in the first century}} already reports a word barones which he took to be of Gaulish origin. He glosses it as meaning servos militum and {{explains}} it as meaning [...] "stupid", by reference to classical Latin bārō [...] "simpleton, dunce"; because of this early reference, the word has also been suggested to derive from an otherwise unknown Celtic *bar, but the Oxford English Dictionary takes this to be [...] "a figment".|$|R
25|$|At Rene de Challant's death without male heirs in 1565, his {{property}} passed to his son-in-law Giovanni Federico Madruzzo {{who was married}} to his daughter Isabel, beginning a long legal conflict with other male members of the Challant family, once again based on the <b>Salic</b> <b>law,</b> under which Isabel could not inherity her father's property.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, {{upon the}} {{coronation}} of Queen Victoria, the personal {{union of the}} United Kingdom and Hanover ended {{as a result of}} differing succession laws. In terms of <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> Hanover could only be inherited by a male heir, with the result that Hanover's throne was inherited by Victoria's uncle Ernest Augustus, younger brother of King William IV.|$|E
25|$|The affair {{badly damaged}} the {{reputation}} of women in senior French circles, contributing to {{the way that the}} <b>Salic</b> <b>Law</b> was implemented during subsequent arguments over the succession to the throne. When Louis died unexpectedly in 1316, supporters of his eldest daughter Joan found that suspicions hung over her parentage following the scandal and that the French nobility were increasingly cautious over the concept of a woman inheriting the throne – Louis' brother, Philip took power instead. Philip died unexpectedly young as well, and his younger brother Charles did not live long after remarrying after his coronation, similarly dying without male heirs. The interpretation of the <b>Salic</b> <b>Law</b> then placed the French succession in doubt. Despite Philip of Valois, the son of Charles of Valois, claiming the throne with French noble support, Edward III of England, the son of Isabella was able to press his own case, resulting in the ensuing Hundred Years War (1337–1453).|$|E
25|$|All {{these laws}} may be {{described}} in general as codes of governmental procedure and tariffs of compositions. They all present somewhat similar features with <b>Salic</b> <b>law,</b> the best-known example, but often differ from it in the date of compilation, the amounts of fines, the number {{and nature of the}} crimes, the number, rank, duties and titles of the officers, etc.|$|E
25|$|The Duchy of Burgundy {{was also}} {{claimed by the}} French crown under <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> with Louis XI, King of France vigorously contesting the Habsburg claim to the Burgundian {{inheritance}} by means of military force. Maximilian undertook the defence of his wife's dominions from an attack by Louis XI and defeated the French forces at Guinegate, the modern Enguinegatte, on 7 August 1479.|$|E
25|$|The fragile {{compromise}} {{came to an}} end in 1584, {{when the}} King's youngest brother and heir presumptive, François, Duke of Anjou, died. As Henry III had no son, under <b>Salic</b> <b>Law,</b> the next heir to the throne was the Calvinist Prince Henry of Navarre. Under pressure from the Duke of Guise, Henry III reluctantly issued an edict suppressing Protestantism and annulling Henry of Navarre's right to the throne.|$|E
