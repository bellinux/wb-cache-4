2500|$|When {{asked by}} Moshe Zupnik why he risked {{his career to}} save other people, he said simply : [...] "I do it just because I have pity on the people. They {{want to get out}} <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> them have the visas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hardaway continued, ‘You know, I hate {{gay people}}, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> it be known,’ Hardaway said. ‘I don't like gay people and I don't {{like to be}} around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|World War I {{brought a}} crisis in his development. Military service {{disrupted}} his life when {{at the age of}} 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped [...] "beginnings". On one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was [...] "this notorious Schoenberg, then"; Schoenberg replied: [...] "Beg to report, sir, yes. Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> it be me" [...] (according to Norman , this is a reference to Schoenberg's apparent [...] "destiny" [...] as the [...] "Emancipator of Dissonance").|$|E

6000|$|... 'You're a gentleman, by G--!' was {{his first}} remark, as he slapped him on the back. 'You're a gentleman in disguise. <b>So</b> am <b>I.</b> <b>Let's</b> swear a friendship.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You, sir! She owes all to you; and <b>so</b> do <b>I.</b> <b>Let</b> me go below, sir. My old wits are shaky. Bless you, sir, {{and thank}} you for ever and ever!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 1985, Ant {{secured a}} {{spot at the}} Live Aid concert – the first live {{performance}} of the [...] "Ant/Marco/Wiczling/De Niro" [...] band – but was asked to cut his set to one song, for which he chose his new single, the Vive le Rock title track Ant later claimed to regret playing the fundraiser, saying, [...] "I was asked by Sir Bob to promote this concert. They had no idea they could sell it out. Then in Bob's book, he said, 'Adam was over the hill <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him have one number.'... Doing that show was the biggest f**king mistake in the world. Knighthoods were made, Bono got it made, {{and it was a}} waste of f**king time. It was the end of rock 'n' roll." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> Charley cry {{a little}} longer, {{and it did}} us both good.|$|E
60|$|I didn't care to meet him, and I couldn't {{well get}} down, <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> the Waler have it, and {{we headed for}} the town.|$|E

6000|$|... "Didn't I tell you, mother, {{that she}} was funny? I'll explain to you what she said when we are alone; but Addi-lay is hungry now, and <b>so</b> am <b>I.</b> <b>Let</b> us feed, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her mamma came up long ago, but {{the dear}} thing was fast asleep, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> her be disturbed, and Mrs. Carrol went away again," [...] {{said the old}} woman, rousing from a nap.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither do I mine," [...] {{said the}} Heavy Friend. [...] "It amuses her, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> her do it." [...] His wife, the Lady-with-the-Bust, was safely out of hearing.|$|E
60|$|I took good care. I {{wanted to}} cure him. If {{it had been}} {{possible}} I would have shown him my naked soul. But I couldn't do that, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him see....|$|E
60|$|What is {{all this}} in writing! It is only some sort of relief to my full heart, and shows very little of it to you; but that's something, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> it go.|$|E
6000|$|But I didn't know it, all the same. I hadn't an {{idea in the}} world; but {{it would}} have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> never <b>let</b> on, but said: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't {{know exactly}} what to say, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> myself off with a little philosophy: 'Well, you see, it didn't pay, exactly,' 'Oh no,' he said, sadly enough, and he went out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't like him, {{he puts on}} airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father, and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast, and I don't {{consider}} him a desirable acquaintance, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him alone." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him go,--and my curse with him,--and from {{my window}} I watched his coach drive {{away in the}} drizzling rain, {{scattering}} the crowd of awe-stricken loiterers who had collected at the rumour of his presence.|$|E
6000|$|The priest {{shook his}} head. [...] "I have {{no wish to}} find shelter under the roof of Vaux Abbey," [...] he said coldly. [...] "You are well {{protected}} against the weather, and <b>so</b> am <b>I.</b> <b>Let</b> us stay here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay; go mad for rations! There's no feigning there, Poppins. The {{world is}} doing that. But, Poppins, Hamlet feigned; and <b>so</b> do <b>I.</b> <b>Let</b> the wind blow as it may, I know a hawk from a handsaw. Therefore {{you need not}} fear me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{gave him}} one of your white shirts. He wore a cheap horrid cotton thing, and I knew it would look ridiculous. And then his shoes were <b>so</b> slipshod, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him have a pair of yours, the old ones with the narrow caps--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly;--because {{he never}} asked me. For the moment I was weak, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him have another chance. I shall {{not have been a}} good friend to him if it ends in his marrying this Yankee." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was there}} alone. I got work for Cothope with the Ilchesters, for whom I now build these destroyers. They wanted him at once, {{and he was}} short of money, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him go and managed very philosophically by myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I told him, sahib," [...] {{the servant}} said, [...] "that you cared not for such entertainments, {{and that he}} had better go elsewhere; but he insisted that you {{yourself}} had told him to come, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> him wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let the {{old fool}} alone," [...] he said; [...] "we fare well, {{and our lives}} are easy, having three men {{to do the work}} of one. <b>So</b> say <b>I,</b> <b>let</b> us sail on and make merry with his good rum; his money-chest is heavy yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Cherokee {{had this}} Christmas mess already bought and paid for; {{and he was}} all flattered up with {{self-esteem}} over his idea; and we had in a way flew the flume with that fizzy wine <b>I</b> speak of; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> never <b>let</b> on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] goes on Mack, [...] "that {{a man had}} better take 'em in and secure his inspirations of the sect when he's young and <b>so</b> preordained. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> my chance go by; and I guess I'm too old now to go hopping into the curriculum." ...|$|R
60|$|I couldn't see the driver, {{and across}} my mind it rushed That that Commissariat {{elephant}} had suddenly gone musth. I didn't care to meet him, and I couldn't well get down, <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> the Waler have it, and {{we headed for}} the town.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} after I moved in here, I {{found that one}} old man could not fill the whole of this house, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> the upper floors," [...] he explained, smilingly. [...] "Some day I must {{introduce}} you to my tenants, Mr. Hodder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't approve on't, but {{he might}} do wuss. We all have to have our comfort somehow, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> Lisha smoke {{as much as he}} likes, and he lets me gab, so it's about fair, I reckon," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Wilkins, from the suds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir, so help me! There {{was nothing}} to see. He just gave a little sort of hallo! threw his hands before him, and over he went--crash. I couldn't hear {{anything}} more, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just <b>let</b> go the wheel for a second to call you up." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{comments}} on her website, [...] "Their bare breasts were called 'indecent', <b>so</b> <b>I</b> thought, <b>let's</b> use this incident and our equal {{protection under the}} 14th Amendment to show what real freedom and decency look like.

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it would be better to push on, Dave," [...] Boston Joe said.
