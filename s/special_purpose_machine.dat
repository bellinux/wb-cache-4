50|$|DES has a {{block size}} of 64 bits {{and a key}} size of 56 bits. 64-bit blocks became common in block cipher designs after DES. Key length {{depended}} on several factors, including government regulation. Many observers in the 1970s commented that the 56-bit key length used for DES was too short. As time went on, its inadequacy became apparent, especially after a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machine</b> designed to break DES was demonstrated in 1998 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. An extension to DES, Triple DES, triple-encrypts each block with either two independent keys (112-bit key and 80-bit security) or three independent keys (168-bit key and 112-bit security). It was widely adopted as a replacement. As of 2011, the three-key version is still considered secure, though the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards no longer {{permit the use of}} the two-key version in new applications, due to its 80-bit security level.|$|E
50|$|Each CM-1 {{microprocessor}} {{has its own}} 4 kilobits of random-access memory (RAM), and the hypercube-based {{array of}} them was designed to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously, i.e., to execute tasks in single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) fashion. The CM-1, depending on the configuration, has as many as 65,536 individual processors, each extremely simple, processing one bit at a time. CM-1 and its successor CM-2 {{take the form of}} a cube 1.5 meters on a side, divided equally into eight smaller cubes. Each subcube contains 16 printed circuit boards and a main processor called a sequencer. Each circuit board contains 32 chips. Each chip contains a router, 16 processors, and 16 RAMs. The CM-1 as a whole has a 20-dimensional hypercube-based routing network, a main RAM, and an input-output processor (a channel controller). Each router contains 5 buffers to store the data being transmitted when a clear channel isn't available. The engineers had originally calculated that 7 buffers per chip would be needed, but this made the chip slightly too large to build. Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman had previously calculated that 5 buffers would be enough, using a differential equation involving the average number of 1 bits in an address. They resubmitted the design of the chip with only 5 buffers, and when they put the machine together, it worked fine. Each chip is connected to a switching device called a nexus. The CM-1 uses Feynman's algorithm for computing logarithms that he had developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for the Manhattan Project. It is well suited to the CM-1, using as it did, only shifting and adding, with a small table shared by all the processors. Feynman also discovered that the CM-1 would compute the Feynman diagrams for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations faster than an expensive <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machine</b> developed at Caltech.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} issues faced by a large manufacturer of semiconductor devices. Semiconductor manufacturing companies allocate millions of dollars every year for new types of machine tools for their facilities. Typically these are <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machine</b> tools which are made to order.

Further, manu-facturers experience a long lead time while procuring these tools. In this paper, we model the tool capacity planning problem under uncertainty in demand. The number of tools required in a facility is suciently large (nearly hundred or more tools) to make it nearly impossible to obtain ecient exact algorithms. We provide heuristics to find ecient tool procurement plans and test their quality using lower bounds on the formulation. Ó 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The Baccalaureate Thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} tool for fixing of thrust rings in flanges of high {{pressure}} fuel injection pumps. The theoretical part of the final project summarizes both theory-based and cold metal and alloy working-based knowledge.

40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machine</b> tools (SPMs) {{have been}} widely used to perform drilling-related {{operations}} in high volume production including within automotive component industries. The first step in designing and manufacturing a SPM is a feasibility analysis. Since SPMs have relatively higher investment cost than other machine tools, this task must be performed before any investment on the preparation of detailed design. The present paper explores an economic feasibility analysis strategy which aims to make logical decision by assessing the strengths and limitations of an SPM in comparison with other machine tools. The mathematical product cost model for SPMs is proposed for estimating important economic factors and then financial indicators are calculated to evaluate the SPM’s economic performance. A case study is used to examine the proposed model and results are compared with other machine tools. The proposed model provides a decision support approach for selecting an SPM for manufacturing a given part from an economic perspective...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} application of knowledge-based expert systems to facilitate the task of techno-economical feasibility analysis of utilization of special purpose machines for high quantity production tasks. Also, to study the possibility of assisting <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machine</b> designers in applying knowledge-based expert systems in the design task {{in order to reduce}} required machine design time, improve machine design efficiency, and eliminate possible human errors. Design/methodology/approach: Development of a knowledge-based expert system has been proposed to help decide where to utilize special purpose machines to accomplish the production task. The knowledge-based expert system consists of a rule-base which contains qualitative human knowledge and expertise in the form of if-then rules; and a database which contains qualitative information of machining operations, and characteristics of standardized <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>machine</b> components. Findings: A case study has been presented where an analysis has been {{made on the basis of}} techno-economical considerations for a typical part with three machining operations to be produced in large quantities. It has been concluded that for the given production task, special purpose machines would result in a significant 59 % reduction of costs compared to CNC machines, and 95. 5 % compared to traditional machines. The proposed methodology also reduces the time and effort needed for decision making on utilization of special purpose machines and determination of machine layout. In addition, it minimizes the level of expertise required to perform these functions and eliminates possible human errors. Research limitations/implications: The current system focuses on drilling and drilling-related operations which cover about 60 % of all machining operations. More work is needed to cover other machining operations including milling. Also the KBES developed currently works on a standalone basis. Work is in progress to integrate it with a 3 D CAD modelling system. Upon completion the information could be directly extracted from the CAD system, eliminating the need for manual data input by the user. Originality/value: In spite of a large number of publications on machine tool design in the literature, publications on special purpose machines are very limited. The method of techno-economical analysis presented here for utilization of special purpose machines in comparison with other production alternatives is of great value to manufacturing engineers and specialists. Also the methodology presented for machine design and implementation is highly valued by machine tool designers and manufacturers...|$|E
