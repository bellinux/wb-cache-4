5|$|In May 1945, the Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The {{committee}} was chaired by Stimson, with James F. Byrnes, a former US Senator soon to be Secretary of State, as President Harry S. Truman's personal representative; Ralph A. Bard, the Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, the Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush; Karl T. Compton; James B. Conant; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and president of New York Life Insurance Company. The Interim Committee in turn established a <b>scientific</b> <b>panel</b> consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee, the <b>scientific</b> <b>panel</b> offered its opinion {{not just on the}} likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its probable military and political impact.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the <b>scientific</b> <b>panel</b> that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the {{committee}} that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E

25|$|The Oregon Coast Aquarium (OCA) in Newport, Oregon {{where the}} orca Keiko was kept {{prior to his}} {{translocation}} to Iceland, offered its facilities to rehabilitate Springer for a one-year period, after which a <b>scientific</b> <b>panel</b> would {{determine whether or not}} she was fit to return to Johnstone Strait, BC. Media reports soon revealed that OCA was deep in debt and bound by an agreement with the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation (FWKF) that Keiko's former tank, built by FWKF, could never again house a wild orca. Furthermore, growing scientific opinion was that rehabilitating Springer in a concrete tank would further acclimate the orca to humans and likely result in permanent captivity. OCA withdrew its offer.|$|E

[...] Throughout the war, Compton would remain a prominent scientific adviser and administrator. In 1945, he served, along with Lawrence, Oppenheimer, and Fermi, on the <b>Scientific</b> <b>Panel</b> that recommended military use {{of the atomic bomb}} against Japan. He was awarded the Medal for Merit for his services to the Manhattan Project.|$|E
500|$|The {{necessity}} of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki became {{a subject of}} controversy among historians. Some questioned whether an [...] "atomic diplomacy" [...] would not have attained the same goals and disputed whether the bombings or the Soviet declaration of war on Japan was decisive. The Franck Report was the most notable effort pushing for a demonstration but was turned down by the Interim Committee's <b>scientific</b> <b>panel.</b> The Szilárd petition, drafted in July 1945 and signed by dozens of scientists working on the Manhattan Project, was a late attempt at warning President Harry S. Truman about his responsibility in using such weapons.|$|E
500|$|With Truman as president, {{men like}} John R. Steelman, who was {{appointed}} chairman of the President's Scientific Research Board in October 1946, came to prominence. Bush's authority, both among scientists and politicians, suffered a rapid decline, though he remained a revered figure. In September 1949, he was appointed to head a <b>scientific</b> <b>panel</b> that included Oppenheimer to review {{the evidence that the}} Soviet Union had tested its first atomic bomb. The panel concluded that it had, and this finding was relayed to Truman, who made the public announcement. Bush was outraged when a security hearing stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954; he issued a strident attack on Oppenheimer's accusers in The New York Times. Alfred Friendly summed up the feeling of many scientists in declaring that Bush had become [...] "the Grand Old Man of American science".|$|E

The three <b>scientific</b> <b>panels</b> were: (1) National Fish Hatchery Review Panel, (2) Up Stream: Salmon and Society in the Pacific Northwest, and (3) Return to the River: Restoration of Salmonid Fishes in the Columbia River Ecosystem.

500|$|Extensive timber {{cutting in}} the Sandy River basin {{began in the}} mid-19thcentury in {{response}} to a demand for wood from the Portland metropolitan area. Logging intensified in the lower basin through the 20thcentury as sawmills became established in Sandy, Boring, Brightwood and other settlements in the region, and railroad spurs extended into the forests. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Bull Run Trespass Act to forbid activities such as camping and livestock grazing in the Bull Run Reserve. Except for activity related to the waterworks, the protected area changed little until the 1950s, when the United States Forest Service began to advocate logging in the Reserve. After the U.S. Congress passed the Multiple Use – Sustained Yield Act of 1960 stressing timber production in the national forests, the Forest Service in the 1960s and 1970s built about [...] of forest roads in the watershed. Before the road-building and heavy logging, [...] "The watershed [...] remained almost inviolable for nearly 60years, its runoff protected by a largely unbroken expanse of centuries-old trees," [...] according to a member of the Bull Run Advisory Committee, a <b>scientific</b> <b>panel</b> commissioned by the City of Portland in 1977 to review issues related to Bull Run.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for dropping {{an atomic bomb}} on Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer-led <b>Scientific</b> <b>Panel</b> of the Interim Committee decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet warning. Those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation and {{also because of the}} wish to maximize shock in the leadership. No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped. Various sources gave conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb. Robert Jay Lifton wrote that it was July 27, and Theodore H. McNelly wrote that it was July 3. The USAAF history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27, but Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on July 30. Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4. Hiroshima may have been leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets {{a few days before the}} atomic bomb was dropped. Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities targeted for firebombing; a total of 33 cities listed. With the text of this leaflet reading in Japanese [...] "...we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked..." [...] Hiroshima is not listed.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, the United States National Academy of Sciences, at {{the request}} of the US Army Research Institute, formed a <b>scientific</b> <b>panel</b> to assess the best {{evidence}} for psychokinesis. Part of its purpose was to investigate military applications of PK, for example to remotely jam or disrupt enemy weaponry. The panel heard from a variety of military staff who believed in PK and made visits to the PEAR laboratory and two other laboratories that had claimed positive results from micro-PK experiments. The panel criticized macro-PK experiments for being open to deception by conjurors, and said that virtually all micro-PK experiments [...] "depart from good scientific practice in a variety of ways". Their conclusion, published in a 1987 report, was that there was no scientific evidence for the existence of psychokinesis.|$|E
