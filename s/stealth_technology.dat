5|$|The F-22 {{cannot be}} {{exported}} under American federal law {{to protect its}} <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> and other high-tech features. Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but {{was designed to be}} cheaper, more flexible, and available for export. In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of F-22 export sales on U.S. aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|The Kolkata class (Project 15A) is a {{class of}} guided missile destroyers with <b>stealth</b> <b>technology.</b> By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had {{redesigned}} the follow-on Kolkata class to improve technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A was framed by the navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL). It consists of three ships (Kolkata, Kochi and Chennai), built by Mazagon Dock Limited, which are the navy's largest destroyers. Due to construction delays and a problem discovered during sea trials, the first ship's commission was postponed from 2010 to 2014.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. <b>Stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5000|$|One or {{multiple}} of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks {{used in the}} raid upon Osama bin Laden's compound on 1 May 2011 {{are believed to have}} featured <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies.</b> These features are said to include specialized materials, and the use of harsh angles and flat surfaces across the exterior fuselage, techniques previously employed upon other stealth aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{considered}} an expert in matters {{in science and technology}} due to his background. He was a supporter of continuing the B-1 bomber program, which he considered successful. This conflicted with President Carter's desire to fund the B-2 bomber program. Glenn did not fully support development of the B-2 because he had doubts about the feasibility of the <b>stealth</b> <b>technology.</b> Glenn joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1978. He became the chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, for which he traveled to Japan, Korea, the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China. Glenn helped to pass the Taiwan Enabling Act of 1979. In 1979, another dispute Glenn had with President Carter was Glenn's stance on the SALT II treaty. He did not believe that the U.S. had the capability to monitor the Soviet Union accurately enough to verify compliance with the treaty. During the launching ceremony for the , he spoke about his doubts about verifying treaty compliance. First Lady Rosalynn Carter also spoke at the event, during which she criticized Glenn for speaking publicly about the issue. The Senate never ratified the treaty, {{in part because of the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The late 1980s also {{witnessed}} {{the arrival of}} the first giant flying wing to soar over the base in nearly 40 years. The thin silhouette, compound curves and other low-observable characteristics of the B-2 Spirit bomber represented third-generation <b>stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> following the SR-71 and F-117.|$|E
50|$|The RAH-66 {{was armed}} with a 20 mm three-barrel XM301 cannon under its nose and could {{internally}} carry six AGM-114 Hellfire or twelve AIM-92 Stinger missiles split evenly between the two retractable weapons pylons. The Comanche could also carry four Hellfire or eight Stinger missiles externally on each of its stub wings, but with {{a reduction in the}} effectiveness of <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies.</b>|$|R

25|$|According to a {{statement}} by Pakistan Air Force Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, {{there had been an}} air-surveillance failure. Qamar covered the inquiry by saying that the air space was unable to detect the American helicopters because the radar installed on the western borders were inactive {{on the day of the}} incident. The U.S. helicopters also reportedly used radar-evading measures, such as <b>stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> to avoid detection.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger has the {{distinction}} of being the first all-composite helicopter developed in Europe; even the earliest models also incorporate other advanced features such as a glass cockpit, <b>stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> and high agility to increase its survivability. Improved variants have since entered service, outfitted with more powerful engines and compatible with a wider range of weapons. Since the type's introduction to service, Tigers have been used in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, and Mali.|$|E
25|$|Stealth mode avoids {{detection}} using {{a variety}} of <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies</b> that reduce reflection/emission of radar, infrared, visible light, radio-frequency (RF) spectrum, and audio; the car's lights and main engine are deactivated; the vehicle is powered by an auxiliary electric motor. This makes the car very hard to find at night or in dark places, and as demonstrated by the car chase in Batman Begins, can easily throw off pursuers.|$|R
50|$|To improve tank protection, one {{field of}} {{research}} involves making the tank invisible to radar by adapting <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies</b> originally designed for aircraft. Improvements to camouflage or and attempts to render it invisible through active camouflage is being pursued. Research is also ongoing in electromagnetic armour systems to disperse or deflect incoming shaped charge jets, as well as various forms of active protection systems to prevent incoming projectiles from striking the tank at all.|$|R

25|$|The Su-57 will be {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft in Russian Air Force service to use <b>stealth</b> <b>technology.</b> Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the airframe incorporates planform edge alignment to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully aligned at several specific angles {{in order to reduce the}} number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe, and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape. The IRST housing is turned backwards when not in use, and its rear is treated with radar-absorbent material (RAM) to reduce its radar return. To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face, the partial serpentine inlet obscures most, but not all, of the engine's fan and inlet guide-vanes (IGV). The production aircraft incorporates radar blockers similar in principle to those used on the F/A-18E/F in front of the engine fan to hide it from all angles. The aircraft uses RAM to absorb radar emissions and reduce their reflection back to the source, and the canopy is treated with a coating to minimize the radar return of the cockpit and pilot.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the evolution of}} strategic bombing doctrine {{in order to identify}} the basic doctrinal tenets and then evaluate their compatibility with emerging <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies.</b> Current doctrine is an evolution of existing doctrine, theory, and experience. Therefore, to comprehend fully the meaning of doctrine, it is necessary to trace its lineage. As airpower arrived only recently in the doctrinal arena, no previous doctrine existed. Therefore, this analysis begins with the early airpower theories which provided the roots of evolution. Giulio Douhet is the most famous of the early theorists and his work provided a basis upon which to build. Following World War II (WWII), Bernard Brodie modified Douhet's theory to incorporate atomic weapons and the experience to date. As theory evolved, so did early Air Corps "unsanctioned " doctrine. Despite a lack of approval at the Department of the Army, the Air Corps Tactical School developed and taught strategic bombing concepts which later provided the basis of WWII aerial planning and execution. The Korean and Vietnamese conflicts provided impetus for slow and gradual change to the basic tenets of strategic bombing doctrine. The USAF reinforced the validity of these basic tenets when it promulgated the 1992 version of Basic Aerospace Doctrine. By testing each tenet against the demands of emerging <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies,</b> the paper finds that existin...|$|R
500|$|The {{surface of}} the {{compound}} eye of the housefly is densely packed with microscopic projections that {{have the effect of}} reducing reflection and hence increasing transmission of incident light. Similarly, the eyes of some moths have antireflective surfaces, again using arrays of pillars smaller than the wavelength of light. [...] "Moth-eye" [...] nanostructures could be used to create low-reflectance glass for windows, solar cells, display devices, and military <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies.</b> Antireflective biomimetic surfaces using the [...] "moth-eye" [...] principle can be manufactured by first creating a mask by lithography with gold nanoparticles, and then performing reactive-ion etching.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the U.S. Army began formulating a {{requirement}} for the replacement of its helicopters then in service, resulting in the Light Helicopter Experimental program. In 1991, the Boeing-Sikorsky team was chosen to produce prototypes. The Comanche would incorporate <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies,</b> featuring a number of designs previously untried. It was to employ advanced sensors in its reconnaissance role, and was intended to designate targets for the AH-64 Apache. The aircraft was also armed with missiles and rockets to destroy armored vehicles. Two RAH-66 prototypes were built and conducted flight testing from 1996 to 2004. Since the cancellation, the prototypes have been placed on display.|$|R
