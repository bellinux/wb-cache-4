5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E

25|$|When Keats died at 25, he {{had been}} writing poetry seriously for only about six years, from 1814 until the summer of 1820; and {{publishing}} for only four. In his lifetime, sales of Keats's three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies. His first poem, the sonnet O Solitude appeared in the Examiner in May 1816, while his collection Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes and other poems was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome. The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> is just one remarkable aspect of Keats's work.|$|E

25|$|Although genetic factors govern {{susceptibility}} to atopic disease, increases in atopy have occurred within too <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> frame {{to be explained}} by a genetic change in the population, thus pointing to environmental or lifestyle changes. Several hypotheses have been identified to explain this increased rate; increased exposure to perennial allergens due to housing changes and increasing time spent indoors, and changes in cleanliness or hygiene that {{have resulted in the}} decreased activation of a common immune control mechanism, coupled with dietary changes, obesity and decline in physical exercise. The hygiene hypothesis maintains that high living standards and hygienic conditions exposes children to fewer infections. It is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from TH1 type responses, leading to unrestrained TH2 responses that allow for an increase in allergy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are certain}} {{offices of the}} {{executive}} whose pensions are regulated by particular acts of Parliament. Judges of the High Court, on completing fifteen years services or becoming permanently incapacitated for duty, whatever their length of service, may be granted a pension equal to two-thirds of their salary (Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873). The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain however <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> he may have held office, receives a pension of £45,000, but he usually continues to sit as a Law Lord in the House of Lords; so also does the Lord Chancellor of Northern Ireland, who receives a pension of £3,692 6s. A considerable number of local authorities have obtained special parliamentary powers {{for the purpose of}} superannuating their officials and workmen who have reached the age of 65.

25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the standby diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|E

500|$|Lilienthal {{had made}} [...] "whirling arm" [...] tests on {{only a few}} wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a {{different}} shape. The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, [...] "were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> with so few materials and at so little expense". An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio (wingspan divided by chord—the wing's front-to-back dimension). Such shapes offered much better lift-to-drag ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far.|$|E
500|$|Although {{some in the}} Conservative party {{agreed with}} Wilson (and Jo Grimond, the Liberal leader) that the Conservatives would have won the 1964 {{election}} if Butler had been Prime Minister, The Times observed, [...] "it should not be overlooked that in October 1963 Home took over a Government whose morale was shattered and whose standing in the opinion polls was abysmal. A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [...] recovered so much ground in so <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> was in itself an achievement." [...] However, looking back across Home's career, The Times considered that his reputation rested not on his brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: [...] "He brought to the office... his capacity for straight talking, for toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted {{as a lack of}} sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia. But he brought something else as well: an unusual degree of international respect." ...|$|E

Anne lost no time in appointing Sarah – of whom she had been passionately fond since childhood – one of her Ladies of the Bedchamber. Their relationship continued to blossom, so much so that years later Sarah wrote – [...] "To see [...] was a constant joy; and to part with [...] for never so <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> a constant uneasiness... This worked even to the jealousy of a lover". For his part, Churchill treated the princess with respectful affection and grew genuinely attached to her, assuming – in his reverence to royalty – the chivalrous role of a knightly champion. From this time forward the Churchills were increasingly detached from James's Catholic inner circle and more noticeably associated with the Princess.|$|E

500|$|This fact did {{not escape}} {{government}} officials, and when, in 1863, {{they attempted to}} restore coins to circulation, the use of bronze coins, which would not contain their face values in metal, was considered. In his annual report submitted October1, 1863, Mint Director James Pollock noted that [...] "whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins, they merely want the inferior [...] money for convenience in making exact payments". He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained {{as little as a}} fifth of a cent in metal, yet had still circulated. [...] He proposed that the copper-nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size. Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery. On December8, Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, proposing a bronze cent and two-cent piece, and enclosing pattern coins of the two-cent piece that he had had prepared. According to numismatist Neil Carothers, a two-cent piece was most likely proposed in order to get as much dollar value in small change into circulation in as <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as possible, as the Mint could strike a two-cent piece as easily as a cent.|$|E
500|$|In the 20th and 21st centuries {{historians have}} focused {{less on the}} rightness or wrongness of the conquest itself, instead concentrating {{on the effects of}} the invasion. Some, such as Richard Southern, have seen the conquest as a {{critical}} turning point in history. Southern stated that [...] "no country in Europe, between the rise of the barbarian kingdoms and the 20th century, has undergone so radical a change in so <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> as England experienced after 1066". Other historians, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, believe that the transformation was less radical. In more general terms, Singman has called the conquest [...] "the last echo of the national migrations that characterized the early Middle Ages". The debate over the impact of the conquest depends on how change after 1066 is measured. If Anglo-Saxon England was already evolving before the invasion, with the introduction of feudalism, castles or other changes in society, then the conquest, while important, did not represent radical reform. But the change was dramatic if measured by the elimination of the English nobility or the loss of Old English as a literary language. Nationalistic arguments have been made {{on both sides of the}} debate, with the Normans cast as either the persecutors of the English or the rescuers of the country from a decadent Anglo-Saxon nobility.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} his {{manuscript}} Handel {{wrote the}} letters [...] "SDG"—, [...] "To God alone the glory". This inscription, taken with the speed of composition, has encouraged belief in the apocryphal story that Handel wrote the music in a fervour of divine inspiration in which, as he wrote the [...] "Hallelujah" [...] chorus, [...] "he saw all heaven before him". Burrows points out that many of Handel's operas, of comparable length and structure to Messiah, were composed within similar timescales between theatrical seasons. The effort of writing so much music in so <b>short</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> was not unusual for Handel and his contemporaries; Handel commenced his next oratorio, Samson, within a week of finishing Messiah, and completed his draft of this new work in a month. [...] In accordance with his frequent practice when writing new works, Handel adapted existing compositions for use in Messiah, in this case drawing on two recently completed Italian duets and one written twenty years previously. Thus, [...] from 1722 became the basis of [...] "O Death, where is thy sting?"; [...] "His yoke is easy" [...] and [...] "And he shall purify" [...] were drawn from [...] (July 1741), [...] "Unto us a child is born" [...] and [...] "All we like sheep" [...] from [...] (July 1741). Handel's instrumentation in the score is often imprecise, again in line with contemporary convention, where the use of certain instruments and combinations was assumed and {{did not need to be}} written down by the composer; later copyists would fill in the details.|$|E
