5000|$|A {{large number}} of small {{two-stroke}} engines use a sealed crankcase as a compression chamber for their mixture. These are hugely common as petrol or gasoline small engines for motorcycles, generator sets and garden equipment. Both sides of the piston are used as working surfaces: the upper side is the power piston, the lower side acts as a <b>scavenging</b> <b>pump.</b> As the piston rises, it pushes out exhaust gases and produces a partial vacuum in the crankcase, which draws in fuel and air. As the piston travels downward, the compressed fuel/air charge is pushed from the crankcase into the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|Engines {{are both}} {{lubricated}} and cooled by oil that circulates throughout the engine, feeding various bearings and other moving parts and then draining, via gravity, into the sump {{at the base}} of the engine. In the wet-sump system of most production automobile engines, a pump collects this oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine. In a dry-sump, the oil still falls to the base of the engine, however instead of collecting in a reservoir-style oil sump, it falls into a much shallower sump, where one or more <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> draw it away and transfer it to a (usually external) reservoir, where it is both cooled and de-aerated before being recirculated through the engine by a pressure pump. Dry-sump designs frequently mount the pressure <b>pump</b> and <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> on a common crankshaft, so that one pulley at the front of the system can run as many pumps as the engine design requires. It is common practice to have one <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> per crankcase section, however in the case of inverted engines (aircraft engine) it is necessary to employ separate <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> for each cylinder bank. Therefore, an inverted V engine would have a minimum of two <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> and a pressure pump in the pump stack.|$|R

40|$|The {{hypocycloid}} mechanism, in {{its basic}} or modified version, {{can be used}} in reciprocating machines as an alternative solution to the conventional crankshaft-connecting rod system. This kinematic device is quite old in concept, but still gives rise to some research since it has some positive mechanical features, and it allows several functions to be easily combined. In the hypocycloid mechanism in fact the connecting rod has a perfectly sinusoidal straight-line motion, a characteristic that theoretically reduces the piston side thrust to zero and permits a perfect balance of inertia forces without auxiliary rotating shafts. Moreover, by means of a second head with suitable seals that prevent leakage to the crankcase, the lower portion of the cylinder {{can be used as a}} second working chamber without using the crosshead thus reducing the dimensions of the double acting machine. The authors have undertaken theoretical and experimental research in order to evaluate the positive features, in particular those concerning the possibility of the combination of functions, and to compare these characteristics with the evident shortcomings. This has led to the design and construction of a double acting compressor, whose performances have been compared with those of a traditional compressor. A perfectly balanced two-stroke engine, with the <b>scavenging</b> <b>pump</b> separated from the crankcase, has also been constructed and teste...|$|E
40|$|As more {{stringent}} emission limits and low consumption requirements also involve s. i. 2 -stroke engines, {{one of the}} most important design modifications that can cope with these constraints is to perform the scavenging process using pure air, which means not only fuel-free air but also oil-free air. A new single-cylinder prototype engine, equipped with a gasoline direct injection (GDI) apparatus has therefore been designed and built. In order to reduce manufacturing costs, this prototype was obtained by modifying a mass-produced 4 -stroke 4 -cylinder automotive engine. Apart from the replacement of the original indirect fuel feeding system with GDI, two more remarkable features should be pointed out: the use of a force-fed lubrication system, like those used in current 4 -stroke engines and, as a consequence, the use of an external <b>scavenging</b> <b>pump.</b> Before using an electronically controlled direct injection system on the new prototype engine, the whole apparatus was tested on a mass-produced crankcase scavenged 2 -stroke engine (Husqvarna WR 250) in order to evaluate the magnitude of the improvements. A comparison of a carburettor fuel feeding system with a direct fuel injection system was carried out, under cubic power requirements, to check whether the GDI strategies were advantageous. As satisfying results were obtained, the direct injection apparatus was mounted onto the prototype engine for the first experimental test...|$|E

40|$|An aero-engine {{bearing chamber}} is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the high-speed engine shafts. There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the bearing chamber are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the sealing air. The oil collected via the sump and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The sealing air is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a bearing chamber is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using de-aerators [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil collects at the sump and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a bearing chamber is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with deep sumps perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve bearing chamber designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the <b>scavenging</b> <b>pump.</b> Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as grille cover, perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well. This will aid understanding of the flow characteristics of using an insert to improve oil residence in a bearing chamber...|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{wet sump}} engines have one oil pump. It is {{generally}} located inside {{the lower part}} of the engine, usually below and/or to one side of the crankshaft. On dry sump engines, at least two oil pumps are required: one to pressurize and distribute the oil around the engine components, and at least one other 'scavenge pump' to evacuate the oil which has pooled at the bottom of the engine. This <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> is sometimes (but not always) located in the 'sump' of the engine, and crucially, this <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump's</b> flow-rate capacity must exceed that of the pump which pressurizes and distributes oil throughout the engine.|$|R
5000|$|Improved pump {{efficiency}} to maintain oil {{supply to the}} engine. Since <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity {{rather than having to}} be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical pressure pump, which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the pressure pump is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces.|$|R

5000|$|Coolant {{exits the}} DB 601 at two points {{located at the}} front of the engine and at the base of each {{cylinder}} block casting immediately adjacent to the crank case. In the Heinkel system, an [...] "S"-shaped steel pipe took the coolant from each side of the engine to one of two steam separators mounted alongside the engine's reduction gear and immediately behind the propeller spinner. The separators, designed by engineers Jahn and Jahnke, accepted the water at about 110 C and [...] of pressure. The vertically mounted, tube-shaped separators contained a centrifugal impeller at the top connected to an impeller-type <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> at the bottom. The coolant was expanded through the upper impeller where it lost pressure, boiled and cooled. The by-product was mostly very hot coolant and some steam. The liquid coolant was slung by the centrifugal impeller to the sides of the separator where it fell by gravity to the bottom of the unit. There, it was pumped to header tanks located in the leading edges of both wings by the <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump.</b> The presence of the <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> was necessary to ensure the entire separator did not simply fill up with high-pressure coolant coming from the engine.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of the dry}} sump's {{external}} oil reservoir, {{excess air}} can escape the oil before the oil is pumped back through the engine. Dry sumps also allow for more power because they {{reduce the amount of}} windage, oil sloshing up into the rotating assembly, and the vacuum from the <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> improves ring seal. Dry sumps are more popular in racing applications because of the improved power and reduced oil sloshing that would otherwise reduce oil pressure. Disadvantages of dry sumps are increased weight, additional parts, and more chances for leaks and problems to occur.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example is}} the oil pan of an engine. The oil is used to {{lubricate}} the engine's moving parts and it pools in a reservoir known as its sump, {{at the bottom of}} the engine. Use of a sump requires the engine to be mounted slightly higher to make space for it. Often though, oil in the sump can slosh during hard cornering, starving the oil pump. For these reasons, racing and piston aircraft engines are [...] "dry sumped" [...] using <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> and a swirl tank to separate oil from air, which is also sucked up by the pumps.|$|R

The history of AVPIN use on the Lightning demonstrated it was both safe and effective in use. The reduced availability of AVPIN is now a restriction on the continued operation of some preserved military aircraft, such as Lightnings in the UK and South Africa and some are thus being converted to electric starting.|$|R

However, Stewart's performance, having had the race fully in hand, sidelined only by {{mechanical}} failure, won him Rookie of the Year honours despite the winner, Graham Hill, also being an Indianapolis rookie. At {{the start of the}} 1966 season, Stewart won the Australasian 8 round championship from his BRM teammate Graham Hill in 2 litre BRMs and also raced closely with his great rival and friend Jim Clark who was somewhat disadvantaged by an unreliable Lotus 39 which was let down by old Climax 2.5s.|$|R
5000|$|A {{supply of}} {{lubricating}} oil must be fed to the crankcase {{to supply the}} crankshaft bearings. Since the crankcase {{is also used to}} supply air to the engine, the engine's lubricating oil is carried into the cylinder with the air charge, burnt during combustion and carried out of the exhaust. The oil carried from the crankcase to the cylinder is used to lubricate the piston. This means that a two-stroke hot-bulb engine will gradually burn its supply of lubricating oil, a design known as a [...] "total-loss" [...] lubricating system. There were also designs that employed a <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> or similar to remove oil from the crankcase and return it to the lubricating-oil reservoir.

5000|$|To {{build the}} turbo, Kawasaki did not simply add fuel {{injection}} and a turbocharger {{to a standard}} GPz750 motorcycle engine.

The exhaust system and turbo (except silencers) were strengthened with different tube material, and some dimensions and frame geometry differed (28° rake instead of 26°). The rest came from conventionally aspirated 750 and the 1100 (front fork, brakes and some injection parts) and the entire cylinder head assembly from the KZ 650.
