50|$|The IS-54 {{system has}} {{different}} synchronization sequences {{for each of}} the six time slots making up the frame, thereby allowing each receiver to synchronize to its own preassigned time slots. An additional 12 bits in every time slot are for the SACCH (i.e., system control information). The digital verification color code (DVCC) is the equivalent of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> used in the AMPS system. There are 256 different 8-bit color codes, which are protected by a (12, 8, 3) Hamming code. Each base station has its own preassigned color code, so any incoming interfering signals from distant cells can be ignored.|$|E
25|$|The modem would {{generate}} <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> between 1200 and 2300Hz from picture signals, and picture signals from received <b>audio</b> <b>tones.</b> The <b>audio</b> would {{be attached to}} a radio receiver and transmitter.|$|R

25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> of Eurosignal were sampled by the French electronica duo Air {{for their}} musical composition Les professionals on their album Moon Safari (1988).|$|R
50|$|An {{individual}} aircraft {{has its own}} assigned SELCAL code. To initiate a SELCAL transmission, a ground station radio operator enters an aircraft's SELCAL code into a SELCAL encoder. The encoder converts the four-letter code into four designated <b>audio</b> <b>tones.</b> The radio operator's transmitter then broadcasts the <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> on the aircraft's company radio frequency channel in sequence: the first pair of tones are transmitted simultaneously, lasting about one second; a silence of about 0.2 seconds; followed by the second pair of tones, lasting about one second.|$|R
50|$|R2 {{register}} signalling {{is a family}} of protocols that govern the conveyance of addressing information during the addressing phase and how the call attempt turned out during the disposition phase. Although in the 1960s R2 {{register signalling}} was represented by electromechanical devices that could generate multi-frequency <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> and by electromechanical devices that could detect those <b>audio</b> <b>tones,</b> by the latter 1970s these electromechanical registers also could be represented by digitized PCM audio in DS0 channels of an E1 other than the R2 line signalling DS0 channel in that E1.|$|R
50|$|Simply put, MCW uses a fixed <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> to {{modulate}} a carrier wave. This is an older method of sending Morse code, with continuous wave being {{the more common}} method used today.|$|R

50|$|The {{underwater}} telephone, {{also known}} as UQC, AN/WQC-2, or Gertrude, wasdeveloped by the U.S. Navy in 1945. The UQC underwater telephone is used on all manned submersibles and many Naval surface ships in operation. Voice or an <b>audio</b> <b>tone</b> (morse code) communicated through the UQC are heterodyned to a high pitch for acoustic transmission through water.|$|R
5000|$|The Portable People Meter (PPM) is system {{developed}} by Arbitron (now Nielsen Audio) {{to measure how}} many people are exposed or listening to individual radio stations and television stations, including cable television.

5000|$|Olivia modes are {{commonly}} referred to as [...] Olivia X / Y [...] (or, alternatively, [...] Olivia Y / X [...] ), where X refers to the number of different <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> transmitted and Y refers to the bandwidth in hertz over which these signals are spread. Examples of common Olivia modes are 16/500, 32/1000 and 8/250.|$|R
50|$|His Ph.D. work {{centered}} on biomolecular chemistry and {{the makeup of}} proteins, a field that relies heavily on colorful, computer-generated models of complex molecular structures. Out of necessity, Cordes wrote a computer program that replicates the 3-D images using a range of <b>audio</b> <b>tones</b> and surround-sound speakers, allowing him to “visualize” the proteins in his head. In 2007 he earned his Ph.D.|$|R
50|$|The gunner {{tracks the}} target visually, until the missile locks onto the target, {{indicating}} this {{with both a}} flashing light and an <b>audio</b> <b>tone.</b> The gunner then provides target lead and depresses the trigger all the way. This triggers the booster section of the missile, which projects the missile a safe distance away from the operator before the sustainer motor ignites.|$|R
