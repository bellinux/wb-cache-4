25|$|In 11Q13 Melchizedek is {{referred}} to as god the divine judge. Melchizedek in the bible was the king of Salem. At least some in the Qumran community <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> at the end of days Melchizedek would reign as their king. The passage is based on Psalm 82.|$|E
25|$|After the {{traditional}} three-day wait before {{one can see}} an African big chief, Msiri received them courteously on 17 December 1891. Gifts were presented and negotiations started. Both sides feigned the possibility of future compliance with the other's demands. Msiri wanted gunpowder and removal of Legat, Stairs wanted to fly the Free State flag over Bunkeya. Stairs <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Le Marinel letter indicated Msiri's acquiescence, but it was vague, and Msiri repudiated any such interpretation.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} fierce fights were {{underway}} at Bucharest Otopeni International Airport between troops sent {{against each other}} under claims {{that they were going}} to confront terrorists. Early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon. These troops were from the UM 0865 Campina military base, and were summoned there by Gen. Ion Rus, the commander of the Romanian Air Force. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers as well as eight civilians. The military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport's perimeter, passing several checkpoints. However, after passing the last checkpoint, being on their way to the airport, they were fired upon from different directions. A civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight. After the firefight the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they were loyal to Ceausescu's regime.|$|E

500|$|On 31 July 2005, Pratchett criticised media {{coverage}} of Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, commenting that certain {{members of the media}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the continued elevation of J. K. Rowling can be achieved only {{at the expense of other}} writers". Pratchett later denied claims that this was a swipe at Rowling, and said that he was not making claims of plagiarism, but was pointing out the [...] "shared heritage" [...] of the fantasy genre. Pratchett also posted on the Harry Potter newsgroup about a media-covered exchange of views with her.|$|E
500|$|It {{had been}} alleged by Canadian {{historian}} Holger Herwig that both in November 1940 and May 1941, leading into and {{through to the}} period in which Japan began planning the naval attack that would bring the United States into the war, that Hitler had stated that he had a desire to [...] "deploy long-range bombers against American cities from the Azores." [...] Due to their location, Hitler <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a Luftwaffe airbase located on the Portuguese Azores islands were Germany's [...] "only possibility of carrying out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States", in a period about a year before the May 1942 emergence of the Amerika Bomber trans-oceanic range strategic bomber design competition.|$|E
500|$|Carte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919–20, {{featured}} ten of {{the thirteen}} extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] These included Princess Ida, which had its first London performances since the original production. [...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. [...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did {{not by any means}} imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. [...] All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation.... Many people <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. [...] He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1994 Melody Maker {{interview}} Thunders' manager Mick Webster {{described the}} family's {{efforts to get}} New Orleans police to investigate the matter further: [...] "We keep asking the New Orleans police to re-investigate, but they haven’t been particularly friendly. They <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this was just another junkie who had wandered into town and died. They simply weren’t interested." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{essay was}} {{intended}} to frighten gay men and anger them {{to the point where}} they would respond to government indifference. [...] Michael Specter writes in The New Yorker, [...] "it was a five-thousand-word screed that accused nearly everyone connected with health care in America– officials at the Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, researchers at the National Institutes of Health, in Washington, doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in Manhattan, and local politicians (particularly Mayor Ed Koch)– of refusing to acknowledge the implications of the nascent AIDS epidemic. The article's harshest condemnation was directed at those gay men who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if they ignored the new disease, it would simply go away.|$|E
2500|$|Others, such as Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel, {{felt the}} verdict was fair because the {{prosecution}} {{did not have enough}} evidence to establish guilt or meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Hannity said that {{the verdict was}} legally correct, and that all of the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was either impeached or contradicted by the defense. John Cloud of Time magazine echoed these sentiments, saying the jury made the right call: [...] "Anthony got off because the prosecution couldn't answer ," [...] Cloud stated. [...] "Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on Anthony's (nearly imperceptible) moral character. The prosecutors <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer." ...|$|E

2500|$|ERA {{generated}} {{nearly as}} much attention from legislators as the simultaneous consideration of the successful right-to-work law. Supporters of the amendment <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it was a foregone conclusion that Speaker Henry had {{found a way to}} get the amendment out of the previously [...] "obstructionist" [...] committee. Meanwhile, a small group of social conservatives, unknown to Henry or LeBlanc, was giving speeches in parts of the state where they sought to switch the votes of four Democratic representatives on the committee. These lawmakers were John W. [...] "Jock" [...] Scott of Alexandria, Michael F. [...] "Mike" [...] Thompson of Lafayette, Lane A. Carson of New Orleans, and A. J. McNamara of Metairie. It was believed that the Pentecostal Church, which opposed ERA and which was influential in Rapides Parish, convinced Scott to reverse his position. pro-life and anti-feminist groups in Lafayette and New Orleans, persuaded Thompson to oppose the ERA, and conservative women in Jefferson Parish pleaded with McNamara, later a Ronald W. Reagan-appointed U.S. district judge, to switch his vote as well.|$|E
