Carino (CAnada–RIeber–NOrway) is {{marketing}} its seal pelts mainly through its parent company, GC Rieber Skinn, Bergen, Norway. Canada sold pelts to eleven countries in 2004. The next largest were Germany, Greenland, and China/Hong Kong. Other importers were Finland, Denmark, France, Greece, South Korea, and Russia. Asia remains the principal market for seal meat exports. One of Canada's market access priorities for 2002 was to [...] "continue to press Korean authorities to obtain the necessary approvals {{for the sale of}} seal meat for human consumption in Korea." [...] Canadian and Korean officials agreed in 2003 on <b>specific</b> Korean <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> for seal meat. For 2004, only Taiwan and South Korea purchased seal meat from Canada.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the inter-sectoral linkages and imports of Malaysia using the input-output approach. The method employed here will {{be similar to the}} work of Achaya and Hazari (1973), where they differentiated between total and domestic linkages. A hypothesis is put forward stating that there will below rank correlation between the total and domestic linkages if the <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> are relatively high. The results of the analyses suggest a distinct characteristic between the industries generating backward and forward linkages respectively. This study found that there is a high correlation between the total and net forward linkage, suggesting the low <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> for those industries generating forward linkage. These are in contrast with the results found for those industries generating backward linkage, where the correlation between the total and net backward linkage is lower. This suggests that the <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> for those indutries generating backward linkage are higher than those industries generating forward linkage...|$|R

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{surge in}} {{imports of goods}} and services without a concomitant surge in exports in Turkey deserves a sound explanation. The studies on the issue addressed increasing import dependency of the manufacturing sector in Turkey. This paper has attempted to scrutinize the reasons behind this phenomenon by looking not only at the manufacturing sector as the past studies did, but also at the other sectors of the economy. Using 1998 and 2002 Input -Output Tables, <b>import</b> <b>requirement</b> ratios have been calculated for 12 aggregate sectors. The results demonstrate that the contribution of the “wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and household goods” sector to the increasing import dependency, hence to significantly rising imports, is greater than that of the manufacturing sector.
