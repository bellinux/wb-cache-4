40|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas {{has become}} the most widely used gas {{insulator}} in high voltage equipment. But it has global warming effect. The search for alternative insulating gases is carried out all over the world. In order to use alternative gas for the circuit breaker, it is necessary to acquire the insulating property at high temperature. To study the property of insulating gases at high temperature, we use laser-produced plasma to simulate the arc discharge. The use of laser-produced plasma enables us to collect the experimental data easily via controlled eperiments. In this paper, we report the results of basic experiments carried out to verify the new experimental system. We have measured <b>spark-over</b> <b>voltage,</b> neutral gas density, and optical emission spectra of CO 2 and N 2. From the measurements, relationship among <b>spark-over</b> <b>voltage,</b> gas density, and temperature has been derived...|$|E
