40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a series of blast tests on a carbon fiber-reinforced poly-ether-imide (PEI) and a glass fiber-reinforced PEI composite. Initially, the fracture properties of the two composite systems were characterized through a series of flexural and interlaminar fracture tests. Blast testing was then undertaken on a ballistic pendulum facility, capable of measuring the impulse imparted by the plastic explosive. Delamination, localized fiber buckling, fiber fracture, and shear failure at the boundary of the clamped plates were identified as the primary failure mechanisms in the laminates, with their severity depending on the panel thickness and the applied impulse. Delamination was very localized along the center plane of the laminate, a reflection of the very high interlaminar fracture toughness of these composites. The critical impulse for rear <b>surface</b> <b>fiber</b> fracture has been found to increase rapidly with laminate thickness for the range of panels considered here. The impulses associated with the onset of rear-surface fiber fracture and complete failure of the target were similar, suggesting that rear <b>surface</b> <b>fiber</b> fracture is a pre-cursor to complete failure in these laminates. Limited tests on the glass fiber-reinforced PEI system showed that it offers a superior blast resistance to its carbon fiber counterpart. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{knowledge}} of in vivo {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) deformation is fundamental for understanding ACL injury mechanisms and for improving surgical reconstruction of the injured ACL. This study investigated the relative elongation of the ACL when the knee is subject to no load (< 10 N) and then to full body weight (axial tibial load) at various flexion angles using a combined dual fluoroscopic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. Methods: Nine healthy subjects were scanned with MRI and imaged when one knee was subject to no load and then to full body weight using a dual fluoroscopic system (0 °– 45 ° flexion angles). The ACL was analyzed using three models: a single central bundle; an anteromedial and posterolateral (double functional) bundle; and multiple (eight) <b>surface</b> <b>fiber</b> bundles. Results: The anteromedial bundle had a peak relative elongation of 4. 4 % ± 3. 4 % at 30 ° {{and that of the}} posterolateral bundle was 5. 9 % ± 3. 4 % at 15 °. The ACL <b>surface</b> <b>fiber</b> bundles at the posterior portion of the ACL were shorter in length than those at the anterior portion. However, the peak relative elongation of one posterolateral fiber bundle reached more than 13 % whereas one anteromedial fiber bundle reached a peak relative elongation of only about 3 % at 30 ° of flexion by increasing the axial tibial load from no load to full body weight. Conclusions: The data quantitatively demonstrated that under external loading the ACL experiences nonhomogeneous elongation, with the posterior fiber bundles stretching more than the anterior fiber bundles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although {{addition}} of montmorillonite (MMT) clay to isotactic polypropylene (iPP) results in large {{increases in the}} melt viscosity at low shear rates, satisfactory impregnation of glass mats is obtained with iPP/MMT under conditions typical of industrial processing, and the MMT is well dispersed throughout the resulting composites. However, the MMT is also shown to retard relaxation of the glass mat, leading to non-uniform through-thickness glass fiber distributions. Thus, depending on the initial lay-up and hence on the initial <b>surface</b> <b>fiber</b> concentration, the bending modulus of the consolidated specimens may either increase or decrease with increasing matrix MMT content, whereas the tensile modulus remains consistent with the predictions of micromechanical models {{based on the assumption}} of a uniform glass fiber distribution.
