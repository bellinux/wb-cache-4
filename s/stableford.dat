5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} of Amazing in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited Amazing for a decade, {{were unable to}} sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian <b>Stableford,</b> by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|Gillings had an {{inventory}} of material that he had acquired while editing Fantasy, and he drew on this for Science Fantasy, as well as incorporating his own fanzine, Science Fantasy Review, into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel Nonstop appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during {{the latter half of}} the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann's well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of Science Fantasy was always higher than that of New Worlds, and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian <b>Stableford</b> and Josephine Saxton. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of Impulse, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne {{took over}} as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in 1950. Browne {{preferred}} fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines for a while. He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and the quality declined. At the end of 1950, Ziff-Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such as Brian <b>Stableford</b> and Mike Ashley consider the result {{to have been a}} definite improvement in quality. Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest-sized magazine, Fantastic, in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well. The move from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the early 1950s, and with Fantastics success there was little reason to keep Fantastic Adventures going. It was merged with Fantastic; the last issue was dated March 1953, and the MayJune issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the following issue.|$|E

25|$|Very few {{professional}} tournaments {{have used}} a <b>Stableford</b> scoring system.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Stableford</b> {{system was}} {{developed}} by Dr. Frank Barney Gorton <b>Stableford</b> (1870–1959), to deter golfers from giving up on their round after {{just one or two}} bad holes. It was first used informally at the Glamorganshire Golf Club, Penarth, Wales, in 1898, and first used in competition at Wallasey Golf Club in Wallasey, England, in 1932.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stableford</b> is a {{scoring system}} {{used in the}} sport of golf. Rather than {{counting}} {{the total number of}} strokes taken, as in stroke play, it involves scoring points {{based on the number of}} strokes taken at each hole. Unlike traditional scoring methods, where the aim is to have the lowest score, under <b>Stableford</b> rules, the objective is to have the highest score.|$|E

They were the Royal Caribbean Classic in 2000 and 2001, and the Uniting Fore Care Classic in 2002. In the latter case, it {{was seen as a}} final attempt to save the failing tournament.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Stableford’s</b> prodigious {{output of}} short fiction has {{allowed him to}} put {{together}} the following 22 collections with only one case of overlapping stories between them: [...] "The Legacy of Erich Zann" [...] in both Collections 20 & 22. Collections 1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 16, 19 & 21 are subtitled [...] "Tales of the Biotech Revolution" [...] and are related to, though not always entirely consistent with, his [...] "Emortality" [...] novels, see above.|$|R
5000|$|Nonetheless, not all British {{science fiction}} from that period comports with <b>Stablefords</b> thesis. Some, for example, reveled in adventures {{in space and}} held an optimistic view of the future. By the 1930s, there were British authors (such as Eric Frank Russell) who were {{intentionally}} writing [...] "science fiction" [...] for American publication. At that point, British writers who used the term [...] "scientific romance" [...] did so either because they were unaware of science fiction or because they chose not {{to be associated with}} it.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with so much}} of Kuttner and Moore's work, {{the exact}} authorship is unclear. The novel is {{generally}} credited to Kuttner alone; however, most of their work after marriage was done in collaboration, and they frequently worked together so closely as to obscure {{the extent of their}} individual contributions. Critic Stefan R. Dziemianowicz has suggested that Bond's split personality in the novel is [...] "consistent with CLM's deployment of psychologically conflicted characters in her earlier fiction." [...] Brian <b>Stableford's</b> article on Kuttner in the same encyclopedia also names Moore as a co-author. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction concludes that it is [...] "safe to assume that many titles signed as by Kuttner alone are collaborations, though somewhat less safe to assume that the reverse applies." ...|$|R
500|$|Brian M. <b>Stableford's</b> 1979 {{work about}} James Blish's career, A Clash of Symbols, {{described}} {{the book as}} a [...] "combination of space opera and whimsy, quite typical of the Star Trek mythos". He thought that the sequences in the book {{would have been too}} expensive for the television series, although it was structured in a similar manner as an episode with [...] "sub-climaxes that one can easily imagine would bracket commercial breaks". In Strother B. Purdy's The Hole in the Fabric (1979), Spock Must Die! was referred to as a [...] "rather well-written" [...] example of the duplication of characters in science fiction. It was considered to be a play on elements of Martin Gardner's The Ambidextrous Universe and Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. It was described as an [...] "intriguing idea" [...] by astrobiologist Daniel Glavin in New Scientist magazine in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Fantasy {{literature}} presents us {{with many}} different worlds, some {{appearing to be}} like the real world, some completely different. By reading fantasy literature a person can enter these other worlds, take a look around, enjoy them, and maybe learn something {{that can be used for}} the better. Which leads to the question this essay will try to answer: how does fantasy literature involve the reader in an imaginary world? This essay draws upon a carefully assembled corpus of primary and secondary texts. The theory in this essay is mainly derived from a branch of literary studies called narratology. Narrative Fiction by Schlomith Rimmon-Kenan’s is used as a key text for accessing this theory. This essay pays special attention to the immersion and interaction theories that are set forth in Mary-Laure Ryan’s Narrative as Virtual Reality. This essay also makes extensive use of the theory about the implied reader, which Wolfgang Iser put forth in his well-known work, The Act of Reading. The rest of the theoretical corpus used here, is made up from a variety of theoretical texts about fantasy literature in general. Of these texts, this essay derives most from Brian M. <b>Stableford’s</b> Historical Dictionary of Fantasy Literature...|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} points awarded on each hole is {{determined}} based on comparison {{of the number of}} strokes taken to a fixed score, usually par. This fixed score is then adjusted in relation to the player's handicap. Once players have taken two strokes more than the adjusted fixed score, they may abandon the hole and move on to the next, as it is then not possible to score any points on that hole. Because of this, it is still possible to be competitive even allowing for a few bad holes. At the end of the round, the {{number of points}} scored on each hole is totaled to give a final score. The winner of a <b>Stableford</b> competition is the player with the highest point total. Final scores may be modified for all players using the Competition <b>Stableford</b> Adjustment system.|$|E
25|$|Glamorganshire Golf Club {{is located}} in Lower Penarth and is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} finest golf courses in the Principality. The course was established in 1890 and, in 1898, the club was the testing ground of Dr Frank Stableford’s revolutionary new <b>Stableford</b> golf scoring system still used all over the world today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stableford</b> {{can have}} {{the added benefit of}} {{speeding}} up the pace of play, as once it is no longer possible to score a point, players do not have to complete the hole but can simply pick up their ball and proceed to the next hole. It is a popular form of the game, especially at club level and particularly in the United Kingdom, as it is still possible to record a competitive score despite having the occasional bad hole.|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Fisher, {{writing his}} memoirs {{at the end}} of the nineteenth century, {{described}} what the area looked like in 1832. Standing close to the position of the present-day clock tower, Fisher describes how, on looking down Long Lane towards Ashby, [...] "we see a large tract of waste on both sides of the road, still traceable, covered with gorse-bushes, blackberry brambles, etc., with not a single house on either side of the way" [...] until arriving at the Hoo Ash turnpike. Then, looking toward Hugglescote (down a track that is now Belvoir Road), [...] "we see a magnificently timbered lane without a single house, with the exception of White Leys Farm and the Gate Inn on the Ashby Turnpike". In the direction of Bardon, there were no houses until arriving at a group of five or six cottages on the corner of what is now Whitwick Road and Hotel Street, and in the direction of Whitwick (the modern day Mantle Lane) there was nothing apart from a smithy and a carpenter's shop, and the houses of these tradesmen. These would have stood on the site of what is now The Springboard Centre (formerly <b>Stablefords</b> wagon works). From this wilderness emerged the modern town of Coalville, on a rapid scale, following the advent of deep coal mining.|$|R
25|$|In 1940, Lovelock was {{transferred}} first to Victoria for his job, {{where he played}} for Essendon in the Victorian Premier Cricket competition. In 1941, he was again transferred, to Tasmania, where he played for New Town in the TCA Grade Cricket competition. Returning to Western Australia in 1950, he took up golf, competing in several tournaments, and winning one, a <b>stableford</b> event held at Yokine. In 1951, {{he was elected to}} a position on the executive committee of the Western Australian Cricket Association. In 1952, he was appointed president of the Subiaco Football Club.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing a}} {{biography}} on the author, Brian <b>Stableford</b> placed several of Dick's short stories {{in a context}} that established {{their relationship to the}} author's personal hardships. [...] "...it always seemed to him [...] that his career was a catalogue of undeserved disappointments and the record of his published work a travesty of his true ambitions." [...] The personal problems which Dick struggled throughout his life provided fuel for several of the anxiety driven themes for his short stories. In Dick's early work, <b>Stableford</b> highlighted recurring themes in those most popular. These included paranoid suspicions; the dangerous hostility of [...] "seemingly innocent entities"; and [...] "the mechanization of the environment and the computerization of political decision-making". Stories in which androids and robots are a danger to the protagonist include [...] "Autofac", [...] "Colony", and Vulcan's Hammer. However, [...] "The Last of the Masters", <b>Stableford</b> contends, was an exception to Dick's common dystopic portrayals of technology, given Stableford's interpretation of Bors as an altruist, who was [...] "benign" [...] in its role.|$|E
500|$|Sf {{historian}} Mike Ashley regards Super Science Stories as marginally {{better than}} its companion magazine, Astonishing, adding [...] "both are {{a testament to}} what a good editor can do with a poor budget". [...] According to sf critics Brian <b>Stableford</b> and Peter Nicholls, the magazine [...] "had a greater importance {{to the history of}} sf than the quality of its stories would suggest; it was an important training ground".|$|E
500|$|Authors {{whose work}} {{appeared}} in Amazing Stories Quarterly include Stanton A. Coblentz, Miles J. Breuer, A. Hyatt Verrill, and Jack Williamson. [...] Critical opinions differ {{on the quality}} of the fiction Gernsback and Sloane printed: Brian <b>Stableford</b> regards several of the novels as being important early science fiction, but Everett Bleiler comments that few of the stories were of acceptable quality. [...] Milton Wolf and Mike Ashley are more positive in their assessment; they consider the work Sloane published in the early 1930s to be some of the best in the new genre.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} was never {{regarded as one}} of the leading titles of the genre, but has received qualified praise from science fiction critics and historians. [...] Science fiction historian Raymond Thompson describes it as [...] "one of the most interesting magazines to appear during the 1940s", despite the variable quality of the stories. [...] Critics Brian <b>Stableford</b> and Peter Nicholls comment that the magazine [...] "had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest; it was an important training ground".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, New Worlds and the New Wave's {{connection}} to and influence on science fiction was becoming tenuous. [...] In the August 1969 issue, Platt asserted that [...] "New Worlds is not a science-fiction magazine", and Moorcock likened it to an avant-garde and experimental literary review. [...] The sf world had lost interest in New Worlds, and it had become, in Ashley's words, [...] "a revolution running out of energy". [...] In the longer term, however, it proved influential, despite the lack of wide acceptance at the time: in the words of sf historian Brian <b>Stableford,</b> [...] "the paths beaten by the New Worlds writers are now much more generally in use".|$|E
500|$|The burgeoning village {{became a}} hub of {{commercial}} activity. The Duke employed craftsmen to service {{a wide range}} of industries including boat-making, plastering, blacksmithing and mining. A local quarry supplied limestone, for which a kiln was constructed at the junction of Barton Road (B5211) and <b>Stableford</b> Road. A quarry at the Delph supplied building materials for the region, including the stone used to construct Brindley's aqueduct. To accommodate the workers needed for these industries the Duke built extra housing and cottages. [...] In a diary entry of 1773, Josiah Wedgwood wrote of the area [...] "We next visited Worsley which has the appearance of a considerable Seaport Town. His Grace has built some hundreds of houses, & is every year adding considerably to their number." [...] Worsley Green became a thriving centre of industry.|$|E
500|$|According to Milton Wolf and Mike Ashley, {{historians of}} science fiction, {{over the next}} two years Sloane {{published}} some of the best sf of the early years of the field in Amazing Stories Quarterly. [...] Wolf and Ashley cite [...] "Paradox", by Charles Cloukey, an early time-travel story; The Bridge of Light, by A. Hyatt Verrill, a novel about a lost civilization in South America; The Birth of a New Republic, by Miles J. Breuer and Jack Williamson, in which a man of the 24th century reminisces about a revolt by the inhabitants of the Moon rebel against the Earth; [...] "Paradise and Iron", by Breuer; and White Lily, by Eric Temple Bell, under the pseudonym John Taine, about a form of crystal life that endangers the planet. [...] After 1931, according to Wolf and Ashley, the fiction in Amazing Stories Quarterly became less entertaining. [...] Everett Bleiler, the author of a detailed review of the first ten years of science fiction magazines, is less complimentary, describing John W. Campbell, Jr.'s space operas, which appeared from 1930 to 1932, as [...] "turgid", and commenting that only a dozen or so of the stories in the magazine's entire run [...] "might have been considered worth reading if one could put oneself back in the 1930s, accepting the standards of the time". [...] Bleiler mentions three authors, Coblentz, Taine, and Breuer, as having produced notably original material, but adds that their work was [...] "not strong enough for mainstream fiction" [...] and had [...] "too little action and too much sophistication for pulp". [...] Bleiler does however agree with Wolf and Ashley that the magazines's quality declined over time. [...] Brian <b>Stableford,</b> in the Science Fiction Encyclopedia, also highlights Coblentz, Taine and Breuer, along with Williamson and Verrill, among the magazine's contributors; <b>Stableford</b> regards their contributions as being among [...] "the most important early pulp sf novels".|$|E
