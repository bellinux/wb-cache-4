It enables a MAC station to communicate with upper layers via different protocols.|$|R
40|$|Sexual health <b>service</b> <b>access</b> is {{fundamental}} to good sexual health, yet interventions designed to address this have rarely been implemented or evaluated. In this paper, pilot evaluation findings for a targeted public health behavior change intervention, delivered via a website and web-app, aiming to increase uptake of sexual health services amongst 13 to 19 year-olds are reported. A pre-post questionnaire-based design was used. Matched baseline and follow-up data was identified from 148 respondents aged 13 - 18 years. Outcome measures were self-reported <b>service</b> <b>access,</b> self-reported intention to <b>access</b> <b>services,</b> and beliefs about <b>services</b> and <b>service</b> <b>access</b> identified through needs analysis. Objective <b>service</b> <b>access</b> data provided by local sexual health services was also analyzed. Analysis suggests the intervention had a significant positive effect on psychological barriers to and antecedents of <b>service</b> <b>access</b> amongst females. Males, who reported greater confidence in <b>service</b> <b>access</b> compared with females, significantly increased <b>service</b> <b>access</b> by time 2 follow-up. Available objective <b>service</b> <b>access</b> data supports the assertion that the intervention {{may have led to}} increases in <b>service</b> <b>access.</b> There is real promise for this novel digital intervention. Further evaluation is planned as the model is licensed to and rolled out by other local authorities in the UK...|$|R

2500|$|Mail {{contracts}} {{were the}} basis of P's prosperity until the Second World War, but the company also became a major commercial shipping line and passenger liner operator. [...] In 1914, it took over the British India Steam Navigation Company, which was then the largest British shipping line, owning 131 steamers. [...] In 1918, it gained a controlling interest in the Orient Line, its partner in the England- Australia mail route. Further acquisitions followed and the fleet reached a peak of almost 500 ships in the mid-1920s. In 1920, the company also established a bank, P Bank, that it sold to Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (now Standard Chartered Bank) in 1927. At this time it established a commercial relationship with Spinney's of Haifa, that developed into a major regional high-end grocery store chain, which eventually provided shipping <b>services</b> <b>access</b> {{to much of the}} Middle East. Until 1934 it operated liners from Key West, Florida to Havana; then it operated from Miami to Cuba until 1960.|$|E
2500|$|This {{index is}} useful in {{understanding}} and illuminating the differences between human poverty (which focuses on the denial of basic rights, such as dignity and freedom) and income poverty. For example, despite the U.S.'s high income stability, it is also ranked among the highest developed nations in human poverty. In her article, [...] "Towards a Gendered Human Poverty Measure", Elizabeth Durbin critiques HPI and expands {{on the possibility of}} a gender-sensitive index. She argues that HPI incorporates three dimensions of poverty: life span measured by the proportion of the population expected to die before age 40, lack of knowledge measured by the proportion who are illiterate, and a decent standard of living measured by a composite index of access to health <b>services,</b> <b>access</b> to safe water, and malnutrition among children less than 5, that could specifically account for gender disparities. Despite its uses, however, {{it is important to note}} that HPI cannot be a true measure of poverty because it fails to examine certain deprivations, such as lack of property ownership and credit, that are essential to a stronger bargaining position in the household for women.|$|E
