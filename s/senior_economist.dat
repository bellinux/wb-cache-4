2500|$|According to James Smith, a <b>senior</b> <b>economist</b> at Santa Monica-based RAND Corporation {{and lead}} {{author of the}} United States National Research Council's study [...] "", {{immigrants}} contribute as much as $10 billion to the U.S. economy each year. The NRC report found that although immigrants, especially those from Latin America, caused a net loss in terms of taxes paid versus social services received, immigration can provide an overall gain to the domestic economy due {{to an increase in}} pay for higher-skilled workers, lower prices for goods and services produced by immigrant labor, and more efficiency and lower wages for some owners of capital. The report also notes that although immigrant workers compete with domestic workers for low-skilled jobs, some immigrants specialize in activities that otherwise would not exist in an area, and thus can be beneficial for all domestic residents.|$|E
