5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate {{the cochlear}} duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the fifth}} week of development, the {{auditory}} vesicle also {{gives rise to the}} cochlear duct, which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the endolymph that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth. The vestibular wall will separate the cochlear duct from the perilymphatic scala vestibuli, a cavity inside the cochlea. The basilar membrane separates the cochlear duct from the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani,</b> a cavity within the cochlear labyrinth. The lateral wall of the cochlear duct is formed by the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis, which produces the endolymph. The hair cells develop from the lateral and medial ridges of the cochlear duct, which together with the tectorial membrane make up the organ of Corti.|$|E
25|$|In most {{reptiles}} the perilymphatic duct and lagena {{are relatively}} short, and the sensory cells {{are confined to}} a small basilar papilla lying between them. However, in birds, mammals, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated. In birds, crocodilians, and monotremes, the ducts are simply extended, together forming an elongated, more or less straight, tube. The endolymphatic duct is wrapped in a simple loop around the lagena, with the basilar membrane lying along one side. The {{first half of the}} duct is now referred to as the scala vestibuli, while the second half, which includes the basilar membrane, is called the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani.</b> As a result of this increase in length, the basilar membrane and papilla are both extended, with the latter developing into the organ of Corti, while the lagena is now called the cochlear duct. All of these structures together constitute the cochlea.|$|E
40|$|The {{position}} of the cochlear-implant electrode is important to audiological outcomes after cochlear implantation. The common technique to evaluate the intracochlear electrode’s position {{involves the use of}} ionized radiation in MSCT, DVT, or flat-panel tomography (FPT). Recent advances in knowledge regarding the handling of MRI artifacts in cochlear implantees indicate that estimating the intracochlear electrode’s position with an MRI could be possible. This study’s aim was to evaluate the ipsilaterally {{position of}} electrodes using MRI at 1. 5 [*]T. In a retrospective study of 10 implantees with postoperative need for MRI scanning, we evaluated the intrascalar electrode’s position using a T 2 -weighted sequence at 1. 5 [*]T. We compared the resulting estimate of the intracochlear position with the estimates from the postoperative FPT scan and the intraoperative NRT ratio. For each ear, the MRI-estimated scalar position corresponded with the estimated positions from the FPT and NRT ratio. For eight ears, a <b>scala</b> <b>tympani’s</b> position was observed in the MRI. In one case, an electrode scalar translocation was found. In one case, the scala vestibuli’s position was observed. Thus, MRI-based estimation of the scalar position of a cochlear-implant electrode is possible. Limitations to this method include implant-specific magnet and fixation configurations, which can cause complications...|$|R
40|$|The cranial {{anatomy of}} Dinilysia patagonica, a {{terrestrial}} snake from the Upper Cretaceous of Argentina, is redescribed and illustrated, based on high-resolution X-ray computed tomography and better preparations made on previously known specimens, including the holotype. Previously unreported characters reinforce the intriguing mosaic {{nature of the}} skull of Dinilysia, with a suite of plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters with respect to extant snakes. Newly recognized plesiomorphies are {{the absence of the}} medial vertical flange of the nasal, lateral position of the prefrontal, lizard-like contact between vomer and palatine, floor of the recessus <b>scalae</b> <b>tympani</b> formed by the basioccipital, posterolateral corners of the basisphenoid strongly ventrolaterally projected, and absence of a medial parietal pillar separating the telencephalon and mesencephalon, amongst others. We also reinterpreted the structures forming the otic region of Dinilysia, confirming the presence of a crista circumfenestralis, which represents an important derived ophidian synapomorphy. Both plesiomorphic and apomorphic traits of Dinilysia are treated in detail and illustrated accordingly. Results of a phylogenetic analysis support a basal position of Dinilysia, as the sister-taxon to all extant snakes. The fossil taxa Yurlunggur, Haasiophis, Eupodophis, Pachyrhachis, and Wonambi appear as derived snakes nested within the extant clade Alethinophidia, as stem-taxa to the crown-clade Macrostomata. The hypothesis of a sister-group relationship between Dinilysia and Najash rionegrina, as suggested by some authors, is rejected by the results of our analysis.

40|$|Animals are {{frequently}} {{used for the}} development and testing of new hearing devices. Dimensions {{of the middle ear}} and cochlea differ significantly between humans and commonly used animals, such as rodents or cats. The sheep cochlea is anatomically more like the human cochlea in size and number of turns. This study investigated the middle-ear ossicular velocities and intracochlear sound pressure (ICSP) in sheep temporal bones, with the aim of characterizing the sheep as an experimental model for implantable hearing devices. Measurements were made on fresh sheep temporal bones. Velocity responses of the middle ear ossicles at the umbo, long process of the incus and stapes footplate were measured in the frequency range of 0. 25 - 8 kHz using a laser Doppler vibrometer system. Results were normalized by the corresponding sound pressure level in the external ear canal (PEC). Sequentially, ICSPs at the <b>scala</b> vestibuli and <b>tympani</b> were then recorded with custom MEMS-based hydrophones, while presenting identical acoustic stimuli. The sheep middle ear transmitted most effectively around 4. 8 kHz, with a maximum stapes velocity of 0. 2 mm/s/Pa. At the same frequency, the ICSP measurements in the <b>scala</b> vestibuli and <b>tympani</b> showed the maximum gain relative to the PEC (24 dB and 5 dB, respectively). The greatest pressure difference across the cochlear partition occurred between 4 and 6 kHz. A comparison between {{the results of this study}} and human reference data showed middle-ear resonance and best cochlear sensitivity at higher frequencies in sheep. In summary, sheep can be an appropriate large animal model for research and development of implantable hearing devices...|$|R

50|$|The basilar {{membrane}} within the cochlea {{of the inner}} ear is a stiff structural element that separates two liquid-filled tubes that run along the coil of the cochlea, the scala media and the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> (see figure).|$|E
5000|$|It reaches about half-way {{toward the}} outer {{wall of the}} tube, and {{partially}} divides its cavity into two passages or scalae, of which the upper is named the scala vestibuli, while the lower is termed the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani.</b>|$|E
50|$|The basal {{end of the}} cochlea, where sounds enter {{from the}} middle ear, encodes the higher end of the audible {{frequency}} range while the apical end of the cochlea encodes {{the lower end of}} the frequency range. This tonotopy plays a crucial role in hearing, as it allows for spectral separation of sounds. A cross section of the cochlea will reveal an anatomical structure with three main chambers (scala vestibuli, scala media, and <b>scala</b> <b>tympani).</b> At the apical end of the cochlea, at an opening known as the helicotrema, the scala vestibuli merges with the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani.</b> The fluid found in these two cochlear chambers is perilymph, while scala media, or the cochlear duct, is filled with endolymph.|$|E
50|$|The tympanic duct or <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> {{is one of}} the perilymph-filled {{cavities}} in {{the inner}} ear of the human.

50|$|As {{vibrations}} compress {{the bones}} of the skull, pressure is put on the otic capsule and the membranous labyrinth.

50|$|The {{inner ear}} {{consists}} of the cochlea and several non-auditory structures. The cochlea has three fluid-filled sections, and supports a fluid wave driven by pressure across the basilar membrane separating two of the sections. Strikingly, one section, called the cochlear duct or scala media, contains endolymph, a fluid similar in composition to the intracellular fluid found inside cells. The organ of Corti is located in this duct on the basilar membrane, and transforms mechanical waves to electric signals in neurons. The other two sections are known as the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> and the scala vestibuli; these are located within the bony labyrinth, which is filled with fluid called perilymph, similar in composition to cerebrospinal fluid. The chemical difference between the fluids endolymph and perilymph fluids {{is important for the}} function of the inner ear due to electrical potential differences between potassium and calcium ions.|$|E

50|$|The {{deflection}} of the hair-cell stereocilia opens mechanically gated ion {{channels that}} allow any small, positively charged ions (primarily potassium and calcium) {{to enter the}} cell. Unlike many other electrically active cells, the hair cell itself does not fire an action potential. Instead, the influx of positive ions from the endolymph in the scala media depolarizes the cell, resulting in a receptor potential. This receptor potential opens voltage gated calcium channels; calcium ions then enter the cell and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at the basal end of the cell. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the narrow space between the hair cell and a nerve terminal, where they then bind to receptors and thus trigger action potentials in the nerve. In this way, the mechanical sound signal is converted into an electrical nerve signal. Repolarization of hair cells is done in a special manner. The perilymph in the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> has a very low concentration of positive ions. The electrochemical gradient makes the positive ions flow through channels to the perilymph.|$|E
50|$|The basilar {{membrane}} on the tympanic duct presses against the hair {{cells of the}} organ as perilymphatic pressure waves pass. The stereocilia atop the IHCs move with this fluid displacement and in response their cation, or positive ion selective, channels are pulled open by cadherin structures called tip links that connect adjacent stereocilia. The organ of Corti, surrounded in potassium rich fluid endolymph, lies on the {{basilar membrane}} {{at the base of}} the scala media. Under the organ of Corti is the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> and above it, the scala vestibuli. Both structures exist in a low potassium fluid called perilymph. Because those stereocilia are in the midst of a high concentration of potassium, once their cation channels are pulled open, potassium ions as well as calcium ions flow into the top of the hair cell. With this influx of positive ions the IHC becomes depolarized, opening voltage-gated calcium channels at the basolateral region of the hair cells and triggering the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. An electrical signal is then sent through the auditory nerve and into the auditory cortex of the brain as a neural message.|$|E
50|$|The {{influx of}} cations, {{particularly}} potassium, {{through the open}} MET channels causes the membrane potential of the hair cell to depolarize. This depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels to allow the further influx of calcium. This results {{in an increase in}} the calcium concentration, which triggers the exocytosis of neurotransmitter vesicles at ribbon synapses at the basolateral surface of the hair cell. The release of neurotransmitter at a ribbon synapse, in turn, generates an action potential in the connected auditory-nerve fiber. Hyperpolarization of the hair cell, which occurs when potassium leaves the cell, is also important, as it stops the influx of calcium and therefore stops the fusion of vesicles at the ribbon synapses. Thus, as elsewhere in the body, the transduction is dependent on the concentration and distribution of ions. The perilymph that is found in the <b>scala</b> <b>tympani</b> has a low potassium concentration, whereas the endolymph found in the scala media has a high potassium concentration and an electrical potential of about 80 millivolts compared to the perilymph. Mechanotransduction by stereocilia is highly sensitive and able to detect perturbations as small as fluid fluctuations of 0.3 nanometers, and can convert this mechanical stimulation into an electrical nerve impulse in about 10 microseconds.|$|E
50|$|Air {{pressure}} {{changes in}} the ear canal cause the vibrations of the tympanic membrane and middle ear ossicles. At {{the end of the}} ossicular chain, movement of the stapes footplate within the oval window of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the basilar membrane. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the organ of Corti: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each Fourier component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the scala vestibuli and <b>scala</b> <b>tympani.</b> Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position. When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.|$|E
