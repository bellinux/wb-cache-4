25|$|Expanded-bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) chromatography is {{a convenient}} and effective technique for {{the capture of}} proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the <b>settled</b> <b>bed</b> is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends {{on the characteristics of}} the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the <b>settled</b> <b>bed</b> in gravitational sedimentation have been studied by many researchers. The <b>settled</b> <b>bed,</b> often composed of flocculated or aggregated particles, is formed from a process of freesettling, followed by consolidation, subjected to compression. Although the free-settling of the particles is well understood, there is scope for advancing our knowledge to explain and predict the {{characteristics of}} the consolidation. The aim of this research was to develop a universal description of the bed consolidation, limited to incompressible systems that do not yield. A series of batch settling tests was conducted using a model experimental system to generate a broad range of data. Hence the initial volume fraction of the particles ranged from 0. 28 to 0. 55. Spherical, low density, particles were used in the batch tests. These model particles exhibited some features similar to flocculated particles. The new theoretical model is used to calculate the quantity of water expressed from each layer of sediment. The water expressed in a time period scales directly with the quantity of expressible water in the layer, and inversely with the lapse time squared. The batch settling test results, defined in terms of the height of the settled solids versus time, were used to validate the theoretical model. Excellent agreement across the full range of solids concentrations was obtained...|$|E

40|$|The {{compression}} behaviour, {{shear strength}} characteristics, and material properties of dense slurries and soft <b>settled</b> <b>beds</b> of natural fine-grained sediments were studied experimentally. Slurries of varying initial density, initial height, and pore fluid salinity were settled one-dimensionally, by self-weight, in the laboratory. Settling behaviour was studied {{in terms of}} slurry appearance, particle segregation, height of surface versus time, sediment surface and element settlement rates, and the redistribution of sediment with respect to height and time. Consolidation behaviour was studied in terms of sediment compressibility and pore fluid flow. Shear strength was examined "in situ" and elated to the parameters effective stress and specific volume. Instruments and techniques were developed to facilitate the measurement of low effective stresses, low strengths, and high specific volumes. A small scale sediment sampler was developed and used {{in an attempt to}} study the arrangement of particles within soft sensitive beds. The experimental results revealed numerous fundamental reasons why theoretical models of settling and consolidation are unsatisfactory when applied to dense flocculated slurries and beds of high specific volume, respectively. For the sediment studied, well-defined compressibility and shear strength relationships were observed. Pore fluid flow relationships were non-unique at high specific volumes. The compression behaviour of slurries was found to have a rational basis in terms of electrochemical forces and degrees of particle association.

The experiments sought to reproduce {{the environment of the}} lower mudflat at Hythe, Southampton Water, Southern England; this is characterised by fine grain-size and a surface layer of very fluid mud. Natural sediments were used to produce <b>settled</b> <b>beds</b> in the Lab Carousel, an annular flume of 2 m diameter. The following bed conditions were investigated diatom biofilms; the addition of cockles (Cerastoderma edule); and abiotic sediment, obtained by the addition of sodium hypochlorite. The erosion threshold (?crit, calculated with the TKE method) was in the range 0. 02 – 0. 20 Pa. Bioconsolidation increased ?crit considerably: compared to the abiotic sediment experiment, ?crit was 5 – 10 times higher depending on the biofilm development. The relationship between ?crit and water content of sediment (the best proxy for sediment compaction) was as good, or better than between ?crit and chlorophyll a (proxy for biofilm development). When cockles were introduced, ?crit was significantly lower (reduction by 50 – 75 % compared with the diatom biofilm experiments), reflecting the surface disturbance by the bivalves. The biofilm erosion was characterised by a patchy pattern: the bed surface stayed mainly uneroded and erosion was visible only on a few elongated patches commencing at some weakness points of the biofilm, then progressing downstream. The results illustrate the importance of the surface heterogeneity: the irregularities of a natural bed (weak points of the biofilm, bioturbations, microrelief, larger roughness elements like shells or algae, etc.) have a determinant effect on the erodibility of biofilms. Such characteristics may have more influence than biofilm strength, because the erosion starts from the weaker areas. <br/...|$|R

From subaqueous and aeolian dunes and ripples to plug flow in the minerals engineering industry, {{the complexity of the}} fluid dynamics and interparticle interactions in multiphase flow is such that specific applications require specific solutions. The behaviour of suspensions of solid particles in a water carrier fluid in closed pipe flow is investigated over a range of flow regimes, from fully suspended, homogeneous flows to <b>settled</b> <b>beds,</b> using four particle species. The suspensions are intended to be simple analogues of more complex slurries that are encountered in the nuclear industry, the disposal and transport of which represent an ongoing challenge. An off-the-shelf ultrasonic signal processing unit, with two ultrasonic transducers operating at 2 and 4 MHz, is used as both a Doppler velocimeter and an acoustic backscatter system. The results of a range of distinct measurements are presented. The effect of suspended particles of several types at several volume fractions on the first- and second-order flow statistics is described. The dependence of two critical velocities that delineate the homogeneous, heterogeneous and moving-bed flow regimes on the flow and particle properties is described, and the results are compared to two correlations of critical transport velocity in the literature. A model was developed to measure the scattering and attenuation properties of arbitrary solid particles in suspensions, and the measured values are incorporated into an inversion method in order to construct particle concentration profiles in pipe flow. Lastly, the behaviour of stable and time-dependent bedforms, which have been studied in natural and rectangular channels extensively, is investigated in closed pipe flow, and phase diagrams of bedform types are presented and compared with a similar diagram in the literature.

The local value of the heat transfer coecient is strongly influenced by the cross sectional distribution of the solid phase in the pipe. At flow regimes associated with low mixture flow rates and substantial <b>settled</b> <b>bed,</b> the heat transfer at the bed periphery deteriorates because of the ‘‘screen eect’ ’ produced by the settled particles.
