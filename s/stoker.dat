5|$|Whitman also {{influenced}} Bram <b>Stoker,</b> author of Dracula, {{and was the}} model for the character of Dracula. <b>Stoker</b> said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to <b>Stoker,</b> was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman's death. Other admirers included the Eagle Street College, an informal group established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace in Eagle Street, Bolton, to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman. The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its members held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the poet's birthday.|$|E

5000|$|In {{assembling}} {{a team of}} their own, the new owners acquired {{the bulk of the}} starting line-up from the 1967 NPSL Philadelphia Spartans franchise, which would not participate in the NASL in 1968. The new <b>Stokers</b> won their division and fully intended on continuing operation. However, a difference in business philosophy with the five surviving NASL franchises saw the <b>Stokers</b> stay dormant in 1969. They did host an exhibition featuring a number of <b>Stokers</b> and NASL [...] "all-stars" [...] versus a West German opponent, which drew well, and fostered some hope, but Metzenbaum and Bonda remained unhappy with the NASL budgetary restraints, and announced the end of the <b>Stokers</b> in November 1969.The 1968 <b>Stokers</b> won their division after a tight race with the talented Chicago Mustangs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stoker's</b> {{began as}} a family-run business, began by {{producing}} and selling long-leaf tobacco in West Tennessee in the early 1900s. Eventually, this evolved into a mail-order bulk tobacco business. The company's first chewing tobacco, 24-C, was released in the 1940s. Differing from other manufacturers of chewing tobacco, <b>Stoker's</b> sells its chew in 16oz bags, compared to the standard 3oz, to offer a better deal to consumers. More recently, <b>Stoker's</b> has entered the moist snuff (dipping tobacco) market. <b>Stoker's</b> is known for selling moist snuff in 12oz tubs, the equivalent to ten 1.2oz standard cans. Single cans are available in select markets.|$|R

5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram <b>Stoker</b> in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8 September 1999 by Scholastic Inc.

5|$|The vampire is now {{a fixture}} in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and {{continued}} with 19th-century short stories, {{the first and most}} influential of which was John Polidori's The Vampyre (1819), featuring the vampire Lord Ruthven. Lord Ruthven's exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the antihero. The vampire theme continued in penny dreadful serial publications such as Varney the Vampire (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: Dracula by Bram <b>Stoker,</b> published in 1897.|$|E

5|$|Valiant {{was paid}} off in 1885, and she was {{assigned}} to the HMS Indus <b>stoker</b> training establishment in 1897, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904. The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III.

During an attack on the village of La Barque, Whittle rushed a German trench and forced the men from the position; he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal as a result.|$|E
5|$|By 1904 {{the line}} was {{operating}} fourteen steamships of between four and seven thousand tons, several built by the associated Furness Withy shipyards. Services to ports in eastern Canada were supplemented by regular sailings to Boston, Philadelphia, and the southern US cotton ports of New Orleans and Galveston. Between 1904 and 1908 ML deployed three vessels including the Manchester City to the River Plate route, serving other UK ports as well Manchester. The main return cargo was frozen and chilled meat, and the City set a record for the largest meat consignment up to that time. Lord Furness, as he had become, died in 1912 and was succeeded as ML's chairman by R. B. <b>Stoker</b> {{until his death in}} 1919. ML's fleet was maintained at 14vessels during the last few years before the First World War. Eleven of their ships were deployed on the Canadian routes, carrying mainly manufactured goods outwards and meat and grain inbound.|$|E
50|$|Bram <b>Stoker's</b> Dracula's Curse (also known {{simply as}} Dracula's Curse) is a 2006 horror film by The Asylum, written and {{directed}} by Leigh Scott. Despite featuring Bram <b>Stoker's</b> name in the title, the film is not directly based on any of his writings or a mockbuster to the 1992 film Bram <b>Stoker's</b> Dracula, but shares similarities to films such as Blade: Trinity, Dracula 2000, Underworld: Evolution and Van Helsing. The film also shares some similarities with the 1971 Hammer horror film Countess Dracula, which also features a Dracula-esque femme fatale in the lead role.|$|R

He fled to Rome, {{obtained}} a false passport and sailed for the United States from Marseilles, France. He disembarked on March 17, 1907, in New York disguised {{as a member of the}} ship's crew, posing as a <b>stoker.</b> In New York he began to run a gambling den in the basement of 108 Mulberry Street. He became one of the primary underworld targets of police sergeant Joseph Petrosino of the New York City Police Department, who believed Alfano to be a big player in the New York branch of the Camorra.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1940, a {{train with}} workers from Trondheim {{to the airport}} {{collided}} with the local train from Kopperå just east of Hommelvik Station. The Hommelvik train disaster killed 22 people. The trains {{were supposed to have}} passed at Homnmelvik Station, but the engineer thought he had seen the other train, and had left the station. The accident occurred at 08:03, and was caused by there being virtually no light to see with, since all outdoor sources of light were covered. On 23 January 1941, a coke and coal train from Sweden lost its braking between the border and Kopperå. The six back cars plus the caboose derailed just west of Kopperå Station, while the locomotive and 17 other trains continued their wild flight. The train derailed at Meråker Station, and the Meråker train disaster killed both the engineer and the <b>stoker.</b>|$|E
