500|$|The {{lyrics are}} about the birth of Madonna's {{daughter}} Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In {{an interview with the}} Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: [...] "There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing {{that at the end of}} the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>you</b> have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'." [...] Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was about confronting the past, [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] conversely is about [...] "moving onward." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryant's {{star power}} and her extreme views were {{highlighted}} in national news stories. Mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times, Associated Press and Washington Post reported weekly updates on campaign progress, with smaller local newspapers {{across the country}} weighing in their editorial opinions on which side should prevail. Bryant appeared on Good Morning America and The Phil Donahue Show. Her tone and accusations united {{gay men and lesbians}} in cities all over the U.S. In the weeks before the vote, almost $55,000 was raised outside of Florida to oppose Save Our Children. Foreshadowing the effectiveness of the Save Our Children campaign, on April 13, 1977, the Florida Legislature voted not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), to the astonishment of those anticipating the vote. The connection between the ERA and ordinance 77-4 was obvious to many. Florida Senator Dempsey Barron vocally opposed passing the ERA, fearing it would legalize same-sex marriages, force people to use unisex bathrooms, and that it would harm laws meant to protect families. National Organization for Women founder and ERA proponent Betty Friedan expressed her disdain, saying [...] "suddenly you have this red herring in Anita Bryant. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>you</b> have this wave of anti-gay hysteria and then that was preempting the air waves behind the scenes".|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that <b>suddenly</b> <b>you</b> might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E

2500|$|The Force Awakenss first {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Michael Arndt. Early drafts had Luke appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that [...] "every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>you</b> didn't care about your main character anymore." [...] Luke became the film's MacGuffin and {{does not appear in}} person until the final scene. Several directors were considered, including David Fincher, Brad Bird, Ben Affleck and Guillermo del Toro; after a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy, J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.|$|E
2500|$|The 1868 Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, led {{by later}} U.S. Geological Survey {{director}} Clarence King, {{was the first}} to closely study the geology, soils and minerals of the Shoshone Falls area. King described the country as [...] "strange and savage", and said of the falls themselves: [...] "You ride upon a waste. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>you</b> stand upon a brink. Black walls flank the abyss. A great river fights its way through the labyrinth of blackened ruins and plunges in foaming whiteness." [...] He was also the first to speculate that the falls and canyon, rather than being formed by erosion over millennia, might have been created by [...] "moments of great catastrophe" [...] considering the region's chaotic volcanic history. Timothy H. O'Sullivan was {{also a member of the}} 1868 expedition, and became the first national photographer to picture the falls. O'Sullivan also returned to the area in 1874, again to photograph Shoshone Falls.|$|E
2500|$|... "Black Cat" [...] {{received}} positive reception from critics, {{who placed}} {{heavy emphasis on}} Jackson's foray into hard rock. Chuck Campbell of The News Journal called it her [...] "most intriguing track," [...] saying [...] "Miss Jackson relishes {{the role of a}} rocker with unexpected fervor." [...] It was also considered a notable contrast from the [...] "sweet and lovable Janet" [...] of singles such as [...] "Miss You Much," [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)," [...] and [...] "Escapade," [...] transitioning to an [...] "edgier front." [...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "Most hair metal bands would have paid a lifetime in spandex to come up with that guitar line, and then Janet goes and melds it with her funky-fresh backup singers and <b>suddenly</b> <b>you</b> can dance to it — and believe you me, {{it is not easy to}} make You're gonna die into a danceable lyric." [...] Elysa Gardner of Vibe said it [...] "rocks with a frisky muscularity," [...] while author W.K. Stratton praised its [...] "thundering bass." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commended its [...] "grimy" [...] and [...] "guitar-driven" [...] approach, which [...] "unleashes a guitar riff somewhere between the Robert Palmer hit 'Simply Irresistible' and Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water'." [...] Daniel Durchholz of Amazon stated it [...] "burns the place down with a fierce burst of hard rock," [...] while The Sentinel called it a [...] "dance/rock winner." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic considered it a [...] "headbanger" [...] with a [...] "hot, distorted lead guitar break, while Alex Henderson applauded Jackson's vocals as used to their [...] "maximum advantage," [...] declaring it a [...] "pop/rock smoker." [...] Similarly, Logo commended her delivery as it became [...] "less breathy and gets more visceral," [...] displaying aggression. MTV News added Jackson [...] "wailed like a total tigress" [...] throughout the song.|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And <b>suddenly,</b> <b>you</b> know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E
