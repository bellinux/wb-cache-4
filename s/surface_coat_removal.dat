40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of natural (innate) resistance is {{exemplified by the}} solid resistance of mice to infection with the rat-specific Trypanosoma lewisi. We provide {{more information about the}} mechanism of resistance in this model system. Resistance was not diminished in aged mice or reduced by ionizing radiation or splenectomy. There was no difference in resistance of C 5 -deficient mice (B 10. D 2 /oSn and AKR) compared with their normocomplementemic counterparts (B 10. D 2 /nSn and C 57 BL/ 6). Treatment of mice with cobra venom factor resulted in greatly prolonged survival of T. lewisi in mice. Combined treatment of mice with cobra venom factor and silica dust resulted in not only prolonged survival but also considerable intravascular growth of the parasite and resultant death of the mice. T. lewisi cells from irradiated donor rats, or after <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> <b>removal</b> with trypsin, were eliminated by inoculated mice more efficiently than were parasites acquired from normal rats. Incubation of trypanosomes obtained from irradiated rats in normal rat serum restored their resistance to rapid elimination. From the results of these studies and other recent investigations, we have concluded that murine resistance to T. lewisi involves activation and binding of C 3 b by uncoated trypanosomes and concomitant participation of radiation-resistant, silica dust-sensitive effector cells (probably macrophages and neutrophils), and rat plasma proteins, integrated into the trypanosome surface coat, stabilize the coat, make it less susceptible to removal when the trypanosome is present in the mouse bloodstream, and thus delay exposure of underlying molecules (receptors?) that activate murine C 3...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} showed that many neurons in the adult rat brain possessed a perineuronal sulfated {{proteoglycan}} <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> which reacted to cationic iron colloid and aldehyde fuchsin. This <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was stained supravitally with Ehrlich's methylene blue and doubly stained with Ehrlich's methylene blue and aldehyde fuchsin. The <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was also stained with GÃ¶mÃ¶ri's ammoniacal silver and doubly stained with GÃ¶mÃ¶ri's ammoniacal silver and cationic iron colloid. The <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was usually expressed together with a nerve cell surface glycoprotein net detectable with lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin. These findings indicate that the perineuronal proteoglycan <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> is identical to Cajal's superficial reticulum and contains some collagenous elements.

40|$|This study evaluated, in vitro, {{the effects}} of {{different}} instrumentations used {{in the treatment of}} peri-implantitis on implant <b>surfaces</b> <b>coated</b> with hydroxyapatite or titanium plasma spray (TPS). Materials and Methods: There were 14 cylindrical rough implants used, including 7 hydroxyapatite and 7 TPS coated. Split in 2 parts for a total of 24 experimental surfaces, implants were treated with a stainless-steel curette, plastic curette, ultrasonic scaler tip, and air-powder-water spray. There was 1 hydroxyapatite and 1 TPS implant used as controls. Profilometry and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine instrumented surfaces for variations in surface topography. Results: All experimental procedures determined changes on tested rough implant surfaces. Such alterations were related to the implant coating material, and the procedure consisting in <b>coating</b> <b>removal</b> and/or leveling of surface roughness. Conclusion: Although a plastic curette and air-powder-water spray induced less implant surface alterations, these instrumentations left deposits on the surface that may affect, in vivo, the tissue healing process...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates <b>surface</b> <b>coated</b> ultrafiltration (UF) {{polyvinylidene fluoride}} (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane {{for the removal}} of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in water. Coating of PVDF membranes with Poly (1 -phenylethene- 1, 2 -diyl) - Polystyrene solution through physical adsorption was carried out under two modes, ‘dipped’ and ‘sprayed’. The performance of the coated membrane in the rejection of model organic micropollutants, caffeine and carbamazepine spiked in deionised water (at 300 g/L and 500 g/L), correlated with the coating methods used. Dipped coated membrane showed a better removal of recalcitrant hydrophobic carbamazepine compared to the ‘sprayed’ coated membrane; while for both methods of <b>coating,</b> <b>removal</b> of caffeine was relatively insignificant. Inferably, hydrophobic interaction and size exclusion may be the major removal mechanism involved in the rejection by the coated membranes. The coating layer potentially enhanced reduction of pore size with resulting effect on membrane permeability and providing more sites for possible hydrophobic interaction...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} fine structure of the microvilli on jejunal and colonic epithelial cells of the mouse intestine has been made. The microvilli in these two locations demonstrate a remarkably similar fine structure {{with respect to the}} thickness of the plasma membrane, the extent of the filament-free zone, and the characteristics of the microfilaments situated within the microvillous core. Some of the core microfilaments appear to continue across the plasma membrane limiting the tip of the microvillus. The main difference between the microvilli of small intestine and colon is in the extent and organization of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat.</b> In the small intestine, in addition to the commonly observed thin surface "fuzz," occasional areas of the jejunal villus show a more conspicuous <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> covering the tips of the microvilli. Evidence has been put forward which indicates that the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> {{is an integral part of}} the epithelial cells. In contrast to the jejunal epithelium, the colonic epithelium is endowed with a thicker <b>surface</b> <b>coat.</b> Variations in the organization of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> at different levels of the colonic crypts have also been noted.

40|$|Neurons of {{cerebellar}} nuclei in the rat brain had {{a marked}} <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> which was stained with cationic iron colloid or aldehyde fuchsin. Neurons {{with a similar}} <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> were also noted in the retrosplenial cortex. The <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was stained doubly with cationic iron colloid and aldehyde fuchsin. Digestion with hyaluronidase eliminated the stainability of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> to both agents. Combined digestion with chondroitinase ABC, heparitinase and keratanase eliminated the cationic iron colloid staining but did {{not interfere with the}} aldehyde fuchsin staining. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections revealed that the iron particles were deposited in the perineuronal tissue spaces. These findings indicate that the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> consists of sulfated proteoglycans which occupy, as the extracellular matrix, the perineuronal tissue spaces. Many neurons in the retrosplenial cortex were labeled with lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin. Double staining revealed that these lectin-labeled neurons are usually reactive to cationic iron colloid.

40|$|Giardia lamblia {{undergoes}} surface antigenic variation. The ultrastructural {{location of}} antigens on four different variants was studied by label fracture and immunocytochemistry with four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), {{each of which}} recognized the predominant variant in a particular clone. Each Giardia clone and its reacting MAb showed similar findings. The entire surface of the organism was covered by a <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> which contained the variant surface protein. The <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> was densely and uniformly labeled. Unreacting MAbs failed to label the surface. Label-fractured Giardia trophozoites exposed to reactive MAb revealed a planar distribution of reactivity with no discernible relationship to visualized intramembranous particles. Unexpectedly, some Giardia trophozoites lacked a <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> and consequently failed to react with the appropriate MAb.
