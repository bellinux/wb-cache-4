Early analysis of dependability during design and development phase is often a <b>statutory</b> <b>condition</b> for the approval of technical systems. In order to support the developers in verifying and analysing these systems the QuantUM tool was recently introduced [31].

This thesis proposes an extension to the QuantUM method so that nondeterminism is supported. Non-determinism is an essential paradigm when analysing concurrent system architectures. We introduce new translation rules into the QuantUM profile which are then used to transform UML or SysML models into locally uniform Continuous-Time Markov Decision Processes. Since there are no efficient model checking algorithms for CTMDPs, a discretization technique is applied to convert the CTMDP into discrete-time MDPs.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} Ukraine {{political parties}} are strongly fragmenting the political spectrum, preventing the providing of significant opportunities to consolidate electoral groups of citizens, to promote conscious and rational political participation. The transition period has created {{conditions for the}} emergence of so-called party projects and parties that are targeted on a specific person. Formal conditions for the party structures functioning allow them to exist {{even in the absence of}} formal membership and, comparatively, low public awareness of their activities. The way of citizens’ involving as conscious actors of the political process to the party life is intra-party democracy, which can become the basis for significant major democratic debate on ideological issues and on the development of the country. However, in transition countries membership in the ruling party is a sign of the influence of social circumstances, patron-client dependance, factors of group, clan, political choice, and so on. Hence, there is a need to study the basic principles of intra-party democracy in a rapidly changing situation of democratic transition. Moreover, indications of the political parties projects in Central and Eastern Europe transition countries and former Soviet states, are relative closeness of the party leadership, lack of convergence between the formal and organizational principles of the party and the true meaning of specific policy actions of the party leaders and their functionaries. Transformation in the countries of stable democracy showed that the level of intra-party democracy was the basic <b>statutory</b> <b>condition</b> and political parties functioning. In conditions of intra-party competition, this factor is important because of political forces competition which promotes openness to intra-party processes, which encourages citizens to political participation. An example of the UK shows that all party-organizational processes are transparent, which has the reflection even at the appointment of senior party leadership and political parties` participation in the appointment of government. In contemporary Ukraine party organizations responsibility and their value is only beginning to move away from purely formal, documented provision. The extremely important role in this context, should play a civil society. It can extend its sphere of control outside of state government and local government. This area should be extended on intra-party solutions. The possibility of intra-party democracy appearance as a sustainable and well played phenomena can only be based on the formation of political parties as a competitive and dynamic structures that have a high degree of internal relationships and a clear understanding of a common goal that is shared by both the governing parties and the basis of parties and ordinary party members.

Does welfare 'trump' all or only some conditions, and if only some then how do we distinguish between competency determining conditions and those subject to welfare considerations? Both questions arise from a decision of the President of the Family Division, in which the judge held (i) that the child’s welfare overrode a statutory requirement, and (ii) that the use of the adoption legislation, which contained no such requirement, would be entirely unsuitable for the circumstances in which a parental order was sought. It will be suggested that this approach is an unnecessary subversion of the expressed will of Parliament; it will be concluded that parental orders, by avoiding the policy balances of adoption, are themselves dangerous and ought to be abolished. These issues will be explored in the context of both Scots and English law because parental orders, though designed to reflect the different adoption rules in each of these jurisdictions, contain elements traced to English law that fit imperfectly into the Scottish system...|$|R

40|$|The current thesis {{elucidates}} {{the state}} of the art of interdisciplinary teamwork and so called multimodal therapy for chronic conditions in children and adolescents. Specifically, it covers cystic fibrosis (CF) and mental health problems, conditions of high relevance for public health. First, two analyses of a) survey data of a nationwide representative German sample and b) claims data of a statutory health insurance fund present frequencies of children and adolescents with common mental health problems and CF. Survey analyses show results depending on statistical and clinical case definition strategies on the one hand and differences between parent- and self-report on the other hand. Estimates on the incidence of CF based on claims data analyses are in line with the existing literature. Second, two systematic guideline reviews synthesize recommendations on multimodal therapy for concerned children and adolescents and discuss the results against the background of social legislation in the statutory health care system. Results show defi-cits in <b>statutory</b> <b>conditions</b> for interdisciplinary teamwork in the outpatient health care setting, revealing a need for change in the general conditions for multimodal therapy. Third, a) a survey on the health care utilization in a sample of patients of a CF-centre indicates high rates of children and adolescents with CF who do not receive multimodal therapy despite of a below average health related quality of life and a clear need for treatment. b) A claims data analysis presents important insight into the current utilization patterns of children and adolescents with common mental health problems. Against guideline recommendations for later pharmacological treatment, age is hardly ever associated with drug prescription in the common mental health problems. Fourth, emphasizing the need of scientific pilot projects, an action plan is suggested to improve the structural and process quality of multimodal therapy. A theoretical concept illustrates the development of a database that provides more transparency in health care and enables the development of a care flat rate within a capitated payment system. Considering strength and limitations of different databases, this thesis indicates an explicit need for multimodal treatment that is inadequately met and discusses the gap between guideline recommendations and <b>statutory</b> <b>conditions.</b> Implications for better health care provision are specified in the end...|$|R

The decision by the Court was that the Federal Trade Commission was a quasi-legislative body because of other powers it had, and therefore, the president could not fire an FTC member for political reasons.
