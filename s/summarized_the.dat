5|$|In 2003, a Minnesota {{resident}} named Lyle Christiansen {{watched a}} television {{documentary about the}} Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was D. B. Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the History series Brad Meltzer's Decoded also <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.|$|E

5|$|In his {{comprehensive}} study, Soviet Military Deception in the Second World War, Glantz <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> Russian doctrine as involving both {{active and}} passive deception and surprise. For the Soviets, deception permeated {{all levels of}} war. And since they thought of war as just an extension of politics by other means, deception could and should be used and constantly considered in politics before a war began, if it was to work effectively.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1943, Lorković {{was named}} Minister of Interior, where he {{advocated}} stricter policing, {{and a second}} term as Foreign Minister from 29 April until 5 May 1944, after his friend Perić was removed from office. It was agreed that Lorković would remain Foreign Minister and Minister of Interior simultaneously, but was soon replaced by Mehmed Alajbegović as Foreign Minister. After realising that Germany would lose {{the war and the}} NDH would cease to exist, he advocated radical changes in state policy. In February 1944, he wrote a detailed memorandum in German which <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> history, current situation and the fundamental problems of the NDH and its Armed Forces, as well as problems with the German Army.|$|E
5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive. In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E

5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the Thought That We Hate as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> development of the U.S. Constitution's protections {{of freedom of speech}} and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered a gun and a bone in his backyard. Instead of a traditional script, he and Swanberg wrote an outline that <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> plot but included no dialogue. They cast the film mainly by contacting their friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous work. It was filmed over 15 days in Los Angeles County, California. Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} literature over the naming of Russula brevipes. Some early 20th-century American mycologists {{referred to it as}} Russula delica, although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Fries with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. Fries's concept of R.delica included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named Russula delica. Robert Shaffer <b>summarized</b> <b>the</b> taxonomic conundrum in 1964: Russula delica is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, but the evidence indicates that R.delica sensu Fries (1838) is not R.delica sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not R.delica sensu Kühner and Romagnesi (1953)…It is best to use R.brevipes for the North American collections which most authors but not Kühner and Romagnesi (1953), call R.delica. The name, R.brevipes, is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed.|$|E
