2500|$|Robert Prechter {{replied to}} the Batchelor–Ramyar study, {{saying that it}} [...] "does not {{challenge}} the validity of any aspect of the Wave Principle...it supports wave theorists' observations," [...] and that because the authors had examined ratios between prices achieved in filtered trends rather than Elliott waves, [...] "their method does not address actual claims by wave theorists". The <b>Socionomics</b> Institute also reviewed data in the Batchelor–Ramyar study, and said these data show [...] "Fibonacci ratios do occur more often {{in the stock market}} than would be expected in a random environment".|$|E
5000|$|The idea {{of social}} mood as a [...] "collectively shared state of mind" [...] (Nofsinger 2005; Olson 2006) is {{attributed}} to Robert Prechter and his <b>socionomics.</b> The notion is used primarily {{in the field of}} economics (investments).|$|E
5000|$|Behavioral Analysis of Markets is a {{new area}} of study, {{proposed}} by James Gregory Savoldi, closely related to behavioral finance, behavioral economics and <b>socionomics.</b> Unlike traditional models of behavioral analysis which typically integrate insights from psychology with neo-classical economic theory, Behavioral Analysts of markets focus entirely on the psychology of actual market participants and how their present moods control market price movement.|$|E
50|$|The Elliott Wave Theorist is {{a monthly}} {{newsletter}} published by Elliott Wave International. The {{first issue of}} the Theorist published in April 1976 and has been continuously in print on a subscription basis since May 1979. The publication includes Elliott wave analysis of the financial markets and cultural trends, plus commentary on topics that include technical analysis, behavioral finance, physics, pattern recognition, and <b>socionomics.</b> Robert Prechter is the publication's editor and main contributor.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Prechter {{postulated}} that social mood drives financial, macroeconomic and political behavior, {{in contrast to}} the conventional notion that such events drive social mood. His description of social mood as the driver of cultural trends reached a national audience in a 1985 cover article in Barron's. Prechter coined the term [...] "socionomics" [...] and in 1999 published an exposition of socionomic theory, The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior. In 2003, he published an anthology of empirical work in the field, Pioneering Studies in <b>Socionomics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since then, the counter-intuitive {{premise of}} the socionomic {{hypothesis}} - that social mood drives the character of social events - has gained attention in academic journals, books, the popular press, universities, academic conferences and in research funded by the National Science Foundation. The <b>Socionomics</b> Foundation hosts an annual conference each April in Atlanta GA regarding social mood. The conferences have included presentations from academics, authors and financial professionals such as Richard L. Peterson, Tobias Preis, Johan Bollen, John Casti, Michelle Baddeley, Todd Harrison, Eric Gilbert and Robert Prechter.|$|E

5000|$|Robert R. Prechter, Jr. ( [...] born March 25, 1949 [...] ) is an American {{author and}} stock market analyst, {{known for his}} {{financial}} forecasts using the Elliott Wave Principle. Prechter is an author and co-author of 14 books, and editor of 2 books, and his book Conquer the Crash was a New York Times bestseller in 2002. He also has published monthly financial commentary in the newsletter The Elliott Wave Theorist since 1979, and {{is the founder of}} Elliott Wave International and New Classics Library. Prechter served {{on the board of the}} CMT Association for nine years, and as its President in 1990-1991. In recent years Prechter has supported the study of <b>socionomics,</b> a theory about human social behavior.|$|E
5000|$|The Theorist has {{featured}} several {{topics of}} distinction and controversy. Prechter's August 1985 Theorist essay [...] "Pop Culture and the Stock Market" [...] preceded a shorter {{version of the}} September 1985 cover story essay in Barron's, [...] "Elvis, Frankenstein and Andy Warhol." [...] Following Benoit Mandelbrot's 1999 Scientific American article [...] "A Fractal Walk Down Wall Street," [...] the Theorist [...] ran detailed criticism of that article, saying that Mandelbrot took credit for ideas that [...] "originated with Ralph Nelson Elliott, who put them forth more comprehensively and more accurately with respect to real-world markets in his 1938 book The Wave Principle." [...] In recent years the Theorist has been credited with popularizing market indicators such as the “skyscraper indicator,” and been a forum for ideas and research regarding <b>socionomics</b> from Prechter and others, such as the 2006 essay, “Social Mood and Automobile Styling,” which received wide media coverage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Six basic notions {{concerning}} {{business processes}} and their supporting information systems are presented and discussed, {{on the basis}} of one common theory. This yields that these notions are defined not only clearly and precisely but also coherently and integrally. Regarding system and model, teleology (black-box) and ontology (white-box) are considered. Regarding business process and information system, a <b>socionomics</b> based definition of organization is provided as well as three corresponding levels of abstraction. Regarding design and architecture, general and special requirements are distinguished, in addition to the distinction between black-box and white-box models. ...|$|E

Evidence and results from this research lend strong support to the presumption of con-struct validity of the PARQ as a valid cross-cultural measure of the warmth dimension of parenting. As such, the instrument {{may be used as}} an additional source of evidence for Raoul Naroll’s "tests of theories " step in <b>socionomics.</b> In his major lifetime work, The Moral Order, Naroll (1983) argued that weakened &dquo;moralnets&dquo; are a primary cause of 10 major per-sonal and family problems worldwide. ! He included child abuse among these problems. In his &dquo;tests of theories&dquo; of child abuse, he drew heavily from our long-term program of research (Rohner...|$|E
40|$|In The Moral Order, Raoul Naroll {{outlines}} {{five steps}} in the devel-opment of <b>socionomics,</b> a discipline for guiding human affairs. After establishing a set of core values, Naroll shows that Norway does better than other countries in achieving goals based on those values. He also details the theory and evidence {{for the importance of}} moral-nets in preventing or ameliorating social problems. One inference untested by Naroll is that Norway, a model society with the highest score for social well-being, has strong moralnets (moral networks). This article argues that Norway’s numerous voluntary organiza-tions and clusters of ideologically homogeneous organizations are often linked in networks that have all of the characteristics that Naroll attributed to moralnets. Data from community case studies in Norway fit Naroll’s moralnet theory better than they fit the competing theory of structural limitation of conflicts through cross-cutting ties.
