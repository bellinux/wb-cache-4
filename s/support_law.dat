The duration of FISA surveillance and physical search orders were increased. Surveillance performed against [...] "lone wolf terrorists" [...] under section 207 of the USA PATRIOT Act were increased to 120 days for an initial order, while pen registers and trap and trace device extensions under FISA were increased from 90 days to a year. The reauthorization act also increased congressional oversight, requiring a semi-annual report into physical searches {{and the use}} of pen registers and trap and trace devices under FISA. The [...] "lone wolf terrorist" [...] provision (Section 207) was a sunset provision that also was to have expired, however this was enhanced by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The reauthorization act extended the expiration date to December 31, 2009. The amendment to material <b>support</b> <b>law</b> done in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was also made permanent. The definition of terrorism was further expanded to include receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization and narcoterrorism. Other provisions of the reauthorization act was to merge the law outlawing train wrecking (...) and the law outlawing attacks on mass transportation systems (...) into a new section of Title 18 of the U.S. Code (...) and also to criminalize the act of planning a terrorist attack against a mass transport system. Forfeiture law was further changed and now assets within U.S. jurisdiction will be seized for illegally trafficking in nuclear, chemical, biological or radiological weapons technology or material, if such offense is punishable under foreign law by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. Alternatively, this applies if similar punishment would be so punishable if committed within the U.S. A sense of Congress was further expressed that victims of terrorism should be entitled to the forfeited assets of terrorists.|$|E

40|$|Family {{responsibility}} and <b>support</b> <b>laws</b> {{have a long}} but mixed history. When first enacted, policy makers used such laws to declare an official policy that family members should support each other, rather than draw upon public resources. This article tracks modern developments with filial <b>support</b> <b>laws</b> that purport to obligate adult children to financially assist their parents, if indigent or needy. The author diagrams filial <b>support</b> <b>laws</b> that have survived in the 21 st Century and compares core components in the United States (including Puerto Rico) and post-Soviet Union Ukraine. While the laws are often similar in wording and declared intent, this article demonstrates that enforcement practices are quite different among the two countries, even as both countries struggle with aging populations and recession. In addition, the author analyzes a potentially disturbing trend emerging {{in at least two}} U. S. states, most significantly Pennsylvania, where filial <b>support</b> <b>laws</b> are now a primary collection tool for nursing homes, with decisions against adult children running to thousands of dollars in retroactive “support. ” The article closes with concerns for policy makers in any state or country considering filial support as an alternative or supplement to public funding for long-term care or health care for the elderly...|$|R
