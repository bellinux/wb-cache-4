Some order relations of elements in the union of three classes of catacondensed hexagonal systems with <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Kekule structures mentioned in [1] are obtained. Based on the above results, the catacondensed hexagonal systems with the fifth up to 12 (th) <b>smallest</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Kekule structures are determined...|$|R

5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> DPB {{cases have been}} reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E

These formulations give better results and are {{faster than the}} approximation obtained by a dielectric media with high permittivity because <b>of</b> a <b>smaller</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> degrees of freedom and a <b>smaller</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> steps of the iterative solver.
