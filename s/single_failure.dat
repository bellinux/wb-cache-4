Jackson felt that his skills {{would be put}} to best use as organiser and audio director rather than as one man behind a mixing console. He put together a team of audio professionals {{as well as an}} equipment design composed of digital nodes linked with optic fibre to transport digital audio around the largest venues without attenuation or ground hum. To wire the spectacle which played to 110,000 people in attendance and some 3billion distant viewers around the world, redundant systems were connected throughout so that a <b>single</b> <b>failure</b> point could not halt the show. To complete the assignment, Jackson said one of the main factors was working within budget, which was not unlimited as it had been with Streisand. He served as audio director for the opening ceremony on 15 September and the closing ceremony on 1 October.

40|$|Abstract — The £-cycle survivable network design {{under the}} <b>single</b> link <b>failure</b> {{assumption}} {{has been studied}} extensively. Shared risk link group (SRLG) {{is a concept that}} better reflects the nature of network failures. An SRLG is a set of links that may fail simultaneously because of the common risk they share. The capability of dealing with SRLG failures is essential to network survivability. In this paper, we extend the £-cycle design from the <b>single</b> link <b>failure</b> model to the <b>single</b> SRLG <b>failure</b> model. An integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that minimizes spare capacity requirement is provided. To avoid enumerating all cycles of a network, we also provide an algorithm to generate a basic candidate £-cycle set that guarantees 100 % restorability in case of a <b>single</b> SRLG <b>failure</b> given enough spare capacities. Simulation results of optimal £-cycle design under the <b>single</b> SRLG <b>failure</b> model are presented. The spare capacity efficiency performance of the basic candidate £-cycle set is also evaluated. Finally, we give a brief overview of the SRLG failure detection problem {{and its impact on the}} restoration speed which is an important consideration of £-cycle design.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we {{optimize}} administrative link costs of IP networks {{in such a}} way that the maximum utilization of all links is as low as possible for a set of considered failure scenarios (e. g., all <b>single</b> link <b>failures).</b> To that aim, we present the new &quot;hill hopping &quot; heuristic with three different variants and compare their computation times and the quality of their results. We adapt the objective function of the heuristic to make the link cost settings robust to <b>single</b> link <b>failures,</b> <b>single</b> node <b>failures,</b> and <b>single</b> link or node failures, and compare the results. In particular, we optimize the routing for multilayer networks where unused backup capacity of the link layer can be reused to redirect traffic on the network layer in case of an IP node failure. ...|$|R

Since each module operates independently of the others, <b>single</b> <b>failures</b> have {{little effect on the}} operation of the system as a whole. Additionally, the modules individually operate at low powers, perhaps 40 to 60 watts, so the need for a large high-voltage power supply is eliminated.|$|R

2500|$|Two {{academic}} {{papers from}} the USENIX OSDI Symposium covered failure modes of DB engines (including LMDB) under a sudden power loss or system crash. The paper from Pillai et al., {{did not find}} any failure in LMDB that would occur in the real-world file systems considered; the <b>single</b> <b>failure</b> identified by the study in LMDB only relates to hypothetical file systems. The Mai Zheng et al. paper claims to point out failures in LMDB, but the conclusion depends on whether fsync or fdatasync is utilised. Using fsync ameliorates the problem. [...] Selection of fsync or fdatasync is a compile-time switch which is not the default behavior in current GNU/Linux builds of LMDB, but is the default on macOS, *BSD, Android, and Windows. [...] Default GNU/Linux builds of LMDB are therefore the only ones vulnerable to the problem discovered by the zhengmai researchers however LMDB may simply be rebuilt by GNU/Linux users to utilise fsync instead.|$|E
2500|$|Wrecks {{may present}} {{a variety of}} {{site-specific}} hazards to divers. [...] Wrecks are often fouled by fishing lines or nets and the structure may be fragile and break without notice. [...] Penetration diving, where the diver enters a shipwreck is an activity exposing the diver to hazards of getting lost, entrapment and consequently running out of breathing gas. Management of these risks requires special skills and equipment. [...] Many attractive or well preserved wrecks are in deeper water requiring deep diving precautions. [...] Training agencies recommend {{that at least one}} cutting device be carried in case the diver is entangled with fishing lines, nets or ropes and to have a spare light source in case the primary light fails. [...] If penetrating a wreck, a guideline tied off before entering a wreck [...] and run out inside the wreck is advisable. [...] A guideline can help a diver to find the way out more easily in case of low visibility. [...] For penetration diving, a reserve of breathing gas sufficient to allow the diver to exit the wreck and make a safe ascent in the event of any reasonably foreseeable <b>single</b> <b>failure</b> of equipment is required by training agencies' protocols and scientific codes of practice. Most wreck divers use a minimum of the rule-of-thirds for gas management. This allows for 1/3 of the gas down and into the wreck, 1/3 for exit and ascent and 1/3 reserve. In addition, because of the potential fragility of the wreck, the likelihood of disturbing sediments or disturbing the many marine animals that take advantage of the artificial habitat offered by the wreck, extra care is required when moving and finning. Many divers are taught to use alternative finning methods such as frog kick or modified flutter kick which direct the thrust of the fins away from the bottom where most of the silt is likely to deposit. Good buoyancy control is necessary for safe and non-destructive diving in the environment of a wreck.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. This report documents the independent analysis results corresponding to the Orbiter Electrical Power Distribution and Control (EPD and C) hardware. The EPD and C hardware performs the functions of distributing, sensing, and controlling 28 volt DC power and of inverting, distributing, sensing, and controlling 117 volt 400 Hz AC power to all Orbiter subsystems from the three fuel cells in the Electrical Power Generation (EPG) subsystem. Each level of hardware was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticality was assigned based upon {{the severity of the}} effect for each failure mode. Of the 1671 failure modes analyzed, 9 <b>single</b> <b>failures</b> were determined to result in loss of crew or vehicle. Three <b>single</b> <b>failures</b> unique to intact abort were determined to result in possible loss of the crew or vehicle. A possible loss of mission could result if any of 136 <b>single</b> <b>failures</b> occurred. Six of the criticality 1 / 1 failures are in two rotary and two pushbutton switches that control External Tank and Solid Rocket Booster separation.
