5|$|A Daily Bugle employee, who <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> catchphrase to Jameson.|$|E
5|$|Elliott <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> southern, presumably Kentish, origin for the seax {{because its}} {{inscription}} only comprises the original twenty-eight {{letters of the}} Anglo-Saxon futhorc, and does not include any of the additional letters in use in Northumbrian runic inscriptions at that time.|$|E
5|$|In his 1997 book {{of essays}} {{entitled}} The Geography of the Imagination, American writer Guy Davenport <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> different inspiration for Kilmer's poem.|$|E
50|$|These {{questions}} <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> possible {{synthesis of}} immanence and transcendence, {{and they also}} <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> actualization of nonhierarchical community in social life.|$|R
5000|$|That {{research}} did not <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> immediate {{need for}} additional legislation, and neither did it <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> {{need to change the}} threshold for the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports.|$|R
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to establish the lifestyle of Perspicaris. Its large eyes and other parts would <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> swimming animal, yet it lacks claws, which seems to <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> bottom feeder.|$|R
5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that Sai Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year, and returned permanently around 1858, which <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> birth year of 1838.|$|E
5|$|Officers of the Order also wear green robes. The Gentleman Usher of the Green Rod also bears, as {{the title}} of his office <b>suggests,</b> <b>a</b> green rod.|$|E
5|$|The Gunslinger with {{no further}} purpose prepares to travel a {{distance}} to self-destruct, but the Doctor <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> new resolve. As the Doctor, Amy, and Rory leave, the Gunslinger stands watch over Mercy as its new marshal.|$|E
50|$|In a first {{proposal}} of march, 1853, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> two-manual instrument, partially reusing material of the Van Peteghem organ.A second proposal also <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> two-manual instrument with almost identical disposition.|$|R
5000|$|Lettering made to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> aesthetic, such as modernism, {{the natural}} world, or another genre of lettering. Examples {{of the latter}} include use of stencil or {{embossing}} tape fonts to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> industrial aesthetic.|$|R
50|$|Yanomaman {{is usually}} not {{connected}} with any other language family. Joseph Greenberg has <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> relationship between Yanomaman and Macro-Chibchan. Migliazza (1985) has <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> connection with Panoan and Chibchan. Neither proposal has been accepted.|$|R
5|$|The {{common and}} Asian house martins have {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be}} a single species, although both breed in the western Himalayas without hybridising. There is also limited DNA evidence that <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> significant genetic distance between these two martins.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of several pigments {{in the type}} species, including variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and several other derivatives of pulvinic acid, <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> chemotaxic relationship with the Boletaceae, Coniophoraceae, and Paxillaceae—families of Boletales with members that have similar compounds.|$|E
5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, {{and the fact that the}} vertebrae were represented only by centra <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes that much of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypothesis}} is <b>a</b> <b>suggested</b> explanation of <b>a</b> phenomenon, or alternately <b>a</b> reasoned proposal <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> possible correlation between or among {{a set of}} phenomena.|$|R
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the chemical literature is now only of historical significance. Indeed, some further computational results have been reported, which vary from <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> preference for meta radical-anion protonation to <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> mixture of ortho and meta protonation.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} indicators for utility efficiency. In the case of China, some indicators, such as labor productivity, <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> low level of operational efficiency, while other indicators - such as non-revenue water - <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> high level of operational efficiency.|$|R
5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together {{with the presence of}} the E-Group, <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{into higher}} taxa for these groups {{has been and}} remains problematic. A phylogenetic study {{suggests}} the Polyplacophora form a clade with a monophyletic Aplacophora. Additionally, it <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> sister taxon relationship exists between the Bivalvia and the Gastropoda. Tentaculita may also be in Mollusca (see Tentaculites).|$|E
5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> hurricane destroyed the village, though {{there is no evidence to}} prove the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E
3000|$|Rater E: Cool. So {{this one}} is much better, and I’m <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> {{straight}} 4. And she [Rater F] is <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> 5, 4, 5, 4 for this one. 5 would be the top level. Maybe {{you would like to}} discuss this? [...]...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} indicators for utility efficiency. In the case of China, some indicators, such as labor productivity, <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> low level of operational efficiency, while other indicators - such as non-revenue water - <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> high level of operational efficiency.|$|R

5|$|In 721, the Chronicle {{records that}} Ine slew one Cynewulf, of whom nothing else is known, though his name <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> {{connection}} to the Wessex royal line. A quarrel apparently arose in the royal family soon afterwards: in 722, according to the Chronicle, Ine's queen Æthelburg destroyed Taunton, which her husband had built earlier in his reign.|$|E
5|$|In the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), {{a number}} of loanwords from Mixe–Zoquean {{languages}} seem to have entered the proto-Mayan language. This has led to hypotheses that the early Maya were dominated by speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the Olmec. In {{the case of the}} Xincan and Lencan languages, on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> period of intense contact between Maya and the Lencan and Xinca people, possibly during the Classic period (250–900).|$|E
5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver brooch was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a double}} review for All About Jazz, Clifford Allen observes that [...] "Where Morris' music can <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> somber Mark Rothko-like atmosphere, {{even in its}} most lickety-split moments, the music of Rob Brown <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> urbane fauvism not unlike the {{paintings}} of Bob Thompson." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{historian}} JK Wallenberg (in 1931) <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> Anglo-Saxon root, tynan, to enclose, {{followed by}} the Anglo-Saxon word [...] "Hamm", a land drained by dykes. Another historian, Eilert Ekwall (in 1936), <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> early owner named Teona, whose name is found in Teonanhyll in Berkshire.|$|R
50|$|Sallaberger and Westenholz (1999) <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> {{location}} {{close to}} {{the confluence of the}} ʿAdhaim river east of Samarra (at or near Dhuluiya). Similarly, Reade (2002) <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> site in this vicinity, based on a fragment of an Old Akkadian statue (now in the British Museum) found there.|$|R
5|$|Jemima lays her eggs, and the fox <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> {{dinner party}} {{to mark the}} event. He asks her to collect the {{traditional}} herbs used in stuffing a duck, telling her the seasonings {{will be used for}} an omelette. Jemima sets about her errand, but the farm collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from the farm kitchen and asks her what she is doing and where she keeps going. She reveals her errand, Kep sees through the fox's plan at once, and finds out from Jemima where the fox lives.|$|E
5|$|Koalas can {{be subject}} to {{pathogens}} such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria, which can cause keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, and reproductive tract infection. Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) {{which is similar to}} AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in koala populations <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.|$|E
5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for this plant, <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears to describe a plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E
50|$|Townsend often {{embroidered}} flowers which {{exhibited a}} surprising deepness for needlework. Her floral designs <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> influence from the William Morris and the Royal School of Art Needlework. Her technique of using various stitches and colors {{to create the}} illusion of depth <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> influence from Wheeler.|$|R
5000|$|Villa Erica (Heather Villa), <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> Romano-British origin.|$|R
50|$|On the parent-reported SCAS {{for boys}} and girls ages 6-11, a total score of 31.4 and above or 33 and above <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> anxiety disorder, respectively. For boys and girls ages 12-18, a total score of 30.1 and above or 32.2 and above <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> anxiety disorder, respectively.|$|R
