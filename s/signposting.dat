5|$|Dating {{back to the}} {{original}} <b>signposting</b> of the state highway system, M-19 initially connected Detroit with Port Huron and Port Austin in 1919. In late 1926, the routing was altered to shorten it to Bad Axe on the north and Richmond on the south. Additional changes in the 1950s and 1960s updated the highway to finish paving the roadway and extend it southward to its present terminus.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} section of the Istrian Y, which {{constitutes}} the bulk of the E751 route, started in 1976, with {{the first section}} opening in 1981, there were no high-performance road routes in Istria. Instead, the E751 was signposted along state roads, specifically the D66 spanning Rijeka and Pula, and then switched to the D21 in Pula {{all the way to the}} Kaštel border crossing. As the Istrian Y system was being developed, the E751 designation was gradually transferred to the new route, with consistent <b>signposting</b> of the E751 along the A9 and the A8, just as the D3 state road designation west of Rijeka was transferred to the B8 and B9 (later replaced by the A8 and A9 respectively).|$|E
25|$|Even though legal {{authority}} {{and responsibility for}} the erection of directional signposts was given to local councils, the Automobile Association of Ireland began an extensive road <b>signposting</b> scheme in 1938 which included comprehensive <b>signposting</b> of routes from Belfast, Cork and Dublin.|$|E

25|$|The black-on-white <b>signposting</b> of {{secondary}} roads distinguishes them from primary roads in Finland, France, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, Italy, Romania, and Sweden black-on-white indicates urban-only roads or urban destinations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>signposting</b> of road numbers also differs greatly, {{except that}} European route numbers, if displayed, are always {{indicated}} using white characters on a green rectangle. European route numbers are, however, not signed {{at all in}} the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Lying just to {{the north}} of Blagdon Lake, {{isolated}} Nempnett Thrubwell falls within the network of minor roads bounded by the A38, A368, B3114 and B3130; whilst signposted from each of these major routes, a lack of any further <b>signposting</b> makes it difficult to locate the village when arriving by road. The landscape is characterized by isolated farmsteads, the vernacular older buildings generally of the local Lias limestone or of render with clay-tiled roofs.|$|E
25|$|Epping Forest attracts {{large numbers}} of {{mountain}} bikers. Mountain biking is generally permitted except around the Iron Age camps, Loughton Brook and other ecologically or geomorphologically sensitive areas. Despite clear <b>signposting,</b> a minority of mountain bikers and horse riders continue to cause damage in these areas, and the Conservators of Epping Forest have expressed their concern. A number of clubs organise rides, particularly on Sunday mornings. The forest is also used as a training area for many national level mountain-bike racers as it is highly regarded for its fast and tight flowing single track trails. This type of terrain is known within the mountain bike fraternity as cross country (or XC). Epping Forest was considered as a venue for the mountain-biking event of the 2012 Summer Olympics, though the final choice was near Hadleigh Castle.|$|E
25|$|Several other differences, {{including}} in road classification and route-numbering, speed-limits, directional sign-posting and warning and regulatory <b>signposting</b> have developed since the 1920s. Signs in Northern Ireland denote distances in miles, while all directional signs {{placed in the}} Republic since the 1970s use kilometres. Currently speed limits in miles per hour (mph) are used north of the border; those in the Republic are in kilometres per hour (km/h). Metric speed limits were introduced on 20 January 2005, this involved the provision of 58,000 new metric speed limit signs, replacing 35,000 imperial signs. The Republic's road signs are bilingual, using both of the state's official languages, Irish and English while those in Northern Ireland are in English only. Northern Ireland uses directional, regulatory and warning signage which is almost identical to that used in Great Britain. Warning signs have black symbols on a white background with a red border, enclosed in a triangle-shaped sign. However, from 1956, the Republic of Ireland has used diamond-shaped warning signs, with black symbols or writing on a yellow (reddish-orange for temporary signs) background, similar to the signs used in the US and Australia.|$|E
40|$|<b>Signposts</b> {{at major}} roads and {{motorways}} hinting at places in neighbouring countries address drivers from different countries speaking different languages. It cannot be expected that, e. g., a French driver knows how German or Hungarian speakers call Prague [Praha] or how a Hungarian speaker calls Vienna [Wien]. Road <b>signposts</b> are therefore first of all to apply endonyms {{in the sense of}} names in the local language of the place indicated and only possibly and additionally names in the language, where the <b>signpost</b> is located (exonyms). But practice varies. In some countries indeed only endonyms are shown on road <b>signposts,</b> in other countries also the exonym is given. In several countries practice is not uniform. The paper examines the practice in several countries of Central Europe and formulates guidelines for the use of place names on road <b>signposts,</b> regarding also {{the question of how to}} proceed when places indicated on the <b>signpost</b> or the <b>signpost</b> itself are located in a multilingual area...|$|R

500|$|M-142 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} The Thumb region of the US state of Michigan. [...] It is a [...] "trans-peninsular" [...] highway in that it travels through an agricultural area from Bay Port on Saginaw Bay to Harbor Beach on Lake Huron. The current trunkline in Huron County was originally parts of other state highways that {{date back to the}} initial 1919 <b>signposting</b> of the state highway system in the state. The designation was applied in 1939, and the road has remained unchanged since it was completely paved in the 1950s. One other highway, near Lake City, carried the number in the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|M-62 {{follows a}} roughly [...] "question mark"-shaped routing in southwestern Michigan. It {{starts at the}} Indiana state line south of Edwardsburg in Cass County's Ontwa Township north of Granger, Indiana. The {{trunkline}} connects with State Road 23 and runs north through farmland to Edwardsburg, intersecting US Highway 12 (US12) in town. M-62 turns northeasterly running out of town parallel to a rail line up to Cassopolis. The trunkline crosses the rail line and runs concurrently with M-60 through Cassopolis. The two highways pass Stone Lake on the way into downtown. M-62 continues north after leaving M-60, then curves west to leave town; between these locations is where the change in <b>signposting</b> from north–south to east–west occurs. It then continues through more farmland to La Grange, where it crosses the Dowagiac River {{at the mouth of}} La Grange Lake. It crosses the river a second time on the way northwest to Dowagiac.|$|E

50|$|Signs on, {{and leading}} to, French {{motorways}} generally refer to some {{three or four}} towns on that motorway. In other words, there are no stand-out towns that could {{be referred to as}} the French equivalent of a control city. The towns <b>signposted</b> have been picked from the three categories <b>signposted</b> along motorways, with towns in category 5 <b>signposted</b> from the biggest distance out (typically, on any motorway that leads to a town in category 5, the first category 5 town ahead is <b>signposted).</b>|$|R

2500|$|Prior to this, Ireland had a {{different}} road classification and numbering system. Roads fell into three categories: T (Trunk Roads), L (Link Roads) and unclassified roads. The origins of this system lie in pre-independence legislation: the preliminary section of [...] states that the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919 [...] gave the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the power to assign a [...] "route letter and number" [...] to a road, while Section 6.4 of Part I of the Regulations specified the positioning of the [...] "route letter {{and the number of}} the road" [...] on directional signs. A reference in the Statutory Instrument to the [...] "classification of roads as a 'Trunk' or 'Link' Road" [...] indicates that a system of route classification and numbering was envisaged in the 1920s. However, at present, there is no information about when the Trunk and Link road-numbering system was actually introduced on signposts. Even though legal authority for the erection of directional signposts was given to local councils, the Automobile Association of Ireland began an extensive road <b>signposting</b> scheme in 1938 which included comprehensive <b>signposting</b> of routes from Belfast, Cork and Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Calm Ahern was more {{negative}} about the game's intention {{to capitalize on}} people's nostalgia, noting that the game [...] "aggressively captured both the bad {{as well as the}} good: camera issues, ambiguous puzzles, a distinct lack of <b>signposting,</b> and voices that will make your ears bleed", while the game itself could not decide whether it was aiming at children or adults as an audience. Furthermore, while he was positive about the first level, he claimed that all other levels in the game were falling short, finding them repetitive and confusing. Chelsea Stark of Polygon noted that Yooka-Laylee was [...] "proof that sometimes our fondest memories should stay in the past." [...] She called the game's combat mechanics [...] "a chore" [...] and was critical of the controls. Gamesradar also noted the game's repetitive missions and objectives, with reviewer David Houghton noting that some of the game's power-ups, especially the flight ability, render most puzzles obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|Directional signage in the Republic of Ireland {{is fairly}} {{similar to the}} United Kingdom design. Place names are listed in Irish in mixed case, {{followed}} underneath by the English language equivalent place name in all capital letters. [...] The Transport Heavy and Motorway typefaces are used, although the Irish language text uses a distinctive oblique variant, in which letters a are represented by script a (ɑ), and letters i are represented by dotless i (ı) in order better to differentiate them from their accented forms (However, sometimes normal letter i is used). Only the Irish place name is shown if the sign is in the Gaeltacht, or the official name in English {{is identical to the}} Irish name or nearly so (for example Dún Laoghaire or Port Laoise). Due to the practice of <b>signposting</b> in both languages, usually a limited number of destinations will be signposted. If a destination can be reached by following a route which is a spur from that route, the destination and route number will be shown in brackets. Also, distances are shown in kilometres.|$|E

Results Although mothers in both groups benefi tted from the program, as evidenced by pre- to post-program improvements across all measures, the mean effect size was notably larger for mothers who participated in <b>Signposts</b> with fathers. Conclusions These results highlight possible further program benefi ts for mothers who participate in <b>Signposts</b> with fathers, and are of particular signifi cance in light of research describing the increased stress experienced by mothers of children with a disability...|$|R

2500|$|Although law-tracts in Early Medieval Ireland {{described}} {{several different}} types of road, and Irish annals referred to a network of major highways, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that Ireland ever had a network of roads as well developed as those found in the Roman Empire or other ancient societies. The road network remained underdeveloped throughout the Late Medieval and much of the Early Modern periods: it was not until the 18th century that an extensive system of roads suitable for long-distance travel was developed. Newly built roads were relatively wide and straight. Many still form the backbone of the current major roads network. The development of roads continued throughout the early 19th century until the arrival of the railways which became the dominant form of land transport from the 1840s-1850s onwards. The development of the internal combustion engine and of motorised vehicles led to [...] increases in traffic on roads, which were developed and improved as a result. Ireland's roads have continued to develop and improve up to the present day.
