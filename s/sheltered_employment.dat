Over a five-year period, Rusch and his students helped start over 125 supported employment programs in the states of Illinois and Kansas. These demonstrations led to over 100 publications by his students between the period beginning 1987 and ending in 1994. His first text was recognized by the President’s Committee on Mental Retardation as the first text to overview the methods that should be used to promote employment among persons with disabilities, leading to his being awarded the American Association on Mental Retardation’s Educator of the Year Award. During this period he worked with Senator Paul Simon’s staff in crafting changes in legislation that promoted the emergence of transition service for high school students in an effort to better prepare youth to escape the potential of <b>sheltered</b> <b>employment</b> by being better prepared for work and independence after high school.|$|E

50|$|Once {{a mentally}} retarded {{defendant}} is identified, the VDAP provides {{a list of}} accommodations to consider. First, attorneys should question whether their clients’ disabilities affected the voluntariness of their consent to searches, statements, or waiver of other rights. Secondly, the court should determine whether a “cognitive facilitator” is necessary to guide the defendant through the legal process by asking the court to use simple language or to slow down if the defendant needs further explanation. Third, the court, prosecutors, and defense counsel should ensure that defendants understand the legal obligations created by pretrial release, guilty pleas, and probation conditions. Finally, the VDAP suggests that {{the criminal justice system}} should use extensive case management for the mentally retarded and sufferers of HLD. This approach would provide housing, <b>sheltered</b> <b>employment,</b> substance abuse counseling, and mental health services rather than using the criminal justice system as the “institution of last resort” for disabled defendants.|$|E
50|$|The College {{was able}} to offer four courses to it initial intake of 18 students. These were gardening, bench carpentry, boot and shoe repair and {{surgical}} boot making, and clerical and commercial. These students included ex-miners and ex-servicemen and there disabilities ranged from quiescent tuberculosis and poliomyelitis to limb amputees. Despite their widely varying backgrounds, these students thrived in spite of being away from home {{in an environment that}} was conducive to discussion, debate and friendship helping each other with their problems and frustrations associated with all their disabilities. Throughout the 1950s the college went from strength to strength. It had a close working relationship with the National Coal Board with efforts particular aimed at the mining communities. The college also became a vital link for disabled and handicapped school leavers supplying further education and the college commitments were extended to provide this along with vocational training. 1961 saw the first female students enrolled at the college. At this time new courses were introduced and these included shorthand and typing followed by course in electronic wiring and assembly, and industrial electronics. The college along with the Ministry of Labour developed a pilot <b>sheltered</b> <b>employment</b> project.

The next level is [...] "the belongingness and love needs", where people will strive for social acceptance, affiliations, a sense of belongingness and being welcome, sexual intimacy, and perhaps a family.

40|$|During {{economic}} crises, {{more than}} ever, the companies realize {{the impact of}} their activities on society through their social reponsibility. Firms that practice social responsibility strategies are more attractive to their customers, and sometimes {{this is a way to}} obtain competitive advantages such as creation of value, better social image, high consumer loyalty and, in consequence, higher profits. Prior literature justifies that there is a positive association between corporate social responsibility and financial performance. A kind of company with a special commitment to develop its business in a responsible way for society is <b>sheltered</b> <b>employment</b> centers, businesses whose workers are mostly disabled people. The objective of this paper is to analyse whether the <b>sheltered</b> <b>employment</b> centers that receive public subsidies achieve greater economic profitability on average than those centers that do not receive it. Although the number of these firms has been growing during the crisis, when governments have reduced their financial help, some theoretical papers justify their profitability due to public subsidies received. After obtaining the total sample of <b>sheltered</b> <b>employment</b> centers in the Community of Madrid using statistical and artificial intelligence methods, our results show that <b>sheltered</b> <b>employment</b> centers, on average, are productive enterprises in which their profitability is not conditioned by the public aid granted. The model obtained shows that these companies are profitable businesses when they can pay their interest expenses with profits every period. Additionally, the social and labour integration of disabled people is a way to improve their corporate social responsibility...|$|E

Similar themes were identified in research conducted in Canada by Michelle Lem, Director of Community Veterinary Outreach in Ontario, Canada. These pet owners described the ways their pets shaped their environment: they would sleep outside in the rain if the only option was shelter in a no pet shelter; their pet kept them off drugs and alcohol, and they avoided risky behavior that might result in arrest and incarceration because they feared their pet would be removed or euthanized.

Due to their growth, competitiveness in the labor market and work in the framework of the social economy, these companies have attracted some interest recently.

Then, the all CEEs were classified in tree groups (healthy, doubtful and distressed), according to their Altman Z’-score. A method of artificial intelligence (algorithm C 4. 5) was used in order to obtain the basic patterns of each of the groups. The main contribution of this study is that we can know which CEEs survive with the ratios of debts over net sales, return on assets, and quick ratio and which one will have more difficulties to stay in the market.
