40|$|In 1990 the Federal State of Hesse (Germany) {{started a}} {{long-term}} faunistic research programme in selected <b>Strict</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Reserves.</b> Here we report {{the results of}} the inventory of pseudoscorpions from seven reserves: Goldbachs- und Ziebachsrück, Hasenblick, Hohestein, Kinzigaue, Niddahänge east of Rudingshain, Schönbuche and Stirnberg. A total of 4567 specimens (315 - 1314 per site) belonging to 13 species (4 - 9 per site) were recorded using a broad spectrum of methods. The bulk of material comes from pitfall traps (83 %), followed by various types of stem eclectors (16 %). The structure and quality of the species assemblage in the oak-dominated flood plain forest of the Kinzigaue differs strongly from those of the remaining reserves, which are all dominated by beech. In the Kinzigaue a species-rich community (9 species) with balanced dominance structure (Shannon-Index 1. 67) has been recorded. At this site, rare or moderately common species reach abundance proportions of more than 50 %. Most importantly, two species with strong affinities to pristine forests, Dendrochernes cyrneus and Chernes cimicoides, were exclusively recorded from this reserve. In contrast, the beech-dominated reserves were strongly dominated by a single species, Neobisium carcinoides (59 - 91 % of the specimens, Shannon-Index Dendrochernes cyrneus (cat. 3 "vulnerable") reached an abundance proportion of 20 % in the reserve Kinzigaue. Dinocheirus panzeri (cat. G "indeterminate risk") has been recorded in single specimens from the reserves Hasenblick, Stirnberg and Niddahänge. The preferred habitat for most of the species is the forest. Species with strong affinities to forests make up more than 95 % of the specimens in all reserves except for Kinzigaue, where this proportion was 89 %. Species richness and abundances were not different between the <b>Strict</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Reserves</b> (management was stopped {{at the end of the}} 1980 's) and the reference areas with continued forestry.

40|$|The {{integration}} of nature conservation in forest management plans still uses highly variable concepts and processes, mixing considerations related to naturalness and patrimonial or esthetical value. We propose a method {{based on the}} difference between conservation value (CV) and natural value (NV), and on the distinction between local and landscape scales. Criteria and indicators for CV and NV are computed {{on the basis of}} floristic observations and data usually collected by foresters and naturalists. The method is tested in south Belgium on 7 forests, 66 parcels and a little unexploited forest. Though CV and NV are correlated, the CV/NV ratio shows strong differences between habitat types, confirming the usefulness of the initial distinction. In the test sample, the unexploited forest, an oligotrophic alder wood and some mature oak and pine woods have the highest CV, whereas highest NV is obtained in the unexploited and the uneven-aged beech forests. The method can be used for the definition of priority conservation areas (Natura 2000), the design of <b>strict</b> <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> networks and the estimation of the ecological effect of habitat transformation scenarios...|$|E

Within {{the concept of}} metacommunities, {{this leads to the}} prediction that host-plant specialists should sort into local assemblages according to the local environmental conditions, i. e. habitat conditions, whereas assemblages of host-plant generalists should depend also on regional processes. Our study aimed at ranking the importance of local environmental factors and species composition of the vegetation for predicting the species composition of phytophagous moth assemblages with either a narrow or a broad host range. Our database consists of 351, 506 specimens representing 820 species of nocturnal Macrolepidoptera sampled between 1980 and 2006 using light traps in 96 <b>strict</b> <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> in southern Germany. Species were grouped as specialists or generalists according to the food plants of the larvae; specialists use host plants belonging to one genus. We used predictive canonical correspondence and co-correspondence analyses to rank the importance of local environmental factors, the species composition of the vegetation and the role of host plants for predicting the species composition of host-plant specialists and generalists. The cross-validatory fit for predicting the species composition of phytophagous moths was higher for host-plant specialists than for host-plant generalists using environmental factors as well as the composition of the vegetation. As expected for host-plant specialists, the species composition of the vegetation was a better predictor of the composition of these assemblages than the environmenta...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At present, {{approximately}} 15, 000, 000 ha {{or nearly}} 30 % {{of the total}} land area of France is under forest (France has also 8. 5 M ha of tropical forests overseas). The main forest stands are deciduous high forest (only 9. 5 % but dominant in state forests), conifer high forest (24 %), coppice (11 %) and coppice with standards (37 %). Most protected forests belong to the following three categories: National Parks (95, 000 ha of forests in 5 sites but with great differences in the regulation), National Nature Reserves (about 40, 000 ha of forests in a hundred sites, including more than 14, 000 ha of unmanaged forests, plus 200, 000 ha of old-growth tropical forests protected overseas) and Biological Reserves. At the end of 2002, the latter status protected nearly 22, 000 ha (151 sites) of “Managed Biological Reserves ” (but including {{a large proportion of}} nonforested habitats) and more than 3, 000 ha (34 sites) of “Strict Biological Reserves”. Several projects forests are currently under study for new protected forests, including several large (2, 000 ha or more) <b>strict</b> <b>forest</b> <b>reserves.</b> History and ownership explain most of the diversity in the numerous forest stands and protection type found in France.

40|$|Highlights • Climate {{change and}} {{emerging}} diseases challenge global Arabica coffee production. • The wild Arabica genepool from SW Ethiopia {{is needed to}} harness coffee production. • Only in situ conservation can secure the evolutionary potential of Arabica coffee. • In situ coffee conservation can only be accomplished in <b>strict</b> <b>forest</b> <b>reserves.</b> • Extensive coffee production systems may secure other components of biodiversity. Climate change and emerging pests and diseases are posing important challenges to global crop productivity, including that of Arabica coffee. The genetic basis of commercially used Arabica coffee cultivars is extremely narrow, and it is uncertain how much genetic diversity is present in ex situ collections. Conserving the wild Arabica coffee gene pool and its evolutionary potential present in the montane forests of SW Ethiopia is thus critically important for maintaining coffee yield and yield stability worldwide. Globally, coffee agroforestry helps to conserve forest cover and forest biodiversity that cannot persist in open agricultural landscapes, but the conservation of the wild Arabica coffee gene pool requires other priorities than those that are usually set for conserving forest biodiversity in mixed tropical landscapes. We show how forest loss and degradation, coffee management, in particular production intensification, {{and the introduction of}} cultivars, are threatening the genetic integrity of these wild populations. We propose an active land sparing approach based on strict land use zoning to conserve the genetic resources and the in situ evolutionary potential of Arabica coffee and discuss the major challenges including the development of access and benefit sharing mechanisms for ensuring long-term support to conservation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Forestry-based carbon {{sequestration}} projects demand a comprehensive quantification {{of the different}} climate change mitigation effects. In our study, we modeled a life cycle of managed pure stands consisting of the four main tree species in Bavaria (spruce, pine, beech and oak). For spruce and beech, an unmanaged stand was additionally integrated in order to analyze the differences in climate change mitigation effects compared to the managed stands. We developed a climate change mitigation model, where stand development and silvicultural treatments including harvested timber volumes were conducted using the tree growth model Silva 2. 3. The harvested wood products (HWP), including their substitution effects were calculated with a subsequent model. For unmanaged beech forests, we compiled measured data from the literature, and Bavarian <b>strict</b> <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> for validating our model results. The results for the managed stands reveal that spruce provides the highest total climate change mitigation effects. After a simulation period of 180 years, one hectare leads to a mean mitigation benefit of 13. 5 Mg CO 2 ha&# 8722; 1 year&# 8722; 1. In comparison, results for pine, beech and oak reveal lesser benefits with 10. 1 Mg CO 2 ha&# 8722; 1 year&# 8722; 1, 9. 1 Mg CO 2 ha&# 8722; 1 year&# 8722; 1 and 7. 2 Mg CO 2 ha&# 8722; 1 year&# 8722; 1, respectively. However, these results assume current growing conditions. Considering climate change, {{it is very likely}} that spruce will not be suitable in several regions of Bavaria in the future. Furthermore, excessive disturbances could affect spruce more drastically than the other tree species. In that case, the order could change and beech could exceed spruce. Thus the results cannot be seen as a general recommendation to establish spruce stands in order to achieve optimal climate change mitigation benefits. Nevertheless, results for spruce illustrate that high increment and especially wood use in long-lived products is crucial for high climate change mitigation effects. Mitigation effects in unmanaged spruce and beech stands do not differ in the first decades from their managed counterparts, but are below them in the long term with a total climate change mitigation benefit of 8. 0 Mg CO 2 ha&# 8722; 1 year&# 8722; 1 and 7. 2 Mg CO 2 ha&# 8722; 1 year&# 8722; 1, respectively. These differences are mainly caused by the missing substitution effects in the unmanaged stands. However, the precise dimensions of substitution effects still remain uncertain and the lack of data should be reduced via additional life cycle assessments for more products and product classes. However, neglecting substitution effects in climate change mitigation models leads to severe underestimations of the mitigation effects in managed forests...|$|E
