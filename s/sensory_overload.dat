50|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{filtration}} process extracts physical properties for all stimuli in parallel manner. The second stage was claimed to be of limited capacity, {{and so this is}} where the selective filter was believed to reside in order to protect from a <b>sensory</b> processing <b>overload.</b> Based upon the physical properties extracted at the initial stage, the filter would allow only those stimuli possessing certain criterion features (e.g., pitch, loudness, location) to pass through. According to Broadbent, any information not being attended to would be filtered out, and should be processed only insofar as the physical qualities necessitated by the filter. Since selection was sensitive to physical properties alone, this was thought to be the reason why people possessed so little knowledge regarding the contents of an unattended message. All higher level processing, such as the extraction of meaning, happens post-filter. Thus, information on the unattended channel should not be comprehended. As a consequence, events such as hearing one's own name when not paying attention should be an impossibility since this information should be filtered out before you can process its meaning.|$|R

It implicates various deficits of perceptual and attentional functions, and this inability to inhibit, or “gate”, irrelevant sensory inputs leads to <b>sensory</b> and information <b>overload</b> that also may result in neuronal hyperexcitability related to disturbances of habituation mechanisms.

Methods: Each of 9 pilots intercepted 32 targets in the Swedish Dynamic Flight Simulator. Targets were indicated on simulated standard Gripen visual displays. In addition, in half of the trials target direction was also displayed on a 60 -element tactile torso display. Performance measures and subjective ratings were recorded. Results: Each pilot pulled G peaks above + 8 Gz. With tactile cueing present, mean reaction time was reduced from 1458 ms (SE = 54) to 1245 ms (SE = 88). Mean total chase time for targets that popped up behind the pilot's aircraft was reduced from 13 s (SE = 0. 45) to 12 s (SE = 0. 41). Pilots rated the tactile display favorably over the visual displays at target pop-up on the easiness of detecting a threat presence and on the clarity of initial position of the threats. Discussion: This study is the first to show that tactile display information is perceivable and useful in hypergravity (up to + 9 Gz). The results show that the tactile display can capture attention at threat pop-up and improve threat awareness for threats in the back, even in the presence of high-end visual displays.
