40|$|The {{range for}} {{airframe}} configurations available for UAS is {{as diverse as}} those used for manned aircraft and more since the commercial risk in trying unorthodox solutions is less for the UAS manufacturer. This is principally because the UAS airframes are usually {{much smaller than the}} manned aircraft and operators are less likely to have a bias against unconventional configurations. One of these unconventional configurations is the box-wing, which is an unconventional solution for the design of the new UAS generation. The existence of two wings separated in different planes that are, however, significantly close together, means that the aerodynamic analysis by theoretical or computational methods is a difficult task, due to the considerable interference existing. Considering the fact that the flight of most UAS takes place at low Reynolds numbers, it is necessary to study the aerodynamics of the box wing configuration by testing different models in a wind tunnel to be able to obtain reasonable results.

The slats had originally been featured on the earliest Me 210 models, but had been removed on production models due to poor handling. When entering a sharp turn, the slats had a tendency to open, {{due in part to the}} turn causing a drop in air pressure at the leading edge of the wings, analogous to the low pressure activation the slats were designed for in a slow landing approach (this problem was first observed on the Bf 109V14 and V15 prototypes for the Bf 109E), which added to the problems keeping the aircraft flying smoothly. However, when the problems with the general lateral instability were addressed, this was no longer a real problem. The wing panels of the earlier Me 210 had been designed with a planform geometry that placed the aerodynamic center in a rearwards direction in comparison to the earlier Bf 110, giving the outer sections of the wing planform beyond each engine nacelle a slightly greater, 12.6° leading edge <b>sweepback</b> <b>angle</b> than the inner panels' 6.0° leading edge sweep angle. This resulted in unreasonable handling characteristics in flight for the original Me 210 design. The new Me 410 outer wing panels had their planform geometry revised to bring the aerodynamic center further forwards in comparison to the Me 210, thus making the leading edge sweepback of the outer panels identical to the inner wing panels with both having identical 5.5° sweepback angles, which improved handling.|$|E

It is intended that the test results will have application in giving {{a better understanding of}} the viscous flow phenomena on swept back wings, particularly in relation to the stall. A general picture of the boundary layer flow and surface pressure distribution at high lift conditions, showing the effects of variations in wing planform, was determined. Several existing concepts were verified and an attempt was made to define the limits of applicability of these concepts. A localized separation of the flow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing, hereinafter referred to as the "normal flow", was found to occur at lift coefficients somewhat below the stall on the wings with appreciable sweepback. The separation took the form of a vortex streak running aft and outboard from an origin near the leading edge, and it greatly affected the boundary layer structure and the surface pressure distribution. Generalization of surface pressure distribution on the basis of the local lift coefficient and dynamic pressure for the normal flow was found to hold fairly well for the various <b>sweepback</b> <b>angles.</b> The development of stall was determined for the various planforms in terms of boundary layer thickness and flow direction near the surface of the wing.

40|$|An {{investigation}} by the transonic-bump technique of the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics {{of a series of}} thin, low-aspect-ratio, highly tapered wings has been made in the Langley high-speed 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel. The Mach number range extended from about 0. 60 to 1. 18, with corresponding Reynolds numbers ranging from about 0. 75 x 10 (6) to 0. 95 x 10 (6). The angle of attack range was from - 10 degrees to approximately 32 degrees. The effects on drag and lift-drag ratio of a variation in sweep angle from - 14. 03 degrees to 45 degrees with respect to the quarter-chord line for wings of 3 -percent-chord thickness was found to be small in comparison to the effects of a variation in thickness from 2 percent chord to 4. 5 percent chord for wings with 14. 03 degree sweepback. For the range of variables considered, variations in plan form were considerably more important with regard to longitudinal stability characteristics than the variations in thickness. For the series of basic wings having an aspect ratio of 4, the most hearly linear pitching-moment characteristics were obtained with 26. 57 degree of sweepback of the quarter-chord line. However, for the modified series of wings (obtained by clipping the tips of the original wings parallel to the plane of symmetry to give an aspect ratio of 3 and a taper ratio of 0. 143), the most nearly linear pitching-moment characteristics were obtained with 36. 87 degrees of sweepback. By decreasing the thickness-to-chord ratios from 0. 03 to 0. 02, a large increase in lift-curve slope was obtained for both the basic and modified wings.

Wing <b>sweepback</b> <b>angles</b> of 45 degrees and 40 degrees were investigated with corresponding aspect ratios of 7 and 8, respectively. Modifications to the model for reducing the drag were: a forward fuselage addition and special bodies (four big enough to house jet engines) added to the upper surface of the wing. Other components and changes investigated included an empennage, a wing-tip body, wing fences, wing trailing-edge flaps, horizontal-tail settings, and wing dihedral angle. The investigation covered the Mach number range from 0. 20 to 1. 03 for the angle-of-attack range from - 5 degrees to 15. 4 degrees, and a sideslip angle of - 5 degrees, in the Reynolds number range from 0. 52 times 10 (exp 6) to 1. 94 times 10 (exp 6) based on the wing mean aerodynamic chord. The various fuselage and wing additions delayed the drag-rise Mach number and greatly reduced the drag beyond the drag rise. The wing bodies markedly alleviated unstable pitch tendencies throughout the test Mach number range. At low landing speeds, the wing bodies exhibited little interference with the ability of trailing-edge flaps to increase the lift near maximum lift coefficient; {{and the use of}} fences greatly reduced the severe longitudinal instability trend at landing attitudes.

40|$|To {{produce a}} better {{airframe}} design, {{it is imperative}} to investigate the problems of design and manufacturing integration early on at the conceptual design stage. A new design approach and support tool is required which will aid the designer in future product development. This is a particular necessity in the current context of increasing complexity and challenging economic situations. The present work focuses on the development of a design approach and design aids for designing metallic wingbox structures of low-subsonic transport aircraft with small wing <b>sweepback</b> <b>angles.</b> Its aims are two-fold: to assist in producing alternative structural concepts, and to capture the effects of new materials and manufacturing processes on weight and cost. It will form the basis for selecting the structural concept at the early stage of the design process. The target users of this design approach and tools are relatively inexperienced structural designers and students. The developed process and tools are quite general in their application as they use stand-alone modules which can be employed separately or jointly with existing techniques and tools used by industry, research centres and academia. A comparison of the result from the developed analytical tools against a detailed study undertaken by an aircraft company on the original configuration was made. It showed stress analysis and sizing results that were within a 10 % margin. A case study was performed to investigate the reduction of Direct Operating Cost (DOC) of a turboprop transport aircraft by redesigning the wingbox structure. Weight reductions of wing box structure of 16 % were achieved using new configurations and advanced metallic materials. The purchase price of the aircraft could also be reduced through use of cheaper labour and new manufacturing processes. These cost savings, if converted into DOC reductions, are only 0. 36 % of DOC due to fuel saving and 0. 25 % of DOC due to manufacturing cost reduction for the wingbox structure only. It is obvious that the overall DOC reduction {{is the result of the}} total impact of relative DOC effects due to fuel cost saving, material prices, labour rates, and manufacturing process improvements. Within the range of the calculated parameter values, the overall DOC reductions could be as much as 0. 61 % relative DOC. It appears that fuel prices, material cost and labour rates give greater impacts on DOC than high speed machining processes. Due to the use of advanced aluminium, maintenance cost is also predicted to be less. It has better fatigue life and fracture toughness than the standard aluminium and therefore will increase the aircraft maintenance periods for inspection and repair due to slower crack damage growth. This cost saving will contribute in reducing the life cycle cost of the aircraft. In addition, the number of crack stoppers could be reduced, therefore minimising weight and manufacturing cost. These benefits however have not been analysed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The wings have an NACA 65 - 210 section, a taper ratio of 2. 6 : 1, and aspect ratios of 7. 5 and 5. 2. A study of the results of these measurements indicates that, when the Mach number was increased to high subsonic values at low angles of attack, the locations of the peak negative pressure coefficients on the upper surfaces of sections near the wing-fuselage junctures shifted rearward markedly. Some reduction of the profile-drag coefficient with increasing sweep at subcritical Mach numbers was indicated.

A two dimensional Boeing single element airfoil at an angle of attack of eight degrees and a <b>sweepback</b> <b>angle</b> of thirty-two was used to simulate {{a portion of the}} wing of a generator aircraft. Various free stream velocities were used to test any individual fin at its particular angle of attack. While the fin itself was mounted on the upper surface of the generator model, the angle of attack of each fin was varied until stall was reached and/or passed. The relative fin vortex strengths were measured in two ways. First, the maximum angular velocity of a four blade rotor placed in the fin vortex center was measured {{with the use of a}} stroboscope. Second, the maximum rolling moment on a following wing model placed in the fin vortex center was measured by a force balance...|$|E
