40|$|Using a rich firm-level dataset on the Italian {{manufacturing}} industry, {{this paper}} provides a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} role that firms and market characteristics play in shaping firms’ trade activities. We enhance the previous analyses by considering firms’ engagement in international transactions, by focusing on either exports or imports. We show that the determinants of a firm’s export participation and value across countries also drive import behavior. Our research {{is consistent with the}} presence of country-specific sunk costs and with a qualitatively similar role of gravity forces and other country attributes on both sides of trading activities. Our evidence, however, militates in favor of a framework where variations in market characteristics have a larger impact on imports than exports.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of ITS begins and takes root within a European policy {{focused on the}} diffusion and enhancement of ITS. This section briefly introduces {{the history of the}} European policies and actions supporting these technologies to describe their scope in Europe. ITS apply information and communication technologies to make the transport of people and goods easy and flowing. The potential of ITS was expressly mentioned in several White Papers of the European Commission (EC), which considers them as a way to reduce congestion and bottlenecks. The implementation of traffic management plans, information services before and during the journey, goods management services, assistance and emergency services in case of emergency as well as electronic fee systems is therefore a priority and shall contribute to reduce the saturation of the road network. To support the extension of services in Europe, the European Community supports ITS in the road sector by co-financing several projects. Community policies {{for the development of the}} Trans-European Road Network (TERN) aim at establishing the interconnection, the interoperability and the continuity of services, above all on long-distance corridors and at borders. Traffic management advanced systems were implemented before 2001 in many European areas. National and regional ITS services were never coordinated, thus resulting in a fragmented mosaic. Aiming at a wide diffusion of ITS services all over Europe, the EC launched the programme Trans-European intelligent transport systeMs PrOjects (TEMPO) in 2001 - 2006. The key objective of the programme TEMPO on ITS in the road sector was to promote a harmonious and coordinated development of ITS in the member states of the Union, as well as the cooperation among the several countries, and the safety and quality of the service on the TERN network thanks to the cooperation between bordering regions by means of the so-called Euroregional projects. The programmeTEMPO 2001 - 2006 includes sixprojects: ARTS, CENTRICO, CORVETTE, <b>SERTI,</b> VIKING and STREETWISE. The project CONNECT and the project ITHACA were added to the six projects, thus covering the whole Europe...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} schistosomiasis {{level and}} risk factors that exposed school-aged children to infection {{as well as}} to model schistosomiasis map in relation to altitude and rainfall in Gashaka Local Government Area, Taraba State, Nigeria. Methods: The study was conducted between January 2014 and June 2014. Urine and faecal samples were collected from 1080 school-aged children and processed using the filtration and formol–ether concentration techniques, respectively. Results: Irrespective of the schistosomes species, a point prevalence of 10. 18 % was reported out of the 1080 children examined. Males were significantly infected than their female counterparts (11. 75 % vs. 8. 43 %) (χ 2  =  4. 86; P =  0. 027), as well as children aged 6 – 10 (11. 65 %, 72 / 618) and 11 – 15 years (10. 29 %, 35 / 340) than the other age groups (χ 2  =  9. 274; P =  0. 026). No significant difference was observed in schistosomiasis between children whose parents were educated (11. 11 %, 57 / 513) and not educated (9. 88 %, 53 / 536) (χ 2  =  1. 342; P =  0. 247) and those whose parents are farmers (9. 74 %, 53 / 544) and non-farmers (10. 63 %, 57 / 536) (χ 2  =  0. 787; P =  0. 375). Proximity to water bodies (distance <  500  m) (odds ratio =  1. 809, confidence interval =  1. 057 – 3. 094; P =  0. 003 1) and fishing (odds ratio =  2. 632, confidence interval =  1. 397 – 4. 958; P =  0. 003) were the risk factors exposing children to infection. The spatial distribution pattern of schistosomiasis showed that the infection was significantly higher in <b>Serti</b> A (22. 2 %, 26 / 180) and Mayo-Selbe (21. 1 %, 38 / 180) than the other localities (χ 2  =  92. 99; P =  0. 000). Conclusions: This study reported a moderate level of infection among school-aged children with proximity to water bodies and fishing as the main risk factors. The spatial distribution of schistosomiasis in the area will guide in efficient and effective control programmes at local level. It is recommended that continued efforts be made to scale-up distribution of praziquantel to high risk areas so as to curb the progression of the disease...|$|E

Naujagimiai veršeliai neturi tinkamos apsaugos nuo aplinkoje esančių mikroorganizmų - bakterijų, virusų, pirmuonių poveikio, todėl labai svarbu nuo pirmųjų gyvenimo dienų juos tinkamai prižiūrėti. Didelį dėmesį skirti, kad girdimo pienu periodu (iki 3 – 4 mėn. amžiaus) veršeliai nesusirgtų virškinimo trakto ir kvėpavimo takų ligomis. Pasibaigus šiam periodui sudaryti tinkamas šėrimo, laikymo sąlygas. Svarbiausia išsaugoti, kad veršeliai būtų sveiki, to galima pasiekti laiku sugirdant geros kokybės krekenas, užtikrinant geras laikymo sąlygas, priežiūrą, <b>šerti</b> visaverčiais bei kokybiškais pašarais. Tikslas: išanalizuoti apsiveršiavusių karvių fiziologinių rodiklių įtaką veršelių sveikatingumui. Uždaviniai: 1. Įvertinti veršelių sveikatingumą lemiančius veiksnius; 2. Įvertinti apsiveršiavusių karvių ir veršelių fiziologinius, biocheminius kraujo rodiklius; 3. Įvertinti apsiveršiavusių karvių kūno masės indekso įtaką veršelių sveikatingumui. Išvados: 1. Veršelių sveikatingumui įtakos turi veršelių kūno masės didėjimas, nustatytas prieaugis per dieną (0, 321 kg), neigiamos įtakos turi nepakankamai susidaręs imunitetas, dviejų dienų amžiaus šešiems veršeliams iš vienuolikos nustatytas sumažėjęs imunoglobulino G kiekis (0, 05). Pasiūlymai: 1. Laiku kontroliuoti karvių kūno masės indeksą. 2. Tikrinti krekenų kokybę. Veršeliams laiku sugirdyti geros kokybės krekenų, laiku atlikti vakcinaciją. 3.

The objectives: To set the {{parameters}} of calved cow’s milk, biochemical indicators of cows and calves blood and cow‘s body mass index and to explain how biochemical indicators in cow’s blood influence calves health. Place of investigation and methodology: The experiment was accomplished during the months of August - October 2012 in ŽŪB Grūduva, located in the Gotlybiskiu village Šakiai region. 13 cows of various lactation and productivity mainly of Holstein and Lithuanian Black and White dairy cow breeds and 13 Holstein and Lithuanian Black and White dairy calves were selected for the experiment. The samples were taken from jugular vein in the neck, using vacuum, disposable tubes without anticoaugulant. (BD Vacutiner, England.). Blood samples were taken from calved cows 2 days after parturition, then after 7 days, and after 14 days. Calves blood samples were taken {{at the age of}} two-days-old, then 7 -days-old and two weeks of age. While taking the samples the calves were weighed and rectal temperature was measured. Biochemical parameters of: calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg, urea, phosphorum (P), albumen (ALB), total protein (B. b.), enzymes aspartate aminotransferae (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration in serum were investigated with computerized analyzer „Hitachi 705 “ (Hitachi, Japan) using DiaSys“ (Diagnostic Systems GmbH, Germany). Blood glucose (mmol / l) was determined by using disposable glucose strips. From the blood serum the quantity of calves immunoglobulin G was determined. Information on milk somatic cells (SCC), milk protein, milk fat, milk, lactose and the amount of urea was collected using the SE “Pieno Tyrimai” data. In the investigated dairy farm, herd management and accounting is managed using "Afifarm" computerized herd management program. Results: The results obtained while carrying out the experiment showed that the biochemical parameters of calved cows blood influence young calves blood indicators. A positive relationship was established between cows phosphorus and calves magnesium; calcium of cows and calves albumins (p < 0. 05) negative correlation between the total protein in cows and ALT in calves, and the urea of cows and calves (p < 0. 05). During the experiment calves put on 4. 5 kg of weight in 14 days Average one calve weight increase per day was 0. 321 kg which was not considered as high. According to Kulpis J. (2010) during the lactation period the calves should not be fed too much. What is important is that during the lactation period the calves would be healthy and resistant to infections. During the experiment half of the calves did not have proper amount of immunoglobulin G. The data showed that calved cow’s body mass index (KMI) didn’t have influence young calves blood glucose, urea, ALT, AST, phosphorus indicators. Various environmental and genetic factors influence birth weight of calves Conclusions: 1. The increase in calves weight has influence on the calves health. The weight increases 0. 321 kg per day. Insufficient immunity has negative influence. For 6 out of 11 calves at the age of two days a reduced amount of immunoglobulin was observed G (0, 05). Suggestions: 1. Control cows body mass intex on time. 2. Control the quality of colostrum. Provide calves with good quality colostrum and, vaccinate them on time. 3. Periodically check the levels of immunoglobulin in the blood on the calves at the age of 2 days...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Serto</b> is the cursive {{alphabet}} of Syriac-Aramaic, {{which is}} used by the largest corpus of documents in libraries in Aramaic. A lingua franca, and often a source language, Aramaic has influenced major Judaic, Christian and Islamic thoughts as well as the development of science. The script is cursive, e. g. Arabic, and consequently it has a hand-writing appearance compared to Latin. <b>Serto,</b> and Aramaic in practice, has not an automatic character recognition system, OCR. Most library documents are reproductions using printed characters. The readers would strongly benefit from having an OCR, as these reproductions are predominantly books, printed in the pre-computer era. We propose a segmentation-free OCR using linear symmetry features with an individual threshold for the tensors of the characters, and an ordered search sequence. It yields ~ 90 % correctly identified characters in the average. As a first recognition scheme for <b>Serto,</b> it represents a base-line OCR for Syriac-Aramaic. I...|$|R
