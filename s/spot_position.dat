The general trend in their variation is determined and used to explain the resultant change in response.

Finally, we apply the well-known MTR codes to mitigate such errors and present their bit error performance. I...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} a novel method for fast online analysis of X-ray Laue spots taken {{by means of}} an energy-dispersive X-ray 2 D detector. Current pnCCD detectors typically operate at some 100 Hz (up to a maximum of 400 Hz) and have a resolution of 384 × 384 pixels, future devices head for even higher pixel counts and frame rates. The proposed online data analysis is based on a computer utilizing multiple Graphics Pro-cessing Units (GPUs), which allow for fast and parallel data processing. Our multi-GPU based algorithm is compliant with the rules of stream-based data processing, for which GPUs are opti-mized. The paper’s main contribution is therefore an alternative algorithm for the determination of <b>spot</b> <b>positions</b> and energies over the full sequence of pnCCD data frames. Furthermore, an improved background suppression algorithm is presented. The resulting system is able to process data at the maximum acquisition rate of 400 Hz. We present a detailed analysis of the <b>spot</b> <b>positions</b> and energies deduced from a prior (single-core) CPU-based and the novel GPU-based data processing, showing that the parallel computed results using the GPU implementation are at least of the same quality as prior CPU-based results. Further-more, the GPU-based algorithm is able to speed up the data processing by a factor of 7 (in com-parison to single-core CPU-based algorithm) which effectively makes the detector system more suitable for online data processing...|$|R
