50|$|Update {{messages}}. The ACM evaluates update messages {{based on}} the simulation’s update message filtering criteria that the simulation provides. As discussed in earlier, when an ACM receives an update message there are four possible outcomes: (1) the ACM discards the message, (2) <b>the</b> ACM <b>sends</b> <b>the</b> simulation a create message, (3) <b>the</b> ACM <b>sends</b> <b>the</b> simulation the update message, or (4) <b>the</b> ACM <b>sends</b> <b>the</b> simulation a delete message.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, the Terra Nova {{arrived at}} the {{beginning}} of February, and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered. When Atkinson belatedly left for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he encountered the scurvy-ridden Edward ("Teddy") Evans who needed urgent medical attention. Atkinson therefore tried to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> short-sighted Cherry-Garrard on 25 February, who was not able to navigate, only as far as One Ton depot (which is within sight of Mount Erebus), effectively cancelling Scott's orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March.|$|E

5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. This second Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and {{intelligence}} of the original and is much weaker; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind <b>send</b> <b>the</b> second into remission, although dark templar energies are still needed to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game. After a scoreless first quarter in which Alabama missed two field goals, both teams scored field goals in the second; Alabama also had another attempt blocked {{early in the second}} quarter, that left the score tied 3–3 at halftime. Alabama took a 6–3 lead in the third, but LSU tied the game at 6–6 in the fourth quarter to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> game into overtime. In the overtime period, Alabama missed a 52-yard field goal. LSU then connected on a 25-yard field goal to win the game 9–6.|$|E
5|$|As the Super League war {{built up}} in the mid-1990s, the Roosters {{recruited}} high-profile coach Phil Gould and star five-eighth Brad Fittler, both from the Penrith Panthers. This helped to quickly <b>send</b> <b>the</b> Roosters back to {{the upper end of}} the ladder. Fittler's presence proved invaluable; during his reign, the Roosters competed in four grand finals in five years. In 2002, the club captured its 12th premiership — the first in 27 years — defeating minor premiers the New Zealand Warriors 30–8 in the 2002 NRL grand final.|$|E

5|$|Gillingham {{took the}} lead {{in the first half of}} the final, but Wigan {{equalised}} to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> game into extra time.

Gillingham thus gained promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time in the club's 107-year history, in what proved to be manager Peter Taylor's final match in charge.|$|E

Dash and Violet are spotted and chased {{by a number of}} Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with their powers before reuniting with their parents; however, Syndrome captures them, leaving them imprisoned on Nomanisan while he follows the rocket to Metroville.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves did not join the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces could not <b>send</b> <b>the</b> supporting army that San Martín had requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E

The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans {{and the sound of}} the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 1958 World Cup that Pelé began {{wearing a}} jersey with number 10.

The press proclaimed Pelé the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind Didi.|$|E
