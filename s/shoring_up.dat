5|$|As the Japanese regrouped {{west of the}} Matanikau, the U.S. forces {{concentrated}} on <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 14 September, Vandegrift moved another battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units) to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift—beginning on 19 September—to establish an unbroken line of defense around the Lunga perimeter. Vandegrift's forces' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the Matanikau River from 23–27 September and 6–9 October.|$|E
5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} than ever, and he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E

5|$|With the {{initiative}} {{back with the}} Germans and Italians, Kesselring hoped to launch an offensive that would drive the Allies out of North Africa. At the Battle of the Kasserine Pass his forces gave the Allies a beating, {{but in the end}} strong Allied resistance and a string of Axis errors stopped the advance. Kesselring now concentrated on <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> his forces by moving the required tonnages of supplies from Sicily but his efforts were frustrated by Allied aircraft and submarines. An Allied offensive in April finally broke through, leading to a collapse of the Axis position in Tunisia. Some 275,000 German and Italian prisoners were taken. In return, Kesselring had, however, held up the Allies in Tunisia for six months, forcing a postponement of the Allied invasion of Northern France from the middle of 1943 to the middle of 1944.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He mitigates {{the effects of the}} explosion, getting rid of the fallout and <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage the Golden Gate Bridge and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse, endangering lives.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Andronikos II, who had disbanded the Byzantine {{army and}} navy, and who favoured monks and intellectuals, Andronikos III was an {{energetic}} ruler who personally led his forces in military campaigns. In 1329, his first {{campaign against the}} Ottomans resulted in a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Pelekanos, after which the Byzantine position in Bithynia rapidly collapsed. Subsequent sorties into the Balkans were nevertheless successful in <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> Andronikos' tottering realm. Thessaly and the Despotate of Epirus, two territories separated from the Empire after the Fourth Crusade, were restored to imperial rule, almost without bloodshed in 1328 and 1337 respectively. Andronikos III also rebuilt a modest fleet, which allowed him to recover the rich and strategically placed island of Chios from the Genoese Zaccaria family in 1329 {{as well as to}} claim the allegiance of Andreolo Cattaneo, the Genoese governor of Phocaea on the Anatolian mainland. In 1335, however, Andreolo's son Domenico captured the island of Lesbos with Genoese assistance. The Emperor led a fleet to recover it and Phocaea, and requested the aid of the Turkish emirs of Saruhan and Aydin. Saruhan sent troops and supplies, but Aydin's ruler Umur Beg came to meet the Emperor in person. It was during this encounter that Kantakouzenos and Umur established a long-lasting close friendship and alliance.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, Wallace made a {{goodwill}} tour of Latin America, <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> {{support among}} important allies. His trip proved a success, and helped persuade twelve countries {{to declare war}} on Germany. Regarding trade relationships with Latin America, he convinced the BEW to add labor clauses to contracts with Latin American producers. These clauses required producers to pay fair wages and provide safe working conditions for their employees, and committed the United States to paying for {{up to half of}} the required improvements. This met opposition from the Department of Commerce.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1916, Copeau {{received}} an invitation to organize a tour with the Vieux-Colombier in America, supposedly to counteract {{the influence of the}} German theatre in New York City, but also as a propaganda move to continue American support of the French cause. He immediately saw {{this as an opportunity to}} bring back his actors from the front and to reconstitute his theatre, but also as a means of <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> the weak finances of the Vieux-Colombier. But his efforts to free his actors from military duty proved futile and so he left alone in January 1917 for a lecture tour in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Dennis Lillee's four-wicket opening spell reduced England to 49/4 before David Steele (50), on debut, bailed England out. Steele set a {{platform}} for more positive contributions from new England captain Tony Greig (96) and Alan Knott (69), with Bob Woolmer (33), also on debut, <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> the tail. In reply, John Snow reduced Australia to 37/3 and 81/7, but Ross Edwards (99) was well supported by the tail, especially Lillee (73 not out, with three sixes). John Edrich (175) anchored England's second innings, sharing partnerships of 111 for the first wicket with Barry Wood (52), 104 for the second with Steele (45), 66 for the fourth with Graham Gooch (31). Sedate at first, Edrich hit out as a declaration neared, adding 65 for the fifth with Greig (41 from 42 balls), before a hard-hitting cameo from Woolmer (31 from 25 balls, with two sixes) heralded Greig's declaration. Thanks to Rick McCosker (79), Ian Chappell (86), Greg Chappell (73 not out) and Edwards (52 not out), Australia did not struggle to salvage a draw, losing only three wickets in one-and-a-half days.|$|E
25|$|Ground-breaking {{began in}} March 2012. Initially, the tunnel was {{estimated}} at $38 million, but this was revised to a cost of $82.5 million. It was expected to take 25 months to complete but eventually took 40 to complete. Tunnelling contractor Technicore Underground, Inc. {{had to deal with}} left over metal pilings from the 1930s tunnel project and contaminated soil. The pilings themselves were not a surprise, their details being in the TPA archives, but the pilings had fractured much of the rock in the tunnel area, meaning that the strength of the rock around the tunnel area was weaker and needed extra <b>shoring</b> <b>up.</b> There was also a dispute over payments and Technicore filed a $10 million lien against the project alleging unpaid work. To deal with the delays, the contractor applied for an exemption from the city's noise bylaw to work around the clock. Its application for round-the-clock work was denied, but it was allowed to work longer hours until 11 PM. The Toronto Port Authority announced that the project would be complete during the winter of 2014/2015 and blamed the delay on the winter of 2013/2014 being colder than in previous years and ice build-up slowed progress. The agency announced a further delay to the late spring of 2015. The project finally opened on July 30, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Honório Hermeto, by then {{a leading}} politician, was {{appointed}} Minister of Justice on 13 September 1832, effectively becoming {{the head of}} the cabinet. He resigned after eight months to avoid becoming entangled in the aftermath of an uprising in Minas Gerais, in which one of his relatives had been involved. Vasconcelos mounted a challenge to Honório Hermeto's position among his constituency, and by circulating rumors that the latter had links to the uprising, undercut his reputation at home and in the Chamber of Deputies. Honório Hermeto relinquished his post on 14 May 1833 to concentrate on <b>shoring</b> <b>up</b> his position in Minas Gerais, and won another term as general deputy.|$|E

500|$|By 2:30pm the {{shooting}} {{from the house}} had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close {{to the wall and}} pushed the door open, before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted. A wall collapsed on a group of five [...] firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital.
