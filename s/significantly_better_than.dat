His album sales continued to decelerate with his 2003 album, Ghetto, Gutter & Gangsta, which was released through Bungalo Records. In 2005, he released Hustla's Handbook under Capitol Records. The album did <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> his previous, peaking at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200—forty places above Ghetto, Gutter & Gangsta. His most recent solo album, Soft White (2009), was released through Fontana Distribution and at number 141, {{it is his}} lowest charting album on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the {{two main}} immunotherapy treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but {{a combination of the}} two is not <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within four weeks of the onset of symptoms. IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within two weeks of the onset of symptoms, and has fewer complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E

40|$|Wavelet-based image {{compression}} {{is proving to}} be a very effective technique for medical images, giving <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> the JPEG algorithm. A novel scheme for encoding wavelet coefficients, termed set partitioning in hierarchical trees, has recently been proposed and yields <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> compression <b>than</b> more standard methods. We report the results of experiments comparing such coding to more conventional wavelet compression and to JPEG compression on several types of medical images. Introduction Wavelet coding {{is proving to be}} a very effective technique for medical {{image compression}}, giving <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> the JPEG standard algorithm with comparable computational efficiency [1 - 5]. The standard steps in such compression are to perform the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), quantize the resulting wavelet coefficients (either uniformly or with a human visual system weighting scheme), and losslessly encode the quantized coefficients. These coeffi [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The Jarmann rifle was {{a remarkably}} {{accurate}} rifle for its time.

25|$|News analysts {{questioned}} {{the need for}} a Quebec lieutenant, as Martin was bilingual.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the removal of the {{external}} keel, when the first trials were held the two airships were able to turn more quickly than their predecessors; but more importantly it was discovered during the lift and trim tests that the disposable lift was more than 8tons.

25|$|Besides being {{far easier}} to handle, the wax {{recording}} media also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality. The Graphophone designs initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings which were then replaced by more convenient wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms and which finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph. The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Edison's machine.|$|E

25|$|A new {{generation}} of IGCC-based coal-fired power plants has been proposed, although none is yet under construction. Projects are being developed by AEP, Duke Energy, and Southern Company in the US, and in Europe by ZAK/PKE, Centrica (UK), E.ON and RWE (both Germany) and NUON (Netherlands). In Minnesota, the state's Dept. of Commerce analysis found IGCC to have the highest cost, with an emissions profile not <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> pulverized coal. In Delaware, the Delmarva and state consultant analysis had essentially the same results.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to close}} {{proximity}} of the structures, vestibular lesioning often results in cochlear damage, which in turn results in hearing impairments. Hearing {{has been shown to}} affect place cell functioning, therefore, spatial deficits could be in part due to damage to the cochlea. However, animals with a removed eardrum (usually causing the inability to hear) and normal vestibular labyrinths perform <b>significantly</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> animals with eardrums and lesioning in the vestibular labyrinths. These findings suggest that disruption to hearing is not the primary cause of the observed spatial memory deficits.|$|E
