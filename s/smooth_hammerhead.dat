5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} forages {{for food}} both {{during the day}} and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (Sphyrna zygaena), the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca). When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its back like a scorpion. Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.|$|E

50|$|<b>Smooth</b> <b>hammerheads</b> {{are caught}} by {{commercial}} fisheries throughout the world, including those off the United States (East and West Coasts), Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, the Philippines, southwestern Australia, and western Africa, primarily using gillnets and longlines.

The meat is sold fresh, dried and salted, or smoked, though in most markets it is considered undesirable and {{there are reports of}} poisoning. Much more valuable are the fins, which have the highest rating for use in shark fin soup and often leads to captured sharks being finned at sea. Additionally, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the skin for leather, and the offal for fishmeal. This shark is also used in Chinese medicine.|$|R

This study provides the first quantitative investigation of the diets of sympatric pelagic shark species in gulf and shelf waters off southern Australia. Stomachs of 417 sharks collected from fishery catches between 2007 and 2011 were examined, including 250 bronze whalers, 52 shortfin makos, 49 dusky sharks, 39 <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerheads,</b> and 27 common threshers.

5000|$|The {{scalloped}} hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) is {{a species of}} hammerhead shark, {{and part of the}} family Sphyrnidae. Originally known as Zygaena lewini, its genus name was later changed to its current name. The Greek word sphyrna translates into [...] "hammer" [...] in English, referring to the shape of this shark's head. The most distinguishing characteristic of this shark, as in all hammerheads, is the 'hammer' on its head. The shark's eyes and nostrils are at the tips of the extensions. This is a fairly large hammerhead, though is smaller than both the great and <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerheads.</b>|$|R
500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerheads,</b> blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an [...] long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.|$|R

50|$|Studies {{based on}} {{morphology}} have generally regarded the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> {{as one of}} the more derived members of its family, grouped together with the scalloped hammerhead (S. lewini) and the great hammerhead (S. mokarran). Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have concluded differently: while the smooth and great hammerheads are closely related, they are not as closely related to the scalloped hammerhead as the other Sphyrna species. Furthermore, the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is among the more basal hammerhead species, indicating that the first hammerheads to evolve had large cephalofoils.|$|E
5000|$|The Swedish natural {{historian}} Carl Linnaeus, {{known as}} the [...] "father of taxonomy", originally described the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> as Squalus zygaena in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae, without designating a type specimen. The name was later changed to Sphyrna zygaena. The specific epithet zygaena originates from the Greek word zygòn, meaning [...] "yoke", referring {{to the shape of}} its head. The Greek name zýgaina had already been used for the hammerhead shark by Aristotle in the second book of his History of Animals. Other common names for this species include common hammerhead, common <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> round-headed hammerhead, or simply hammerhead.|$|E
30|$|Liver, {{heart and}} {{abdominal}} muscle samples from scalloped (Sphyrna lewini) and <b>smooth</b> (Sphyrna zygaena) <b>hammerhead</b> sharks were analysed to characterise their lipid and fatty acid profiles. Samples were compared both between and within species, {{but there were}} no significant differences in total lipids for either comparison, although much greater total amounts were found in the liver samples. Within the individual fatty acids, the only significant differences were greater amounts of 22 : 6 n- 3, total n- 3 polyunsaturates and total polyunsaturates in smooth, when compared to scalloped, hammerhead liver. This may reflect the more wide spread distribution of this species into cooler waters. Within both species the liver levels of the same fatty acid fractions decreased from spring to summer, which may correlate with changes in fatty acid profile to adapt to any differences in amount or species of prey consumed, or other considerations, eg. buoyancy, however there was no data to clarify this.|$|R
50|$|The second-largest hammerhead next to {{the great}} hammerhead, the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> {{typically}} measures 2.5 - 3.5 m long, with a maximum recorded length and weight of 5 m and 400 kg respectively. The <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> differs from other large hammerheads {{in the shape of}} its cephalofoil, which has a curved front margin without an indentation in the center. The cephalofoil is wide but short, measuring 26 - 29% of the body length across. The nostrils are located near the ends of the cephalofoil, with long grooves running towards the center. There are 26 - 32 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 25 - 30 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each tooth is triangular in shape, with smooth to weakly serrated edges.|$|E

50|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is an active-swimming {{predator}} {{that feeds}} on bony fishes, rays, sharks (including {{of its own}} species), cephalopods, {{and to a lesser}} extent crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and barnacles. They readily scavenge from fishing lines. In some areas, stingrays are a favored prey and comprise a majority of its diet. The venomous barbs of stingrays are often found lodged in and around the mouths of these sharks; one specimen examined contained 95 such spines. In northern Europe, the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> feeds on herring and seabass, while in North America it takes Spanish mackerel and menhaden. Off South Africa, smooth hammerheads feed on squid such as Loligo vulgaris and small schooling fish such as pilchard over the deep coral reefs at the edge of the continental shelf, with individuals over 2 m long taking increasing numbers of smaller sharks and rays. Off Australia, squid are the most important prey, followed by bony fish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is {{potentially}} dangerous to humans. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 34 attacks attributable to large hammerhead sharks, 17 of them unprovoked (1 fatal). However, {{due to the}} smooth hammerhead's occurrence in temperate regions where people {{are less likely to}} enter the water, it was likely responsible for a minority of these attacks. Off southern California, this species has been reported to steal catches from sport fishers and divers.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the {{scalloped}} {{and great}} hammerheads, the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> stays {{closer to the}} surface, in water less than 20 m deep. However, it has been recorded diving {{to a depth of}} 200 m. It prefers inshore waters such as bays and estuaries, but is sometimes found in the open ocean over the continental shelf, and around oceanic islands. This shark has also been reported entering freshwater habitats, such as the Indian River in Florida. In the summer, smooth hammerheads migrate poleward to stay in cooler water, heading back towards the equator in winter.|$|E
50|$|Older studies {{based on}} {{morphology}} have generally placed the great hammerhead {{as one of}} the more derived members of its family, reflecting the traditional view that cephalofoil size gradually increased over the course of hammerhead shark evolution. However, this view has been refuted by phylogenetic analyses using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, which found that the great hammerhead and the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (S. zygaena) form a clade that is basal to all other Sphyrna species. These results also show that the first hammerheads to evolve had large rather than small cephalofoils.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (Sphyrna zygaena) is {{a species}} of hammerhead shark, {{and part of the}} family Sphyrnidae. This species is named [...] "smooth hammerhead" [...] because of the {{distinctive}} shape of the head, which is flattened and laterally extended into a hammer shape (called the [...] "cephalofoil"), without an indentation {{in the middle of the}} front margin (hence [...] "smooth"). Unlike other hammerheads, this species prefers temperate waters and occurs worldwide at medium latitudes. In the summer, these sharks migrate towards the poles following cool water masses, sometimes forming schools numbering in the hundreds to thousands.|$|E
50|$|Adult smooth hammerheads {{are either}} solitary or form small groups. They may come {{together}} in great numbers during their annual migrations; schools of over a hundred juveniles under 1.5 m long have been observed off the eastern Cape of South Africa, and schools thousands strong have been reported off California. During hot summer weather, they can be seen swimming {{just below the surface}} with their dorsal fins exposed. Young smooth hammerheads are preyed upon by larger sharks such as the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus); adults have been observed being consumed by killer whales (Orcinus orca) off New Zealand. Known parasites of the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> include the nematodes Parascarophis sphyrnae and Contracaecum spp.|$|E
50|$|The {{streamlined}} {{body of the}} great hammerhead with the expanded cephalofoil {{is typical of the}} hammerhead sharks. Adult great hammerheads can be distinguished from the scalloped hammerhead and the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> by the shape of the cephalofoil, which has a nearly straight front margin (as opposed to arched), with prominent medial and lateral indentations. The width of the cephalofoil is 23 - 27% of the body length. The teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, becoming more oblique towards the corners of the mouth. There are 17 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} upper jaw with 2 - 3 teeth at the symphysis (the midline of the jaw), and 16 - 17 teeth on either side of the lower jaw and 1 - 3 at the symphysis.|$|E
50|$|The second-largest hammerhead shark {{after the}} great hammerhead shark, the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> can measure up to 5 m long. It is an active {{predator}} that takes {{a wide variety of}} bony fishes and invertebrates, with larger individuals also feeding on sharks and rays. As in the rest of its family, this shark is viviparous and gives birth to litters of 20 - 40 pups. A relatively common shark, it is captured, intentionally or otherwise, by many commercial fisheries throughout its range; its fins are extremely valuable for use in shark fin soup. This shark is potentially dangerous and has likely been responsible for a few attacks on humans, though it is less likely to encounter swimmers than other large hammerhead species due to its temperate habitat.|$|E
50|$|Like other hammerheads, the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is viviparous: {{once the}} young exhaust their supply of yolk, the empty yolk sac is {{converted}} into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Females bear relatively large litters of 20 - 50 pups after a gestation period of 10 - 11 months. Birthing occurs in shallow coastal nurseries, such as Bulls Bay in North Carolina. The pups measure 50 - 61 cm long at birth; females reach maturity at 2.7 m long and males at 2.1 - 2.5 m long, depending upon locality. Off South Africa, newly mated females have been caught in February and females with full-term embryos in November; off {{the east coast of}} Australia, birthing takes place between January and March, with ovulation taking place around the same time. This shark is thought to live for 20 years or more.|$|E
5000|$|Zacharias {{was the son}} of a Saxonian {{judge and}} a painter. In 1633 he {{traveled}} from Dresden via Hamburg to Amsterdam. There he worked for Willem Blaeu. Within a year he enlisted as a soldier in the armed forces of the Dutch West India Company to serve in [...] "New Holland" [...] (Dutch Brazil) in 1634. Three years later, he was hired as a writer by the newly arrived governor of the colony, Count John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. In Recife he kept a sort of diary with 109 water-colour drawings of curious fish, strange birds, useful and harmful animals, lovely tasty fruit and nasty, poisonous worms and big, brown or black people, published as [...] "Thier-Buch". There are pictures of the <b>Smooth</b> <b>Hammerhead,</b> Cutlassfish, slender filefish, Serranidae, and Cirripedia. In 1641, he left Dutch Brazil, and traveled back to Dresden.

50|$|Of the hammerhead sharks, the <b>smooth</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is {{the species}} most {{tolerant}} of temperate water, and occurs worldwide to higher latitudes {{than any other}} species. In the Atlantic, it occurs from Nova Scotia to the Virgin Islands and from Brazil to southern Argentina in the west, and from the British Isles to Côte d'Ivoire, including the Mediterranean Sea, in the east. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa, India, and Sri Lanka. In the western Pacific, it occurs from the Gulf of Tonkin to southern Japan and Siberia, as well as off Australia and New Zealand. In the central and eastern Pacific, it occurs off the Hawaiian Islands, California, Panama, the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, and Chile. This species is usually considered to be amphitemperate (absent from the tropics) in distribution, though there are rare reports from tropical waters {{such as in the}} Gulf of Mannar off India, and off southern Mozambique. Its presence in the tropics is difficult to determine due to confusion with other hammerhead species.|$|E

5000|$|Many other {{fisheries}} {{from every}} ocean also take smooth hammerheads as bycatch, {{and they are}} caught in some numbers by recreational anglers. Smooth hammerheads are also killed by entanglement in shark nets used to protect beaches. Fewer than 10 smooth hammerheads were caught annually in the nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from 1978 - 1990. In contrast, in the nets off New South Wales, Australia, smooth hammerheads comprised 50% of the 4,715 sharks captured from 1972 - 1990. At present, this species remains relatively common and has been assessed as [...] "Vulnerable (VU)" [...] by the World Conservation Union. Off New Zealand, it is a prohibited target species and is the most abundant shark along the northwest coast. It also {{does not appear to}} have been negatively impacted by fishing off southern Australia.
