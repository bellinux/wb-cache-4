40|$|The <b>sternocleidomastoid</b> (SCM) <b>artery</b> {{supplying}} {{blood to}} the SCM muscle has different origins according to its anatomical segment. The authors performed cadaveric neck dissection to review the surgical anatomy of neurovascular structures surrounding the carotid artery in the neck. During the dissection, an unusual finding was cited in which the SCM artery supplying the middle part of the SCM muscle originated from the lingual artery (LA); it was also noted that it crossed over the hypoglossal nerve (HN). There have been extremely rare reports citing the SCM artery originated from the LA. Though the elevation of the HN over the internal carotid artery was relatively high, the vascular loop crossing over the HN {{was very close to}} the carotid bifurcation. Special anatomical consideration is required to avoid the injury of the HN during carotid artery surgery. Key Words: Lingual artery · Carotid artery surgery · SCM artery · Hypoglossal nerve...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{contribution}} of the sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery (superior arterial pedicle – SAP) to the irrigation of the ster-nocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) was evaluated in fresh human cadavers by injecting radiological dye and a resin for microvasculature corrosion casts. From its insertion in the mastoid process of the temporal bone, the SCM was divided into superior, medium, and inferior thirds. In most of the SCM, The SAP are formed by two longitudinal parallel branches. In all specimens, the radiological dye injected into the SAP reached or trespassed the middle part of the studied SCM. The SAP was poorly distributed in the lowermost region of the inferior third of the SCM, suggesting the {{contribution of}} other arteries or pedi-cles. The corrosion casts of the microvasculature showed a profuse network of microscopic vessels in those levels where the SAP was detected. DESCRIPTORS: <b>Sternocleidomastoid</b> muscle.

It is considered by classic anatomists that the sternocleidomas-toid branch of the occipital artery is the main vessel irrigating the stern-ocleidomastoid muscle 9, 25, 28. More recently, many authors have consid-ered two other principal arteria...|$|R
