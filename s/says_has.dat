25|$|While {{still at}} school, Tatchell campaigned {{in favour of}} better {{treatment}} of, and full human rights for, the Aboriginal people of Australia. He believes that Australian cities should be renamed with their original Aboriginal place names, to sever ties with the colonial era. For example, he wants the Tasmanian capital Hobart to be renamed Nibberluna, arguing {{that this would be}} a fitting tribute to Australia's Aboriginal heritage, which he <b>says</b> <b>has</b> been discarded and disrespected for too long.|$|E
25|$|In the 6th century Jordanes named two tribes, {{which he}} calls the Suehans and the Suetidi, who lived in Scandza. These two names are both {{considered}} {{to refer to the}} same tribe. The Suehans, he <b>says,</b> <b>has</b> very fine horses just as the Thyringi tribe (alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis). The Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) wrote of the 6th-century Swedish king Adils (Eadgils) that he had the finest horses of his days. The Suehans supplied black fox-skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names the Suetidi which is considered to be the Latin form of Svitjod. He writes that the Suetidi are the tallest of men—together with the Dani, who were of the same stock. Later he mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of the same height.|$|E

25|$|In its {{late 1990s}} incarnation, One Nation called for zero net immigration, {{an end to}} {{multiculturalism}} and a revival of Australia's Anglo-Celtic cultural tradition which it <b>says</b> <b>has</b> been diminished, the abolition of native title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an end to special Aboriginal funding programs, opposition to Aboriginal reconciliation which the party says will create two nations, and {{a review of the}} 1967 constitutional referendum which gave the Commonwealth power to legislate for Aborigines. The party's economic position was to support protectionism and trade retaliation, increased restrictions on foreign capital and the flow of capital overseas, and a general reversal of globalisation's influence on the Australian economy. Domestically, One Nation opposed privatisation, competition policy, and the GST, while proposing a government subsidised people's bank to provide 2 per cent loans to farmers, small business, and manufacturers. On foreign policy, One Nation called for a review of Australia's United Nations membership, a repudiation of Australia's UN treaties, an end to foreign aid and to ban foreigners from owning Australian land.|$|E
25|$|Pitrājñāpālanam (Sanskrit: पित्राज्ञापालनम्). Jamadagni {{requests}} Paraśurāma {{to marry}} and enter {{the second stage of}} life, the Gārhasthya Āśrama ("householder's life"). Paraśurāma respectfully turns the request down, saying he wishes to be forever away from the bondage of family. One morning, Reṇukā goes to a lake to fetch water. There she sees the Gandharva king Citraratha, taking delight in the water of the lake with his wife. Reṇukā is attracted to Citraratha and returns home excited, fantasizing about him. Jamadagni senses this and orders his three elder sons to kill their mother who he <b>says</b> <b>has</b> become impure by her adulterous thoughts. When the brothers refuse to carry out his command, Jamadagni asks Paraśurāma to do the same. Paraśurāma is caught between the command of his father, and the indebtedness to mother – he remembers the Smṛti scriptures which says the mother is ten times the greater than the father. After a lot of thought and counter-thought, he decides to obey his father. Paraśurāma beheads his mother and three brothers. Jamadagni is pleased and offers Paraśurāma two wishes. Paraśurāma asks for the resurrection of all four as the first wish, and their loss of memory about their killing as the second one. Jamadagni grants both the wishes and Reṇukā and her three sons get up as if from sleep. Paraśurāma thus satisfies his father and also brings back his mother to life.|$|E

500|$|Blazing Lazers {{received}} further praise {{after it}} was released on the Virtual Console. Mike Fahey from Kotaku describes the game as the [...] "best damn shooter on the TurboGrafx, if not best game overall". Lucas Thomas from IGN referred to the game as superior to other shoot 'em up games such as Super Star Soldier, Gradius III, and the R-Type series. Thomas further asserts that the game had [...] "pushed the [...] to its limits". Frank Provo from GameSpot also gave positive reviews for Blazing Lazers, saying that the game, despite the plain graphics and aesthetics, compensates with intense gameplay and a [...] "ridiculous orgy of firepower". He also lauds the game for its diverse weaponry, lack of graphical slowdown seen in some older console games, and the superior, futuristic audio, which he <b>says</b> <b>has</b> an [...] "optimistic quality" [...] to it.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{has also}} criticized a Christian video game {{based on the}} Left Behind series. In , players {{participate}} in [...] "battles raging {{in the streets of}} New York," [...] according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in [...] "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." [...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant. It's a mass-killing game." [...] Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying [...] "Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, I prefer to give them something that's positive." [...] The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's book, Out of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he <b>says</b> <b>has</b> [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{worked to}} incorporate 1980s fashion {{into the show}} {{in a way that}} [...] "felt fun, definitely, but also grounded in a reality where [...] could tell dramatic stories." [...] The styles featured were therefore constructed so that viewers would not be distracted from an emotional scene by characters wearing 1980s makeup, hairstyles, or shoulder pads. In addition, show makers wanted to make the series feel [...] "like something that you'd {{want to be a part}} of, rather than make fun of", and that young women would be inspired by the clothing styles featured in the spin-off as well as on Gossip Girl. During flashbacks in [...] "Valley Girls", Lily dresses in two styles of clothing. She appears in a preppy, upper-crust riding outfit while associating with her rich parents, but changes into a dress more typical of the [...] "underground punk-rock scene" [...] after running away to the San Fernando Valley. Snow describes her hairstyle as [...] "a little teased, feathered like Farrah Fawcett with curly bangs like Brooke Shields." [...] In present-day scenes, Blair and Serena both attend Prom in designer dresses; Blair dons a black and gold gown from the Marchesa Spring 2008 collection, while Serena wears a pink halter dress from the Christian Dior Spring 2009 collection. Belinda Goldsmith of Reuters cited the episode's Prom scene as an example of the media's glamorization of U.S. formal dances, which she <b>says</b> <b>has</b> caused the cost of formal dances around the world to rise.|$|E
500|$|Limbo was {{generally}} praised for its puzzle {{design and the}} simplicity of its controls. Jake Gaskill of G4 TV {{was impressed by the}} complexity of the puzzles based on the two simple actions of jumping and grabbing onto objects, similar to LittleBigPlanet, with a variety of elements to assure [...] "you're always facing something new and challenging" [...] during the game. Game Informer Matt Miller commented that part of the success of Limbo is that [...] "every one of these [...] stands alone"; the game accomplishes this in Miller's opinion by varying the elements throughout the game, and preventing the player from getting too accustomed to similar solutions since [...] "everything changes". GameSpy's Ryan Scott believed that the game empowered the player to work through solutions themselves, and its puzzle design, [...] "with its elegant simplicity, offers up what feels like a world of meaningful possibilities". The frequency of death was not considered a distraction from the game; not only were the deaths seen as necessary as part of learning and overcoming each obstacle, but reviewers found the checkpoints where the player would restart to be plentiful throughout the game. Will Freeman of The Guardian praised the game but noted that beyond the [...] "smoke and mirrors" [...] of Limbo artwork, the game is [...] "undermined by the title's lack of innovative gameplay", which he <b>says</b> <b>has</b> been seen in earlier platform games.|$|E
