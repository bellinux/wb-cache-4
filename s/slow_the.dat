The flea Xenopsylla gratiosa and dermanyssid mites are commonly found, with lower numbers of ticks.

The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies {{at a distance of}} 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the Navier-Stokes equation between planar plates, the equation of motion of the Binghamian grouts is deduced in smooth and inclined fissures. The model indicates that the velocity of flow gradually reduce {{with the development of}} time. And the greater the pressure is, the greater the speed is, as a result, the Binghamian grouts has a further infiltration. The velocity of flow of Binghamian grouts {{has nothing to do with}} fissure inclination. In addition, in the circumstance of the same parameters, the wider the fissure is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> velocity of flow of Binghamian grouts is; the bigger the viscosity of grouts is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; the smaller the initial shear strength is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; the bigger the Binghamian grouts density is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; and vice versa. 特集 : 「資源、新エネルギー、環境、防災研究国際セミナー...|$|R

5|$|A {{new plan}} was {{put forward by}} West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was <b>slow.</b> <b>The</b> two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too <b>slow,</b> <b>the</b> Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E

5|$|Although the 1st Marine Division {{landed at}} Wonsan {{as part of}} Almond's US X Corps, Almond and Major General Oliver P. Smith of the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before the landing at Inchon, when Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious {{landings}} are {{even though he had}} never been involved in one. Smith believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact that higher headquarters in Tokyo said otherwise, but Almond felt Smith was overly cautious. The mutual distrust between the commanders caused Smith to <b>slow</b> <b>the</b> 1st Marine Division's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond's instructions. Smith established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.|$|E

In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961.

5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to <b>slow</b> <b>the</b> flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
