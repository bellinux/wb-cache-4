25|$|The sediments entrained in a flow can {{be transported}} along the bed as bed load {{in the form}} of sliding and rolling grains, or in {{suspension}} as <b>suspended</b> <b>load</b> advected by the main flow.

25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the bed load plus the portion of the <b>suspended</b> <b>load</b> which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed.

Data corresponding to five successively doubled temporal scales (i. e. daily, two-day, four-day, eight-day and 16 -day) from the St. Louis gaging station in Missouri are analyzed. The investigation {{is focused on}} identifying possible low-dimensional deterministic behavior in the <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> transport dynamics, with an aim towards reduction in model complexity. The correlation dimension method is used to identify low-dimensional determinism. The <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> dynamics are represented through phase-space reconstruction, and the variability is estimated using the (proximity of) reconstructed vectors in the phase space. The results indicate the presence of low-dimensional determinism in the <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> series {{at each of the}} five temporal scales, with the variables dominantly governing the dynamics in the order of three or four. These results not only suggest the appropriateness of relatively simpler models but also hint at possible scale invariance in the <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> transport dynamics.

40|$|The extreme {{variation}} {{in the amount of}} annual precipitation and rainfall during single events is typical of the East Asian monsoon climate and may greatly influence the characteristics of the <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load.</b> The turbidity in Lake Imha which is the eighth largest multipurpose dam in Korea has been the cause of major water quality problems for use as drinking water. The turbidity rose to 882 NTU, and it remained over 30 NTU continuously for 170 days during 2002, as the result of significant amounts of soil erosion from the watershed during the Asian monsoon typhoon. In this study, characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate was investigated by comparing the variation of yearly <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>loads</b> and the ratio of maximum <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>loads</b> in a single event to yearly <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> from Lake Imha watershed using the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF). The model calibration is performed according to the 2009 – 2010 events, and simulation results characterized suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate for 2001 – 2010. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were performed every 4 – 6 h, and calibration was performed using hourly simulated sediment loads. The calibration results demonstrated good agreement with the observed data. The characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate are a high variance of the yearly <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> and a significant of amount of <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> during a single event influenced by the typhoon intensity. The maximum yearly <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> was 10 times higher than the minimum yearly value. About half of the yearly <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> was loaded with a single event under the Asian summer monsoon climate and the ratio of <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>loads</b> by a single event to total yearly loads ranged from 29 % to 90 %. Structural best management practices (BMPs) to trap suspended sediment in stormwater such as stormwater ponds or wetlands rely on much more storage volume or area and non-structural BMPs to minimize soil erosion by source control such as mulching or revegetation in disturbed areas, which are important BMPs, especially in the Asian summer monsoon region...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{transport}} {{may occur}} during fast geomorphic transients {{as a consequence}} of strong upward momentum fluxes due to turbulence and/or of intense erosion of a loose bed. Under these circumstances, sediments will move with the distinctive features of bed-load in the region close to the bottom, whereas suspended sediment will follow the carrying fluid in the upper region of the flow. The paper presents a two-phase model able to describe both bed and <b>suspended</b> <b>loads.</b> While bed-load dynamics is modeled considering the particle-bottom and particle-particle collisions and drag received by the fluid, the suspended one is considered just advected by carrying flow. The model is applied to analyzed the dam-break waves over erodible beds of light sediment. The numerical results reproduce the main features of the experiment, putting in evidence the different dynamics of bed and <b>suspended</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Braided rivers, as {{distinct}} from meandering rivers, occur when a threshold level of sediment load or slope is reached whilst a steep gradient is also maintained. [...] Geologically speaking, an increase in sediment load will over time increase {{the slope of the}} river, so these two conditions can be considered synonymous; and, consequently, a variation of slope can model a variation in sediment load. [...] A threshold slope was experimentally determined to be 0.016 (ft/ft) for a [...] stream with poorly sorted coarse sand. [...] Any slope over this threshold created a braided stream, while any slope under the threshold created a meandering stream or—for very low slopes—a straight channel. So the main controlling factor on river development is the amount of sediment that the river carries; once a given system crosses a threshold value for sediment load, it will convert from a meandering system to a braided system. [...] Also important to channel development is the proportion of <b>suspended</b> <b>load</b> sediment to bed load. [...] An increase in suspended sediment allowed for the deposition of fine erosion-resistant material on the inside of a curve, which accentuated the curve and in some instances caused a river to shift from a braided to a meandering profile.|$|E
50|$|<b>Suspended</b> <b>load</b> is {{composed}} of fine sediment particles suspended and transported through the stream. These materials are too large to be dissolved, but too small to lie on {{the bed of the}} stream (Mangelsdorf, 1990). Stream flow keeps these suspended materials, such as clay and silt, from settling on the stream bed. <b>Suspended</b> <b>load</b> is the result of material eroded by hydraulic action at the stream surface bordering the channel as well as erosion of the channel itself. <b>Suspended</b> <b>load</b> accounts for the largest majority of stream load (Strahler and Strahler, 2006).|$|E

40|$|<b>Suspended</b> {{sediment}} <b>load</b> estimation at high resolutions is {{an extremely}} difficult task, because: (1) {{it depends on the}} availability of high-resolution water discharge and suspended sediment concentration measurements, which are often not available; (2) any errors in the measurements of these two components could significantly influence the accuracy of <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> estimation; and (3) direct measurements are very expensive. The {{purpose of this study is}} to approach this sampling problem from a new perspective of fractals (or scaling), which could provide important information on the transformation of <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> data from one scale to another. This is done by investigating the possible presence of fractal behaviour in the daily <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> data for the Mississippi River basin (at St. Louis, Missouri). The presence of fractal behaviour is investigated using five different methods, ranging from general to specific and from monofractal to multi-fractal: (1) autocorrelation function; (2) power spectrum; (3) probability distribution function; (4) box dimension; and (5) statistical moment scaling function. The results indicate the presence of multi-fractal behaviour in the <b>suspended</b> sediment <b>load</b> data, suggesting the possibility of transformation of data from one scale to another using a multi-dimensional model.
