40|$|There {{have been}} more hitting <b>streaks</b> <b>in</b> Major League Baseball than we would expect. All batting lines of MLB hitters from 1957 - 2006 were {{randomly}} permuted 10, 000 times {{and the number of}} hitting streaks of each length from 2 to 100 was measured. The average count of each length streak was then compared to the corresponding total from real-life, when the games were in chronological order. The number of <b>streaks</b> <b>in</b> real-life was significantly higher than over the random permutations. Non-starts (such as pinch-hitting appearances) were removed since these may be unduly reducing the number of <b>streaks</b> <b>in</b> the permutations; the number of <b>streaks</b> <b>in</b> the permutations increased but was still significantly lower than real-life totals. Possible explanations are given for why more <b>streaks</b> have appeared <b>in</b> real-life than we would expect, including possibly the hot hand idea.
