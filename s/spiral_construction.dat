40|$|Abstract. This {{article is}} based on the {{construction}} of Nested Hyperbolic Polygonal <b>Spirals.</b> The <b>construction</b> uses constructible Euclidean angles to create hyperbolic polygons of five or more sides. The nested polygons are formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original polygon, thus creating a <b>spiral.</b> The <b>construction</b> is included for the readers to be able to construct one for themselves as they read along. This construction, along with hyperbolic trigonometric formulas, led to the results: measures of the angles, side lengths and areas of all the parts of the <b>spiral.</b> Furthermore, the <b>construction</b> is used to prove the constructible hyperbolic regular polygons have the same number of sides as the constructible Euclidean polygons.

40|$|AbstractIn the plane, the way {{to enclose}} the most area with a given {{perimeter}} {{and to use the}} shortest perimeter to enclose a given area, is always to use a circle. If we replace the plane by a regular tiling of it, and construct polyforms i. e. shapes as sets of tiles, things become more complicated. We need to redefine the area and perimeter measures, and study the consequences carefully. A <b>spiral</b> <b>construction</b> often provides, for every integer number of tiles (area), a shape that is most compact in terms of the perimeter or boundary measure; however it may not exhibit all optimal shapes.

Orb-web construction behaviour is reviewed and {{compared with that of}} nonorb-weaving orbicularians. Phylogenetic comparisons and the biogenetic law are applied to deduce behavioural homology. Linyphia webs were constructed gradually and in segments over a period of many days and had a long lifespan. Two construction behaviours, supporting structure and sticky thread (ST) (within the sheet) were observed. ST construction behaviour in linyphiids is considered homologous to sticky <b>spiral</b> <b>construction</b> in orb-weavers. Overall web construction conformed to the pattern of alternate construction of sticky and nonsticky parts as observed in theridiids. Linyphiids had no problem in switching between structure construction and ST construction even during a single behavioural bout. Both web construction behaviours in linyphiids were nonstereotypic, which is unusual in orbicularians. This might be due to the loss of control mechanisms at genetic level, probably by macro mutation. Lack of stereotypic behaviour might have played a substantial role in the origin of the diverse web forms seen in nonorb-weaving orbicularians. This hypothesis is consistent with patterns observed in the orbicularian phylogeny...|$|E

40|$|This month’s {{tutorial}} {{article presents}} {{a summary of}} the advantages and limitations of electrically-small antennas like those used in many wireless devices Every device that transmits and/or receives radio signals needs an antenna. When that device has a small size or limited space for a classic resonant antenna, various techniques are used to implement reducedsize antennas. Those techniques may include inductive or capacitive loading, meandered or <b>spiral</b> <b>construction,</b> high dielectric constant materials to slow down wave propagation, and embedded structures incorporated into the packaging. Each of these methods imposes some type of limitation when compared to monopole, dipole, or resonant loop antennas. This tutorial looks at the key limitations of small antennas, with the intention of illustrating what level of performance can be expected from the various design options. VSWR Bandwidth A good impedance match is needed for efficiently transferring power into, and extracting power from an antenna. Compared to the “natural” radiation resistance of a monopole (36 ohms) and a dipole (72 ohms), the radiation resistance of reduced size antennas will be much lower.

30|$|The third {{result from}} {{this study was the}} absence of a {{difference}} in the number of anomalies between the webs weaved by the spiders in the two groups. As anomalies are directly linked to behaviour during web construction (Foelix 2011), we could expect that the number of anomalies would increase for the spiders reared in boxes, but this was not the case. These results are in agreement with the previous study by Sensenig et al. (2010) that found that the general design of the web structure was not affected when webs were built under natural conditions (fence) or in the laboratory. Anomalies have not been extensively studied for orb-webs; they were rather unevaluated in experiments where spiders were put in extreme conditions such as weightlessness (Witt et al. 1968), drugs (Witt and Reed 1965; Hesselberg and Vollrath 2004), feeding (Blamires 2010) and ageing (Anotaux et al. 2012). Anomalies are difficult to use as parameter as they are numerous and varied (Pasquet et al. 2013). This phenomenon is also very difficult to study under natural conditions: after construction, the geometrical design of an orb-web is never perfect in the field. As soon as a web is made, or even during construction, the structure may be damaged by external events (wind, insects, vegetal). Indeed, under these conditions, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether an anomaly is the consequence of behavioural variation or due to external events. Previously, we showed that under laboratory conditions, anomalies in the orb structure are due to spider behavioural sequences during the capture <b>spiral</b> <b>construction</b> (Toscani et al. 2012). However, in this present study, experience had no influence on the number of anomalies made during web construction. We can therefore conclude that the behavioural scheme for web building is not affected by experience.|$|E
40|$|U članku je obrađena malobrojna skupina vojničkih fibula porijeklom s područja germansko-retskoglimesa. Datirane su u kraj 2. i prvu polovicu 3. st. Dva su primjerka iz Salone, a za treći nisu poznateokolnosti nalaza. Tipološki pripadaju tipovima Böhme 27, Böhme 29, i Böhme 30. Zajedno s fibulamaiz Salone, tipa Böhme 28, koje su objavljene ranije, pripadaju vojničkim fibulama srednjocarskogvremena koje prethode kasnocarskim lukovičastim fibulama. Vrijeme njihove uporabe je vrijememarkomanskih ratova, kada u Saloni borave vojne jedinice cara Marka Aurelija, te su možda zaostalekao svjedočanstvo boravka tih legija u Saloni. Due to {{military}} movements and repositioning {{of the military}} troops, {{one of the main}} characteristics ofthe fi bulae used as a part of military equipment is their wide area of distribution. That is precisely whythe Aucissa fi bulae type that was worn by soldiers has been present in all of the Roman provincessince the late 1 st century BC. In the fi rst half of the 1 st century AD, this role was taken by the well-defi ned fi bulae that areconsidered to have developed from the late La Tene forms, but whose origin and development of thevariants has still not been clarifi ed. Knee-shaped fi bulae appeared in the late 1 st century and lastedall through the 2 nd and 3 rd century, appearing even in the early 4 th century. Late Imperial fi bula thatwould take place of all the other types was a crossbow fi bula. The Salona example (cat. no. 1) belongs to the Böhme 27 type, variant 27 a, and according to thebasic characteristics, it belongs to the two-part bow-shaped fi bulae with <b>spiral</b> <b>construction.</b> Salonaexample diff ers from the basic type {{in the form of the}} head plate. Pprobably a series of fi bulae existedwithin the same type. It is important to emphasize that this example belongs to the group connectedto the fi nds in the western provinces of the Empire. Böhme 27 type examples can be found in large numbers in the area of German – Raeitan Limes,they become rare towards the east. Second Salona example (cat. no. 2) is characterised by a long cover of the hinge with thehexagonal cross-section that has a sculpturally defi ned rib on each side and slightly thicker endings. According to the typological classifi cation of A. Böhme, they belong to the type 30. They are dated inthe late 2 nd and early 3 rd century, and the examples similar to ours could be found in the Limes region,which assumes military usage. Fibulae with long cover of the hinge that have twice rectangle bended arch (Böhme 29) aredated in the same period. Fibula with catalogue no three belongs to this group. Nevertheless, it stilldiff ers from the fi bulae characteristic for this group in some details. Primarily, decoration in a formof an animal head placed on the part of the arch that bends towards the leg, has been replaced by adecoration in a shape of a ball, part of the arch close to the leg is wrapped in wire, and the arch diff ersbecause the middle part is hollow and inscription was probably placed there. The letters have notbeen preserved, but some remains in the corners could be parts of the letters. The same example iskept in Cologne and it carries the legend VTERE FELIX, which was probably the same for our exampleas well. It has one more peculiarity and that is the pelta-like shape of the head plate. This kind can befound with the so-called Pelta fi bulae that correspond to our fi bulae in time, area and origin. The beginning of the 2 nd century was characterized by the Dacian wars, while the end ofthe same century was characterized by the Marcomanni wars that led to the reconstruction ofSalona walls. It is diffi cult to say whether this material witnesses the military expeditions causedby that event. Namely, Salona did not have permanent army troops situated there, but they wouldtemporarily come during the immediate danger, and after that, they would retrieve into their basecamps. Inscriptions from Salona dating from 170 AD witness that the parts of the walls and towerswere built by the soldiers of the 1 st Delmati cohort led by the tribune Granius Fortunatus and thedetachments of the 2 nd and 3 rd legion led by the centurion Publius Emilius Amintianus. These twolegions were established in 165 during the rule of Marcus Aurelius (161 – 180). They stayed in Salonaduring Marcomannian danger, that is the time when all the fi bulae discussed in this paper were used,and may have been left as a testimony of this legions’ stay in Salona...|$|E

40|$|With the <b>spiraling</b> cost of <b>construction,</b> {{coupled with}} inflation, {{engineers}} must develop and research new techniques to better utilize the public's dollar. One area i n which these new technologies must be researched {{is in the}} field of highway construction; more specifically, asphalt products. There are areas within the state of Iowa which do not have Class I aggregate readily available for asphalt concrete road construction. The cost of transporting higher quality aggregate specified in the "Standard Specifications for Highway and Bridge construction"' for construction projects is escalating on a yearly basis. Many counties will be squeezed out of the construction of new roadways if an alternative to the high costs is not identified. The same high costs will curtail adequate upkeep on the existing paved system and will result in decreased serviceability.

Extensive parametric studies have been carried out, using the orthotropic sheet theoretical model of Hobbs and Raoof, {{on a wide range}} of <b>spiral</b> strand <b>constructions,</b> with outside diameters, d, and lay angles, a, in the practical ranges, 16. 4 mm ≤ d ≤ 184 mm, and 11 ≤ α ≤ 24, respectively. The effects of an external hydrostatic pressure on certain structural characteristics of sealed spiral strands, used in deep water applications, have also been studied in some detail, for water depths ranging from 0 m to 2000 m. The results, based on such theoretical parametric studies, have, for example, been used to refute claims by Jolicoeur that, by a simple modification, a significant improvement to the original orthotropic sheet model of Hobbs and Raoof, had been found. In addition, using such studies, axial fatigue life design S-N curves have been developed, which cater for the effects of an externally applied hydrostatic pressure on sheathed spiral strands. Simple (hand-based) formulations have also been developed for estimating the maximum frictional axial and torsional hysteresis along with,the associated axial load range/mean axial load, and range of twist/ 2, respectively, at which they occur, relating to both, the in-air conditions and also when a sheathed spiral strand is subjected to an external hydrostatic pressure. The previously reported work of Raoof and his associates, in connection with the response of helical cables (spiral strands and/or wire ropes) to impact loading, has been extended to include the development of closed-form solutions for predicting the extensional-torsional wave speeds and displacements, in axially preloaded helical cables, experiencing a half-sine type of impact loading at one end, with the other end fixed. The influence of the lay angle on the response of a spiral strand to three different (i. e. unit-step, triangular and half-sine) forms of impact loading functions, has also been analysed, with much emphasis placed on the practical implications of the final results in connection with non-destructive methods of wire fracture detection under service conditions [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was carried}} out in order to evaluate three differing approaches to achieving low energy buildings using improved methods of traditional masonry <b>construction.</b> <b>Spiralling</b> greenhouse emissions and fuel costs have focused the industry towards the delivery of low energy buildings. Cavity wall Masonry construction is the favoured method of construction currently used in the construction of dwellings in Ireland. Partial fill rigid insulation which is installed within the cavity is a technique which has been seen to result in large gaps between the design performance levels and actual performance levels. Impending requirements to further reduce heat loss will result in restricted use of traditional methods in the future. The inherent structural properties of this method are reaching their limits due to the requirement of more comprehensive widths of insulation material within the cavity. A comprehensive examination of published literature {{was carried out}} in order to address the causes of the performance gap relevant to this topic. The research will assess the performance issues with the comparative approaches through the literature review and primary research in order to determine if the use of either approach could contribute to narrowing the performance gap. Primary research will be gathered in the form of structured interviews with Industry professionals with expertise in both practical aspects and theoretical based levels of expertise. The results indicate that Solid Wall Construction with External Insulation is seen to be the approach which could contribute to the delivery of low energy buildings in Ireland on a more consist basis from the three options. The primary reasons for this are owing to the simplicity of the construction form and division of trade responsibility. However as this approach lacks familiarity, it is believed that a training and skills issued would firstly need to be addressed as it is a relatively new technique. One of the most problematic areas concerned with partial fill insulation is the issue of thermal passage that occur. Insulating cavity walls internally is seen to increase construction times and involves multiple layers with sequencing issues and lack of accountability in addition to the increased hygrothermal risk associated with insulating internally. While the Super Wide Full fill cavity technique draws concerns to the structural implication concerning the distance between both leafs and implications around window and eave locations...|$|R
