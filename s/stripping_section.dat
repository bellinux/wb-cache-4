40|$|Solid calcine {{is one of}} the wastes under {{evaluation}} for TRU removal by the TRUEX process. The calcine must first be dissolved in nitric acid prior to the removal of TRUs and fission products. Zirconium type calcine (generated from zirconium fuel reprocessing raffinates) comprises the majority of the calcine currently stored at the ICPP. The zirconium calcines average 18. 3 wt% ZrO{sub 2 } and are anticipated to be the most challenging to treat with regards to TRU removal because of the large zirconium content. This paper reports the results from a countercurrent flowsheet test performed with a dissolved calcine simulant in a 2 -cm centrifugal contractor pilot plant. The simulant was spiked with radioactive {sup 241 }Am and {sup 95 }Zr to facilitate analysis and evaluate the behavior of the actinides. Flooding and precipitate formation were observed in the <b>strip</b> <b>section</b> during the flowsheet testing. It is postulated that the flooding occurred as a result of precipitate formation. The precipitate was determined to be ZrPO{sub 4 } and was likely formed due the excessive amount of Zr carried into the <b>strip</b> <b>section</b> with the organic phase. Roughly 65 % of the Zr in the feed was extracted. Of the extracted Zr, 15. 6 % reported to the strip product and 15. 1 % ended up in the organic effluent, indicating the <b>strip</b> <b>section</b> was ineffective at re-extracting Zr. The poor <b>strip</b> <b>section</b> performance was probably due to the precipitation and concomitant flooding problems encountered in the test, resulting in the <b>strip</b> <b>section</b> never achieving steady state operating conditions. Despite the obvious problems encountered during the test, > 99. 18 % of the americium was removed from the feed in the extraction section. This may be slightly lower than the anticipated 99. 9 % Am removal efficiency necessary to insure the < 10 nCi/g TRU content in the LLW raffinate...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{experimentation}} {{has indicated}} that the SREX process is effective for partitioning {sup 90 }Sr from acidic radioactive waste solutions located at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. Previous countercurrent flowsheet testing of the SREX process with simulated waste resulted in 99. 98 % removal of Sr. With this previous test, however, Pb was extracted by the SREX solvent and was not back-extracted in the dilute nitric acid <b>strip</b> <b>section.</b> The Pb concentration increased in the recycled solvent and in the aqueous phase of the <b>strip</b> <b>section,</b> resulting {{in the formation of}} a Pb precipitate. Subsequently, studies were initiated to identify alternative stripping agents which will selectively strip Sr and Pb from the SREX solvent. Based on the results of these studies, a countercurrent flow sheet was developed and tested in the 5. 5 -cm Centrifugal Contactor Mockup using simulated waste. The flowsheet tested consisted of an extraction section (0. 15 M 4 {prime}, 4 {prime}(5) -di-(tert-butyldicyclohexo) - 18 -crown- 6 and 1. 2 M TBP in Isopar-L{reg_sign}), a 0. 05 M nitric acid <b>strip</b> <b>section</b> for the removal of Sr from the SREX solvent, a 0. 1 M ammonium citrate <b>strip</b> <b>section</b> for the removal of Pb from the SREX solvent, and a 2. 0 M nitric acid equilibration section.

40|$|The HIDiC is {{a concept}} of {{distillation}} to increase the energy efficiency. The HIDiC combines {{the advantages of the}} heat pump assisted column with the diabatic column. The rectification section and <b>stripping</b> <b>section</b> are separated and the rectification section is placed inside the <b>stripping</b> <b>section.</b> By compressing the flow from the <b>stripping</b> <b>section</b> to the rectification section, heat exchange between the two sections is possible. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine and validate process parameters with experimental data of the HIDiC pilot plant with and without equipped heat panels to increase the total heat transfer area and therefore heat transfer. Outcome of the study is that the installation heat panels does increase heat transfer but decreases the heat transfer coefficient. Several explanations and suggestion are given to improve this heat transfer coefficient. The model of efficiency works well, the pressure drop model over predicts the pressure drop in the outer column but works well for the inner column.

40|$|A heat {{integrated}} {{distillation column}} (HIDiC) {{is a new}} and highly energy-efficient distillation process. In the present work, multiple steady-states in HIDiC are analyzed. In HIDiC, the pressure in the rectifying section is kept higher than that in the <b>stripping</b> <b>section</b> by using a compressor to enhance heat transfer from the rectifying section to the <b>stripping</b> <b>section</b> through the wall.

First, the conditions for making multiple steady-states are derived on the basis of the first principle model of the HIDiC. Then, the analysis results are validated through simulations. The results show that: 1) the instability condition depends largely on the compressor operation policies; 2) in case P 1, multiple steady-states appear when the top product is highly pure, the bottom product is relatively impure, vapor flow rate is large, and compressor power is small; 3) in case P 2, multiple steady-states appear when the bottom product is highly pure; and 4) multiple steady-states appear in a wider range of operation in case P 2 than in case P 1...|$|E

This study is carried out to influence the unwanted side product dibutylether formation, produced by butanol dehydration. First of all, activity based intrinsic reaction kinetics for the main reaction (esterification) and the side reaction (etherification) have been developed. Effect of various parameters such as temperature, mole ratio, catalyst loading and catalyst particle size was studied. The intrinsic kinetic parameters related to Pseudohomogeneous (PH), Eley-Rideal (RE), Langmuir Hinshelwood Hougen Watson (LHHW), and modified LHHW (ML) models were developed. Good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data were obtained. For the main reaction RE model or modified LHHW model and for the side reaction LHHW model are appropriate representations of intrinsic kinetics. The developed rate expression were then used for the simulation based design of reactive distillation column {{for the production of}} butyl acetate with the goal of eliminating the side product formation and achieving high purity of desired product butyl acetate.
