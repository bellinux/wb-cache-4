40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} {{a comparison of}} the acoustic characteristics of one-dimensional and three-dimensional models of vocal tracts with nasal coupling. One-dimensional acoustic propagation is computed using an electric analog model. A finite element method is used for three-dimensional acoustic simulation. The comparison of these two approaches involves the vocal-tract shape of two subjects, one Japanese male and one French male pronouncing the vowel /a/ in their native language. Results show that the pole/zero pairs ascribed to the nasal coupling for both simulations appeared at almost the same frequency, at least below 2 kHz. Little difference between the one-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations in the transfer functions for the French subject is observed, since the three-dimensional mesh for the French subject is smoother. An extra pole exists in the transfer function of the three-dimensional model for the Japanese subject, possibly caused by the asymmetric structure of the laryngeal cavity.

This paper focuses on forecasting the wave energy over horizons of 1 - 12 h, {{in the southern part of}} the Caspian Sea. For this purpose, an artificial neural network was used to obtain the wave <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> using two different methods.

40|$|Leathers, Daniel J. Arctic {{amplification}} {{and changes}} in Arctic sea ice has led to questions regarding {{the role of the}} Arctic in mid-latitude climate. All studies concerning the factors and the impacts suggest that changes in the Arctic system occur in association with altered <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Therefore, this study explores Arctic <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes</b> in detail concentrating on their temporal and regional characteristics using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) dataset. To understand how <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> variations affect the Arctic climate, interactions among <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> variables, Arctic sea ice, and prominent atmospheric teleconnections are investigated. These interactions are analyzed from two spatial perspectives: the entire Arctic and the sub-Arctic regions. Results from the entire Arctic showed that the annual cycle and the spatial distribution of <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes</b> follow the seasonal cycle, latitudinal variation, and surface conditions. No significant long-term trends are found for the <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> variables; however, the accumulated total energy tendency suggests a prolonged period with <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> surplus from 1995 - 2006. Significant correlations were found among <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes,</b> sea ice, and the NAO suggesting that sea ice variations are connected with changes in atmospheric circulation through the surface <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> (F sfc) directly or indirectly through the atmospheric energy transport (TEDIV). Maps of the spatial correlations show stronger relationships between these variables in unique regions. Hence, studying these <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes</b> and the relationship from a regional perspective is essential. Examination of coherent regions shows that the annual cycle and the time series of the Arctic sub-regions are similar to the average for the entire Arctic following the solar cycle and without long-term linear trends. Only the annual cycle for TEDIV show differences among regions and do not resemble the average Arctic pattern. Additionally, a hypothetical pathway with two time-scales of variation is suggested. These two levels of influence complement each other and provide a comprehensive picture of the interactions among Arctic <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes,</b> sea ice, and atmospheric circulation. Further, the analysis suggests that sea ice variation {{is an important factor in}} modulating Arctic <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes,</b> and the Kara region plays a critical role in linking sea ice variability and atmospheric circulation.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{parameter}} {{study of the}} corona–solar wind system. The corona is heated by an <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> from the sun. This <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> is lost as heat conductive flux into the transition region and as solar wind <b>energy</b> <b>flux.</b> We consider two-fluid models {{where most of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> is deposited in the proton gas. Heating of the inner corona leads to a significant (electron) heat conductive flux into the transition region and a relatively high coronal electron density. This gives a relatively low coronal proton temperature, a large solar wind proton flux, and a relatively low asymptotic flow speed. In rapidly expanding flow geometries, where the thermal coupling between electrons and protons is weaker, heating of the protons in the inner corona may lead to a somewhat higher proton temperature, and higher asymptotic flow speed, but in order to drive high speed solar wind, a significant fraction of the <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> from the sun must be deposited in the outer corona, where the protons are collisionless. In such a model {{only a small fraction of}} the <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> is lost as inward heat flux, the transition region pressure is low, and the solar wind proton flux is quite small.

40|$|A one-fluid {{solar wind}} model {{is used to}} {{investigate}} some relations between coronal heating, the flux tube divergence near the Sun, and the solar wind proton flux and flow speed. The effects of energy addition to the supersonic region of the flow are also studied. We allow for a mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> that heats the corona, and an Alfven wave <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> that adds <b>energy,</b> mainly to the supersonic flow, both as momentum and as heat. We find that the mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> determines the solar wind mass flux, {{and in order to}} keep an almost constant proton flux at the orbit of Earth with changing flow geometry, that the mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> must vary linearly with the magnetic field in the inner corona. This thermally driven wind generally has a low asymptotic flow speed. When Alfven waves are added to the thermally driven flow, the asymptotic flow speed is increased and is determined by the ratio of the Alfven wave and the mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>fluxes</b> at the coronal base. Flow speeds characteristic of recurrent high-speed solar wind streams can be obtained only when the Alfven wave <b>energy</b> <b>flux,</b> deposited in the supersonic flow, is larger than the mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> heating the corona...|$|R

Upon correction, the planform kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> is lower than originally stated. In the region in front of the turbine array, it is 2. 2 W/m 2 instead of 17 W/m 2. The average planform kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> into the turbine array from 2 D downwind of the second turbine pair to 7. 5 D downwind of the third sensor pair is 3. 4 W/m 2 for the highest sensor position and 0. 03 W/m 2 for the lowest sensor position; values of 22 W/m 2 and 0. 4 W/m 2, respectively, were stated in the paper.

40|$|In {{isotropic}} materials, {{the direction}} of the <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> (<b>energy</b> per unit time per unit area) of an ultrasonic plane wave is always along the same direction as the normal to the wave front. In anisotropic materials, however, this is true only along symmetry directions. Along other directions, the <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> of the wave deviates from the intended direction of propagation. This phenomenon is known as <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> deviation and is illustrated. The direction of the <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> is dependent on the elastic coefficients of the material. This effect has been demonstrated in many anisotropic crystalline materials. In transparent quartz crystals, Schlieren photographs have been obtained which allow visualization of the ultrasonic waves and the <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> deviation. The <b>energy</b> <b>flux</b> deviation in graphite/epoxy (gr/ep) composite materials can be quite large because of their high anisotropy. The flux deviation angle has been calculated for unidirectional gr/ep composites as a function of both fiber orientation and fiber volume content.
