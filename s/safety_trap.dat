40|$|Fear of risk {{provides}} {{a rationale for}} protracted economic downturns. We develop a real business cycle model where investors with decreasing relative risk aversion choose between a risky and a safe technology that exhibit decreasing returns. Because of a feedback effect from the interest rate to risk aversion, two equilibria can emerge: a standard equilibrium and a "safe" one in which investors invest in safer assets. We refer to the dynamics of this second equilibrium as a <b>safety</b> <b>trap</b> because it is self-reinforcing as investors accumulate more wealth and show it {{to be consistent with}} Japan's lost decade...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{consequences}} of safe asset scarcity on aggregate demand in a stylized IS-LM/Mundell Fleming style environment. Acute safe asset scarcity forces the economy into a "safety trap" recession. In the open economy, safe asset scarcity spreads {{from one country to}} the other via capital flows, equalizing interest rates. Acute global safe asset scarcity forces the economy into a global <b>safety</b> <b>trap.</b> The exchange rate becomes indeterminate but plays a crucial role in both the distribution and the magnitude of output adjustment across countries. Policies that increase the net supply of safe assets somewhere are output enhancing everywhere...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the global}} economy has {{experienced}} recurrent episodes of safe asset short-ages. In this paper we present a model that shows how such shortages can generate macroeconomic phenomena {{similar to those found}} in liquidity trap scenarios. Despite the similarities, there are also subtle but important differences which carry significant impacts on the relative effectiveness of economic policy and potential market solutions to the underlying problem. For example, while forward guidance policies are typically more effective than quantitative easing ones in the standard liquidity trap environment, the opposite holds in <b>safety</b> <b>trap</b> contexts. Also, while asset bubbles (market solutions) and public debt are both effective in liquidity traps, only the latter are in safety traps. Essentially, a safe asset shortage is a deficit of a particular form of wealth (safe wealth), which the government has comparative advantage in supplying. Forward guidance and financial bubbles, which increase risky wealth and stimulate the economy in liquidity traps, fail to do so in safety traps as they are dissipated through higher spreads...|$|E
40|$|The {{global economy}} has a chronic {{shortage}} of safe assets which lies behind many recent macroeconomic imbalances. This paper provides a simple {{model of the}} Safe Asset Mechanism (SAM), its recessionary <b>safety</b> <b>traps,</b> and its policy antidotes. <b>Safety</b> <b>traps</b> share many common features with conventional liquidity traps, but also exhibit important differences, in particular {{with respect to their}} reaction to policy packages. In general, policy-puts (such as QE 1, LTRO, fiscal policy, etc.) that support future bad states of the economy {{play a central role in}} the SAM environment, while policy-calls that support the good states of the recovery (e. g., some aspects of forward guidance) are less powerful. Public debt plays a central role in SAM as long as the government has spare fiscal capacity to back safe asset production...|$|R

40|$|The Florence School of Banking and Finance at the European University Institute (EUI) and the Brevan Howard Centre at Imperial College London – in {{cooperation}} with BAFFI CAREFIN at Bocconi University – organized a conference on 28 April 2016 at the EUI in Florence with the theme of "Filling the Gaps in Governance: the Case of Europe". The conference brought together leading economists, lawyers, policy-makers and private practitioners to review the most significant gaps in the European Union's incomplete governance and to discuss how they could be addressed. This ebook summarizes their contributions. The first part centres around {{the debate on the}} desirability of having a debt restructuring regime in Europe and asks whether the 'no bail-out' requirement and the ‘no debt restructuring’ mantra can be compatible in EMU. The second part analyses the implications of incomplete, horizontal agreements among EU and EMU member states and discusses the sensitive (and largely unsettled) matter of withdrawals, exits and expulsions from participating in those different governance arrangements. In particular, it considers the implications of the referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The third part, lastly, addresses the Banking Union and finds that the newest layer of European governance appears to be plagued by gaps in governance even before it has got off the ground.

40|$|Because of {{the high}} {{morbidity}} and mortality associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome {{and the possibility of}} aerosol transmission of hantaviruses, persons handling known reservoir species in the field, laboratory, or classroom should take special precautions to minimize the risk of infection. We provide specific guidelines for personal <b>safety</b> while <b>trapping,</b> handling and releasing, transporting, sampling, and performing necropsy on potentially infected rodents or teaching field classes in areas occupied by reservoir species. Special consideration should be given to respiratory protection, choice and use of disinfectants, decontamination of instruments and traps, proper disposal of infectious wastes, and preservation and shipment of samples intended for hantavirus testing. Precautionary testing of wild rodents used to start laboratory colonies is recommended. Although we specifically address hantaviruses, the procedures described are applicable for any study of populations of small mammals when an infectious zoonotic agent transmissible by aerosol and capable of causing high morbidity and mortality is involved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a coherent}} {{strategy for the}} use of food aid in addressing food insecurity. It surveys recent literature on poverty traps, the rights-based approach to food security and discusses where food aid fits into an integrated analysis of poverty and food security. The paper distinguishes between transitory and chronic poverty and between ‘safety nets’, designed to prevent people from falling below a certain poverty threshold, and cargo nets, aimed at lifting people out of chronic poverty. The appropriateness of food aid is discussed in the context of three situations: emergency humanitarian assistance, asset protection, and asset building and productivity enhancement. The paper argues that food aid, like all forms of foreign assistance, should first seek to do no harm. food aid, poverty <b>trap,</b> <b>safety</b> net, cargo net, right to food. ...|$|R
5000|$|At 15:00 on 18 December 1980, a {{contractor}} building Mong Kok (now Mong Kok East) Station accidentally severed signalling cables, disabling the automatic signalling system. At this time, the railway {{had been only}} partly doubled-tracked, and still made use of the old single-track Beacon Hill Tunnel. Later in the day, two trains were inadvertently put on a head-on collision course {{just south of the}} tunnel. At 18:40, a Lo Wu-bound train carrying about 1,500 passengers reached the point where the double-tracked section of the railway ended ahead of the tunnel, near Yau Yat Chuen. A <b>safety</b> device, a <b>trap</b> point, prevented the collision by forcing the train to derail, causing minor injuries to some passengers. A minute later, a southbound train came to a screeching halt at the accident site. A KCR spokesman blamed [...] "a misunderstanding in a telephone communication".|$|R
40|$|Great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) {{damage to}} citrus {{is a serious}} concern to {{producers}} in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Damage caused by grackles pecking fruit is initiated by breeding colonies in the spring on immature fruit and extends through {{the fall and winter}} on ripening fruit. The most significant damage occurs during the post-breeding period of July through September when neither the currently registered DRC- 1339 -treated dog food bait nor frightening strategies are effective. Observations by Texas Wildlife Services personnel suggested that watermelon was highly attractive to grackles during the period when dog food baits are poorly accepted. Two control strategies using watermelon to bait large cage traps and to formulate DRC- 1339 baits were evaluated in cage and field trials during a 2 -year research project. This paper reports on the development and preliminary evaluations of a unique trap design and the 0. 1 % DRC- 1339 -treated watermelon bait. Summer field trials in citrus groves were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and <b>safety</b> of <b>trapping</b> and DRC- 1339 baiting. Results of preliminary evaluations clearly demonstrated the utility of these methods for controlling grackles. Although the effectiveness of these methods for controlling grackle damage in citrus groves was less conclusive, no measurable hazards to non-target wildlife were documented. With suggested modifications, both methods may provide a viable means to reduce grackle damage to citrus during a period when other alternative methods are ineffective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a global {{review of the}} link from forests to poverty alleviation. Definitions are clarified and the key concepts and indicators related to livelihoods and policy reduction and prevention are explored [...] distinguishing between the analysis and the measurements of poverty. Reviewing the macro-level literature {{on the relationship between}} economic growth, inequality and poverty, the authors found that economic growth usually does trickle down to the poor and that poverty reduction without growth is in practice very difficult to achieve. The potentials and limitations of forests in regard to poverty allevition are canvassed and their possible roles as <b>safety</b> nets, poverty <b>traps</b> and pathways out of poverty are explored. The core discussion addresses how forests can contribute to poverty reduction, distinguishing three main benefit categories. Firstly, non-timber forest products serve subsistence needs, may have important gap filling or safety net functions. Secondly, timber has not traditionally been very pro-poor but the current trends of increased local ownership of natural forests, growing tree commercialisation and small scale wood processing could modify that picture. Thirdly, ecological service payments are emerging rapidly but it is uncertain how much the poor will benefit. In conclusion, this paper outlines ten promising research topics, within three broader fields: assessing current forest-based benefits to the poor; exploring emerging market opportunities; and evaluating cross-cutting institutional and extra-sectoral issues...|$|R
40|$|The use of attractants and larvicides in {{oviposition}} traps is {{of practical}} {{interest for the}} surveillance and control of urban mosquitoes. In addition to increasing the <b>safety</b> of the <b>traps,</b> this combination is essential for an attract-and-kill control strategy based on trapping mosquito eggs. The combination of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) and grass infusion (GI) vs. GI alone were tested {{for their ability to}} attract in paired BR-OVT traps in the backyards of 10 houses in Recife, Brazil, for a period of 45 days. Results show that females prefer to oviposit in traps containing Bti (363 compared with 251 egg rafts over 45 days). Results from a one-year trial on the efficacy of BR-OVT traps loaded with GI and Bti as a sampling tool to monitor temporal fluctuations in the population densities of Culex quinquefasciatus in an urban environment are also reported. From December 2006 -January 2007, one trap per home was installed and maintained for 348 consecutive days in 134 - 151 houses located in three urban blocks. Throughout the one-year field trial a total of 43, 151 Culex egg rafts were collected in the traps. The data show that BR-OVT loaded with GI and Bti is sensitive enough to demonstrate continuous reproductive activity of Cux. quinquefasciatus in the study area throughout the year and to monitor temporal fluctuations in population density...|$|R
40|$|In 2011, western corn root worm beetles were {{detected}} in the federal states Hesse (Groß-Gerau) and Rhineland-Palatinate (Bodenheim) for the first time. Control measures based on commission decision 2003 / 766 /EG (Byrne, 2003) were conducted after detection in PAL-traps. Focus and safety zones were established. In Hesse, both focus and safety zones were treated with the insecticide Biscaya, due to {{the high number of}} 50 beetles which {{were detected}} in the PAL-traps. Since in Rhineland-Palatinate, only one beetle had been captured, only the focus zone was treated with the insecticide. After insecticide treatment, new PAL-traps were arranged like a close grid over the infested areas in both federal states. In each maize field in the focus- and <b>safety</b> zone further <b>traps</b> were placed and checked weekly until September 30 th by supporting staff. Until the end of the monitoring in 2011 (September 30 th) further beetles were {{detected in the}} south of the area (district of Groß-Gerau, Hesse), were the first infestation had been discovered. However, in Rhineland-Palatinate no further beetles were detected that year. By the end of the monitoring 354 beetles in Hesse and one beetle in Rhineland-Palatinate had been captured in total. Subsequently the demarked zones in Hesse were extended. Taking into account the local circumstances, the new focus zone was delimited to include all the areas where beetles had been detected as well as the surrounding maize fields. In the focus zones the cultivation of maize was forbidden for the consecutive two years and a crop rotation with at least 50 percent maize was established in the safety zones. In 2012 no further beetles were captured in the infested region...|$|R
