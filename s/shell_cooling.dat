40|$|The {{existence}} of stellar shells at large distances from isolated elliptical galaxies is {{explained in terms}} of a blast wave associated with an active nucleus phase early {{in the history of the}} galaxy. The blast wave sweeps the initial interstellar medium out of the galaxy into an expanding shell which radiatively cools behind its leading shock front. Cooling of the shell following turnoff of the nucleus activity, which keeps the shell photoionized, leads to a brief epoch of star formation which is terminated by heating of the shell from supernovae and UV radiation from massive stars. The stars so formed follow similar, highly radial, bound orbits, moving in phase with each other and spending much of their time near apogalacteum, thus taking on the appearance of a shell. Multiple shells may be produced when conditions allow repeated episodes of <b>shell</b> <b>cooling</b> and supernovae heating to occur in the blast wave...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the altitude wind tunnel {{to determine the extent}} to which the afterburner <b>shell</b> <b>cooling</b> problem could be alleviated by internal configuration changes.

Consideration is given to the effects on both shell temperature and afterburner performance. In the range of fuel-air ratio investigated, the use of a cooling liner resulted in substantial reductions in shell temperature with no penalty in performance. Appreciable reductions in afterburner shell temperature were made possible by control of the radial fuel distribution; however, the effects on performance are uncertain and may depend on other variables not investigated. No direct relation was found between shell temperature and the clearance between the flame holder and the shell; however, some cooling effect may possibly be achieved by varying the clearance...|$|E

40|$|Application {{of energy}} {{efficient}} compressors, {{air handling units}} (AHUs), condensers and evaporators of high effectiveness are the some of the measures towards energy conservation in refrigeration systems. Cooling of compressor shell with the defrost drips is an energy saving measure which is explored in this paper. In tropical countries which have 70 – 80 % RH year round, the quantity of defrost formation is significant while refrigeration systems are on. This defrost water is dripped on the compressor's shell, which in turn cools the compressor oil and hence reduces the friction losses and winding temperature of the motor. Once winding temperature is reduced the compressor's ampere rating is reduced which ultimately reduces the energy consumption of the compressor. For given conditions of refrigerator function, the compressor shell temperature and ampere rating of compressor are tabulated and investigated before and after compressor <b>shell</b> <b>cooling.</b> The investigation reveals that around 8 – 10 % energy savings are achieved for the given conditions...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of turbojet-engine thrust augmentation {{by means of}} tail-pipe burning has been conducted in the NACA Lewis altitude wind tunnel. Several fuel systems and flame holders were investigated in a 29 -inch-diameter tail-pipe burner {{to determine the effect}} of fuel distribution and flame-holder design on tail-pipe-burner performance and operational characteristics over a range of simulated flight conditions. At an altitude of 5000 feet, the type of flame holder used had only a slight effect on the combustion efficiency. As the altitude was increased, the decrease in peak combustion efficiency became more rapid as the blocking area of the flame holder was reduced. At all altitudes investigated, an improvement in the uniformity of the radial distribution of fuel and air slightly increased the peak combustion efficiencies and shifted the peak combustion efficiency to higher tail-pipe fuel-air ratios.

40|$|Cooling in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be cool down, which {{is known as the}} <b>shell</b> <b>cooling.</b> This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other cooling methods. Cooling can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the back plate. This paper focuses on seeking the most effective cooling place to increase the performance and reduce the impeller temperature. It is found that shroud cooling improves the compressor performance the most. Shroud cooling with 2400 W of cooling power increases the pressure ratio by 4. 6 % and efficiency by 1. 49 %. Each 500 W increase in the shroud cooling power, increases the efficiency by 0. 3 %. Diffuser cooling and back plate cooling have an identical effect on the polytropic efficiency. However, back plate cooling increases the pressure ratio more than diffuser cooling.

Two supported catalysts were considered: a standard Pd/carbon, and an egg-shell Pd/alumina, in a vapour-phase process that uses propane as solvent. Best reactor–catalyst combination was selected using optimization. Optimal reactor–catalyst conditions were: Pd (0. 5 wt%) on alumina catalyst in tubes, <b>shell</b> <b>cooling,</b> inlet temperature 170 °C, space-time 100 s, 4 mol% of H 2 in the feed, oil feed 1 mol%, propane 95 mol%, with pressure up to 20 MPa.

In plant simulation, three recycle streams (H 2, CO 2 and cosolvent) complicate the separations. In order to assess the safety differences between these options, a study was done using the Dow Fire and Explosion Index to roughly figure out process safety.

The afterburner modifications were made by the manufacturer to improve the endurance at sea-level, high-pressure conditions and to reduce the afterburner shell temperatures. The engine operating conditions of rated rotational speed and turbine-outlet gas temperature were increased. Data were obtained at conditions simulating flight at a Mach number of 0. 9 and at altitudes from 40, 000 to 60, 000 feet. The afterburner modifications caused a reduction in afterburner combustion efficiency. The increase in rated engine speed and turbine-outlet temperature coupled with the afterburner modifications resulted in the over-all thrust of the engine and afterburner being unchanged at a given afterburner equivalence ratio, while the specific fuel consumption was increased slightly. A moderate shift in the range of equivalence ratios over which the afterburner would operate was encountered, but the maximum operable altitude remained unaltered.

In order to solve this problem, we present a simple model of chemical evolution for elliptical galaxies after the galactic wind period under the assumption that the gases ejected from stars do not mix with the circumferential gas. The ejected gas components evolve separately according to their birth time and origin. We have investigated their evolution qualitatively. The gas components originated from supernova remnant <b>shells</b> <b>cool</b> and drop out of the hot gas faster than the other components because of their high density and metal abundance. As a result, supernovae cannot heat the whole gas of the elliptical galaxies effectively, in contrary to the previous results.

40|$|The {{exact nature}} of eta Carinae is still an open issue. In this paper we assume a binary system to explain the strong X-ray emission, but we also take into account that, near periastron {{and because of the}} highly {{eccentric}} orbit, the wind emerging from eta Carinae accumulates behind the shock and can mimic a shell-like ejection event. For this process to be effective, at periastron the secondary star should be located between eta Carinae and the observer, solving also the discrepancy between the orbital parameters derived from ground and space based observations. We show that, as the secondary moves in its orbit, the <b>shell</b> <b>cools</b> down and the number of available stellar ionizing photons is not enough to maintain the shell temperature at its equilibrium value of about 7500 K. The central part of the shell remains cold and under these conditions grain formation and growth can take place in timescales of hours.

We also calculated the neutral gas column density intercepting the line of sight at each point of the orbit near periastron, and were able to reproduce the form and duration of the X-ray light curve without any change in the eta Carinae mass loss rate.

The version of record is available online at doi: 10. 1051 / 0004 - 6361 : 20020135. ?? ESO 2002 A radiative hydrodynamic simulation for a typical, powerful high redshift radio galaxy is presented. The jet is injected at one third {{the speed of light}} into a 10 000 times denser, homogeneous medium. In the beginning of the simulation, the bow shock consists of a spherical shell that is similar to a spherical blast wave. This <b>shell</b> <b>cools</b> radiatively down to ≈ 10 ^ 4 K, providing after 6 × 10 ^ 6 yrs a neutral column of 3. 8 × 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 around the whole system. The shell starts to fragment and forms condensations. This absorbing screen will cover a smaller and smaller fraction of the radio source, and therefore the emission line region, and eventually form stars in typically 104 globular clusters of 10 ^ 6 M_. Approximately 10 ^ 9 M_ are entrained into the radio cocoon. This gas, cooling and illuminated from the radio source, could be the emission line gas observed in high redshifted radio galaxies and radio loud quasars. The neutral column behind the bow shock can account for the absorption found in almost all of the small sources. The globular cluster excess of ≈ 10 ^ 4 systems found in present day brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), which are believed to be the vestiges of these objects, is consistent with the presented scenario...|$|R
