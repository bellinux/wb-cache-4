40|$|The {{increase}} in {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from anthropogenic sources has resulted in climate change, which affects all living beings. Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plantations, in monoculture or together with timber species such as <b>salmwood</b> (Cordia alliodora), mitigate climate change due to fixation of atmospheric CO 2  that is deposited in biomass and soils. This study {{was carried out in}} the municipality of Líbano, Tolima, Colombia with the objective of defining which of the following coffee production systems store more soil organic carbon (SOC) : 1) monoculture, 2) agroforestry systems (AFS) with <b>salmwood,</b> and 3) AFS with plantain. Farms with those systems that are the most dominant in the study zone were selected. From each system, five repetitions were identified to be analyzed with a completely randomized design. In each plot or repetition, five samples for bulk density (BD) using the cylinder method and a composite sample for concentration of SOC were taken and analyzed using the Walkley and Black approach. The systems of production did not significantly (p > 0. 05) affect either the BD or the concentration of SOC. However, AFS with plantain tended to have less BD than monoculture and AFS with <b>salmwood</b> (0. 83 ± 0. 03 vs 0. 88 ± 0. 03 vs 0. 92 ± 0. 04 g·cm- 3, respectively). These systems of production stored between 50 and 54 t·ha- 1  of SOC in the top 30 cm, which indicates their capacity for climate change mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Slash-and-burn {{agriculture}} is, {{under conditions}} with increasing pressure on resources, one cause of deforestation and land degradation. The Mayas of southern Belize use {{a type of}} slash-and-burn farming which is currently degrading the environment. On the other hand, cacao cultivation can be an integrated part of multi-storey agroforestry systems, indicated to provide capacity to maintain biodiversity. The Mayas have traditionally farmed cacao {{and it is now}} becoming an important cash crop in the district. Institutional stakeholders in Toledo district and six cacao farmers in two Mayan villages was interviewed for this study. The focus was to identify perceived constraints and prospects, as well as considerations of improvements, in shaded cacao cultivation. The farmers who participated in this study produce organic cacao under small-scale farming conditions, growing cacao under a canopy of mainly fruit and timber trees, providing income and food. Banana/plantain (Musa sp.), <b>Salmwood</b> (Cordia alliodora) and Cedar (Cederela odorata) are common shade species. Shade trees are randomly planted and timings for shade management is varying. Many of the farmers experience that their shade management can improve. Weather, disease, income and lack of knowledge are some of the issues in shaded cacao farming in the south of Belize. There is an on-going development of the local cacao market and the organic and Fair Trade production is constantly growing. More attention needs to be given to further research for improvements in shade management, as well as better access to resources for the local cacao farmers...|$|E
