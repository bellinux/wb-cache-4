50|$|In 1956 his brother, Tomoma Tani, {{brought home}} a hand-made, 3-motor, 3-head <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> This sparked Katsuma's {{interest}} in reel-to-reel tape recorders. Confident they could engineer a better tape recorder, the Tani brothers founded the Tokyo Electro-Acoustic Company on 24 December 1956.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, Kolbe said, [...] "In {{the autumn}} of 1953 got the first <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> in Europe, an Ampex 350... which meant we aimed for proper stereo image rather than the 'ping-pong' style that was popular {{in the early days}} - {{everything}} on the left or the right and no middle". From the beginning, Kolbe was a strong advocator of 3-channel stereo.|$|E
50|$|There are no radios, {{televisions}} sets, <b>stereos,</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> or VCR {{in homes}} of the members. Musical instruments like pianos or guitars are also not found there. There was a long debate {{over the use of}} the internet beginning {{in the middle of the}} 1990s, although contrary to various reports, it was not one of the primary catalysts for the split in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Engineers at AEG, {{working with}} the {{chemical}} giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. During World War II, an engineer at the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft discovered the AC biasing technique. With this technique, an inaudible high-frequency signal, typically {{in the range of}} 50 to 150 kHz, is added to the audio signal before being applied to the recording head. Biasing radically improved the sound quality of magnetic tape recordings. By 1943 AEG had developed <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b>|$|R
50|$|With two {{interleaved}} stereo pairs, {{the track}} format {{and speed of}} the RCA tape cartridge is fully compatible with the slower 3.75 IPS speed of consumer reel-to-reel <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> It is possible to dismantle the cartridge, spool the tape onto an open reel, and play it on such a machine. In fact, RCA offered an adapter for their Sound Tape Cartridge machines {{to enable them to}} both play back and record traditional reels of tape up to 5 inches in reel diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Atkins is {{once again}} pictured on the cover in his home studio in Nashville. The liner notes are by David Halberstam, then writing for The Tennessean in Nashville, Tennessee, which discuss his {{practice}} of recording rhythm tracks in the RCA studio and then going home with the tapes to perfect his guitar part in his own studio. [...] "The workshop resembles a small scale Cape Canaveral. In it is approximately $8,000 worth of electronic and electrical equipment, much of it built by Atkins himself: a small maze of mixing panels, a three channel <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> a one channel recorder... This is the lonely man's room and Atkins when he is working is a lonely man. 'Can't take my time in the studio. We're making money there and when you are making money you can't really take your time.' Here he can retire {{for days on end}} to be handed an occasional sandwich through the door by his wife Leona, but here to stay with his guitar, and his sound." ...|$|E
50|$|The 3/180° and 5/180° {{connectors}} {{were originally}} standardized and {{widely used in}} European countries for interconnecting analog audio equipment. For example, a <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> could connect to a stereo amplifier using the five pins for the four signal connections plus ground. The connectors on the cord are connected pin for pin, (pin 1 to pin 1, etc.). Pins on male connectors are numbered (from right to left, viewed from outside of the connector, with the 5 pins upwards, and facing them): 1-4-2-5-3. Holes on female connectors are also numbered 1-4-2-5-3, but {{from left to right}} (facing the holes). A four-conductor cord wired in this way is sometimes called a DIN cord, a DIN lead or a DIN cable. For mono interconnections, the 3/180° plugs are sufficient. When a mono plug is inserted into a stereo socket, it mates with the left channel. This interface was rare in the U.S. market, and has progressively disappeared on new equipment, both in Germany and worldwide, since the 1980s, in favour of RCA connectors.|$|E
50|$|On {{completing}} his studies in 1969 Fanshawe travelled up the Nile from the Mediterranean Sea, visiting Egypt, Sudan, Uganda and Kenya {{over a three-year}} period before finally reaching Lake Victoria. He brought a small <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> on his journey and would persuade local musicians to play for him. Returning to the United Kingdom in 1972 with several hundreds of hours of recordings made during his travels, Fanshawe used the material to compose what became his best known work, African Sanctus. After this work he became widely known for the composition of choral works. Besides vocal pieces, he also composed the score for films and television, including films such as Tarka the Otter (1979) and Dirty Weekend (1993), and TV productions such as the BBC's Softly, Softly: Taskforce and When the Boat Comes In, and ITV's The Feathered Serpent, Flambards and The Good Companions. His ethnic field recordings have featured in countless TV documentaries, including Musical Mariner and Tropical Beat, as well as various feature films including Mountains of the Moon, How to Make an American Quilt, Seven Years in Tibet and Gangs of New York.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic <b>tape</b> sound <b>recorder,</b> the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. By 1943 AEG had developed <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> Development of magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing corporation (now known as 3M).|$|R
50|$|In 1958, American {{recording}} engineer Wally Heider mounted recording equipment in a truck, reportedly {{the first to}} do so. The next year, engineer Reice Hamel did the same. Both men used new techniques, bringing many microphones to a concert and mixing the performance as it happened—in {{the manner of a}} remote broadcast—recording onto <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> for release as stereo and mono records. Hamel's first truck grew from simple to more complex in the first seven years. He started with stereo, obtained a three-track machine on which he taped a Barbra Streisand concert, then in 1965 he configured the truck as a complete recording studio. In 1966 he installed a four-track machine, then moved to eight-track, and by 1971 was recording on sixteen tracks.|$|R
50|$|Jackson's intent for the {{recording}} was {{to capture the}} intensity and spontaneity of a live performance, but without the distraction of noise from the crowd. He requested that the audience remain silent while his performance was recorded. The music was mixed live from microphones on each musical instrument and sent directly to a <b>stereo</b> digital <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> Unlike most live recordings, no post-recording mixing or overdubbing was performed.|$|R
40|$|Information {{gathering}} system measures and records vibrations which affect personnel comfort in space, air, and surface vehicles. Three vibration transducers with {{mutually perpendicular axes}} control the frequency output of voltage controlled oscillators /VCO/. Outputs of VCO'S are multiplexed and then recorded on one track of <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Old {{and in the}} Way is the self-titled {{first album}} by the {{bluegrass}} band Old and in the Way. It was recorded 8 October 1973 at the Boarding House in San Francisco by Owsley Stanley and Vickie Babcock utilizing eight microphones (four per channel) mixed live onto a <b>stereo</b> Nagra <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> The caricature album cover was illustrated by Greg Irons. [...] For many years it was the top selling bluegrass album of all time, until that title {{was taken by the}} soundtrack album for O Brother, Where Art Thou.|$|R
2500|$|Some time in {{or after}} 1965, he {{acquired}} his first item of studio recording equipment, a Bang & Olufsen 'Beocord 2000 De Luxe' <b>stereo</b> reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> which allowed multi-tracking between {{left and right}} channels. He says it [...] "taught me {{how to be a}} producer". In 1966, Lynne joined the line-up of the Nightriders as guitarist. The band would soon change their name to the Idle Race. Despite recording two critically acclaimed albums with the band and producing the second, success eluded him. In 1970, Lynne accepted an offer from friend Roy Wood to join the line-up of the more successful band the Move.|$|R
50|$|The 30-line {{signal was}} {{sufficiently}} low-band for Elliott {{to be able}} to record the production onto a <b>stereo</b> audio <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> thus preserving it for posterity. Although Elliott did not re-create the entire play and used amateur student actors in the roles, he did secure the services of the original production's producer, Lance Sieveking. Sieveking not only returned to produce the production in an attempt to assure as much authenticity as possible, but he was also able to provide the original artwork used in the play which was used again, and the very same 78-rpm gramophone record which had provided the music in 1930, which was also re-used.|$|R

5000|$|In 1968, {{the record}} {{producer}} for The Litter, Warren Kendrick, devised {{a method to}} precisely control flanging by placing two 15 IPS (inches per second) <b>stereo</b> Ampex <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> side by side. The take-up reel of recorder A and supply reel of B were disabled, as were channel 2 of recorder A, channel 1 of recorder B and the erase head of <b>recorder</b> B. The <b>tape</b> was fed left-to-right across both recorders and an identical signal was recorded on each channel of the tape, but displaced by approximately 18 inches {{along the length of}} the tape. During recording, an ordinary screwdriver was wedged between the recorders to make the tape run [...] "uphill" [...] and [...] "downhill." [...] The same configuration was employed during the playback/mixdown to a third recorder. The screwdriver was moved back and forth to cause the two signals to diverge, then converge. The latter technique permits zero point flanging; i.e., the lagging signal crosses over the leading signal and the signals change places.|$|R
5000|$|In 1932 DuMont {{invented the}} magic eye tube {{also known as}} the Electron Ray Tube, used as a tuning {{accessory}} in radios and as a level meter in mono and <b>stereo</b> home reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> In the 1930s the manufacture of mechanical panel meters were labor-intensive and expensive. Magic eye tubes provided radio designers with a less expensive and more profitable way to add a feature usually found in higher price equipment. The general public reception was a success as customers like the green glow and the seemingly magical way it worked. He released information on his invention the following year. [...] He sold the patents and rights to RCA for $20,000 to help fund his other projects.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Nakamichi {{developed}} one of {{the first}} open reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> in Japan under the Magic Tone brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the Fidela 3-head Open Reel <b>Stereo</b> <b>Tape</b> Deck.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{scanning}} {{serves to}} mitigate the problems of scintillation and dynamic range for Fourier spectrometry, {{as well as to}} simplify the measurement procedures. Rapid scanning means scanning at a rate such that the interferometric fringes act as their own chopper. It also means scanning at a rate such that the fringe frequencies exceed the scintillation frequencies, thereby avoiding confusion between the two. Of necessity the scanning becomes repetitive for the measurement of faint sources. During observation the repetitive interferogram signals are recorded on one channel of a <b>stereo</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> while timing information is recorded on the other channel. The interferograms are subsequently digitized and summed (in synchronism according to the timing channel) into a magnetic core memory. Fourier analysis of the resulting interferogram can be finally carried out by either analogue techniques or by digital computation. Astronomical spectra obtained by two instruments, one in the visible (S- 20) range, the other in the lead sulphide range, are shown to demonstrate the efficacy of rapid scanning. Finally a curious systematic effect of erroneous digitizing to enhance weak spectral absorption lines was discovered and will be illustrated...|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{recording}} in {{the series}} goes back to 1968. Working {{under the direction of}} Tony Conrad and Beverly Grant Conrad, Teibel recorded ocean waves at Coney Island for use in their feature film [...] "Coming Attractions" [...] (1970). Teibel immediately sensed the marketability of this material, noting its effect on improving concentration, enhancing sleep and sex, and imparting a sense of calm to the listener. Conrad, who wished to credit Walter De Maria for his prior usage of ocean recordings, was not willing to become a partner in the Syntonic Research enterprise as envisioned by Teibel, so Teibel parted ways with the [...] "Coming Attractions" [...] project. Subsequently Teibel himself felt unsatisfied with his results — though his Uher <b>stereo</b> reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> had faithfully captured the sounds of the surf, he felt that they were less convincing on playback. A friend of Teibel's, Louis Gerstman, had access to an IBM 360 computer, and he and Teibel played around with processing the recordings until eventually the two of them hit upon a series of manipulations (basically some rolling filtering and overdubbing) which sounded 'more real than real.' ...|$|R
50|$|A Dolby noise-{{reduction}} system, or Dolby NR, {{is one of}} {{a series}} of noise reduction systems developed by Dolby Laboratories for use in analog magnetic tape recording. The first was Dolby A, a professional broadband noise reduction for recording studios in 1965, but the best-known is Dolby B (introduced 1968), a sliding band system for the consumer market, which helped make high fidelity practical on cassette tapes which used a relatively noisy tape size and speed. It is common on high fidelity <b>stereo</b> <b>tape</b> players and <b>recorders</b> to the present day. Of the noise reduction systems, Dolby A and Dolby SR were developed for professional use. Dolby B, C, and S were designed for the consumer market. Aside from Dolby HX, all the Dolby variants work by companding, or compressing the dynamic range of the sound during recording and expanding it during playback.|$|R

50|$|By {{this time}} the World Record Club was also {{releasing}} pre-recorded spool tapes of their LPs. These were mainly produced in mono half-track at 3¾ ips. The quality of the tapes was very high and the price reasonable. They appealed to enthusiasts who had <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> for making their own recordings, because at that time broadcast sound quality (for off-air recordings) was not very high. These tapes were released with the prefix TT. Although in mono, they are half-track, which gives a very high and gratifying signal to noise ratio. A number of 7½ ips half track <b>stereo</b> <b>tapes</b> were also released under the WRC label, in plain white boxes with a historical sculpture in orange on the front. At least 8 were produced, {{one of which is}} of Scheherezade with Eugene Goossens.|$|R
