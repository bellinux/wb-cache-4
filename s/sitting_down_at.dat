2500|$|The Virtual Boy {{was meant}} to be used <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a table, {{although}} Nintendo said it would release a harness for players to use while standing. One of the unique features of the controller is the extendable power supply that slides onto the back. It houses the six AA batteries required to power the system. This can be substituted with a wall adapter, though a [...] "slide-on" [...] attachment is required for the switchout. Once the slide-on adapter is installed, a power adapter can be attached to provide constant power.|$|E
2500|$|The Spinners â€“ {{also known}} as [...] "The Family" [...] or Church of Unlimited Devotion. These people [...] "used the band's music in worship {{services}} and were a constant presence at shows." [...] They were called [...] "spinners" [...] because of their twirling dance style. John Perry Barlow stated at the 'So Many Roads Conference' that the Dead family hadn't realized {{at the time that}} the Spinners were a Cult. Observers have reported seeing them spinning only to Jerry songs and <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the songs Bobby performed. Allegations of abuse have circulated widely in Deadhead groups.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, a {{demonstration}} outside Faderhusets headquarters {{was surrounded by}} the police. The demonstration was small and {{did not try to}} resist against the police. The police then started to beat the demonstrators, a lot of which were <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the time. One demonstrator later had to be taken to hospital. This sparked a public outcry and deepened the anger the users already felt towards the police. This anger combined with the city councils refusal to negotiate and Faderhusets apparent [...] "crusade" [...] against Ungdomshuset would later lead to the riot in December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Kazuaki Seki, who worked together with Sakanaction in 2010 for their single [...] "Aruku Around". It was uploaded to YouTube {{two days after the}} single's release, on January 25, 2013. The music video features a square shot of Yamaguchi <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a computer, while he listens to headphones. In the remaining area to the left and right of Yamaguchi, a video of a girl, played by talent Ayano Kudo, surrounded by gray-scale dancers can be seen as she goes about her daily life. The scenes of the girl switch between a top-down perspective and a forced perspective where it appears she is being shown from above, but is actually being shown from her side. Occasionally the dancer's black hands can be seen interacting with both the scenes of the girl and Yamaguchi's scene.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins in}} a futuristic {{cafeteria}} with kids, dubbed the [...] "Warriorettes", <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> tables wearing all white while {{the tables and}} walls are gray. Smith then enters the room in colorful attire, including a blue vest, orange pants and a belt with her name on it, while donning rhinestones on her lips and extravagant nail tips. With her braids shaped to form a heart, she carries a boombox filled with paint and plays it while undoing her braids and dipping them into paint inside the stereo, using her hair as a paintbrush and enlivening the atmosphere with colors. Smith then performs dance moves and gets the classroom involved, which is intercut with the singer now donning a colorful mohawk, performing choreography with dancers with blue shirts {{in front of a}} light blue backdrop. She alternates different hairstyles, and then walks down a hallway with her backup dancers, donning a cotton candy-esque hairstyle. She further whips her hair to give color to the lockers and students' attire, before performing extensive choreography with the hallway students. Midway, Smith and her dancers perform a dance routine with music not in the original song. The last scenes involves Smith with puff braids and in a yellow jumpsuit with her backup dancers in a different classroom {{trying to get them to}} dance, which is intercut with previous paint-splashing scenes, as the students, including her brother Jaden, teachers, janitor, elderly lady, and toddler dance. A writer for Rap-Up said that Smith [...] "is in a class of her own in the breakout video for her empowering anthem", calling the video [...] "the birth of more B.S.".|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her glasses on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. She stares at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from her eyes {{to the extent that the}} ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E
