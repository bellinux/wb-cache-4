5|$|Association football, {{the modern}} game, also has {{documented}} early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit {{violence on the}} pitch, making it more <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable</b> for women to play. The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.|$|E

5|$|The ONA {{believe that}} there are {{historical}} precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named Baphomet at the spring equinox and to the Arcturus star in the autumn. However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable</b> within Western nations.|$|E
5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable.</b> Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the role}} {{is subject to}} many stereotypes, and men may have {{difficulties}} accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable</b> by the 2000s. The stay-at-home dad was more regularly portrayed in the media by the 2000s, especially in the United States. However, due to traditional family structures and stereotypic expectations, the stay at home father figure is culturally unacceptable in countries in South Asia such as India.|$|E

Although non-monetary donations are always inefficient, our model predicts donors to favor non-monetary donations when the inefficiency is relatively small and when the recipient is sufficiently rich. The model helps to explain the prevalence of volunteering, the nature of Christmas gifts, and the taboo against paying cash in return for friendly favors.

5|$|Kanhopatra {{was trained}} in dance and song from early {{childhood}} {{so that she}} could join her mother's profession. She became a talented dancer and singer. Her beauty was compared to the apsara (heavenly nymph) Menaka. Shama suggested that Kanhopatra should visit the Badshah (Muslim king), who will adore her beauty and gift her money and jewelry, but Kanhopatra flatly refused. Traditional tales narrate that Shama wanted Kanhopatra to marry, but Kanhopatra longed to marry a man who was more beautiful than her. Scholar Tara Bhavalkar states that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden, as it was not <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable</b> for a daughter of a courtesan to marry.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Demi Moore had {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair exactly one year earlier in the August 1991 edition in Leibovitz's photograph, More Demi Moore. As a groundbreaking work, the photograph of her pregnant pose was an iconic one for Moore, Leibovitz and women in general who now view public representation of pregnancy as <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable.</b> It had a cultural impact by causing numerous celebrities to pose for photographs in advanced pregnancy, which has made pregnancy photos fashionable and created a profitable business for photographers such as Jennifer Loomis. The American Society of Magazine Editors regards it {{as one of the best}} U.S. magazine covers ever, and it is one of Leibovitz' best-known works. Additionally, the photo served as a litmus test when Internet decency standards were first being legislated and adjudicated.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable</b> for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|The website asserts to its {{visitors}} {{that all}} performers engaged in sexual activities {{depicted in the}} videos appear of their own volition and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable</b> to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines {{did not have a}} focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was <b>socially</b> <b>acceptable</b> for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E

The national-socialist leaders, however, insisted that the model’s private zone has to be covered with a sash including a cockade. Furthermore, a silver swastika should adorn the cockade, which Simmerl categorically rejected, using the - <b>socially</b> not <b>acceptable,</b> but historically verified - phrase “there will be no swastika on my balls”.

50|$|The term fallen {{woman was}} used to {{describe}} {{a woman who has}} “lost her innocence”, and fallen from the grace of God. In Victorian Britain especially, the meaning came to be closely associated with the “loss or surrender of a woman's chastity”.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that non-differential misclassification {{will lead to}} a bias toward the null-value. However, using one graphical and one numerical example, we show that in situations where underestimation more than overestimation is the problem, non-differential misclassification may lead to a bias away from the null-value for intermediate categories of exposure variables. We show that a true threshold level for an exposure may, subsequently, appear as a dose-response relationship. Underestimation more than overestimation is likely to occur in studies in which self-reports are used to obtain data on activities which respondents voluntarily engage in and which are <b>socially</b> not <b>acceptable</b> or known to be potentially dangerous. Researchers should be aware that both a shown deleterious effect at a low level of exposure and a dose-response relationship may in fact be spurious and due to underestimation of exposure at higher level...|$|R
30|$|Despite these {{objective}} benefits, {{the views}} on emigrants in home countries {{can be quite}} negative {{especially in terms of}} social perceptions or cultural aspects. For instance, derogative labels such as pochos and pachucos are used for Mexican origin people living in the US to refer to their dissimilation from Mexican culture, assimilation to American culture, and indeed a subculture which is neither Mexican nor American. The legacy of Mexican experience with undesired emigration is reflected in the image of emigrants who abandoned their homeland. Yet, in later periods, negative views came to be replaced by the idea that they support their homeland from abroad, which is especially visible in the official discourse (Martinez-Saldana, 2003). Since this support was primarily in the form of economic contributions, cultural loss was outweighed by the economic gains. Thus, pursuing emigrant-friendly sending state policies has become <b>socially</b> more <b>acceptable</b> over time, in line with an improved image of emigrants.|$|R
