40|$|This study {{suggests}} a mechanical interpretation of Wheeler's {{model of the}} charge. According to the suggested interpretation, the oppositely charged particles are connected through the vortical lines of the current thus create a close contour "input-output" whose parameters determine {{the properties of the}} charge and spin. Depending on the energetic state of the system, the contour can be structurized into the units of the second and third order (photons). It is found that, in the framework of this interpretation, the charge is equivalent to the momentum. The numerical value of the unit charge has also been calculated proceeding from this basis. A system of the relations, connecting the charge to the constants of radiation (the Boltzmann, Wien, and <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> <b>constants,</b> and the fine structure constant) has been obtained: this give a possibility for calculating all these constants through the unit charge...|$|R
40|$|The Swann and Pittman semi-empirical {{relationship}} 1 {{has been}} used as a standard in aerospace industry to predict the effective thermal conductivity of honeycomb core panels. Recent measurements of the effective thermal conductivity of an adhesively bonded titanium honeycomb core panel using three different techniques, two steady-state and one transient radiant step heating method, at four laboratories varied significantly from each other and from the Swann and Pittman predictions. Average differences between the measurements and the predictions varied between 17 and 61 percent in the temperature range of 300 to 500 K. In order to determine the correct values of the effective thermal conductivity and determine which set of the measurements or predictions were most accurate, the combined radiation and conduction heat transfer in the honeycomb core panel was modeled using a finite volume numerical formulation. The transient radiant step heating measurements provided the best agreement with the numerical results. It was found that a modification of the Swann and Pittman semi-empirical relationship which incorporated the facesheets and adhesive layers in the thermal model provided satisfactory results. Finally, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of adhesive thickness and thermal conductivity on the overall heat transfer through the panel.

5000|$|The <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> <b>constant</b> (also Stefan's constant), a {{physical}} constant denoted by the Greek letter σ (sigma), is the {{constant of proportionality}} in the Stefan-Boltzmann law: [...] "the total intensity radiated over all wavelengths increases as the temperature increases", of a black body which {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the thermodynamic temperature. The theory of thermal radiation lays down the theory of quantum mechanics, by using physics to relate to molecular, atomic and sub-atomic levels. Slovenian physicist Josef Stefan formulated the constant in 1879, and it was later derived in 1884 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The equation can also be derived from Planck's Law, by integrating over all wavelengths at a given temperature, which will represent a small flat black body box. [...] "The amount of thermal radiation emitted increases rapidly and the principal frequency of the radiation becomes higher with increasing temperatures". The <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> <b>constant</b> can be used to measure the amount of heat that is emitted by a blackbody, which absorbs all of the radiant energy that hits it, and will emit all the radiant energy. Furthermore, the <b>Stefan-Boltzmann</b> <b>constant</b> allows for temperature (K) to be converted to units for intensity (W m−2), which is power per unit area.|$|E
