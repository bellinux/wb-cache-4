The general requirement {{is that the}} center of the wood configuration be held at 133 °F (56 °C) for 30 min. However, many factors can affect the time required to reach this temperature. This study explored several of these factors, including thickness of boards or cross-sectional dimension of square timbers, wet-bulb depression, and stacking method (solid or stickered). The heating temperature used was 160 °F (71 °C). Heating time increased with increasing board thickness or increasing cross-sectional dimension. It also increased as wet-bulb depression increased because of surface cooling when simultaneous drying occurred at significant wet-bulb depressions. <b>Solid</b> <b>piling</b> increased heating time by a factor ranging from 2 to 10 compared with stickered piling, depending on species and size. This study also looked at developing an analytical method to predict heating time as a function of heating variables. Multiple regression was successful as a prediction tool as a function of wood size, wetbulb depression, and initial wood temperature as long as the wet-bulb temperature in the heating chamber was higher than the target center temperature. The multiple regression results were used to create 99 % upper confidence levels on estimated heating times...|$|E

Four types of piles were studied: steel pipe piles, concrete hollow <b>piles,</b> concrete <b>solid</b> <b>piles</b> and timber piles. A parametric study was undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of pile dimensions, operational frequency, and source distance on the screening effectiveness. The results showed that screening effectiveness of steel pipe piles is generally better than that of <b>solid</b> <b>piles,</b> and that a concrete hollow pile barrier can be ineffective due to its stiffness. The influence of pile length on screening effectiveness is more significant than that of pile spacing and the distance between the vibrating foundation and the pile barrier. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{method of}} {{composite}} stiffness principle and biparameter for laterally loaded pile {{was used in}} this paper to calculate the amplitude of deflection and rotation of pile on the ground when the vibration frequency of dynamic load is equal to or close to the natural frequency of pile, i. e. when the pile is in the state of resonance. And the amplitude of the maximum bending moment and its location was also calculated.

Hydrodynamic model predictions showed good agreement with flume experiments for flow-velocity adaptations both within and in front of a patch of tube-building worms.

40|$|A new formal {{solution}} for the multiple scattering of plane harmonic waves {{by a group of}} arbitrary configuration tubular piles in an elastic total space is derived. Each order of scattering satisfies prescribed boundary conditions at the interface of tubular piles, which is delivered as the sum of incident and scattering waves. The first order performs the scattering wave by each scattered pile and the subsequent orders resulted from the excitation of each pile of first order of scattering from the remaining tubular piles. Advanced scattering orders can be regarded as the same manners. Several series of scattering coefficients are figured out with the aids of addition theorem so that the exact steady-state {{solution for}} the scattered displacement and stress is obtained.

40|$|Granular {{materials}} are collections of particles whose sizes range from microns to meters. They can be packed as a static <b>solid</b> <b>pile</b> {{and can also}} move like fluid or gas. When driven at a sufficiently low rate under a compressive load, the grains flow in a quasi-static regime, in which they creep while maintaining simultaneous contacts with multiple neighbors. ^ We investigate experimentally a quasi-static flow of glass beads packed and sheared in an annular channel. The experiments utilize techniques of refractive-index-matched fluorescent imaging, particle tracking, and simultaneous measurements of volume and boundary shear force. Under long-term shearing, a crystallization transition accompanied by a stepwise decrease of packing volume and shear force can occur. This transition also alters {{the structure of the}} internal velocity field. Boundary conditions can affect the crystalline ordering throughout the entire packing. We find that, even under identical boundary conditions and shearing, the evolution of the packing can lead to non-unique final states. The behavior in response to shearing is influenced by the past history of the packing. ^ Our measurements of the internal velocity fields have a dynamical range of five decades; parameters such as packing thickness and particle size are varied systematically. We demonstrate that crystalline ordering has {{a significant impact on the}} spatial gradient of grain velocity. Changing particle size does not influence the gradient of particle velocity significantly; the velocity decay length does not show a direct scaling with particle size. We also make time-resolved measurements of the internal flows in response to cyclic shearing, and investigate the anomalous motility of individual grains in response to the reversal of boundary motion. Our observations of both steady and transient states illustrate that sufficient packing thickness is needed to reveal bulk properties, such as the shear banding of velocity field, the development of distinct states of internal order, and the anomalous mobility upon shear reversal. In addition, by analyzing the measurements in this and other experimental systems of granular shear flows, we argue that the spatial decay of grain velocity should be geometry-specific; a heuristic model is proposed to explain the shear banding in this geometry. ...|$|R

Productivity varied between 28 and 55 tonnes of fresh chips (or 105 and 194 m 3 of loose chips) per productive work hour, excluding delays. Pure chipping productivity (calculated on chipping time only) was higher and peaked at 70 tonnes of fresh chips or 242 m 3 of loose chips per hour.

Rotating stall is an aerodynamic instability with a typical frequency about half the rotor frequency, acoustically identifiable from the changes in the emitted rotor noise, due to displacement from the stability. This work investigates rotating stall dynamics on an axial fan with fouled blades. The stall is identified with time-resolved pseudo-sound measurements in the end-wall region using DIY sensors. The signals have been analysed in frequency domain, and time domain using a phase space reconstruction technique.

Super-solar metallicities result if <b>solid</b> particles <b>pile</b> {{up as they}} migrate starward {{as a result of}} aerodynamic drag. Previous analyses of aerodynamic drift rates that account for mean flow differences between gas and particles yield particle pile-ups. We improve on these studies not only by accounting for the collective inertia of solids relative to that of gas, but also by including the transport of angular momentum by turbulent stresses within the particle layer. These turbulent stresses are derived in a physically self-consistent manner from the structure of marginally Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulent flows. They are not calculated using the usual plate drag formulae, whose use we explain is inappropriate. Accounting for the relative inertia of solids to gas retards, but does not prevent, particle pile-ups, and generates more spatially extended regions of metal enrichment. Turbulent transport hastens pile-ups. We conclude that particle pile-up is a robust outcome in sufficiently passive protoplanetary disks.

However, pollutant emissions from landfill site can take a number of forms: gaseous emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), airborne particulate matter and leachate. For example, surface water could be polluted by rainwater flowing through <b>solid</b> waste <b>piles.</b> Groundwater could be contaminated by leachate from landfill sites where solid wastes are disposed of. The polluted surface water and groundwater can further affect the drinking water safety; leachate containing hazardous materials can enter soil and further reside in the agricultural products that make our foods poisonous. Secondly, landfills are the first and/or second largest contribution of methane (CH 4) source (e.g. in 2006, the amount of CH 4 released from landfills was 5985 Gg, occupying 23 % of total US anthropogenic methane emissions) (USEPA, 2007). Recently, there is an increasing concern for CH 4, as a major greenhouse gas, while its global warming potential is about 23 on a 100 -year time horizon (Mor et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2010). Thirdly, conflicts exist in the urban land resources due to the rapid population growth and swift economy development. Particularly, for the City of Changchun, the serious scarcity of land near urban centers leads to waste disposed of at landfill more and more noneconomic. Therefore, issues of land resource consumption, surface water/groundwater contamination, and greenhouse gas effect may imply higher environmental penalties than the savings obtained from waste buried.|$|R

Composting, if it is properly carried out, can constitute a viable method for organic {{waste management}} in these countries, due to its low operational cost and the income generation, with low environmental impact. Thus, this paper studies composting as treatment method for the sustainable management and recycling of the municipal solid wastes generated in the Chimborazo Region (Ecuador), and the use of some of the composts obtained as growing media for seedling production. For this, six piles were elaborated using municipal <b>solid</b> wastes: <b>Piles</b> 1, 2 and 3 were prepared using municipal solid wastes from the Riobamba landfill and Piles 4, 5 and 6 were elaborated using source-separated market waste and urban pruning wastes. After composting, composts C 3, C 4 and C 5 (from Piles 3, 4 and 5, respectively) were used as substrates components, mixed with peat in different percentages (0, 25, 50 and 75 %, volume/volume) for seedling production of tomato, courgette and pepper. The composts obtained showed adequate physico-chemical and chemical properties, and a suitable degree of stability and maturity, with absence of phytotoxicity. Regarding their use as growing media, the substrates with 25 % (volume/volume) of the compost C 3, C 4 or C 5 had the best properties for their use as substrate components, only C 3 reducing the seed germination in the courgette crop. In addition, at an economic level, the alternative of peat substitution at 25 % with compost can suppose a reduction of 23 % in the cost of the substrate. In the most conservative scenario, this reduction can be of 21 %, also with an increase of 2. 9 % in the business contribution margin. Therefore, composting can be a suitable method not only for the management and recycling of these waste streams, but also for adding value to them, as components of growing media in seedling productionPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Very limited {{experimental}} {{test data}} {{are available on the}} response of pile groups under the combined action of vertical and lateral loads. In practice, the loads applied on piles are often a combination of both vertical and lateral loads. In addition, piles are often arranged in groups, and the behavior of a pile group may differ substantially from that of a single pile. In this research, tests were performed on model pile groups subjected to both axial and lateral loads in order to evaluate the effects of pile-pile interaction in pile groups and to study the influence of axial loads on the lateral load response of pile groups in sands. The model pile groups tested consisted of 2 × 2, 1 × 2, and 1 × 3 piles. The model piles were driven into sand samples prepared at different densities using a large pluviator. The piles were then connected by a <b>solid</b> steel <b>pile</b> cap placed above ground level. The axial load (base and shaft) for a pile cap displacement of 10 % of the pile diameter was first obtained from axial load tests. For all the model pile groups tested in dense sand, the group efficiency was a little less than unity, while {{in the case of the}} pile groups tested in medium dense and loose sand values of group efficiency higher than one were measured. The results of the lateral pile load tests were presented in terms of the lateral load-pile head displacement response of the model pile groups, the load experienced by the individual piles in the groups, and the bending moment profiles of the individual piles. The lateral load carried by each pile was obtained from strain gauges that were attached to the shaft of the piles 10 cm below their head. The results showed that the leading piles experienced larger loads and bending moments than those experienced by the trailing piles due to the more intense pile-pile interaction. The combined load tests were performed for axial loads of 0 % (pure lateral load), 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the axial loads of the pile groups corresponding to a settlement of 10 % of the model pile diameter. The results of the combined load tests demonstrated that the bending moments and lateral deflections of the pile head increases substantially in the presence of axial loads with antifriction devices which provide minimal restraint to the lateral movement of the test piles. ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{attention}} {{was not long}} in coming round to the charming structure that presently rose before us. The pale yellow front of the chateau, the small scale of which is at first a surprise, rises beyond a consider- able court, {{at the entrance of}} which a massive and detached round tower, with a turret on its brow (a relic of the building that preceded the actual villa), appears to keep guard. This court is not enclosed - or is enclosed, at least, only by the gardens, portions of which are at present in a state of violent reforma- tion. Therefore, though Chenonceaux has no great height, its delicate facade stands up boldly enough. This facade, one of the most finished things in Tou- raine, consists of two stories, surmounted by an attic which, as so often in the buildings of the French Renaissance, is the richest part of the house. The high-pitched roof contains three windows of beautiful design, covered with embroidered caps and flowering into crocketed spires. The window above the door is deeply niched; it opens upon a balcony made {{in the form of a}} double pulpit, - one of the most charm- ing features of the front. Chenonceaux is not large, as I say, but into its delicate compass is packed a great deal of history, - history which differs from that of Amboise and Blois in being of the private and sen- timental kind. The echoes of the place, faint and far as they are to-day, are not political, but personal. Chenonceaux dates, as a residence, from the year 1515, when the shrewd Thomas Bohier, a public functionary who had grown rich in handling the finances of Nor- mandy, and had acquired the estate from a family which, after giving it many feudal lords, had fallen into poverty, erected the present structure on the foundations of an old mill. The design is attributed, with I know not what justice, to Pierre Nepveu, alias Trinqueau, the audacious architect of Chambord. On the death of Bohier the house passed to his son, who, however, was forced, under cruel pressure, to surrender it to the crown, in compensation for a so-called deficit in the accounts of the late superintendent of the trea- sury. Francis I. held the place till his death; but Henry II., on ascending the throne, presented it out of hand to that mature charmer, the admired of two generations, Diana of Poitiers. Diana enjoyed it till the death of her protector; but when this event oc- curred, the widow of the monarch, who had been obliged to submit in silence, for years, to the ascend- ency of a rival, took the most pardonable of all the revenges with which the name of Catherine de' Medici is associated, and turned her out-of-doors. Diana was not in want of refuges, and Catherine went through the form of giving her Chaumont in exchange; but there was only one Chenonceaux. Catherine devoted herself to making the place more completely unique. The feature that renders it sole of its kind is not ap- preciated till you wander round to either side of the house. If a certain springing lightness is the charac- teristic of Chenonceaux, if it bears in every line the aspect of a place of recreation, - a place intended for delicate, chosen pleasures, - nothing can confirm this expression better than the strange, unexpected move- ment with which, from behind, it carries itself across the river. The earlier building stands in the water; it had inherited the foundations of the mill destroyed by Thomas Bohier. The first step, therefore, had been taken upon <b>solid</b> <b>piles</b> of masonry; and the ingenious Catherine - she was a raffinee - simply proceeded to take the others. She continued the piles to the op- posite bank of the Cher, and over them she threw a long, straight gallery of two stories. This part of the chateau, which looks simply like a house built upon a bridge and occupying its entire length, is of course the great curiosity of Chenonceaux. It forms on each floor a charming corridor, which, within, is illuminated from either side by the flickering river-light. The architecture of these galleries, seen from without, is less elegant than that of the main building, but the aspect of the whole thing is delightful. I have spoken of Chenonceaux as a [...] "villa," [...] using the word ad- visedly, for the place is neither a castle nor a palace. It is a very exceptional villa, but it has the villa- quality, - the look of being intended for life in com- mon. This look is not at all contradicted by the wing across the Cher, which only suggests intimate pleasures, as the French say, - walks in pairs, on rainy days; games and dances on autumn nights; together with as much as may be of moonlighted dialogue (or silence) in the course, of evenings more genial still, in the well- marked recesses of windows.|$|R
6000|$|But {{attention}} {{was not long}} in coming round to the charming structure that presently rose before us. The pale yellow front of the château, the small scale of which is at first a surprise, rises beyond a considerable court, {{at the entrance of}} which a massive and detached round tower, with a turret on its brow (a relic of the building that preceded the actual villa), appears to keep guard. This court is not enclosed--or is enclosed at least only by the gardens, portions of which are at present in process of radical readjustment. Therefore, though Chenonceaux has no great height, its delicate façade stands up boldly enough. This façade, one of the most finished things in Touraine, consists of two storeys, surmounted by an attic which, as so often in the buildings of the French Renaissance, is the richest part of the house. The high-pitched roof contains three windows of beautiful design, covered with embroidered caps and flowering into crocketed spires. The window above the door is deeply niched; it opens upon a balcony made {{in the form of a}} double pulpit--one of the most charming features of the front. Chenonceaux is not large, as I say, but into its delicate compass is packed a great deal of history--history which differs from that of Amboise and Blois in being of the private and sentimental kind. The echoes of the place, faint and far as they are to-day, are not political, but personal. Chenonceaux dates, as a residence, from the year 1515, when the shrewd Thomas Bohier, a public functionary who had grown rich in handling the finances of Normandy and had acquired the estate from a family which, after giving it many feudal lords, had fallen into poverty, erected the present structure on the foundations of an old mill. The design is attributed, with I know not what justice, to Pierre Nepveu, alias Trinqueau, the audacious architect of Chambord. On the death of Bohier the house passed to his son, who, however, was forced, under cruel pressure, to surrender it to the Crown in compensation for a so-called deficit in the official accounts of this rash parent and predecessor. Francis I. held the place till his death; but Henry II., on ascending the throne, presented it out of hand to that mature charmer, the admired of two generations, Diana of Poitiers. Diana enjoyed it till the death of her protector; but when this event occurred the widow of the monarch, who had been obliged to submit in silence, for years, to the ascendency of a rival, took the most pardonable of all the revenges with which the name of Catherine de'Medici is associated and turned her out of doors. Diana was not in want of refuges, Catherine went through the form of giving her Chaumont in exchange; but there was only one Chenonceaux. Catherine devoted herself to making the place more completely unique. The feature that renders it sole of its kind is not appreciated till you wander round to either side of the house. If a certain springing lightness is the characteristic of Chenonceaux, if it bears in every line the aspect of a place of recreation--a place intended for delicate, chosen pleasures--nothing can confirm this expression better than the strange, unexpected movement with which, from behind, it carries itself across the river. The earlier building stands in the water; it had inherited the foundations of the mill destroyed by Thomas Bohier. The first step therefore had been taken upon <b>solid</b> <b>piles</b> of masonry; and the ingenious Catherine--she was a raffinée--simply proceeded to take the others. She continued the piles to the opposite bank of the Cher, and over them she threw a long, straight gallery of two tiers. This part of the château, which mainly resembles a house built upon a bridge and occupying its entire length, is of course the great curiosity of Chenonceaux. It forms on each floor a charming corridor, which, within, is illuminated from either side by the flickering river-light. The architecture of these galleries, seen from without, is less elegant than that of the main building, but the aspect of the whole thing is delightful. I have spoken of Chenonceaux as a [...] "villa," [...] using the word advisedly, for the place is neither a castle nor a palace.

40|$|Abstract: This article investigates {{different}} types of dynamic influences on the steel <b>pile</b> dipped into <b>solid</b> water-resisting soil as the excavation fencing is constructed. In order to solve this task, an experiment is carried out on a construction site, with dipping a pile, with the following types of dynamic influences: driving in with a diesel, mechanical and hydraulic drop hammers (with the frequency, respectively, 50; 15 - 20; 100 hits per minute); by the method of vibrational immersion with the frequency of oscillation 1440 per minute and {{with the use of}} a vibrational pile driver with the frequency of 420 hits per minute. Vibrational-percussive pile driving was done with a free-falling springless vibrational pile driver weighing 4. 7 - 6. 7 tons and with the relation to the driving force from 0. 25 to 0. 36. Using these methods, 4 - 6 piles of flat profile and u-shape, with the length of 8 - 11 m were driven into the cushion. As a result of experiments aimed at finding the criterion of the maximum speed and depth of pile driving without significant deformation, the efficiency was estimated for percussive and vibrational-percussive methods with increased frequency of hits and a small height of dropping the hammer. Such result can be explained by the changing character or resistance in the solid soil against the pile entering it. With a higher frequency, fatigue loading of the soil takes place under the tip of the driven pile, which, in its turn, crushes the monolith body of the soil and decreases the point resistance against the pile.

40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. <b>Solid</b> velvet <b>pile</b> warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R
30|$|Piles are {{commonly}} used to transfer vertical forces, arising primarily from super structure. But for some structures, the primary function of pile is to transfer the lateral loads to. But in many places in addition with the vertical forces, piles are also transferring the lateral forces due to heavy wind, earthquakes, slope failure, and lateral spread induced by liquefaction. So the combined action of vertical and horizontal ground loads can occur in many situations for a pile. So the study on the behaviour of pile with lateral and combined loading is an important. Begum [1] conducted an experimental study of laterally loaded pile on sloped surface by varied the slope angles. This experimental study {{is also used to}} develop a graphical non dimensional relationship between the lateral load and maximum bending in a pile. Begum and Muthukkumaran [2] conducted an experimental study of laterally loaded pile on sloped surface by varied the slope angle (zero slope, 1 : 1.5 and 1 : 2), L/D ratio (25, 30 and 35) and the relative densities of the soil (30, 45 and 70  %). Broms [3] developed solutions for the ultimate lateral resistance of a Pile assuming the distribution of lateral soil pressure and considering static of the problem and also two modes of failure and yielding of the soil {{along the length of the}} Pile were considered. Abbas et. al. [4] used to model a single Pile in layered soil by using PLAXIS- 3 D (FEM software) and compared the lateral load carrying capacity between circular Pile and square Pile. In addition, an effect of slenderness ratio L/B is carried out and also discussed about the negative base deflection of Pile. Judi et al. [5] presented a series of three dimensional numerical analysis performed by FLAC 3 D finite difference program on <b>solid</b> concrete <b>piles</b> with circular section in clayey soils under combination of axial and lateral loading. Karthigeyan et al. [6] used 3 -dimensional finite element program GEOFEM 3 D, to analyse the combined loading on pile in both sand and clayey soil. Lee et al. [7] presented a simplified approach for the study of a row of piles used for slope stabilization in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous soil profiles. Begum and Muthukkumaran [8] studied the behaviour of a pile due to the lateral load on sloped surface and for this study pile is considered at crest of the sloped surface. So in the field of analysis of pile due to combined load was not well explored. So in this paper, the behaviour of pile due to combined load is focussed on both and sloped grounds (1 : 1.5, 1 : 2 and 1 : 2.5). Muthukkumaran et al. [9] conducted the experimental study on aluminium pile in the sloped sandy soil surface with varying density. Muthukkumaran et al. [10] conducted the experimented study on behaviour of pile due to the varying surcharge load on sloped surface and this study was made in soil have different relative densities (30, 45 and 70  %). Poulos [11] modeled pile-soil interactions using elastic continuum methods that consider the soil to act as a 3 -D, linearly elastic, homogeneous, isotropic, semi-infinite medium. Used Mindlin’s equations to develop factors that account for additional displacements (αp) and rotations (αθ) caused by interactions from adjacent piles. Poulos and Davies [12] modified the elastic solution to account for nonlinearity using yield factors. The modulus of subgrade reaction approach was extended to account for the soil nonlinearity.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to provide a}} {{comprehensive}} evaluation of the fire protection and life safety design of a warehouse building that serves a large construction project. The results and conclusions from this evaluation are documented herein and supported by analysis when necessary. The gross floor area per story of the construction warehouse is 39, 000 ft 2. This building is used as a warehousing facility in support of a large construction project. Rack storage of Group A plastics is permitted in this facility to a height of 20 ft. beneath a 24 ft. ceiling on the main floor. Shelf and <b>solid</b> <b>pile</b> storage of Group A plastics is permitted {{on the second floor of}} this facility to a height of 10 ft. It is also used for office space in large open and enclosed areas for the operations and maintenance personnel. It is classified as a mixed occupancy used for moderate storage (S- 1) and business (B) purposes. The occupant load calculated for this building is 466 occupants. A walled in mezzanine area, used for business (office) purposes, above the main floor office area is present in this building. The gross floor area of the main floor office and mezzanine office areas is 4, 100 ft 2 each. The structure was constructed in 2002 in accordance with the Uniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, and is a Type II-N structure. The building is evaluated as a Type II-B structure according to the International Building Code, 2009 Edition. The building is protected throughout by an automatic fire sprinkler system per NFPA 13, 1999 Edition, and a fire alarm system per NFPA 72, 2002 Edition. Life safety for this building is provided according to NFPA 101, 1997 Edition. The installed fire protection and life safety (egress) systems in this facility are evaluated to NFPA 13, 2010 Edition, NFPA 72, 2010 Edition, and NFPA 101, 2012 Edition. Main storage (rack storage) floor is protected by an automatic, supervised, Early Suppression Fast Response (ESFR) fire sprinkler system. The second floor is protected by a fire sprinkler system for protection of storage using Control Mode Density / Area (CMDA) design methods. The balance of protected areas, including office areas, loading dock, and tool room areas, are protected as an Ordinary Hazard Group 2 classification. The overall assessment concludes that the automatic fire sprinkler systems installed in this building meet NFPA standards for the hazard that requires protection. Any design differences noted between the 1999 Edition and 2010 Edition of NFPA 13 will be discussed with the building owner. The entire facility is monitored and protected by an automatic fire alarm system that serves as a protected premises fire alarm system and a building fire alarm system. For performance based analysis purposes, notification of building occupants is assumed to occur upon audible or visual signals from the building fire alarm system. Initiating devices include manual pull stations at each exit. Smoke detectors (for elevator recall) are located near each elevator door, in the elevator machinery room and at the top of the elevator hoist way. Duct smoke detectors are placed to shutdown air handling units upon detection of smoke in air supply plenums. One fixed temperature detector is installed at the top of the elevator hoist way, and another is installed in the elevator machinery room, to support the elevator shunt trip function. The fire alarm system automatically reports fire alarm, supervisory, and system trouble signals to the fire department via a high frequency radio transmitter. Overall, the construction warehouse building is in compliance with NFPA 72, 2010 Edition. Any minor deficiencies noted will be discussed with the building owner. Four (4) exits are provided on the main floor of the warehouse that discharge directly outdoors. Additionally, four (4) exterior stairwells, each accessible from both the main and second floor of this facility, are provided. The west stairwell provides direct access to an exit from the walled in mezzanine office level. Each stairwell is separated from the building by 2 hour fire-resistive construction and each stairwell discharges outdoors at grade level. Storage areas within this building are characterized as large, open areas. The maximum travel distance to any exit (or protected exit stairwell enclosure) is less than 300 ft. There is one dead end corridor in the warehouse that extends 49 ft. Common path of travel is limited to the distance required to traverse a typical office and no common path of travel exceeds the 100 ft. limitation for an S- 1 or B classified occupancy. The construction warehouse meets prescriptive NFPA 101, 2012 Edition, requirements for egress. This evaluation documents a performance based life safety analysis. Two (2) fire scenarios are considered: · 1) A rack storage fire on the main floor involving unexpanded polystyrene cups contained in cardboard cartons, placed in a 4 by 4 by 4 fuel array (stacked four (4) tiers high). · 2) An office workstation fire on the mezzanine level involving a typical office cubicle Criteria for the performance based analyses was taken from NFPA 101, 2012 Edition, Section 5. 2. 2 : Performance Criterion, 2 ̆ 2 Any occupant who is not intimate with ignition shall not be exposed to instantaneous or cumulative untenable conditions. 2 ̆ 2 This performance criterion is met when the calculated available safe egress time (ASET) exceeds the calculated required safe egress time (RSET) (i. e., ASET 3 ̆e RSET). The calculation of RSET assumes that: · 1) Detection time is dependent on the specific fire scenario, but that detection occurs upon first sprinkler or smoke detector actuation (detection by human senses is not assumed) · 2) Notification time is 30 seconds based on fire alarm system electronic processing time · 3) Pre-movement time is assumed to be 60 seconds for some occupants · 4) Evacuation time is determined based on Pathfinder egress modeling software in STEERING mode which is shown to be comparable to independent hand calculations for personnel on the second floor to enter the protective enclosure provided by the west stairwell (the west stairwell is the most limiting egress path) – is calculated to be 158 seconds. Tenability limits are established according to external references. For this analysis, tenability limits for visibility, temperature, and carbon monoxide dose are established and documented by this report. A 10 m visibility limit is established for large open areas within this building such as storage areas. For office areas, where occupants are familiar with the location of exits and large travel distances are not required, the visibility limit is established at 3 m. A 100 °C temperature limit is established and carbon monoxide dose, measured in terms of Fractional Effective Dose (FED) of 0. 3 is also established. The visibility and temperature limits are evaluated at an elevation of 6 ft. (1. 82 m) above walking surfaces. The FED is calculated and increases with time and concentration of carbon monoxide by the fire. The concentration of carbon monoxide is determined based on a ratio of the mass of carbon monoxide released into the affected building volume divided by the mass of all gases and products of combustion in the same volume. Appropriate factors must be applied in this calculation to ensure that the parts per million of carbon monoxide is correctly input into the FED equation. Soot and carbon monoxide yields are input into Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and are calculated in proportion to the mass of each component that makes up the fuel array. Both fire scenarios are modeled in FDS with the assumption that fire severity is limited to the heat release rate at the time of sprinkler activation. Sprinkler activation time is determined using detector activation (DETACT) analysis. Growth of the main floor rack storage fire is assumed to follow a “t-cubed” fire growth curve which has been observed in actual fire tests for the initial growth period of this type of fire. This growth is modeled using a ramp function and applying appropriate factors at appropriate times, within FDS. Sixteen (16) burners are modeled representing each carton in the fuel storage array. The burner for each successive tier of cartons turned “on” at 0, 30, 60 and 90 seconds, respectively, to simulate the spread of fire within the rack fuel array. DETACT analysis predicts ESFR sprinkler actuation for the rack storage fire scenario 60 seconds following ignition. In this scenario, the fire is controlled at 2, 592 kW, and the top tier of cartons does not ignite. The fire continues to burn at this rate deep within the fuel array. The performance based aspects of the main storage floor rack storage fire, with detection time of 60 seconds, provides an RSET value of 308 seconds. FDS output shows that the time to reach the 10 m visibility limit is 400 seconds. For the rack storage fire scenario, ASET (400 seconds) 3 ̆e RSET (308 seconds), and this report has determined that the building would meet performance based life safety design criteria for this fire scenario. Additionally, this report concludes that the radiant heat from this fire does not, itself, cause the spread of fire to adjacent racks of storage located 8 ft. away, and that maximum ceiling temperature of does not exceed 180 °C (356 °F). The case where sprinklers fail to actuate is also evaluated. In this case the fire is allowed to grow to 36, 500 kW in 150 seconds. As a result, this uncontrolled fire is predicted to cause extreme danger to building occupants due to hampered egress, spread to adjacent racks and commodities, and cause significant structural damage to the second floor (maximum temperature at the ceiling is predicted by FDS to reach 877 °C (1, 611 °F)). Sprinklers in the warehouse are deemed to be essential for safe performance based egress and protection of property. The mezzanine workstation fire scenario follows a “t-squared” fire growth curve. If left unchecked this fire would grow to 6, 730 kW in 530 seconds. Sprinkler actuation, predicted to occur 170 seconds following ignition is assumed to control the fire at 694 kW. The smoke detector located on the ceiling near the elevator door is predicted to detect this fire in 54 seconds by hand calculations. For comparison, FDS predicts heat detector activation 62 seconds into the fire scenario. Detection time is assumed to be 54 seconds. The calculated value of RSET for the workstation fire is 302 seconds. FDS output shows that the time to reach the 3 m visibility limit on the mezzanine is 130 seconds. In this case, ASET (130 seconds) 3 ̆c RSET (302 seconds), leaving a deficit of 172 seconds. This report has determined that the building does not meet performance based life safety design criteria for a fire involving a workstation on the mezzanine office level. This report evaluates several alternatives for improving performance based egress design: · 1) Replace standard response sprinklers with quick response sprinklers in the mezzanine area. The corresponding RSET reduction is 30 seconds. This alternative does make up for the 172 deficit between ASET and RSET. · 2) Remove the suspended ceiling, relocate and replace standard response sprinklers with quick response sprinklers. This alternative provides an 80 second increase in ASET and has no effect on RSET. This alternative does make up for the 172 deficit between ASET and RSET. · 3) Add an additional protected exterior stairwell on the north side of the mezzanine. This alternative improves the time for all building occupants to exit the building and reduces RSET by 42 seconds. This alternative does make up for the 172 deficit between ASET and RSET. · 4) Install a mechanical smoke control system. The revised FDS model shows that the value of ASET may be increased indefinitely. This is a costly alternative. · 5) Remove the mezzanine walls so that this area will be open to the main storage floor below. The rack storage fire scenario would become the bounding scenario but would need to be revised to account for exposure to personnel on the mezzanine. The additional 65 mezzanine occupants would be almost immediately susceptible to tenability limits. This alternative, which would solve the mezzanine workstation fire performance based life safety design issues, is expected to fail the main floor rack storage fire scenario performance based design criteria. · 6) Do nothing, control the number of occupants on the mezzanine floor, or control combustible loading. The mezzanine currently meets prescriptive egress criteria of NFPA 101, 2012 Edition. This alternative is subject to approval of the Authority Having Jurisdiction. Controlling the number of mezzanine occupants is expected to improve egress time but may not make up the 172 second deficit. Control of combustible (workstation) material is not feasible...|$|R
