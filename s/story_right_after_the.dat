5000|$|The film {{opened to}} {{predominantly}} positive reviews on 18 April 2014. Sify wrote, [...] "Shree {{has come out}} with a thriller comedy that seldom loses its grip. Credible performances from its leads and a nail-biting screenplay makes it an engaging trip. Damaal Dumeel is an enjoyable and racy fun ride". M Suganth of The Times of India, giving the film 3 stars out of 5, termed the film [...] "a worthy attempt" [...] and further wrote, [...] "Right in the opening shot sic we realize {{that we are in the}} hands of a competent filmmaker and Shree keeps things moving at a brisk pace till the end. Even the romantic track is used only in small doses and the director doesn't allow a possible melancholic moment to linger". IANS also gave 3 stars out of 5 and called it [...] "a reasonably good dark comedy that you seldom see from an industry that has an urge for predominantly making masala entertainers". Behindwoods gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Unlike the usual commercial masala that we get to watch every second Friday, Damaal Dumeel slips into the crux of the <b>story</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> public service advertisement on smoking is played and clutches onto it right till the end. The movie has an interesting combination of dark comedy and titillation and the actions of the characters that appear in the film are quite unpredictable".|$|E

5000|$|The {{first chapter}} of this <b>story</b> begins <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> funeral of Israel Haydon’s wife of 40 years, Martha Haydon. He is in the barn on their farm {{extremely}} depressed. He thinks to himself {{that she was so}} much better than he in social situations and would have known how to handle the funeral meal. He decides to go into the main house where his sister and sister in law are waiting for him. He steps inside the house where the two women have cleaned and prepared a dinner for him. Israel does not have much appetite and discusses how he wishes his son and wife had come over. Abby and Stevens talk amongst themselves about the events of the evening. The next chapter begins <b>the</b> morning <b>after</b> <b>the</b> funeral. Israel and his son go on a walk, discussing everyday events. We get a short description of how Israel found out from the doctor that his wife was extremely ill and that she would not get better. We also learn that both him and his wife had inherited a small amount of money from a distant relative. William is a much stronger man than his father and it shows. Israel is known for being extremely elegant, even while working on the farm. William offers to have his father stay with him in his home, but Israel is stubborn and refuses the help. The two share an awkward moment and William drives away. As soon as he leaves, Israel breaks down in tears for his lost wife. His two sisters watch from inside the house and comment on how sad he has been. They discuss how they need to go through the late Martha’s clothing, and decide to ask William for help, as him and his mother were so close. We learn that William was quite talented at sewing and knitting as a child. Some time passes and Israel returns to his regular life. His sister leaves- and Israel hires a summer hand for help. The two have quite a strained relationship as Israel finds the boy to be lazy but it works out. [...] The next chapter of this story begins two months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> passing of Martha Haydon. William and his son are sitting on the porch of his house discussing the lack of order in his house. William says that he feels his father is angry at him for something and wishes to apologize. Israel, however, says it is simply that he is still grieving his wife. He says that he cannot maintain the state of the house the way his wife used to. William invites his father over for dinner and to see Maria Durrant, a woman that could possibly work for him as a housekeeper. Israel met her a while ago when William’s wife was sick and thinks {{she is one of the}} most able women he has ever met. When they meet, they immediately take to each other. The next morning Maria ignores Israel’s request to begin work in the afternoon, and decides to start early. She leaves William’s house and arrives at Israel’s farm. There she notices the terrible state of the garden and decides to bring it back to the state in which it was when Martha tended to it- Israel told her earlier in the evening that he wanted to do this himself but was having trouble. The fourth chapter of this book takes place entirely in Mr. Haydon’s kitchen. Martha Durrant is mending some clothing, when a visitor surprises her. The visitor is an old acquaintance of both Maria and Israel by the name of Polly Norris. She is an extremely irritating woman who is not completely sane of mind. She frequently visits people to ask for help. The two gossip a while. Polly informs Maria that there is a rumor going around that she has been at the farm for too long. People are beginning to think that she wants to marry Mr. Haydon. Polly then quickly changes the subject as she realizes that Maria is upset. She asks Maria for an old work robe to use and Maria quickly leaves the room. Their visit ends shortly after and Maria begins to cry uncontrollably. She feels that this is the first time that she has been happy in a long while. She thinks that she now has to leave the farm and go back to her brother’s house. She works extremely hard in his hotel- tending for guests and her cruel sister-in-law, and does not receive any thanks. Israel comes inside the house and Maria tells him that she needs to leave. He refuses and surprisingly tells her that he has been talking to William and they have decided that he should marry Maria, if she will accept him. She accepts his proposal without saying anything. The final chapter of this story takes place after church one Sunday. Maria and Israel are now married. Maria thinks to herself how lucky she is that she has such a loving husband. The two begin to discuss the late Martha. Maria is extremely kind when discussing her. She continually complements her ‘predecessor’ and so does Israel. Maria suggests that they should invite one of Martha’s oldest friends to the house for tea, as Martha used to. When the guest arrives a day later, Israel overhears the two ladies talking about how sad he was when Martha died. Maria comments that she is so lucky to have met him, but sad that she is not as significant as Martha. The guest comments that she has never seen Israel so happy since he was a young man. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> guest leaves Israel comes inside and tells Martha that he is so happy to have met her, that she is a “good wife”- replacing Martha with Maria once and for all.|$|R
