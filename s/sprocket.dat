5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive <b>sprocket</b> had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
5|$|To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, with {{an image}} area of 2 × 2½ inches, four times that of Edison's 35mm format. Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a <b>sprocket</b> hole {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. Sherlock Holmes Baffled ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive <b>sprocket</b> had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sprockets</b> {{are used}} in the {{conveyor}} system to drive the chain. Conveyor <b>sprockets</b> typically have an odd number of teeth although <b>sprockets</b> with an even number have become more prevalent over the last thirty years. Most <b>sprockets</b> are made from fabricated steel and are parallel or taper keyed to a through shaft. Conveyor <b>sprockets</b> are also available in double pitch and shear pin varieties. Double pitch <b>sprockets</b> wear evenly and offer a longer service life than standard <b>sprockets.</b> Shear pin <b>sprockets</b> break when overloaded, stopping the conveyor and saving considerable expense and downtime.|$|R
5000|$|One method, used by Shimano, {{is to use}} {{chain tension}} to pivot the cage. This has the {{advantage}} of working with most sets of <b>sprockets,</b> if the chain has the proper length. A disadvantage is that rapid shifts from small <b>sprockets</b> to large over multiple <b>sprockets</b> at once can cause the cage to strike the <b>sprockets</b> before the chain moves onto the larger <b>sprockets</b> and pivots the cage as necessary.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sprockets</b> in a {{cassette}} are usually {{held together by}} three small bolts or rivets for ease of installation. These keep the <b>sprockets</b> and spacers in the correct order and position when they are removed from the freehub body. When the <b>sprockets</b> {{need to be replaced}} due to wear or the user wishes to change gear ratios available, only the <b>sprockets</b> are replaced, not the ratchet mechanism. Cassettes also allow the use of <b>sprockets</b> with fewer teeth, as in micro drive systems.|$|R
5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine – electric generator – electric motor – drive <b>sprocket.</b> This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E
25|$|Racing cyclists {{often have}} gears {{with a small}} {{relative}} difference of around 7% to 10%; this allows fine adjustment of gear ratios to suit the conditions and maintain a consistent pedalling speed. Mountain bikes and hybrid bikes often have gears with a moderate relative difference of around 15%; this allows for a much larger gear range while having an acceptable step between gears. 3-speed hub gears may have a relative difference of some 33% to 37%; such big steps require a very substantial change in pedalling speed and often feel excessive. A step of 7% corresponds to a 1-tooth change from a 14-tooth <b>sprocket</b> to a 15-tooth <b>sprocket,</b> while a step of 15% corresponds to a 2-tooth change from a 13-tooth <b>sprocket</b> to a 15-tooth <b>sprocket.</b>|$|E
25|$|To avoid violating Edison’s {{motion picture}} patents, Biograph cameras from 1895-1902 used a large-format film, {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, {{with an image}} area of 2×2½ inches, four times that of Edison’s 35mm format. The camera used friction feed instead of Edison’s <b>sprocket</b> feed to guide the film to the aperture. The camera itself punched a <b>sprocket</b> hole {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second.|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} two methods {{employed}} by rear derailleurs to maintain the appropriate gap between the upper jockey wheel and the rear <b>sprockets</b> as the derailleur moves between the large <b>sprockets</b> and the small <b>sprockets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Now, {{consider}} {{the small and}} large front <b>sprockets</b> which have 28 and 52 teeth respectively, and {{consider the}} small and large rear <b>sprockets</b> which have 16 and 32 teeth each. Using these numbers we can compute the following speed ratios between {{the front and rear}} <b>sprockets</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{chain gear}} <b>sprockets</b> wear {{faster than the}} {{ratcheting}} mechanism. Replacing individual <b>sprockets</b> on a freehub cassette is easy compared to that on some freewheels.|$|R

25|$|Derailleur type {{mechanisms}} {{of a typical}} mid-range product (of the sort used by serious amateurs) achieve between 88% and 99% mechanical efficiency at 100W. In derailleur mechanisms the highest efficiency is achieved by the larger sprockets. Efficiency generally decreases with smaller <b>sprocket</b> and chainring sizes.|$|E
25|$|The army's first {{lineage of}} tanks had {{evolved from the}} M1 Combat Car and progressed to the M2 Light Tank, M2 Medium Tank, M3 Lee, and finally the M4 Sherman; these tanks all shared the common traits of using {{rear-mounted}} Continental air-cooled radial aircraft engines and a front <b>sprocket</b> drive. The rear engine-front <b>sprocket</b> drive layout required a driveshaft to pass underneath the turret, which increased the overall height of the tank, a characteristic shared with German tanks of World War II that also used this layout. In addition, the large diameter of the radial engines in the M4 line of tanks added further to the hull height. These mechanical features accounted for the high silhouette and large side sponsons that were characteristic of the M4 lineage.|$|E

2500|$|To achieve such {{consistent}} relative differences {{the absolute}} gear ratios {{should be in}} logarithmic progression; most off-the-shelf cogsets do this with small absolute differences between the smaller <b>sprockets</b> and increasingly larger absolute differences as the <b>sprockets</b> get larger. [...] Because <b>sprockets</b> must have a (relatively small) whole number of teeth {{it is impossible to}} achieve a perfect progression; for example the seven derailleur <b>sprockets</b> 14-16-18-21-24-28-32 have an average step size of around 15% but with actual steps varying between 12.5% and 16.7%. The epicyclic gears used within hub gears have more scope for varying the number of teeth than do derailleur <b>sprockets,</b> so {{it may be possible to}} get much closer to the ideal of consistent relative differences, e.g. the Rohloff Speedhub offers 14 speeds with an average relative difference of 13.6% and individual variations of around 0.1%.|$|R
25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to a}} crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear <b>sprocket(s)</b> (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 <b>sprockets,</b> hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple <b>sprockets</b> (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|R
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} cause of the accident was that the co-pilot's aileron controls had jammed due to a chain slipping off its <b>sprocket.</b> The difficulty of setting and inspecting the chains in the dual control columns was cited as a contributory factor in the accident.|$|E
25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive <b>sprocket.</b> They have just a single chainring and a single rear <b>sprocket,</b> almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E
25|$|A ghost or {{floating}} chainring is {{an additional}} chainring in the drive train between the driving chainring and <b>sprocket.</b> The top of the chain moves it forward {{at the same speed}} that the bottom of the chain moves it backwards, giving the appearance that it is floating in the chain.|$|E

In October 2006, Rue Morgue magazine included Throat <b>Sprockets</b> on their list of 50 essential alternative horror novels. Ellen Datlow selected it as the best first horror novel of 1994, describing Throat <b>Sprockets</b> as [...] "an unnerving, sophisticated, and passionate novel[...] [...] [...] Suspenseful and terrifying, with some beautiful writing." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of bicycle chains, it is {{possible}} to modify the overall gear ratio of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the <b>sprockets</b> {{on each side of the}} chain. This is the basis of derailleur gears. A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized driving <b>sprockets</b> and up to 11 (as of 2014) different-sized driven <b>sprockets,</b> allows up to 33 different gear ratios. The resulting lower gear ratios make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher gear ratios make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills. In a similar way, manually changing the <b>sprockets</b> on a motorcycle can change the characteristics of acceleration and top speed by modifying the final drive gear ratio.|$|R
25|$|Front/rear gear {{measurement}} uses two numbers (e.g. 53/19) {{where the}} first is the number of teeth in the front chainring and the second is the number of teeth in the rear <b>sprocket.</b> Without doing some arithmetic, it is not immediately obvious that 53/19 and 39/14 represent effectively the same gear ratio.|$|E
