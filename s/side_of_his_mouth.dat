500|$|Flynn has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from film critics. Kirk Baird of The Blade [...] described the character as irresistible, while Columbus Alives Brad Keefe called him [...] "loveable". Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as [...] "a hero invested with enough colour to liven up {{what could have}} been a monochromatic role". Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is [...] "better than a prince". Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes, writing, [...] "If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment—one more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals, from its early nameless princes ... to here, a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time." [...] Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that [...] "Flynn talks in a laid-back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable". Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although [...] "Male characters sometimes get shortchanged in Disney movies ... Flynn is one of their better efforts to add to Aladdin, Mowgli and the Beast." [...] Virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with Flynn. Anthony Quinn of The Independent described the character as a [...] "fop", while Tom Huddleston of Time Out called him [...] "bland". The Scotsman wrote, [...] "it's a shame the prominence of Rapunzel's wayward love interest ... needlessly distracts from" [...] the film.|date = January 27, 2015|accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = The Scotsman|publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd|last = |first = }} Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Flynn [...] "a second-rate Nickelodeon TV punk". Jeff Meyers of the Metro Times dismissed Flynn as not [...] "all that heroic". The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli quipped that Flynn's [...] "sensitive chin fur, and the way he talks out of the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> [...] makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam". The Los Angeles TimesKenneth Turan believes that the film's [...] "initial shakiness" [...] is [...] "amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of" [...] Flynn. Accusing the character of [...] "lacking both superficial and emotional individuality", Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as [...] "rather obnoxious", Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as [...] "vanilla". Flynn's narration has also been widely panned. Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referred to it as [...] "flippant". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as [...] "annoyingly smart-alecky". Justin Chang of Variety described the character's opening monologue as [...] "clunky". William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to [...] "a modern-day Chris Evans/Pine type, and his glib narration [...] combined with a hasty prologue [...] almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys' AND girls' club". However, Goss relented, [...] "The voice-over tapers off, though, and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Faith No More {{lead singer}} Mike Patton also showed he was {{obviously}} miming a performance by sticking his tongue out of the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> during close-up shots. Also, their 1997 performance of [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] on the show featured Robin Guy (of the band Sack Trick) on drums instead of their actual drummer. He apparently wore a [...] "Puffy" [...] mask as a joke in reference to Faith No More's actual drummer, Mike [...] "Puffy" [...] Bordin. Mike Patton can be seen giving Guy the finger during the performance, supposedly because the mask fell off (or was taken off on purpose) {{as soon as the}} performance started.|$|E

"Go to the County Ground on any {{day in the}} cricket season – or, {{for that}} matter, on a good many days outside it – and somewhere between the indoor school and the {{pavilion}} {{you are likely to}} meet a comfortable, well-fed-looking man going in one direction when he obviously wants to go in several.

2500|$|According to {{the post}} mortem report, {{the body of the}} man was found naked on Rosses Point beach with his clothes {{scattered}} along the shore, with no wallet, money or form of identification. The Sligo medical examiner deemed the cause of death to be drowning and found no signs of foul play that would give reason to believe the man's death was a homicide. The man's teeth were in good condition and showed signs of frequent dental work in his life. He had bridging, root canals, crowns and had a full gold tooth on the upper back right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and a small silver filling along the gum of a tooth {{on the left side of}} the lower jaw.|$|E

[...] He never married.|$|R
50|$|Lockheed’s {{appearance}} and character, as depicted {{by the various}} artists who illustrated him, as well as writer Chris Claremont, evolved from the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first appearance to his later appearances in Excalibur. When he first appeared as drawn by Paul Smith, he was largely quadrupedal, with red eyes lacking any pupils or irises, a small triangular head about half a foot long, teeth protruding outward from his upper and lower jaws and his intelligence appeared comparable {{with that of a}} dog. By the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appearances in Excalibur as drawn by Alan Davis, he had been anthropomorphized considerably. His eyes were now human-like, with white corneas and black irises, though at times they were colored yellow and red or orange and he was capable of more human-like facial expressions and gestures, including standing on his hind legs. His teeth no longer stuck out the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>his</b> head was more oblong and his jaw now much longer.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{election}} of 1956, Morrison lost to Earl Long. The acerbic Long ridiculed Morrison as a [...] "city slicker" [...] {{out of touch with}} residents of small towns and rural areas. Long laughed at his opponent's unusual first name deLesseps: [...] "Ole De la Soups is the only man that can talk out <b>of</b> both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> whistle, and strut all at once." [...] Trailing both Long and Morrison in the 1956 primary were Fred Preaus of Farmerville, the choice of outgoing Governor Robert Kennon; Francis Grevemberg, the former state police superintendent; and James M. McLemore, the Alexandria auction-barn owner who ran his second consecutive unsuccessful race on a strictly segregationist platform.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right!" [...] said Paul, {{his eyes}} upon the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>mouth,</b> where in another instant his fist would have hit. He ached for that stroke. But {{he heard a}} faint moan from behind. His mother was deadly pale and dark at the mouth. Morel was dancing up to deliver another blow.|$|R
5000|$|Long's {{campaign}} promises included spending increases to fund health, education, {{and other social}} programs. He made these promises on an extensive tour of the state, stopping in nearly every town to deliver theatrical speeches mocking his opponents. The acerbic Long attacked Morrison with particular enthusiasm, mocking his toupee and fancy suits and calling him [...] "as slick as a peeled onion", {{out of touch with}} residents of small towns and rural areas. Long also mocked his unusual first name: [...] "Ole De la Soups is the only man that can talk out <b>of</b> both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> whistle, and strut all at once." [...] In addition to his usual base, Long also won support from corrupt rural sheriffs who were angry at their loss of gambling revenues after Kennon's reforms and Grevemberg's raids.|$|R
60|$|He now sat up, drew {{forth the}} {{precious}} and much soiled epistle, unfolded {{and spread it}} out carefully on his knees, placed his pipe very much on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> in order that the smoke might not interfere with his vision, and began to read.|$|E
6000|$|... "I told Cap. he {{was hiding}} somewheres, {{but he would have}} it that he'd beat it down th' escape," [...] said the gum-chewer, with the sombre triumph of the underling whose sound advice has been {{overruled}} by those above him. He shifted his wholesome (or, as some say, unwholesome) morsel to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{and for the first time}} addressed Archie directly. [...] "Ye're pinched!"

50|$|The {{physical}} {{form of the}} sculpture {{is that of a}} middle-aged man with long whiskers on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and a short beard of crisped rolls, in the Byzantine style. He wears short tunic, leaving the left leg revealed, which is draped over the right shoulder to fall downwards {{to the top of the}} feet. He secures firmly a parchment with his right hand and holds in his left a pen. Capping the head is a magnificent turban, edged with twisted flaps passing beneath the brim. Like the statue of Isaiah, Jeremiah is slightly smaller than the remaining statues. From an anatomical point of view, this statue also has deformities. However, despite the noticeable defects, there is intervention of Aleijadinho in the execution of the head, where, no doubt, is concentrated all the real power of the image.|$|R
500|$|Rufus is {{depicted}} as a large, heavily obese blond male. His head is mostly bald, with a long braided ponytail jutting from the top, and a mustache extending down the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> to <b>his</b> chin. <b>His</b> clothing consists <b>of</b> a yellow and black sleeveless jumpsuit with padded shoulders, with the closing straps left open due to his girth and exposing the center <b>of</b> <b>his</b> torso and lower abdominal hair. Black shoes cover his feet, while black fingerless gloves cover his hands and most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forearms. His secondary outfit is similar, changing the jumpsuit to a dark blue and green version with sleeves and a raised collar, additionally removing the gloves and changing his hairstyle to a double ponytail. Other alternate designs were considered but rejected, amongst which included an Elvis impersonator appearance and martial artist attire. Rufus stands [...] tall, and weighs [...]|$|R
25|$|In May 1950, the Gilberton {{publishing}} company produced a comic-book adaptation of The Man Who Laughs {{as part of}} their prestigious Classics Illustrated series. This adaptation featured artwork by Alex A. Blum, much of it closely resembling the 1928 film (including the anachronistic Ferris wheel). The character of Gwynplaine is drawn as a handsome young man, quite normal except for two prominent creases at the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> As this comic book was intended for juvenile readers, there may have been an intentional editorial decision to minimise the appearance of Gwynplaine's disfigurement. A revised Classics Illustrated edition, with a more faithful script by Al Sundel, and a painted cover and new interior art by Norman Nodel, was issued in the spring of 1962. Nodel's artwork showed a Gwynplaine far more disfigured than the character's appearance in either the 1928 film or the 1950 Classics edition.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the unfortunate}} Skinner {{got out of}} the South-Eastern train at Urshot that evening it was already nearly dusk. The train was late, but not inordinately late--and Mr. Skinner remarked as much to the station-master. Perhaps he saw a certain {{pregnancy}} in the station-master's eye. After the briefest hesitation and with a confidential movement of his hand to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> he asked if [...] "anything" [...] had happened that day.|$|E

[...] "But it ain't money. I guess he's got a notion that later on the labour unions'll send him to the United States Senate some day. He's no slouch, either, {{when it comes to}} law. I can tell you that." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{one hand}} the shaggy man held the apple, which he began eating, while {{with the other}} hand he pulled Toto {{out of his pocket and}} dropped him to the ground. Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once, barking joyfully at his release from the dark pocket. When the child had patted his head lovingly, he sat down before her, his red tongue hanging out one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and looked up into her face with his bright brown eyes, as if asking her what they should do next.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{issues that}} Hilder had with Reagan were, when Reagan was {{governor}} of California from 1967 to January 1, 1975, Reagan deserted his stated conservative positions on issues like gun control, Medicare and property rights. Hilder said that large financial interests in Southern California and the East had influenced Reagan. He had rejected Reagans credibility as a true conservative and said he spoke out <b>of</b> both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Hilder {{at the time was}} a member of former senator George Murphy's campaign staff and was on the national policy board of the Liberty Lobby. A letter by Hilder dated June 22, 1975 was sent to Mr. John G. Murphy, Jr. General Council of Federal Election Commission Washington, Hilder stated that the purpose of their organization was merely to inform the cream of the conservatives in the US that Reagan had [...] "betrayed" [...] the principals he portrayed himself to stick to when shown by the press. At the time, both Hilder and Walt Hintzen were co-chairmen of the organization.|$|R
5|$|While the Sudarshana Chakra is {{depicted}} as a subordinate figure with Vishnu, in many South Indian Vishnu temples, the Chakra as an ayudhapurusha is worshipped in its own shrine attached to the central temple. Here, the Chakra is regarded as an aspect of Vishnu and called Chakra-rupi Vishnu – Vishnu {{in the form of}} the Chakra. In the outline of the ordinary circular Chakra with a hexagram inscribed in it (shat-kona-chakra) – stands the personified Chakra in fierce form generally with eight arms. Often, Yoga-Narasimha, the lion-man ferocious aspect of Vishnu {{is depicted}} on the back of the Chakra sculpture. The Shilparatna describes that the fierce Chakra-rupi Vishnu should hold in his hands gada, chakra, a snake, a lotus, musala (a pestle), tramsha, pasha and ankusha. He {{is depicted as}} radiant as the sun and with protruding tusks from the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Another description describes the Chakra as a sixteen-armed fierce form of Vishnu. He holds a chakra, shankha, bow, parashu, asi (sword), arrow, trishula, pasha, ankusha, agni (fire), khadga (sword), shield, hala (plough), musala, gada and kunta. Three-eyed and golden-coloured with protruding tusks, the Chakra stands in the shat-kona-chakra, with Narasimha on the reverse of the sculpture.|$|R
5000|$|Around this time, a masked serial rapist begins terrorizing Miami, raping and mutilating fashion models.

When McNamara/Troy begin performing pro bono {{surgery on his}} victims, the enraged killer targets Sean. Sean is eventually attacked by The Carver in his home, but is more fortunate than most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victims; he receives only a single cut on his right cheek and is not raped. Quentin Costa, a surgeon from Atlanta, is called in to help Christian fix Sean's face.|$|R
60|$|I {{must have}} wished to see Krebs, {{to hear him}} speak; to observe, perhaps, {{the effect on the}} audience. In spite of my {{inability}} to take in what he was saying, I was able to regard him objectively,--objectively, in a restricted sense. I noticed that he had grown even thinner; the flesh had fallen away from under his cheek-bones, and there were sharp, deep, almost perpendicular lines on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> He was emaciated, that was the word. Once in a while he thrust his hand through his dry, ashy hair which was of a tone with the paleness of his face. Such was his only gesture.|$|E
60|$|In fact, Diogenes {{was at that}} moment, as they {{presently}} ascertained {{from looking}} down into the street, staring {{through the window of}} a hackney cabriolet, into which, for conveyance to that spot, he had been ensnared, on a false pretence of rats among the straw. Sooth to say, he was as unlike a lady's dog as might be; and in his gruff anxiety to get out, presented an appearance sufficiently unpromising, as he gave short yelps out of one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and overbalancing himself by the intensity of every one of those efforts, tumbled down into the straw, and then sprung panting up again, putting out his tongue, as if he had come express to a Dispensary to be examined for his health.|$|E
60|$|Over night Calliope {{had hung}} out signals of {{approaching}} low spirits. He had kicked his own {{dog on the}} porch of the Occidental Hotel, and refused to apologise. He had become capricious and fault-finding in conversation. While strolling about he reached often for twigs of mesquite and chewed the leaves fiercely. That was always an ominous act. Another symptom alarming to those who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was his increasing politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases. A husky softness succeeded the usual penetrating drawl in his tones. A dangerous courtesy marked his manners. Later, his smile became crooked, the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> slanting upward, and Quicksand got ready to stand from under.|$|E
60|$|Ospakar sat in {{the hall}} at Middalhof, near to the high seat. He was fully armed, and a black helm with a raven's crest was on his head. For, though he said nothing of it, not a little did he fear that Saevuna spoke sooth--that her words would come true, and, before this day was done, he and Eric should once more stand face to face. At his side sat Gudruda the Fair, robed in white, a worked head-dress on her head, golden clasps upon her breast and golden rings about her arms. Never had she been more {{beautiful}} to see; but her face was whiter than her robes. She looked with loathing on Blacktooth at her side, rough like a bear, and hideous as a troll. But he looked on her with longing, and laughed from <b>side</b> to <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great <b>mouth</b> when he thought that at last he had got her for his own.|$|R
