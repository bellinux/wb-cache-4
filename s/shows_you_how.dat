His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we know how much you like American voices.

500|$|A more {{negative}} review {{said that while}} [...] "Eclipse restores some of the energy New Moon zapped out of the franchise and has enough quality performances to keep it involving", the film [...] "isn't quite the adrenaline-charged game-changer for love story haters that its marketing might lead you to believe. The majority of the 'action' remains protracted and not especially scintillating should-we-or-shouldn't-we conversations between the central triangle." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a more positive review than {{for the first two}} films in the saga, but still felt the movie was a constant, unclever conversation between the three main characters. He criticized the [...] "gazes" [...] both Edward and Jacob give Bella throughout the movie, and noted that the mountain range that appears in the film looks [...] "like landscapes painted by that guy on TV who <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to paint stuff like that." [...] He also predicted that a lack of understanding for the film series in general would not bode well with the audience, stating, [...] "I doubt anyone not intimately familiar with the earlier installments could make head or tails of the opening scenes." [...] He gave the film 2 stars out of 4.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times extolled the film's {{ensemble}} voice {{talent and}} elaborate musical sequences, and declared Frozen was [...] "a welcome return to greatness for Walt Disney Animation Studios." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] grade and labeled it as a [...] "squarely enchanting fairy tale that <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{the definition of}} what's fresh in animation can shift." [...] Richard Corliss of Time stated that: [...] "It's great to see Disney returning to its roots and blooming anew: creating superior musical entertainment that draws on the Walt [...] tradition of animation splendor and the verve of Broadway present." [...] Richard Roeper wrote that the film was an [...] "absolute delight from start to finish." [...] Both Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune and Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film's characters and musical sequences, which also drew comparisons to the theatrics found in Wicked. Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy awarded the film five out of five stars and called the film [...] "a new Disney classic" [...] and [...] "an exhilarating, joyous, human story that's as frequently laugh-out-loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant. Hot {{on the heels of}} the 90th anniversary, it's impossible to imagine a more perfect celebration of everything Disney is at its best." [...] Frozen was also praised in Norwegian Sámi media as showcasing Sámi culture to a broad audience in a good way. Composer Frode Fjellheim was lauded by Norwegian Sámi President Aili Keskitalo for his contributions to the film, during the President's 2014 New Year's speech.|$|E

Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E

60|$|My Lords, you see {{two things}} most {{material}} {{for you to}} consider in the judgment of this great cause, which {{is the cause of}} nations. The first thing for you to consider is the declaration of the culprit at your bar, that a person may be pursued by the cries of a whole people,--that documents the most authentic and satisfactory, but deficient in technical form, may be produced against him,--in short, that he may be guilty of the most enormous crimes,--and yet that legal proofs may be wanting. This <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> seriously you ought to consider, before you reject any proof upon the idea that it is not technical legal proof. To this assertion of Mr. Hastings I oppose, however, the opinion of a gentleman who sits near his side, Mr. Sumner, which is much more probable.|$|E
60|$|Yes; in our '62 diaries, I fear we may {{all of us}} {{make some}} of the '61 entries. There is my friend Freehand, for instance. (Aha! Master Freehand, how you will laugh to find {{yourself}} here!) F. is {{in the habit of}} spending a little, ever so little, more than his income. He <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> Mrs. Freehand works, and works (and indeed Jack Freehand, if you say she is an angel, you don't say too much of her); how they toil, and how they mend, and patch, and pinch; and how they CAN'T live on their means. And I very much fear--nay, I will bet him half a bottle of Gladstone 14s. per dozen claret--that the account which is a little on the wrong side this year, will be a little on the wrong side in the next ensuing year of grace.|$|E
60|$|Now {{think how}} clever that was, how ingenious. What could a body say? what could a body do? For {{certainly}} {{these people were}} within their right. These prisoners were property; nobody could deny that. My dears, if those had been English captives, conceive of the richness of that booty! For English prisoners had been scarce and precious for a hundred years; whereas {{it was a different}} matter with French prisoners. They had been over-abundant for a century. The possessor of a French prisoner did not hold him long for ransom, as a rule, but presently killed him to save the cost of his keep. This <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> small was the value of such a possession in those times. When we took Troyes a calf was worth thirty francs, a sheep sixteen, a French prisoner eight. It was an enormous price for those other animals--a price which naturally seems incredible to you. It was the war, you see. It worked two ways: it made meat dear and prisoners cheap.|$|E

6000|$|The {{form and}} texture of the coming warfare--if there is still warfare to come--are not yet {{to be seen in}} their {{completeness}} upon the modern battlefield. One swallow does not make a summer, nor a handful of aeroplanes, a [...] "Tank" [...] or so, a few acres of shell craters, and a village here and there, pounded out of recognition, do more than foreshadow the spectacle of modernised war on land. War by these developments has become the monopoly of the five great industrial powers; it is their alternative to end or evolve it, and if they continue to disagree, then it must needs become a spectacle of majestic horror such as no man can yet conceive. It has been wise of Mr. Pennell therefore, who has recently been drawing his impressions of the war upon stone, to make his pictures not upon the battlefield, but among the huge industrial apparatus that is thrusting behind and thrusting up through the war of the gentlemen in spurs. He gives us the splendours and immensities of forge and gun pit, furnace and mine shaft. He <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> great they are and how terrible. Among them go the little figures of men, robbed of all dominance, robbed of all individual quality. He leaves it for you to draw the obvious conclusion that presently, if we cannot contrive {{to put an end to}} war, blacknessess like these, enormities and flares and towering threats, will follow in the track of the Tanks and come trampling over the bickering confusion of mankind.|$|E
60|$|These {{five nights}} disheartened the command a good deal. This was aggravated by a {{discovery}} which Noel made, {{and which he}} promptly made known at headquarters. Some {{of the men had}} been trying to understand why Joan continued to be alert, vigorous, and confident while the strongest men in the company were fagged with the heavy marches and exposure and were become morose and irritable. There, it <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> men can have eyes and yet not see. All their lives those men had seen their own women-folks hitched up with a cow and dragging the plow in the fields while the men did the driving. They had also seen other evidences that women have far more endurance and patience and fortitude than menbut what good had their seeing these things been to them? None. It had taught them nothing. They were still surprised to see a girl of seventeen bear the fatigues of war better than trained veterans of the army. Moreover, they did not reflect that a great soul, with a great purpose, can make a weak body strong and keep it so; and here was the greatest soul in the universe; but how could they know that, those dumb creatures? No, they knew nothing, and their reasonings were of a piece with their ignorance. They argued and discussed among themselves, with Noel listening, and arrived at the decision that Joan was a witch, and had her strange pluck and strength from Satan; so they made a plan to watch for a safe opportunity to take her life.|$|E
