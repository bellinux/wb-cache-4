40|$|The largest <b>standardized</b> <b>testing</b> {{cheating}} {{scandal in}} American history has caused many {{to question the}} practice of excessive <b>standardized</b> <b>testing</b> in America’s public education system. In the spring of 2013, thirty-five educators in Atlanta, Georgia, including the former superintendent, principals, teachers, and testing coordinators were indicted for cheating on statewide-standardized tests. The situation in Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia, triggered a conversation about excessive mandated <b>standardized</b> <b>testing</b> in America’s public schools and caused public outcry against {{the negative impact of}} <b>standardized</b> <b>testing.</b> As a result, new state laws are being passed throughout the United States to not only end the rapid increase in <b>standardized</b> <b>testing</b> but to reduce state <b>standardized</b> <b>testing</b> requirements. This article presents evidence outlining three of the primary reasons for excessive mandatory testing in America’s public schools: (1) increasing federal intervention into public education, (2) federal pressure on states to accommodate <b>standardized</b> <b>test</b> reporting requirements, and (3) vendor pressure to contract with state departments of education...|$|R

Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city.

This test was implemented with the idea of creating standardized admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding school in order to standardize curriculum. With origins in World War I the Army Alpha and Beta tests developed by Robert Yerkes and colleagues.
