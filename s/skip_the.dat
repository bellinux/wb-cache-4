5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> first two years of coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.|$|E

5|$|The Character Creation {{section of}} the game was refined to take less time than Fallout 3, with players able to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> {{tutorials}} and proceed across the Wasteland once their character is set up. The option to make any last minute changes to their character occurs when the player steps {{beyond the boundaries of}} the starting location of Goodsprings.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
50|$|Brown played {{third on}} the U.S. team at three World Junior Curling Championships (1994, 1995, 1997). Mike Peplinski <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> team in 1994 and 1995, while Matt Stevens <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> team in 1997. Brown won the bronze medal with Peplinski in 1994.|$|R

Contador chose to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> Giro, despite his status as reigning champion, in order to {{concentrate}} on the Tour de France. The squad Astana sent to the Giro included Armstrong, in his first Grand Tour since the 2005 Tour de France and first ever Giro, and Leipheimer, who was considered to be a favorite to win the event. Support riders on the squad included Yaroslav Popovych, Chris Horner, and Janez Brajkovič.|$|E
5|$|In February, Durant left long-time agent Aaron Goodwin. The {{following}} month {{he signed with}} Pelinka who represented his teammate Harden. Pelinka signed Dion Waiters. At the NBA Draft Combine, Pelinka had Waiters stop his workouts and <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> interview portions of the combine. There was speculation {{that he had a}} high draft position promise. Pelinka also signed Andre Drummond. Waiters was selected fourth overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers and Drummond was selected ninth overall by the Detroit Pistons. At the end of the 2011–12 NBA season, Kaman, Wallace, Fisher and Dooling were unsigned. The New Jersey Nets have Bird rights to Wallace. Mayo, Gordon, Johnson and newly signed Austin Daye all had options.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the year. He won titles in Beijing, Shanghai, Vienna and Paris. As a result, upon reaching the Paris final, Murray gained the number-one ranking, ending Djokovic's 122 consecutive weeks {{at the top of the}} rankings. This meant that all of the Big Four had reached world number one at some point. Following an early loss at Shanghai, Nadal announced that he would <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the 2016 season to recover fully from the wrist injury that troubled him earlier in the year. Thus, for the first time since 2001, neither Nadal nor Federer would be present at the year end championships.|$|E

5|$|Secondary 1 (age 13) {{students}} first {{enter the}} high school section and study there for four years, before proceeding to the college section where they prepare to take the GCE 'A' Levels final examinations. The high school section uses the Mean Subject Grade grading system in tests and exams. The school-wide Integrated Programme offered enables students to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> GCE 'O' Levels, typically taken by Secondary 4 students in Singapore. The Hwa Chong Diploma was introduced in 2008 and is awarded to the best performing 30% of its graduating cohort. It is awarded {{on top of the}} 'A' Levels certificate, and is an added qualification to university applications.|$|E

Cockcroft was successful, winning a £30 scholarship and a £20 bursary awarded to undergraduates of limited means. Metropolitan Vickers gave him £50 subject to his returning after completing his degree. Walker and an aunt made up {{the balance of the}} £316 fee.

5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms {{submitted to the}} Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E

5|$|Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was {{the captain}} of the U.S. {{national}} basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur, but Russell prevailed. He had the option to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team. Under coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the national team win the gold medal in Melbourne, defeating the Soviet Union 89–55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition. His former USF and future Celtics teammate K. C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{decided to}} <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> Australian Open {{and made his}} season debut at the Delray Beach Open, where he was seeded in a tournament {{for the first time}} in three years, at No. 7, and won his first three matches against Kevin Anderson, Damir Dzumhur and Sam Querrey, who beat him in the semifinals of the same tournament last year. However, in the semifinals this year, del Potro lost to top seed and world No. 4 Milos Raonic in {{straight}} sets. Next, del Potro played in the Mexican Open, where he was drawn to play qualifier Frances Tiafoe, who idolised del Potro when he was a child. In the end, del Potro won an extremely tight match in three sets. In the next round, del Potro played the top seed of the tournament for the second time in a row. This time it was Novak Djokovic on the other side of the court. Del Potro lost in three sets after winning the first set.|$|E
50|$|Bice {{joined the}} Greg Balsdon rink in 2012. Bice <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> rink through zone and {{regional}} {{play of the}} 2014 Travelers Tankard, while Balsdon recovered from a broken rib. Balson rejoined the team after they qualified for the Tankard, the provincial men's championship. While Balsdon <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> team, the team would be named for Bice. The team won the event, and will represent Ontario at the 2014 Tim Hortons Brier.|$|R

5|$|In the EuroBasket 2007, {{in which}} the top three teams {{automatically}} qualified for the 2008 Olympics, Nowitzki led Germany to a fifth place. He was the leading scorer with 24.0 points per game. The fifth place meant that Germany fell short of direct qualification, but was allowed {{to participate in the}} 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Nowitzki led Germany into a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot. In that crucial match, he scored a game-high 32 points and was vital for the 96–82 win which sent the German basketball team to their first Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics. Nowitzki was chosen to be the flag bearer for the German Olympic Team at the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Olympics. Nowitzki led the German team to a tenth-place finish, and averaged 17.0 points, and 7.6 rebounds for the tournament. In 2009, Nowitzki skipped the EuroBasket 2009. In July 2010, he said that he would <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> 2010 FIBA World Championship.|$|E
5|$|The 50-kilometre Cross Island Line will {{span the}} island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi. The {{addition}} of the new line brings commuters with another alternative for East-West travel to the current East West Line, and will {{play an important role}} in Singapore's rail network. It will connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line. This line will even have a longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible express services on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E
5|$|The ACC's {{representatives to}} these bowls were picked in a {{hierarchical}} system {{that allowed the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl to have the first selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Music City Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Humanitarian Bowl, in that order. The ACC's agreement with the bowls dictated that the bowls would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after the bowls with higher selections made their pick. Bowls would be allowed to <b>skip</b> <b>the</b> highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could select a 53 team over a 62 team, but could not select a 44 team over a 62 team.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Olympics, Baird has <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> U.S. team to three World Championship events (1979, 1993 & 1994), winning bronze in 1993.
