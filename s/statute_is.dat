5|$|No {{subsidiary}} legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be {{inconsistent with the}} provisions of any Act. This means that any {{subsidiary legislation}} that was made ultra vires its parent Act (that is, the Act did not confer power on the agency to make the subsidiary legislation) or is not consistent with any other <b>statute</b> <b>is</b> void {{to the extent of}} the inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution. However, if the object of the <b>statute</b> <b>is</b> itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a <b>statute</b> <b>is</b> {{an attempt by}} the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
50|$|The Third <b>Statute</b> <b>was</b> {{accepted}} in 1588 {{in response to}} the Union of Lublin, which created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The main author and editor of this <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> the great Chancellor of Lithuania Lew Sapieha of Ruthenian origin. The <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> the first one to be printed (in contrast to the handwritten statutes before) in Ruthenian language using Cyrillic alphabet. Translations of the <b>statute</b> <b>were</b> printed in Muscovite Russia and also in Poland, where at that time laws were not thoroughly codified and the Lithuanian <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> consulted in some cases where respective Polish laws were unclear or missing.|$|R
50|$|The first “modern” {{false pretense}} <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> enacted by Parliament in 1757. The statute {{prohibited}} obtaining “money, goods, wares, or merchandise” by “false pretence.” The first general embezzlement <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> enacted by Parliament in 1799. Neither of these <b>statutes</b> <b>were</b> {{part of the}} American common law. However, most states passed laws similar to the English statutes.|$|R
50|$|The date {{specific}} <b>statutes</b> <b>were</b> passed is not certain; it {{is accepted}} that most {{work was done}} in the years 1346-1362, that it took multiple congresses (wiec), and that both <b>statutes</b> <b>were</b> finished by 1362. Further, historians now agree that the <b>Statutes</b> <b>were</b> partially written after the death of Casimir, and later the entire work was incorrectly attributed to him.|$|R
5|$|Statutes {{are written}} laws {{enacted by the}} Singapore Parliament, {{as well as by}} other bodies such as the British Parliament, Governor-General of India in Council and Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements, which had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past. Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been repealed. One {{particularly}} important <b>statute</b> <b>is</b> the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which is the supreme law of Singapore. Any law the Legislature enacts after the commencement of the Constitution that is inconsistent with it is, to the extent of the inconsistency, void. Statutes of the Singapore Parliament, as well as English statutes in force in Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act 1993, are published in looseleaf form in a series called the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore, which is gathered in red binders, and are also accessible on-line from , a free service provided by the Attorney-General's Chambers of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act. The Act {{establishes}} the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system. The Act also establishes {{and sets the}} charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the Director of Public Transport and V/Line. In addition, the Act creates VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important <b>statute</b> <b>is</b> the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the State's rail network. As a result of recent changes to the Transport Integration Act, {{the responsibilities of the}} Director of Public Transport are being progressively assumed by the new Public Transport Development Authority, a major initiative of the Bailieu Government.|$|E
5|$|The state underage {{drinking}} <b>statute</b> <b>is</b> a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), which upon conviction is {{punishable by}} up to 6 months in jail (rarely imposed), a $500–$1000 fine, and a mandatory 6-month suspension of the person's driver's license. The penalties are the same for using fake identification. Those who unlawfully serve alcohol to an underage person, entice an underage person to drink, knowingly permit underage drinking on their property, or bring alcohol onto a public school property face similar sanctions, except that their driver's license will not be suspended. A licensed business which serves alcohol to a person under age 21, even unintentionally, may be fined or have their liquor license suspended or revoked.|$|E

50|$|According to the marginalia, this <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted in}} 1819, {{and a similar}} law dates back to 1723.

50|$|The Statute (also {{referred}} to as the Rules, Charter and Constitution) was the party's by-laws and controlled life within the CPSU. The 1st <b>Statute</b> <b>was</b> adopted at the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Partythe forerunner of the CPSU. How the <b>Statute</b> <b>was</b> to be structured and organized led to a schism within the party, leading to the establishment of two competing factions; Bolsheviks (literally majority) and Mensheviks (literally minority). The 1st <b>Statute</b> <b>was</b> based upon Lenin's idea of a centralized vanguard party. The 4th Congress, despite a majority of Menshevik delegates, added the concept of democratic centralism to Article 2 of the Statute. The 1st Statute lasted until 1919, when the 8th Congress adopted the 2nd <b>Statute.</b> It <b>was</b> nearly five times as long as the 1st Statute and contained 66 articles. It was amended at the 9th Congress. At the 11th Congress, the 3rd <b>Statute</b> <b>was</b> adopted with only minor amendments being made. New <b>statutes</b> <b>were</b> approved at the 17th and 18th Congresses respectively. The last party statute, which existed until the dissolution of the CPSU, was adopted at the 22nd Congress.|$|R

50|$|In 1967 the Michigan Legislature {{adopted a}} statute, Act 6 of the Public Acts of 1967, {{exempting}} {{the state from}} the observance of DST. The exemption <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> suspended on June 14, 1967, however, when the referendum was invoked. From June 14, 1967 until the last Sunday in October, 1967, Michigan observed DST, and did so in 1968 as well. The exemption <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> submitted to the voters at the General Election held in November 1968, and, in a close vote, the exemption <b>statute</b> <b>was</b> sustained. As a result, Michigan did not observe DST in 1969, 1970, 1971, or 1972. In November 1972, an initiative measure, repealing the exemption <b>statute,</b> <b>was</b> approved by the voters. Michigan again observed DST in 1973, and has continued to do so since then.|$|R

25|$|A {{provision}} {{will usually}} be declaratory if {{it relates to}} the performance of a statutory duty rather than to the exercise of a power on individual interests. If a procedural code established in a <b>statute</b> <b>is</b> intended to be exhaustive and strictly enforced, its provisions are mandatory. The determination will depend on the context and whether, for instance, a mistake is found to be trivial or whether individual rights are obviously prejudiced by the failure to observe the requirement.|$|E

Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because {{of the importance of}} using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of Louisiana, have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.|$|E
