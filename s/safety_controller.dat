Specifically, the effects of a <b>safety</b> <b>controller</b> on user cognitive workload and kinematics were assessed during learning the control of a simulated prosthetic arm through limited head movements. The results revealed that, compared to the group performing without the <b>safety</b> <b>controller,</b> the users assisted with the <b>safety</b> <b>controller</b> exhibited: i) a lower rate of information transfer, ii) a higher cognitive workload and iii) a reduced number of times the user brought the robotic arm close to the workspace boundaries when performing the adaptive reaching task.

Current efforts in the area of pervasive computing focus on the integration of such “smart” devices into these environments with little or no human assistance. Such integration creates potential for unsafe situations due to the interactions of two or more devices in the environment. ^ The statement of this thesis is that, under certain conditions, it is feasible to enforce safety in pervasive computing environments through the (a) automatic and dynamic synthesis of <b>safety</b> <b>controllers</b> and (b) dynamic enforcement of control actions that prevent the environment from moving to an unsafe state due to the interactions among devices. ^ The novel notions of Connected Spaces and Digital Device Manuals for modeling pervasive computing environments and devices, respectively, are introduced.

However, how to manage the dramatically increasing Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) for the safety of distribution networks is still a vital challenge. To mitigate the influence of PHEVs, we propose that a distribute network be modeled by a Finite State Machine with Variables (FSMwV) method and then controlled by a corresponding <b>safety</b> <b>controller.</b> The calculation results of four scenarios verify the effectiveness of managing PHEVs by the FSMwV method.

For the class of control systems operating around an equilibrium, the objective of maintaining the safety of the controlled device is formulated as a stabilization problem, and the safety of the controlled device is tested against the stability region of the device under the safety control.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{investigate}} compositional techniques for synthesis of safety controllers. A <b>safety</b> <b>controller,</b> in this context, {{is a state}} machine that gives the set of safe control outputs for every possible sequence of observations from the plant under control. Compositionality, in this context, refers {{to the ability to}} compose the plant model with a <b>safety</b> <b>controller</b> that is derived in a local context, meaning we only consider a selected subsets of the full set of plant model components. A first main contribution is a symbolic algorithm that works directly on a compact symbolic representation of the controller thereby avoiding explicit construction of the underlying state graph. The algorithm works by refining the representation of the control strategy in a counterexample driven manner. Upon termination the algorithm will yield a symbolic representation of the most permissive, safe control strategy for the given plant model. The algorithm is specifically designed for models that feature partial observability, meaning that certain internal state of the plant model is not directly observable by the controller. A second main contribution is a compositional technique that also explicitly takes partial observability into account. For this we develop a compositional al- gorithm that invokes the aforementioned strategy refinement algorithm repeat- edly. In particular the compositional algorithm performs a two step synthesis process for each relevant subset of the plant model: (1) computation of the local context which effectively forms a local overapproximation of the allowable behavior, (2) computation of the local controller which effectively forms a local underapproximation of the denyable behavior. We prove that upon termination of the algorithm the context and the controller signatures coincide and we ob- tain precisely the desired most permissive <b>safety</b> <b>controller,</b> yet constructed in an incremental, compositional fashion...|$|E

The task of a legal (<b>safety)</b> <b>controller</b> is to ensure that the system never exits a set of speci ed legal con gurations.

Thus, a minimallyinterventive <b>safety</b> <b>controller</b> provides maximum exibility inembedding additional controllers designed for other control objectives to operate concurrently, while eliminating the need to re-investigate or re-verify the legality of the composite controller with respect to the safety speci cation.

In recent years, more advanced FPGAs have seen greater use in embedded systems design as; they make the design easier and are more reliable as they can quickly provide a complex digital system prototype leading ultimately to a faster production of boards. Certainly there are now more advantages in using FPGAs, not only because the number of gates and features has increased and allowing a system-on-chip (SoC) on a single device to be finally realized, but also leading FPGA vendors are offering easy-to-use development tools that accelerate time-to-market and allow not only increased design productivity but also a reduction in the cost of development. Nevertheless, these embedded blocks must be configured, verified, validated and properly connected to the rest of the system; however, this is safe only if the implemented design in FPGA is safe.

We unify both approaches by using games characterized by a single discount factor determining the implementation. We evaluate different implementations from our class experimentally on two case studies. We show that {{the choice of the}} discount factor has a significant influence on the average long-term costs, and the best performance guarantee for the symbolic model does not result in the best implementation.

50|$|Programming errors {{represent}} a serious safety consideration, particularly in large industrial robots. The power {{and size of}} industrial robots mean {{they are capable of}} inflicting severe injury if programmed incorrectly or used in an unsafe manner. Due to the mass and high-speeds of industrial robots, it is always unsafe for a human to remain in the work area of the robot during automatic operation. The system can begin motion at unexpected times and a human will be unable to react quickly enough in many situations, even if prepared to do so. Thus, even if the software is free of programming errors, great care must be taken to make an industrial robot safe for human workers or human interaction, such as loading or unloading parts, clearing a part jam, or performing maintenance.

For example, a haptic stylus may be ejected {{at a high}} speed which may cause injury if manipulated inappropriately. Three safety control approaches are thus proposed in the paper to tackle the issues. The first approach {{is based on a}} simple velocity and force dependent controller, while the other two are derived from a grasp force model exploiting the state of the haptic stylus, including acceleration, velocity and penetration force, to generate the grasp force. Based on the force model, safety indicators called “safety observers” are proposed to monitor system instability caused by sudden release of haptic stylus by a user during interactions with virtual objects. Experimental results show that the proposed models can effectively reduce the velocities of the haptic stylus and suppress jerking movement, and stabilize the haptics system even in presence of active forces. The proposed <b>safety</b> <b>controllers</b> can respond to the “safety observers” and generate appropriate damping forces to counteract the instability incurred, whereas traditional control methods fail to trigger a protection mechanism under the same situation. As prior knowledge of virtual environments and additional hardware sensors are not required, the proposed approaches have the potential to be widely adopted in haptics-enabled applications.
