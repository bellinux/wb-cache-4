50|$|Under {{a variety}} of names, interurbans {{continued}} to operate on the Ypsi-Ann's tracks, eventually coming under control of the Detroit, Jackson and Chicago Railway. The system finally shut down in 1929, {{in the face of}} steep competition from buses and automobiles. (Ann Arbor's local trolley line had switched from street cars to buses in January, 1925). For years after the 1942 wartime scrap drives, it was believed that all of Ypsi's tracks had been removed, but in 2004 crews rebuilding a section of Washington Street found a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> buried under the pavement.|$|E
50|$|After {{paying for}} his prize twice, Eldred {{and his crew}} of 21 men, using a capstan, lifted the boulder 50 feet {{to the top of}} the {{adjacent}} bluff. It took a week to get {{to the top of the}} bluff, where they loaded the boulder into a small railcar. They then cut a swath though the woods and laid out a short <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails.</b> They would push the railcar to the end of the short line, pick up the rails from behind, and place them in front of the car again. Eldred and his men did this for four miles before reaching the bottom of the rapids, where the boulder was then loaded onto a raft. Once the raft reached the mouth of the Ontonagon River it was loaded onto a schooner, which sailed to Copper Harbor. Eldred's victory was short-lived, because when they arrived in Copper Harbor Eldred was informed that the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury had instructed the Secretary of War to claim federal ownership of the Ontonagon Boulder, and ship it to Washington, D.C. However, Eldred was able to delay giving the boulder to the federal government, and in the dead of night he hoisted it onto the deck of a waiting schooner. He sailed to Sault portage, where the boulder was then loaded onto another schooner, which took the boulder the rest of the way to Detroit.|$|E
5000|$|From Clarion Jct., the K&K wound its {{way through}} fields and woods just outside Clarion, and then passed through the village of Lucinda. Between 1987 and 2005, the K&K had its rolling stock and {{locomotives}} located in the small village Marienville. The trains were eventually moved to Kane in early 2006. Between 1987 and 2004, the railroad ran a tourist railroad from Marienville to Kane, then passed through the borough of Mount Jewett to Kinzua Bridge State Park. The Northern Sub. had its official {{north end of the}} line located in Mount Jewett, but the K&K decided to extend the line to the Kinzua Bridge (that was once owned by the Erie Railroad) where the train would take tourists over the viaduct. In 2003, half the viaduct was toppled over by a tornado. The K&K ran the train to the park for another year, but service was ultimately cut, do to the loss of riders wanting to go over the bridge. Another tragedy struck in March 2008. Arsonists set fire to the enginehouse where the locomotives were kept after being moved from Marienville. Later that year, the Knox and Kane was sold at auction, but the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> operated by the K&K were left in place. Most of the tracks dated back to the 1920s when most of the original [...] gauge rail was replaced with [...] rail on the Northern Subdivision. In the spring of 2010, the Kovalchick Corporation began the long process of removing the rail crossings along state roads between Clarion and McKean counties.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> between Pirque {{railroad}} station and Ñuñoa railroad station was dismantled, with the Pirque railroad station demolished by 1943, leaving {{space for the}} park to take shape.|$|R
50|$|In {{a letter}} to the Chief Engineer, Northern Railways, PFA Uttarakhand, asked the Railway {{authorities}} to remove the concrete sleepers at the earliest.

30|$|Within the {{measurements}} of track axis coordinates (optionally <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails),</b> the problem {{resulting from the}} transformation can be eliminated. Frequently, the track axis is measured with a tachymeter referring to the surveying grid-fixed points. This procedure is performed locally and involves the individual parts of a route. Thus, the coordinates of the prism (set by the crew in the track axis) are determined by a stationary tachymeter (placed on the fixed point). Alternatively, the prisms are stationary (on fixed points) while the tachymeter is moved along the track, at this time the coordinates of the total station are defined [2]. However, the locally measured coordinates require adjustments. As a result, additional errors may appear and the assessment of the geometrical layout of the track becomes problematic, especially for the long sections of the railway route.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} line was added, an 80-mile <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> from Guelph to Goderich, Ontario, completed in August 1907. There were also branch lines from Linwood {{by way of}} Stratford to St. Marys and from Linwood to Listowel.

This line was in use until 1988 when it was abandoned by the CPR.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 December 2011 - A 50m <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> power <b>rail</b> damaged between Newton and Orchard MRT stations, causing {{disruption}} to southbound {{service from}} 6.50am to 1.50pm, {{as an early}} morning. As due to the procedure <b>of</b> damaged <b>rails</b> and dislodged claws, the MRT was closed from 5.30am to 12pm on 18 December 2011.|$|R
50|$|Added to this, {{the natural}} factor, the Amazon forest, with its {{high level of}} {{rainfall}} and rapid growth, destroyed entire <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rails,</b> leveled ground, and bridges, reclaiming {{a large part of}} the way that people had insisted on clearing to construct the railroad.|$|R
50|$|These {{detectors}} are a mesh {{of small}} detectors installed against a particular <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail.</b> The detectors are typically {{a mix of}} temperature sensors and strain gauges (so measure in degrees Celsius and kilonewtons force). They measure temperature and stress/tension on the rail, to make sure these measures do not go outside the bounds of structural integrity. These systems are initially calibrated to a particular ‘neutral state’ but measuring the rail with neutral compression (no pulling or pushing) and an agreed neutral ambient temperature. The system then measures the rail to detect if these parameters get too far from neutral state, and will alert if the rail is approaching a breach of structural integrity.|$|R
50|$|Many Humboldt County mills began {{shipping}} lumber in trucks when {{a fire in}} the Island Mountain tunnel {{closed the}} line north of Willits in 1978, and only half of that traffic returned to the rails when the line reopened in 1979. Remaining traffic revenues were insufficient for track maintenance through the Eel River Canyon, at that time the most expensive <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> line in the United States. In September 1983, the SP announced that it was shutting down the maintenance-intensive NWP line north of Willits. This led to a contentious court battle since the SP did not properly notify the Interstate Commerce Commission of their intent to abandon the line. The line was ordered reopened by the U.S. Circuit Court in March 1984.|$|R
50|$|While {{planning}} a unique slaughterhouse near La Villette in 1859 to replace those existing {{within the city}} walls, Napoleon III expressed his desire they {{be connected to the}} Ceinture by rail, a plan that became a concession and decree on the 19th of October 1864. It was a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> that, after leaving the Ceinture to either side of the Belleville-Villette station to form a triangle to its east, arced northward to two stations, 'Paris Bestiaux' in the slaughterhouse marketplace and, further on {{to the other side of}} the drawbridged canal, 'Paris Abattoirs' in the slaughterhouse complex itself. The antenna and stations were open to service from the 18th of October 1867, three days before the inauguration of the slaughterhouses themselves.|$|R
50|$|From this date, the Railway {{suffered}} {{a loss of}} trained personnel and operation for a full season {{became more and more}} difficult. In 2013 two directors resigned fearing that the Railway was facing closure. A local businessman took on the tenancy of the cafe and shortly after, operation of the whole business. Reports on the poor condition of the railway track, locos and rolling stock were ignored and eventually brought about the closure of railway operations. There were however no attempts to repair the track, but the tenant removed the first <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> and began operation of a land train. Following an ORR inspection the Teifi Valley Railway suspended rail services in June 2014 and the Company was reprimanded for having passed rail operations to another operator.|$|R
50|$|To {{meet the}} demand of {{travelers}} rushing to California, a group of New York financiers formed the Panama Railroad Company and set about to construct the first railroad connecting the Atlantic and Pacific. When work began in 1850, ships carried machinery, provisions and workers up the Chagres as far as Gatún. From there, they worked their way back up through the swamp toward the railroad’s Atlantic terminus on Manzanillo Island (now Colón). The first <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> from Manzanillo Island to Gatun was completed in 1851. Construction was completed in 1854 and the first train completed the journey {{from coast to coast}} in January 1855, passing by Gatún. After 1869, with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States, traffic on the Panama Railroad decreased and the town’s main role was as a river trading post for bananas and other crops grown inland and brought by barge to be transported to larger markets by rail.|$|R
50|$|A new {{locomotive}} {{was required}} {{to take full advantage}} of the improved performance possible on these <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> new <b>railbed.</b> ViaFast proposed using the Bombardier JetTrain, capable of speeds up to 240 km, although several other designs were also suitable. Toronto-Montreal traffic would be routed along the Ottawa line; this added only a dozen kilometers to the trip, an added distance the higher speed along these new lines would more than make up for. Express Toronto-Montreal services would not stop in Ottawa.|$|R

2500|$|As Chief of the Special Projects Branch of the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from 1948 to 1950, then-Major Murray led {{the effort}} to persuade {{aircraft}} manufacturers and operational Air Force units to accept the ejection seat as a safe and effective means of escape at high speed. The seat testing took place at Edwards Air Force Base located in Palmdale, California. The seat was attached to a sled that was connected to a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> road tracks. It was propelled by rockets at {{a high rate of}} speed which at the end launched a dummy from the seat with a parachute. When it came time to actually attempt an ejection from an aircraft in flight, Major Murray discovered the seat didn't fit properly in the cockpit of the aircraft that it was designed for, so ultimately the seat chassis was sent to Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles for modifications. Upon the corrections to the seat it was a [...] "Go". Major Murray was flying in an aircraft next to the test plane. The test plane was flown by a close friend and test pilot. The test pilot began to steer the plane towards the ground and Major Murray witnessed the first ejection from the air. The test rail road tracks are still in existence today at Edwards A.F.B. as a reminder of the profound safety achievement and life saver for pilots.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> Parisian-station-connecting <b>rail</b> built wasn't {{part of the}} Ceinture {{concession}} at all, but one {{originating from}} an earlier inter-company deal which had become a separate concession of its own, an arc <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> between the Nord and Strasbourg (later: Est) lines: open in April 1852, it would {{be connected to the}} Ceinture upon its completion. The first length of the Ceinture railway was completed the 12 December 1852 between Rouen's Batignolles freight yards and the Pont du Nord, a point above the Nord company rails south to their station in Paris. The second Ceinture section delivered, between Pont du Nord and Aubervilliers (the point where the Nord-Strasbourg arc-connection joined with the Ceinture railway), opened to service on 30 September 1853.From then, trains could travel freely between the Batignolles (Rouen), La Chapelle (Nord) and La Villette (Strasbourg-Est) freight yards. The construction of the line between the Pont du Nord and Ivry (the Rive Gauche Orléans company freight yard), as it undercut the hills of Montmartre and Belleville, was more problematic: several landslides delayed the work there, but it was delivered in one track from December 1853, freight service began from the 25th of March, and was fully functional after its second rail was delivered in May 1854.|$|R
