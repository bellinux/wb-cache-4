5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and <b>sapodilla</b> <b>trees.</b> Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{prevailing}} stagnation of the colony's economy and society {{during most of}} the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture failed. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of chicle, a gum taken from the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>tree</b> and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, {{golf balls}} {{were made of}} a hardwood, such as beech. Beginning between the 14th and 16th centuries, more {{expensive}} golf balls were made of a leather skin stuffed with down feathers; these were called [...] "featheries". Around the mid-1800s, a new material called gutta-percha, made from the latex of the East Asian <b>sapodilla</b> <b>tree,</b> started {{to be used to}} create more inexpensive golf balls nicknamed [...] "gutties", which had similar flight characteristics as featheries. These then progressed to [...] "brambles" [...] in the later 1800s, using a raised dimple pattern and resembling bramble fruit, and then to [...] "meshies" [...] beginning in the early 1900s, where ball manufacturers started experimenting with latex rubber cores and wound mesh skins that created recessed patterns over the ball's surface. Recessed circular dimples were patented in 1910, but didn't become popular until the 1940s after the patents expired.|$|E

5000|$|In 1848, the Rev. Dr. Robert Adams Paterson (sometimes spelled Patterson) {{invented the}} {{gutta-percha}} ball (or guttie, gutty). The guttie {{was made from}} dried sap of the Malaysian <b>sapodilla</b> <b>tree.</b> The sap had a rubber-like feel and could be made round by heating and shaping it in a round mold. Because gutties were cheaper to produce, could be re-formed if they became out-of-round or damaged, and had improved aerodynamic qualities, they soon became the preferred ball for use. Accidentally, {{it was discovered that}} nicks in the guttie from normal use actually provided a ball with a more consistent ball flight than a guttie with a perfectly smooth surface. Thus, makers began intentionally making indentations into the surface of new balls using either a knife or hammer and chisel, giving the guttie a textured surface. Many patterns were tried and used. These new gutties, with protruding nubs left by carving patterned paths across the ball's surface, became known as [...] "brambles" [...] due to their resemblance to bramble fruit.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{prevailing}} stagnation of the colony's economy and society {{during most of}} the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops, including sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, and coconuts failed. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of chicle, a gum taken from the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>tree</b> and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. Much of the gum was tapped in Mexican and Guatemalan forests by Mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in British Honduras. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. The introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s, but this development led again to only a temporary revival. At this time, mahogany, cedar, and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports. The economy, which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the United States, remained dependent and underdeveloped.|$|E
