40|$|Within {{a global}} economy, export {{controls}} play {{a large role}} in the proliferation of high technology. A company operating in a country that operates under stricter export controls is at a serious disadvantage competing. This has been the case for commercial <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in the United States since 1999, when Congress redefined commercial satellites and all technologies associated with it from a dual-use export {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Department of Commerce to a munitions export that falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of State. Following this was a drastic drop in market share of United States commercial <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in comparison to European manufacturers which continued to define satellites as a dual-use technology. The hypothesis of the paper is “the major reason for this decline in market share is directly, and primarily, due to the fact that the U. S. sector is now operating under a stricter export regulatory environment than its competitors. ” As a secondary effect of this policy change is that U. S. companies are now losing their technical lead. To test this hypothesis, a cross tabular analysis is performed on a data set of all geosynchronous satellite contracts through September, 2006, a population of 982 contracts...|$|R

50|$|The {{radiation}} hardness assurance of <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturers</b> has been continuously improved {{over the last}} decade.

We also addressed potential limits of small satellite development and production including the difficulties of the satellite in providing the services required because of technological or political constraints, and the inability to exploit economies of scale or scope compared to current and anticipated methods of providing the service. The study was conducted through a review of the existing literature and interviews with <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and customers, with other industry officials, with government officials, and with academicians. The data contained in this report have largely been obtained from them. However, the conclusions are solely the responsibility of the authors...|$|R

50|$|While {{the launch}} {{was within the}} margins {{specified}} by the <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> the trajectory analysis had been inexact and the satellite suffered sever life and power degradation. It tried to use a supersynchronous transfer strategy, but Boeing had failed {{to take into consideration}} the effect of the Moon. Thus, the lowest part of the orbit dropped too fast and much propellant had to be spent on a fast transit to geosynchronous orbit. Additionally, the solar panels suffered damage from the extreme contact with the atmosphere. Given the damage to the spacecraft, it was never put into service.|$|E
40|$|The {{competitive}} and evolving {{nature of the}} commercial communications satellite market sector, combined with {{the limited number of}} allocations in geosynchronous orbit, have led to a steady increase in the complexity, size and weight of <b>satellites.</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in the sector have suffered from increased non-recurring engineering costs and low rate production, leading to insufficient profit margins. This paper identifies an opportunity to capitalize on the overcrowding of prime geosynchronous orbit slots and provides satellite service providers with a scalable space system solution that fulfills their need to follow market evolution. The proposed space system, FormSat, is based on standardized medium power satellites flying in formation in the geosynchronous orbit. The system will consist of transparent communication satellites connected via intersatellite links to a hub satellite, which carries the processing and routing functionality of the communication satellites in the formation, allowing management and optimization of in-orbit resources. FormSat allows gradual increase of capacity by adding additional communication satellites in the same formation. This system architecture is integrated with attractive services using a new payload hosting business model. Satellite service providers can reduce upfront investment, and are able to gradually deploy and expand to new applications or commercial markets with reduced risks. The FormSat architecture will provide a profitable and sustainable business for <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturers</b> with low upfront investment and additional new value added for satellite service providers. ...|$|R

Recently, the {{potential}} of electric propulsion (EP) for orbit transfer of scientific or commercial satellites {{has begun to be}} recognized both by <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and providers [1, 2]. The increasing interest in EP to perform primary maneuvers for geocentric missions (until now, under the domain of chemical propulsion) is first motivated by the potential mass savings this technology enables due to the high Isp and more efficient propellant management compared to conventional chemical rockets. This mass saving directly translates into more room for payload or the possibility of using smaller (and thus less expensive) launch vehicles...|$|R

50|$|Control of Galaxy IV {{was lost}} on May 19, 1998 when the satellite's primary control {{processor}} failed. The backup control processor {{had suffered a}} previously undetected anomaly, and PanAmSat {{was not able to}} regain control of the spacecraft. Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20, 1998. Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth, a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder, causing an electrical short circuit. Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder, allowing whiskers to develop. The <b>satellite</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> Hughes, has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs, adding 45 to 90 kg per payload.|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} entered a {{partnership}} with the German company OHB-System, providing the Kosmos-3M launch vehicle as well as designing and producing satellite platforms for OHB-System's ORBCOMM project. Six such satellites were launched on 19 June 2008 with the Kosmos-3M rocket: one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost. The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites losing their proper orientation toward the sun and in reduced power generation. The company has filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites and received $44.5 million in compensation.
