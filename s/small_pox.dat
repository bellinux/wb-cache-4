5|$|Casualties were {{light on}} both sides; Révolutionnaire lost five men killed and four wounded, {{including}} Thévenard {{who had suffered}} minor wounds, while Artois was the only British ship engaged, losing two sailors and a lieutenant of Royal Marines killed and five men wounded. Pellew's squadron brought Révolutionnaire back to Falmouth immediately, having discovered an outbreak of <b>small</b> <b>pox</b> among the prisoners of war taken from the French frigate. Subsequently, the light damage the ship had suffered enabled the Royal Navy to rapidly purchase and commission the frigate as the 38-gun HMS Révolutionnaire {{under the command of}} Captain Francis Cole and attach the ship to Pellew's squadron. Eighteen months later, Révolutionnaire fought and captured the French frigate Unité at the Action of 12 April 1796, and remained in the Royal Navy throughout the following 21 years of warfare. The arrival of Révolutionnaire in Britain caused a stir among naval architects as the frigate was significantly larger than those produced in Britain at the time. The ship was extensively planned and modelled and a ship was commissioned for the Royal Navy to the design of Révolutionnaire, although severe delays at the shipyards meant that HMS Forte, as the ship was eventually named, was not launched until 1814.|$|E

6000|$|Two college sophs of Cambridge growth, Both special wits {{and lovers}} both, Conferring, {{as they used}} to meet, On love, and books, in rapture sweet; (Muse, find me names to fit my metre, Cassinus this, and t'other Peter.) Friend Peter to Cassinus goes, To chat a while, and warm his nose: But such a sight was never seen, The lad lay swallow'd up in spleen. He seem'd as just crept out of bed; One greasy {{stocking}} round his head, The other he sat down to darn, With threads of different colour'd yarn; His breeches torn, exposing wide A ragged shirt and tawny hide. Scorch'd were his shins, his legs were bare, But well embrown'd with dirt and hair A rug was o'er his shoulders thrown, (A rug, for nightgown he had none,) His jordan stood in manner fitting Between his legs, to spew or spit in; His ancient pipe, in sable dyed, And half unsmoked, lay by his side. [...] Him thus accoutred Peter found, With eyes in smoke and weeping drown'd; The leavings of his last night's pot On embers placed, to drink it hot. [...] Why, Cassy, thou wilt dose thy pate: What makes thee lie a-bed so late? The finch, the linnet, and the thrush, Their matins chant in every bush; And I have heard thee oft salute Aurora with thy early flute. Heaven send thou hast not got the hyps! How! not a word come from thy lips? [...] Then gave him some familiar thumps, A college joke to cure the dumps. [...] The swain at last, with grief opprest, Cried, Celia! thrice, and sigh'd the rest.

[...] O Peter! beauty's but a varnish, Which time and accidents will tarnish: But Celia has contrived to blast Those beauties that might ever last. Nor can imagination guess, Nor eloquence divine express, How that ungrateful charming maid My purest passion has betray'd: Conceive the most envenom'd dart To pierce an injured lover's heart. [...] Why, hang her; though she seem'd so coy, I know she loves the barber's boy. [...] Friend Peter, this I could excuse, For every nymph has leave to choose; Nor have I reason to complain, She loves a more deserving swain. But, oh! how ill hast thou divined A crime, that shocks all human kind; A deed unknown to female race, At which the sun should hide his face: Advice in vain you would apply-- Then leave me to despair and die. Ye kind Arcadians, on my urn These elegies and sonnets burn; And on the marble grave these rhymes, A monument to after-times-- [...] "Here Cassy lies, by Celia slain, And dying, never told his pain."

25|$|Brajanath at once caused coins to {{be struck}} in his own name, but it was now remembered that he was ineligible for the throne, as he had {{suffered}} mutilation {{of one of his}} ears. (The Ahom considered their king from divine origin and the person of the monarch, was sacred, and any noticeable sear or blemish, even a scratch received in play, a pit of <b>small</b> <b>pox,</b> or a wound received in action, operated as a bar to succession). Therefore, Brajanath's son Purandar, then only ten years old, was brought from Silmari, who arrived in time and was acclaimed as sovereign of the Ahom kingdom of Assam, in February 1818 CE. A few days later Biswanath Marangikhowa Gohain, brother of Ruchinath Burhagohain effected the slicing off of Chandrakanta's right ear in order to disqualify him from again sitting on the throne.|$|E
25|$|In 1600, the Delaware / Lenape Native American {{population}} in the surrounding area may have numbered as many as 20,000. Several wars, at least 14 separate epidemics (yellow fever, <b>small</b> <b>pox,</b> influenza, encephalitis lethargica, etc.) and disastrous over-harvesting of the animal populations reduced their population to around 4,000 by the year 1700. Since the Lenape people, like all Native Americans, had no immunity to European diseases, when the populations contacted the epidemics, they frequently proved fatal. Some Lenape starved to death {{as a result of}} animal over-harvesting, while others were forced to trade their land for goods such as clothing and food. They were eventually moved to reservations set up by the US Government. They were first moved to the only Indian Reservation in New Jersey, the Brotherton Reservation in Burlington County, New Jersey (1758-1802). Those who remained survived through attempting to adapt to the dominant culture, becoming farmers and tradesmen. As the Lenni Lenape population declined, and the European {{population in}}creased, the history of the area was increasingly defined by the new European inhabitants and the Lenape Native American tribes played an increasingly secondary role.|$|E

500|$|The word [...] "Pūtanā", broken as [...] "Pūt" [...] (virtue) and [...] "nā" [...] (no) means [...] "devoid of virtue".

500|$|The British used {{smallpox}} as {{a biological}} warfare agent at the Siege of Fort Pitt during the French and Indian Wars (1754–1763) against France and its Native American allies. The actual use of smallpox had official sanction. British officers, including the top British commanding generals, ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted {{the use of}} smallpox against the Native Americans. As described by historians, [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy", and [...] "it was deliberate British policy to infect the indians with smallpox". [...] On June 24, 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, [...] "Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the <b>Small</b> <b>Pox</b> Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect." [...] The effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown. There are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).|$|E
500|$|Three {{days later}} Turpin, {{accompanied}} by the same men along with William Saunders and Humphrey Walker, brutally raided a farm in Marylebone. [...] The attack netted the gang just under £90. [...] The next day the Duke of Newcastle offered a reward of £50 in exchange {{for information leading to}} the conviction of the [...] "several persons" [...] involved in the two Woodford robberies, and the robberies of the widow Shelley and Reverend Dyde. [...] On 11February Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, were apprehended. [...] Two accounts of their capture exist. [...] One claims that on their way to rob the Lawrence household the gang had stopped at an alehouse in Edgware, and that on 11February, while out walking, the owner noticed a group of horses outside an alehouse in Bloomsbury. [...] He recognised these horses as those used by the same group of men who had stopped at his alehouse before the Lawrence attack, and called for the parish constable. [...] Another account claims that two of the gang were spotted by a servant of Joseph Lawrence. [...] Regardless, the three, who were drinking with a woman (possibly Mary Brazier) were promptly arrested and committed to prison. [...] Wheeler, who may have been as young as15, quickly betrayed his colleagues, and descriptions of those yet to be captured were circulated in the press. [...] In the London Gazette, Turpin was described as [...] "Richard Turpin, a butcher by trade, is a tall fresh coloured man, very much marked with the <b>small</b> <b>pox,</b> about 26 years of age, about five feet nine inches high, lived some time ago in Whitechapel and did lately lodge somewhere about Millbank, Westminster, wears a blue grey coat and a natural wig".|$|E
500|$|Fearing {{the disease}} would spread to Manitoba and the North West Territories, Morris advised the Department of the Interior that a {{territorial}} government {{needed to be}} set up to deal with the crisis. [...] Morris appointed Dr Lynch to care for the Saulteaux smallpox epidemic. Sigtryggur Jonasson visited John Taylor to seek help, returning to New Iceland on November 8, 1877. [...] Drs David Young, James S. Lynch, and A. Baldwin arrived at New Iceland and placed the area under quarantine as of November 27, 1876. [...] A hospital was established in Gimli, Keewatin and a quarantine station at Netley Creek. [...] The Grassy Narrows House, a Hudson's Bay [...] "outpost" [...] also became an emergency hospital during the epidemic. The nearby Sandy Bar Band first nation community at Riverton was reached by Lynch and Young, and had been abandoned. The buildings were burned to contain the smallpox epidemic. Following the trail, they found the remaining 17 residents of the Sandy Bar band of about 60 people. The Sandy Bar Band fled to the east shore of Lake Winnipeg. This spread the epidemic and infected any bands living there. Ramsay guided the doctor to the various bands. [...] At Sandy River 200 dead bodies were found. The Hudson's Bay Company warehouse, houses and teepees were all burned. After the throne speech was read on November 30, 1876, the council of Keewatin got to work quickly and passed its first piece of legislation. The Act was entitled An Act respecting <b>Small</b> <b>Pox,</b> and it served as the centrepiece of the council. The Act defined penalties and provisions to enforce Morris' proclamation outlawing intercourse by people outside the infected zone who did not have permission from the Council. The Act also offered advice and procedures for medical treatment of the disease. For the entire lifespan of the Council, all acts and regulations passed were geared towards dealing with smallpox. Everyone who wanted to do business with or visit the infected areas had to obtain permission from the council.|$|E

[...] Before medicine understood how such diseases were spread, many people believed that vapor from the canal caused malaria. (The association of disease with the canal was used in later arguments for converting it {{for use as a}} subway and parkway.) In addition to overcrowding and disease, those who lived in the river basin suffered from flooding, open sewers, and polluting industrial smoke. Riots in 1853, 1855, and 1884 began or took place in Over-the-Rhine. Those who could afford to relocate to the new suburbs in the surrounding hills did so.|$|E

[...] On the deliberate communication of smallpox to Native Americans during the 1836–40 epidemic, historian Ann F. Ramenofsky in 1987 wrote, [...] "Variola Major can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U. S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem." [...] While specific responsibility for the 1836–40 smallpox epidemic remains in question, scholars have asserted that the Great Plains epidemic was [...] "started among the tribes of the upper Missouri River by failure to quarantine steam boats on the river", and Captain Pratt of the St. Peter [...] "was guilty of contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offense criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had such horrendous consequences."
