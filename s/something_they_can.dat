25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or <b>something</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E
500|$|... is a vague term {{referring}} {{to almost any}} technique that uses chakra and allows the user {{to do something that}} they otherwise would be incapable of doing. The ninjutsu that most contemporary ninja use is successor to what was called , teachings created by the Sage of the Six Paths that allowed people to use chakra so they might connect with each other; however, as time went by, people began to channel their chakra to their physical and spiritual energies instead, which weaponized the chakra into <b>something</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> inflict upon others. Unlike genjutsu, which makes the opponent see illusions, the effects of ninjutsu are real. They vary greatly in purpose, with the simpler ninjutsu serving such tasks as transforming the user or allowing them to evade attacks. These techniques are often second-nature for experienced ninja, who can use them at will. More complex ninjutsu manipulate the user's surroundings or utilize the elements, respectively serving such tasks as healing others or manipulating basic elements. Techniques that involve the manipulation of elements are called Nature Transformation. However, advanced elements can only be accessed by ninjas with that kekkai genkai (genetic or clan ability).|$|E

60|$|As {{the summer}} {{advanced}} the heat increased, and the mosquitoes became perfectly insupportable. Nothing could save {{one from the}} attacks of these little torments. Almost all other insects went to rest with the sun: sand-flies, which bite viciously during the day, went to sleep at night; the large bull-dog, whose bite is terrible, slumbered in the evening; but the mosquito, the long-legged, determined, vicious, persevering mosquito, whose ceaseless hum dwells for ever on the ear, never went to sleep. Day and night the painful, tender little pimples on our necks and behind our ears were being constantly retouched by these villainous flies, it was useless killing thousands of them-- millions supplied their place. The only thing, in fact, that can protect one during the night (nothing can during the day) is a net of gauze hung over the bed; but as this was looked upon by the young men as somewhat effeminate, it was seldom resorted to. The best thing for their destruction, we found, was to fill our rooms with smoke, either by burning damp moss or by letting off large puffs of gunpowder, and then throwing {{the doors and windows}} open to allow them to fly out. This, however, did not put them all out; so we generally spent an hour or so before going to bed in hunting them with candles. Even this did not entirely destroy them; and often might our friends, by looking telescopically through the keyhole, have seen us wandering during the late hours of the night in our shirts looking for mosquitoes, like unhappy ghosts doomed to search perpetually for <b>something</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> never find. The intense, suffocating heat also added greatly to our discomfort.|$|E
