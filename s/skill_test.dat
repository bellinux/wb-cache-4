40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the difficulty index of the items in the <b>skills</b> <b>test</b> components of the class I and II Korean emergency medical technician licensing examination (KEMTLE), which requires examinees to select items randomly. Methods: The results of 1, 309 class I KEMTLE examinations and 1, 801 class II KEMTLE examinations in 2013 were subjected to analysis. Items from the basic and advanced <b>skills</b> <b>test</b> sections of the KEMTLE were compared to determine whether some were significantly more difficult than others. Results: In the class I KEMTLE, all 4 of the items on the basic <b>skills</b> <b>test</b> showed significant variation in difficulty index (P< 0. 01), as well as 4 of the 5 items on the advanced <b>skills</b> <b>test</b> (P< 0. 05). In the class II KEMTLE, 4 of the 5 items on the basic <b>skills</b> <b>test</b> showed significantly different difficulty index (P< 0. 01), as well as all 3 of the advanced <b>skills</b> <b>test</b> items (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: In the <b>skills</b> <b>test</b> components of the class I and II KEMTLE, the procedure in which examinees randomly select questions should be revised to require examinees to respond to a set of fixed items in order to improve the reliability of the national licensing examination...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{purpose of}} this study was (a) to {{determine}} the effect of a four-step learner readiness profile: positive, active, clear, and energetic (PACE) on self-reported anxiety in first year nursing students before <b>skill</b> performance <b>tests,</b> and (b) to determine the effect of PACE on the performance of first year nursing students on <b>skill</b> <b>tests.</b> The subjects consisted of 27 first year nursing students enrolled at Chemeketa Community College in Salem, Oregon. Two multiple baseline designs across subjects were employed. Volunteers were randomly divided into three subject groups. Baseline data were collected on 5 <b>skill</b> <b>tests</b> for Group 1, 8 <b>skill</b> <b>tests</b> for Group 2, and 11 <b>skill</b> <b>tests</b> for Group 3. The treatment variable, PACE, was implemented once the baseline was established for self-reported anxiety and performance. Findings indicated that PACE was an effective treatment for reducing self-reported anxiety by first year nursing students before <b>skill</b> performance on <b>tests.</b> The students also demonstrated an increased percentage of successful <b>skill</b> performance <b>tests</b> after completion of PACE. It was concluded that PACE was an efficient and effective method for reducing self-reported anxiety and for increasing <b>skill</b> performance <b>test</b> success in first year nursing students enrolled at Chemeketa Community College, Salem, Oregon.
