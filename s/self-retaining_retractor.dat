40|$|During a thyroidectomy, perfect {{exposure}} of the vascular nerve structures, parathyroid gland, trachea, larynx, esophagus, and lymphnodes is crucial to facilitate the surgeon in the meticulous dissection. WIDOX® (MOSS Spa, Lesa, Italy) is an atraumatic self-retaining thyroidectomy retractor specifically designed for thyroid surgeries with an octagonal shape and six retractors (Fig. 1). It is a sterile, single-use device which keeps the surgical wound and the neck muscles retracted allowing the proper {{exposure of}} the operatory field. The device substitutes the manual retractors held by the surgeon's assistants. In our institute, we started using the <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractor</b> WIDOX® from May 2015 {{for a total of}} 50 patients. From our preliminary experience, the <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractor</b> WIDOX® is simple and practical and can be adapted to each patient. The use of energy-based devices and the neuromonitoring is not prevented by the presence of this retractor...|$|E
50|$|Dr. McCarthy {{designed}} the McCarthy Full Sternotomy Retractor and the McCarthy Mini Sternotomy Retractor {{in conjunction with}} Kapp Surgical Instruments. These <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractors</b> were designed to provide exposure {{for a variety of}} valve operations, Maze procedures and other intra-cardiac procedures. The McCarthy retractors include a removable lift attachment that improves exposure for these valve procedures.|$|R
40|$|Femoral {{neuropathy}} {{can result}} from diverse etiologies following abdominal surgery. We describe four cases of postoperative femoral neuropathy after proctological procedures that were carried out at our hospital. The related symptoms developed occultly but eventually impaired patient motor or sensory functions in the lower extremities. When the patient fails to address associated suffering, {{it is easy for}} clinicians to neglect this type of morbidity. All patients recovered from neuropathy following timely detection of the disease entity con-firmed by electromyography and nerve conduction studies, followed by adequate rehabilita-tion management. We hypothesize that postoperative femoral neuropathy may be closely related to unsuitable applications of <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractors,</b> rather than being associated with other factors, such as gender, age, surgery time or body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we used a literature review to examine the pathophysiology, diagnoses and treatment modalities of femoral neuropathy resulting from inappropriate placement of <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractors.</b> Based on a thorough comprehension of the femoral nerves anatomical course and meticulous placement of retractor blades, these types of iatrogenic complication...|$|R
50|$|When a muscle-splitting {{incision}} is made across gluteus maximus {{as part of}} {{the classical}} posterior approach and the muscle parted by hand-held or <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractors,</b> the likelihood of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve is high. The nerve enters the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualised and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as the blood vessels. Parting the muscle damages the nerve further by stretching or even rupturing its branches which run superiorly on its deep surface.|$|R

40|$|Summary: Infection is {{a common}} {{complication}} of immediate breast reconstruction that often leads to device removal, a result emotionally devastating to the patient and frustrating for her surgeon. “No-touch” techniques {{have been used in}} other surgical disciplines and plastic surgery, but they have not been reported for breast reconstruction with tissue expanders or implants and acellular dermis. We report a novel technique of tissue expander and acellular dermis placement using no-touch principles with a <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractor</b> system that holds promise to decrease infectious complications of breast reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} {{a patient with}} a tight filum associated with a small concentric lipoma that was treated by cutting the filum terminale through a totally endoscopic approach. Our approach required {{the creation of a}} midline surgical corridor provided by the placement of a telescopic <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractor</b> over the ligamentum flavum at L 5 -S 1, under endoscopic control. The ligamentum was partially removed, the dura and the arachnoid opened and the filum terminale and the roots of the cauda exposed. After neurophysiological confirmation of the absence of neural structures the filum was coagulated and cut, the dura was closed by a continuous suture and seated with fibrin glue. The entire surgery was performed under the illumination and magnification provided by a rigid endoscope working in an aerial environment. This case shows that the cauda can be explored and the filum terminale cut with a minimally invasive endoscopic approach that does not significantly compromise the structural integrity of the spine, requires only a short dural incision, therefore reducing the risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and allows the use of multiple surgical instruments in an aerial environment. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart...|$|E
40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by De Maria et al. [2] on hand-assisted laparoscopic bypass. The authors concluded that hand-assisted laparoscopic bypass did not improve clinical outcome and was associated with increased costs compared to open gastric bypass for the surgical treatment of obesity. The highest incidence of ventral hernias {{can be found in}} patients with aortic aneurysms. In a retrospective study,we analyzed intermediate-term results of hand-assisted laparosocopic (HALS) aortic aneurysm surgery. Because of the well-known problems with alterations in connective tissue metabolism in these patients,we wanted to evaluate whether the minimal invasive approach caused a reduction in the incidence of ventral hernias. A total of 182 aneurysm patients were operated on using hand-assisted laparoscopy with a hand-assist device inserted through a small midline incision like the one described by de Maria et al. [2]. In 48 cases,a ventral hernia developed at the site where the hand-assist device had been inserted. The proportion of these cases (18. 7 %) is still lower than the 30 % incidence of ventral hernias in aneurysm patients reported in the literature,but the beneﬁt of minimal invasive access is certainly lost because a substantial number of patients require reoperation due to abdominal wall problems. For our HALS patients with a low transverse Pfannenstiel incision or a miniaccess in the left lower ﬂank region like the one performed for laparoscopic sigmoid resection,wound-related problems could be detected in less than 2 % (Fig. 1). This can probably be explained in part by the routine use of <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractors</b> with subsequent transient skin and muscle ischemia. Therefore,we changed our protocol and the whole aortic HALS case was performed under pneumoperitoneum [4, 5]. The miniincision for the hand-assist device must be placed strategically in a way that wound-related problems are reduced and the patient can have the beneﬁt of a total laparoscopic procedure. It is well-known from open surgery that any kind of incision in the upper abdomen can compromise ventilatory function,causes more pain even compared to a thoracotomy,and has an increased incidence of ventral hernias. As in HALS donor nephrectomies,as well as in our aortic cases,the minilaparotomy for the HALS device has to be placed in the lower abdomen. All aspects of the operation are performed under pneumoperitoneum,including suturing of an aortic anastomosis without the need for <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractors.</b> HALS is a technique that facilitates and accelerates complex laparoscopic operations,reduces the conversion rate to open surgery when total laparoscopic procedures are performed,and is superior to any miniincision surgery in which a midline laparotomy is require...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAdhesion {{formation}} {{is a major}} problem following abdominal surgery as it creates a considerable economic burden in addition to an increased risk for complications. In the present study, an effort was made to reduce post-operative adhesion formation by creating an artificial atmosphere within and around the abdominal cavity during an open surgical procedure. Methods 82 Wistar male rats (Clr:WI) (200  gr, 7 weeks) were randomized into two groups. The abdominal cavity of the control group was exposed to the normal atmosphere of the operating-theatre during surgery (21 % O 2, 21  °C, 40 – 47 % relative humidity (RH)), while the abdominal cavity of the study group was exposed to an artificial atmosphere during surgery (3 – 6 % O 2, > 75 % CO 2, 95 – 100 % RH, 37  °C). Adhesion induction consisted of a laparotomy along linea-alba, four lesions in the anterior abdominal-wall, blood from the tail vein dripped inside the abdominal cavity and exposure to the atmosphere around the wound by use of <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractors.</b> In addition, a liquid-sample for quantitative bacteriologic cultivation and bacterial load (CFU/ml) calculation was taken just before closure. After 3 weeks the abdominal cavity was scored for the extent, tenacity and severity of adhesions before the rats were euthanized. The two-sample-Wilcoxon-rank-sum test was used in the analysis. ResultsHighly significant differences in postoperative total adhesion score, extent-, severity- and tenacity-score were found (P    0. 05). ConclusionsThe rats exposed to the warmed and humidified artificial atmosphere consisting of more than 75 % carbon dioxide and 3 – 4 % oxygen during surgery had more severe and more post-operative adhesions compared to the rats that were exposed to the ambient air during surgery...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction • Retractor • Prosthesis • Urinary {{incontinence}} • Erectile dysfunction Objective: We demonstrate {{an innovative}} {{use of a}} barrier sur-gical wound retractor/protector system {{for use in a}} variety of prosthetic urologic procedures (penile prosthetics, artificial urinary sphincters, male slings). Materials and Methods: We demonstrate the use of a self-retaining ring wound retrac-tor in a multitude of prosthetic urological procedures: inser-tion of an inflatable penile prosthesis through an infrapubic approach as well as penoscrotal approach, placement of a transperineal artificial urinary sphincter, and placement of a male urethral sling. Results: The <b>self-retaining</b> ring wound <b>retractor</b> facilitated a more rapid setup and takedown, pro-vided 360 degrees of atraumatic retraction as well as 360 de-grees of wound protection, allowed for maximum exposure with a minimum incision size, significantly shortened the operating wound depth thus maximizing exposure, and iso-lated the surgical field minimizing prosthesis to skin contact. Conclusion: Our experience shows that prosthetic urologic surgeries can be enhanced {{with the use of the}} <b>self-retaining</b> ring wound <b>retractor</b> as it provides better surgical exposure, lowers wound infection risks, sets up more quickly as a safer retraction system with substantial cost savings...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: The {{proximal}} (anterior) transsylvian approach {{through a}} pterional craniotomy {{was developed by}} the senior author (M. G. Y.) in 1967 for the microsurgical treatment of saccular aneurysms of the circle of Willis, frontoorbital and temporobasal arteriovenous malformations, cavernomas, and extrinsic and intrinsic tumors. The acquired positive surgical experiences on this large series enabled the senior author, in 1973, to apply this approach for the selective amygdalohippocampectomy in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: The proximal (anterior) transsylvian-transamygdala approach to the mesial temporal structures permits the selective two-thirds resection of the amygdala and hippocampus-parahippocampus in an anteroinferior to posteroinferior exploration axis along the base of the semicircular temporal horn. This strategy ensures preservation of the overlying neopallial temporal convolutions such as the T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4 gyri as well as the related subcortical connective fiber systems and other essential components of the temporal white matter. The application of rigid brain <b>self-retaining</b> <b>retractor</b> systems was strictly avoided during the entire procedure. Computer-assisted navigation was never used. On routine postoperative CT scanning and MR imaging studies, infarction was not observed in any patient. The availability of tractography technology has proven that the connective fiber system around the resected mesial temporal area remains intact. RESULTS: The surgical outcome and results on neoplastic and vascular lesions of the mesiobasal temporal region have been presented in Volumes II, IIIB, and IVB of Microneurosurgery. The surgical outcomes and results in 102 patients with mesial temporal seizures who underwent surgery performed by the senior author in Zürich have been previously published. In this paper, 73 patients who underwent surgery between 1994 and September 2006 in Little Rock, Arkansas, are presented, and 13 other patients are excluded who underwent surgery after September 2006. Altogether, among 188 patients who underwent surgery, there was no surgical mortality or morbidity, and no neurological deficits, new neurocognitive dysfunction, or impairments of the preoperative incapacities. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical outcome in terms of seizures was rewarding in the majority of patients, particularly in those who exhibited the following irregularities on preoperative investigations: regular local dysfunctions on electroencephalography, dysmorphic changes in the mesiobasal temporal parenchyma on MR imaging studies, and hypometabolism in the anterior third of the temporal lobe on PET studies...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{demonstrate}} the effectiveness of a new kind of disposable autostatic surgical retractor in hernias procedures in order to achieve an easier, faster, and safer surgical intervention. Material and Methods: Between January and March 2008, 42 inguinal hernioplasty procedures have been performed using the 3 PAWS model of ReeTrakt™ a <b>self-retaining,</b> low profile <b>retractor.</b> Equivalent patients samples, in which operations were performed using conventional retraction devices, were considered for comparison of the intra and postoperative results. Results: In all of the 42 inguinal hernioplasty procedures performed, the ReeTrakt™ system has simplified the performance of the surgical team. The retractors were very easy to place. The view of the operating field was always optimal. We also noted a reduction in the operating time. There were no intraoperative complications. No postoperative complications related to the use of this kind of devices occurred. Conversely the amount of peri and postoperative complications in the control group managed with conventional retraction devices was marginally higher than in the ReeTrakt patient group. Conclusion: The ReeTrakt™ system is a very simple and useful low profile retractor for inguinal hernia repair procedures. Its ultra low profile allows a much improved view of the operating field, an unhindered insertion of the surgical instruments and a shortening of intervention time, avoiding the typical problems which arise as a result of standard retractors typically used during this kind of procedure. Due to absolute perpendicular retraction it offers a highly atraumatic performance, avoiding swelling and marks on the insertion sites. Thus in our opinion, reducing the risk of wound oedema, heamatoma or infection, as well as the possible complications of the incision associated with the this surgical procedure...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the effectiveness of a new kind of disposable surgical retractor in arteriovenous fistula (AVF) procedures in order to achieve an easier, faster and safer surgical intervention. METHODS: Between January and June 2008, 22 AVF procedures were performed using the 3 PAWS ReeTrakt (Insightra Inc. - Irvine, Ca., USA) a <b>self-retaining,</b> low profile <b>retractor.</b> An equivalent patient sample, in which an AVF was performed using conventional retraction devices, was considered for comparison of the intra- and post-operative results. RESULTS: In all of the 22 AVF procedures performed, the ReeTrakt system has simplified the performance of the surgical team. The retractors were very easy to place. The view of the operating field was always optimal. The introduction of the surgical instruments was at all times extremely easy and unrestricted. We also noted a reduction in the operating time (from an average of 67 min in controls to 43 min). There were no intra-operative complications. No post-operative complications related to the use of this kind of device occurred. Conversely, the amount of intra- and post-operative complications in the control group managed with conventional retraction devices was marginally higher than in the ReeTrakt patient group. CONCLUSION: The ReeTrakt system is a very simple and useful low profile retractor for AVF procedures. Its ultra low profile allows a much improved view of the operating field, an unhindered insertion of the surgical instruments and a shortening of intervention time, avoiding the problems which arise as a result of standard retractors typically used during this kind of procedure. Due to absolute perpendicular retraction it offers a highly atraumatic performance, avoiding swelling and marks on the insertion sites. Therefore, in our opinion, it has the potential to reduce the risk of wound oedema, hematomas or infection associated with the AVF procedure. This is important as many patients are elderly with fragile tissues...|$|R
