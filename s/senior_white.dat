25|$|Due to the {{economic}} crisis, the President enacted a pay freeze for <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House staff making more than $100,000 per year. The action affected approximately 120 staffers and added up to about a $443,000 savings for the United States government.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House {{correspondent}} Bill Sammon and his {{inside look}} at the Bush administration's response to 9/11, Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism from Inside the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was holding up a legal pad upon which he had written a message telling Bush {{not to say anything}} yet.|$|E

25|$|African Americans {{are behind}} Whites in Internet access, but {{the gap is}} most evident within the senior population: in 2003, 11% of African Americans age 65 and older {{reported}} using the Internet, compared to 22% of <b>senior</b> <b>Whites.</b> Also in 2003, 68% of 18- to 24-year-old African Americans and 83% of 18- to 24-year-old Whites had Internet access. A similar gap is noted in the 55- to 64-year-old range with 58% of Whites and 22% of African Americans accessing the Internet.|$|R
25|$|On December 15, 2015, three <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House officialsValerie Jarrett, Cecilia Munoz, and Ben Rhodesmet with American Muslim and Sikh {{leaders to}} discuss the {{increase}} in violent attacks upon members of the American Muslim and Sikh community following the attack (Sikhs are not Muslims but have been occasionally targeted in anti-Islamic bias-motivated crimes).|$|E
25|$|Therefore, if law {{enforcement}} interviews of the President, Vice President or other <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House officials become subject to routine public disclosure, even upon {{the conclusion of}} an investigation, there is an increased likelihood that such officials could feel reluctant to participate in voluntary interviews or, if they agree to such voluntary interviews, could decline to answer questions on certain topics.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak has met several Trump {{campaign}} {{members and}} administration nominees; involved people dismissed those meetings as routine conversations {{in preparation for}} assuming the presidency. Trump's team has issued at least twenty denials concerning communications between his campaign and Russian officials; several of these denials {{turned out to be}} false. In the early months of 2017, Trump and other <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House officials asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.|$|E

50|$|By 1980, the BSAP {{comprised}} about 46,000 personnel; 11,000 professionals (about 60% black), and {{the remainder}} reservists (mostly white). The organisation's rank structure was unique, with different levels of seniority existing for black and white officers respectively. Until 1979, black officers could rise no further than sub-inspector, while the commissioned ranks were all-white. Limitations on black aspirations were removed in 1979. Under Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwe Republic Police immediately adopted a policy whereby <b>senior</b> <b>whites</b> were forced into retirement {{at the earliest opportunity}} and replaced by black officers.|$|R
25|$|I also do {{not believe}} it would be {{appropriate}} for me to offer opinions, as your letter suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House officials for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the sufficiency of the remedial measures that White House officials took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E
500|$|The Senate Judiciary Committee {{was also}} {{involved}} in investigating the matter, holding hearings beginning June 29, 1996, and focussing on allegations that White House was engaged in a [...] "dirty tricks" [...] operation reminiscent of the Nixon administration. Looking into accusations that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House officials or the First Lady may have inappropriately perused the files, in October 1996 Republican committee chair Orrin Hatch requested that the FBI do a fingerprint analysis of them. [...] On November 3, 1996, the FBI informed the committee that no fingerprints of either the First Lady or any other named senior official were on the files.|$|E
500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of June 1996 arose concerning improper {{access by}} the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, {{head of the}} White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined {{that there was no}} credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, [...] "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House official was involved" [...] in seeking the files.|$|E

500|$|The {{matter was}} {{investigated}} by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Whitewater Independent Counsel. [...] In 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr exonerated President Bill Clinton {{as well as the}} First Lady of any involvement in the matter. [...] In 2000 Independent Counsel Robert Ray issued his final report on Filegate, stating that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter and no credible evidence that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House figures or the First Lady had requested the files or had acted improperly or testified improperly regarding Livingstone's hiring. [...] A separate lawsuit on the matter brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, lingered on for years and was dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.|$|E
500|$|The White House FBI files {{controversy}} of the Clinton Administration, {{often referred}} to as Filegate, arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission. [...] The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top presidential advisors. [...] Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position. [...] Allegations were made that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House figures, including First Lady Hillary Clinton, may have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First Lady had authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.|$|E
500|$|After {{the repeal}} of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama {{included}} openly gay service members in her national military families initiative. On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. <b>Senior</b> <b>White</b> House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

500|$|The Soviet Union, {{then led}} by Joseph Stalin, became an enemy in the Cold War. Truman oversaw the Berlin Airlift of 1948 and the {{creation}} of NATO in 1949 but was unable to stop Communists from taking over China, and survived unharmed from an assassination attempt in 1950. When communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, he sent U.S. troops and gained UN approval for the Korean War. After initial successes in Korea, however, the UN forces were [...] thrown back [...] by Chinese intervention, and the conflict was stalemated throughout the final years of Truman's presidency. [...] On domestic issues, bills endorsed by Truman often faced opposition from a conservative Congress dominated by the Southern legislators, but his administration was able to successfully guide the American economy through the post-war economic challenges. Truman maintained that civil rights were a moral priority, and in 1948 submitted the first comprehensive civil rights legislation and issued Executive Orders to start racial integration in the military and federal agencies. Allegations were raised of corruption in the Truman administration, linked to certain cabinet members and <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House staff; this became a central campaign issue in the 1952 presidential election, and helped account for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower's electoral victory. Scholars, starting in 1962, ranked Truman's presidency as [...] "near great"; since then he has been ranked between 5th and 9th in historical rankings of U.S. Presidents.|$|E
2500|$|The powerful, non-elected [...] "chief executive" [...] {{position}} envisaged for insertion {{into the}} Afghan government {{was characterized by}} a <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House official as [...] "a prime minister, except not prime minister because he wouldn’t be responsible to a parliamentary system." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} reports that <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House officials, and Trump himself, asked intelligence officials {{if they could}} intervene with the FBI to stop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

2500|$|In 1989, in the George H. W. Bush administration, Zelikow was {{detailed}} to {{join the}} National Security Council, where he was involved as a <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House staffer in the diplomacy surrounding the German reunification and the diplomatic settlements accompanying {{the end of the}} Cold War in Europe. During the first Gulf War, he aided President Bush, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, and Secretary of State James Baker in diplomatic affairs related to the coalition. He co-authored, with Condoleezza Rice, the book Germany Unified and Europe Transformed: A Study in Statecraft (1995), an academic study [...] of the politics of reunification.|$|E
2500|$|White was an All-American halfback for the Colorado Buffaloes, {{where he}} {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Whizzer" [...] from a newspaper columnist, which followed him throughout his later legal and Supreme Court career, to his chagrin. As a <b>senior,</b> <b>White</b> led Colorado to an undefeated 8–0 regular season in 1937, but {{they lost to}} favored Rice Institute of Houston 28–14 in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on New Year's Day. He was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, behind Yale quarterback Clint Frank, and also played basketball and baseball at CU. The basketball team advanced to the finals of the inaugural National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden in March 1938, {{a year before the}} first NCAA tourney.|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson filed a {{civil lawsuit}} against Libby, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and other unnamed <b>senior</b> <b>White</b> House {{officials}} (among whom they later added Richard Armitage) for {{their role in the}} public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's classified CIA status. [...] Judge John D. Bates dismissed the Wilsons' lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds on July 19, 2007. [...] The Wilsons appealed Bates's district-court decision the next day. Agreeing with the Bush administration, the Obama Justice Department argued that the Wilsons had no legitimate grounds to sue. Melanie Sloan, one of the Wilsons' attorneys, said: [...] "We are deeply disappointed that the Obama administration has failed to recognize the grievous harm top Bush White House officials inflicted on Joe and Valerie Wilson. The government’s position cannot be reconciled with President Obama's oft-stated commitment to once again make government officials accountable for their actions." ...|$|E
