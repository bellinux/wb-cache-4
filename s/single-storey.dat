5|$|The <b>single-storey</b> stone stables, {{which are}} {{to the west of}} the main house were built around 1769. They are in a similar {{architectural}} style to the house and include three carriage openings.|$|E
5|$|Gillard owned a <b>single-storey</b> {{home in the}} {{south-western}} Melbourne {{suburb of}} Altona which she occupied prior to The Lodge and sold in December 2013. She is a public supporter of the Western Bulldogs Australian rules football team and the Melbourne Storm rugby league team. She currently resides in Adelaide, in the beachside suburb of Brighton.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a <b>single-storey</b> {{building}} from the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} DR {{station was}} rebuilt {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, initially as a <b>single-storey</b> structure. An office building was built above it later. The line was electrified in 1905. In 1949, the Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey L-shaped {{main house}} forms {{the east and}} south sides of a {{courtyard}} with <b>single-storey</b> stables forming {{the north and west}} sides. To the south-west of the house, is a second, larger courtyard flanked on its west side by a large barn and on its north and south by single storey return wings.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a <b>single-storey</b> bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|On 10 February 1889, {{the town}} of Sibu was burnt to the ground. This has caused a {{developmental}} delay in Sibu. The first hospital in Sibu was built by the Brooke government in 1912. It was a wooden <b>single-storey</b> building measuring 50 to 60 feet long, with an outpatient department, male and female wards. On 8 March 1928, Sibu was again consumed by a great fire. However, the Tua Pek Kong Temple remained intact. The locals considered this a miracle.|$|E
5|$|The Nappers let {{it to the}} Pitt family {{until the}} death of John Napper in 1791. It passed through several hands until 1835, when it was bought by Jeremiah Penny. In 1898 the then owner, Arthur Cobbett, added a <b>single-storey</b> {{extension}} to the east front before selling it to his tenant the botanist, Dr. S.J.M. Price. In 1933 it was bought by Phyllis Reiss and her husband, Capt. F.E. Reiss.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} more space, he added blocks {{at either end of}} the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small <b>single-storey</b> lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the house is {{on the north side}} through a single storey portico. The north façade features tall sash windows on the ground and first floors of 12 panes; the second floor windows to the central section are shorter and of nine panes. moulded stucco cornices run above the ground and first floor windows. The east and west façades are five bays wide with a two-storey projecting bay on the east end and a <b>single-storey</b> projecting bay on the west end.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey Master's Tower was the {{original}} access to the College from the river. A <b>single-storey</b> structure {{is attached to the}} south side. The ruined gateway stands to the south separated from the other structures by the almshouses. Poste records that in 1847 it stood between two barns, neither of which now remain. It consists of a pointed arch for carriages in a roughly coursed rag-stone wall flanked by buttress walls on each side.|$|E
5|$|The western wing is {{dominated}} by a square tower of stone-dressed brick which rises two storeys above the roof and is capped by an ogee spirelet surrounded by four corner chimneys. Designed by Barry in the High Victorian style, it was added after the fire. A slender bell tower also rises from the west wing. At the rear is a loggia with a vaulted ceiling supported by Tuscan columns. The western end of this wing is a <b>single-storey</b> extension by Thomas Bower dating from 1896.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} Charles Holden {{designed for the}} extension, Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick, {{glass and reinforced concrete}} and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels rises from a low <b>single-storey</b> structure and is capped by a flat concrete slab roof. The design was inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. The centre of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} altered again in 1837–42 by Edward Blore for Hungerford Crewe. Blore {{replaced}} a local architect, George Latham, {{who had been}} commissioned in 1836. Many of Blore's working drawings survive in the Royal Institute of British Architects archive. He carried out decorative work to the interior in the Jacobethan style and made major changes to the plan of the ground floor, which included replacing the screens passage with an entrance hall and covering the central courtyard to create a <b>single-storey</b> central hall. He also fitted plate glass windows throughout and installed a warm-air heating system. The total cost, including his work on estate buildings, was £30,000 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were <b>single-storey</b> structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th or early 19th century {{it was given}} a Flemish Bond brick face and the rear was {{extended}} with a catslide roof. A slate-roofed, single-level extension {{was added to the}} south prior to 1867. The front ground floor was remodelled sometime between 1900 and 1930, with a doorcase removed and a fascia and cornice added. Later in the 20th century, <b>single-storey</b> extensions were added to the north in the 1960s, and also to the rear (both with flat roofs) and the south, including a uPVC conservatory. The front of the building was also modelled, with a wider front door, fascia sign and plinth added across both the original frontage and the extensions, dividing the architectural features of the ground and first floors. A large amount of the pre-1840 fabric of the building, including first floor joinery, survives into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|North of the gatehouse, {{located at}} 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in Victorian style, in {{contrast}} to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining <b>single-storey</b> at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located {{on the north side of}} the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The station {{consists}} of a central island platform between the tracks that are elevated on a railway embankment. There are four tracks through the site {{although there are no}} platforms for the c2c lines. The full length of the platform is covered by a single station canopy with a central waiting room. The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level to which it is connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other <b>single-storey</b> station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. The floor is tiled with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station is listed as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|The Baths {{were built}} around hot springs, {{the only ones}} {{naturally}} occurring in the United Kingdom. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts. During the early Roman occupation of Britain, in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an open pool {{in the corner of the}} temple precinct. It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a barrel-vaulted building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300years. All the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger; visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room with a glass-domed centre and <b>single-storey</b> radiused corner.|$|E
25|$|The Resident's Quarters is a U-shaped <b>single-storey</b> {{building}} with handsome Tuscan columns {{rising from the}} ground.|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} the main {{building}} was placed an octagonal courtyard encircled by the <b>single-storey</b> servants' wings, called Red Wing.|$|E
25|$|Sayer's Almshouses, {{were the}} legacy of John Sayer, chief cook to Charles II, at 235–241High Street, {{comprise}} a <b>single-storey</b> row of almshouses built in 1684.|$|E
25|$|The Cathedral Rectory is {{an ornate}} {{early twentieth century}} two-storey rusticated {{bungalow}} with decorative plasterwork. There is a covered linkway to a rectangular <b>single-storey</b> building at its rear.|$|E
25|$|The Former Commonwealth Bank Building (now the Show Shop) {{is located}} {{to the south}} of the Main Arena, {{adjacent}} to the Council Stand. It is a rectangular, <b>single-storey</b> rendered brick building with a hipped, terracotta-tile roof. There is an early arched entrance on the eastern side, flanked by tall, arched, steel-framed windows with decorative keystones and false balustrades. The present entrance is via a recent, <b>single-storey</b> metal and glass extension {{at the southern end of}} the building. The north elevation has been modified at some period, with its earlier arched windows removed.|$|E
25|$|Railway halts, {{consisting}} of a small <b>single-storey</b> structure with only ticket counters (a ticket booth, ticket machines and faregates). The stations are usually placed along straightforward dual-lane lines.|$|E
25|$|Old Mill was a {{post mill}} on a <b>single-storey</b> roundhouse. It was winded by a tailpole. It had two Spring sails and two Common Sails {{carried on a}} {{cast-iron}} windshaft.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{sections of}} the RNA Workshop may date back to 1925. This building operates as a workshop and is used to store supplies and machinery. It {{is a combination of}} three buildings, with the largest <b>single-storey</b> building {{at the rear of the}} complex with two smaller <b>single-storey,</b> gable roof buildings set at 90 degrees to it at the front. The front facades of the two smaller buildings are clad in weatherboards, with the side and rear walls of all buildings clad in corrugated iron. Mezzanines have been inserted in parts of the building and there have been many changes to most internal areas.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{terminals}} at Kigali. The main two-storey terminal {{was built to}} replace the <b>single-storey</b> building, now housing the VIP terminal. The main terminal can handle 6 small-to-midsized aircraft, but also up to a Boeing 747 jet.|$|E
25|$|Black Mill was a four-storey smock mill {{mounted on}} a <b>single-storey</b> brick base. It had four single patent sails {{mounted on a}} {{cast-iron}} windshaft and was winded by a fantail. The mill drove four pairs of millstones.|$|E
25|$|The BARB {{headquarters}} {{are in a}} <b>single-storey</b> block {{building that}} matches the adjacent tourist information centre and public conveniences. The boathouse is {{at the north end}} and the Coastguard have facilities {{at the other end of}} the building.|$|E
25|$|The school {{building}} dates from 1876 and is listed at grade II. A <b>single-storey</b> building of three bays with a bell turret forms the school, with an adjoining two-storey schoolmaster's house; both are {{in red and}} blue brick with a blue tile roof.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} set {{of eight}} mainly <b>single-storey</b> shops {{at the corner of}} South Creek Road and Pittwater in the {{northern}} part of Dee Why, next to the lagoon, as well as a few corner stores scattered in the more suburban areas.|$|E
25|$|The new almshouses in {{the village}} were built along three sides of a square, with a small chapel in the centre, facing the road. Twelve <b>single-storey</b> {{dwellings}} were constructed in Tudorbethan style of red and white brick, each with a living room, bedroom and scullery.|$|E
25|$|Shiremark Mill was a three-storey smock mill on a <b>single-storey</b> base. There was no stage, earth {{having been}} thrown {{up against the}} base to form a mill mound. It last worked with four double Patent sails carried on a {{cast-iron}} windshaft. The cap was winded by a hand wheel.|$|E
25|$|These {{buildings}} together {{create a}} long rectangular exhibition pavilion extending between Gregory and St Paul's Terraces, {{with the front}} elevation to Alexandria Street. It is a <b>single-storey</b> structure comprising adjoined buildings from different periods and constructed from different materials. All the buildings are connected internally, allowing free passage through {{the length of the}} structure.|$|E
25|$|Blackdown Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a <b>single-storey</b> brick base. It {{originally}} had Kentish-style cap, winded by a fantail.
