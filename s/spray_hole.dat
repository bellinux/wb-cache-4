In this case the shape, particularly the edge rounding of the injection <b>spray</b> <b>hole,</b> has a significant influence on the atomization of fluids and therefore also on the combustion process [1]. Usually these micro bores are machined by electrical discharge machining (EDM) [2]. In EDM sharp edges occur due to the process characteristics and a specific influence on the edge shape is not possible. Thus, a specific and independent adjustment of the edge rounding is required. To produce such a defined edge rounding of bores, an Electrochemical Machining (ECM) process has been investigated. This process {{is based on a}} localized anodic dissolution of the sample material that is connected to a positive electric potential. The advantages of this process lie in the possible high localization of the erosion process and high achievable surface quality.

ZnO is a semiconductor with band gap energy of 3. 2 eV and has the properties as oxidation photo catalysts that will transform harmful compounds and toxic substances in water into harmless compounds. ZnO thin film deposition is conducted by making gel ZnO with dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(COOCH 3) 2. 2 H 2 O into a solution of isopropanol ((CH 3) 2 CHOH) and monoethanolamine (MEA: HOCH 2 CH 2 NH 2) at room temperature with a concentration of 0. 3 M zinc acetate and the molar ratio is 1 : 1.

The influence of the cavitation number, Reynolds number, the upstream edge sharpness, and the length/ diameter ratio is investigated. A cavity first formed near the upstream corner, but soon caused the jet to leave the wall altogether so that only the upstream corner had any effect on the flow. Under non-cavitating conditions the emerging jet had a rufffed appearance, but under conditions when the jet had left the wall, it emerged smooth and glass-like. The glass-like stage could only be obtained with very accurately made <b>spray</b> <b>holes,</b> and any disturbance upstream, such as occurs in actual Diesel nozzles, caused the jet to appear rufffed at all times.

40|$|The {{high-level}} {{goal of this}} multi-year {{effort was}} to facilitate the Advanced Combustion Engine goal of 20 % improvement (compared to 2009 baseline) of commercial engine efficiency by 2015. A sub-goal {{is to increase the}} reliability of diesel fuel injectors by investigating modelbased scenarios that cannot be achieved by empirical, trial and error methodologies alone. During this three-year project, ORNL developed the methodology to evaluate origins and to record the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks emanating from holes that were electrodischarge machined (EDM), the method used to form <b>spray</b> <b>holes</b> in fuel injector tips. Both x-ray and neutron-based methods for measuring residual stress at four different research facilities were evaluated to determine which, if any, was most applicable to the fuel injector tip geometry. Owing to the shape and small volumes of material involved in the sack area, residual stress data could only be obtained in the walls of the nozzle a few millimeters back from the tip, and there was a hint of only a small compressive stress. This result was consistent with prior studies by Caterpillar. Residual stress studies were suspended after the second year, reserving the possibility of pursuing this in the future, if and when methodology suitable for injector sacks becomes available. The smooth specimen fatigue behavior of current fuel injector steel materials was evaluated and displayed a dual mode initiation behavior. At high stresses, cracks started at machining flaws in the surface; however, below a critical threshold stress of approximately 800 MPa, cracks initiated in the bulk microstructure, below the surface. This suggests that for the next generation for high-pressure fuel injector nozzles, it becomes increasingly important to control the machining and finishing processes, especially if the stress in the tip approaches or exceeds that threshold level. Fatigue tests were also conducted using EDM notches in the gage sections. Compared to the smooth specimens, EDM notching led to a severe reduction in total fatigue life. A reduction in fatigue life of nearly four orders of magnitude can occur at an EDM notch the approximate size of fuel injector <b>spray</b> <b>holes.</b> Consequently, the initiation and propagation behavior of cracks from small <b>spray</b> <b>holes</b> is relevant for generation of design quality data for the next generation diesel fuel injection devices. This is especially true since the current design methodologies usually rely on the less conservative smooth specimen fatigue testing results, and since different materials can have varying levels of notch fatigue resistance...|$|R

ZnO:Co solution was synthesized by dissolving Zinc acetate dehydrate (ZnAc) into isopropanol and then added monoethanolamine (MEA) and cobalt nitrate at room temperature with concentration of ZnAc 0. 3 M and molar ratio of MEA and ZnAc of 1 : 1.

40|$|AbstractMicro bores {{are used}} for several high-precision applications, {{especially}} in hydraulic systems and fuel injectors. In this case the shape, particularly the edge rounding of the injection <b>spray</b> <b>hole,</b> has a significant influence on the atomization of fluids and therefore also on the combustion process [1]. From the present knowledge {{about the relationship between}} bore geometry and hydraulic properties requirements were derived which are not feasible applying conventional manufacturing techniques. In particular, it is currently not possible to adjust the flow coefficient and the cavitation point independent of each other. The flow coefficient significantly influences the atomization, while the cavitation is necessary to prevent coking of the injection holes. One way to decouple the flow coefficient and cavitation behavior is a functional edge rounding of the borehole. This cannot be represented by the previous ly applied hydroerosive rounding. Therefore inverse Jet Electrochemical Machining (inverse Jet -ECM) opens up new possibilities, as the erosion area is localised by the jet. In Jet -ECM the electrolyte is supplied through a nozzle at an average speed of about 20 m/s and adjusted perpendicular to the work piece surface. Forming a free jet leads to a high localization of the current density resulting in a much localized machining area direct below the nozzle [2]. In this study an edge rounding of the micro nozzle bore is realized by an inversion of the Jet-ECM principle...|$|E

40|$|In dieser Arbeit wurden verschiedene Ansätze für eine bessere Homogenisierung und eine günstigere Verbrennungsführung untersucht und bewertet. Die Bandbreite reicht dabei von einem ideal homogenen Brennverfahren mit äußerer Gemischbildung bis zu einem teilhomogenen Verfahren mit innerer Gemischbildung und später Einspritzung. Mit einem ideal homogenen Brennverfahren ist es möglich, die Ruß- und Stickoxidbildung vollständig zu vermeiden. Problematisch ist die durch eine unkontrollierbare, schnelle Verbrennung begrenzte maximal möglich Motorlast im Bereich von 4 - 5 bar indiziertem Mitteldruck. Für eine Anwendung im Fahrzeugmotor besteht außer dem sehr begrenzten Lastbereich die Problematik der Verbrennungsregelung, welche (wenn überhaupt) nur mit Hilfeeines kostspieligen variablen Ventiltriebs realisiert werden kann. Ein größeres Potenzial zeigen Verfahren mit einer Direkteinspritzung nahe dem oberen Totpunkt. Die Vormischung von Kraftstoff und Luft und damit die Vermeidung der Rußbildung wird durch eine gute einspritzseitige Gemischaufbereitung erreicht. Die Stickoxidemission kann aufgrund der hohen AGR-Verträglichkeit dieses Verfahrens auf sehr niedrige Werte gebracht werden. Mit steigender Last muss die Verbrennung zur Vermeidung hoher Druckgradienten deutlich nach OT erfolgen, wodurch sich der Wirkungsgrad signifikant verschlechtert. Aber auch hier ergibt sich aufgrund der vollständig vorgemischten Verbrennung eine Lastgrenze von ca. 10 bar indiziertem Mitteldruck. Zur instationären Regelung der Verbrennung kann die Abhängigkeit vom Einspritzzeitpunkt ausgenützt werden. Bei den {{genannten}} Brennverfahren ergibt sich aufgrund der vollständigen Vormischung die Problematik der Lastbegrenzung aufgrund einer zu schnellen Reaktion. In dieser Arbeit wird bereits eine Lösungsmöglichkeit durch eine „quasi-vorgemischte“ Verbrennung angedeutet. D. h. die Gemischaufbereitung der Düse ist so ausgezeichnet, dass die Enflammung erst in weit von der Düse entfernten, vorgemischten Bereichen stattfindet. Die Verbrennung erfolgt fast zeitgleich mit der Einspritzung und wird von der Einspritzrate gesteuert. Dadurch kann das Verbrennungsgeräusch gering gehalten werden und eine Anwendbarkeit des Verfahrens auf hohe Lasten ist ebenfalls gegeben. Hinsichtlich der einspritzseitigen Gemischaufbereitung muss allerdings noch einiges an Entwicklungsarbeit geleistet werden. Insbesondere die Wandlung der Druckenergie in Geschwindigkeitsenergie des Einspritzsystems muss bei gleichzeitig verringerten Spritzlochdurchmessern und gesteigerten Einspritzdrücken realisiert werden. In {{this work}} different approaches for alternative diesel combustion systems are investigated by experimental and numerical means. The investigated combustion systems range from ideal homogenous combustion with external mixture formation to partly homogenous combustion with internal mixture formation and late injection. The investigation of ideal homogenous combustion with external mixture formation with several different fuels concludes the following: A combustion without smoke and nitrogen-oxide emission {{can be achieved}} by an homogenous, lean compression ignition. The load range is limited by a too early and too fast heat release resulting in high cylinder pressures gradients. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is an effective means to slow down the combustion and to extend the usable load range. However, as EGR is increased and the fuel-air ratio approaches 1, the fuel consumption and the HC- and CO-emission rises. The different investigated fuels do not exhibit a significant extension of the load range. Combustion systems with direct injection and high EGR show a higher potential for extending the load range while avoiding nitrogen-oxide formation. The mixture formation plays the major role at this type of combustion system. The results regarding the mixture formation can be summarized as follows: The injection timing is the central value which influences the time for mixture formation (ignition delay) and the mixture distribution by the position of the fuel jet in the combustion chamber. Early injection timings (at gas temperatures below 800 K) lead in every examined case to wall wetting and oil dilution. Narrow spray cone angles and multiple injections offer no solution of this problem. The mixture formation by the injection system is improved by high injection pressure, conical convergent spray holes, small hole diameters and large spray cone angles. A process with injection close to TDC was examined for higher engine loads. The late injection results in a shorter ignition delay and a more inhomogeneous mixture distribution. This leads to a slower combustion but also to a lower EGR acceptance compared to processes with an earlier injection timing. The retarded combustion situation may give rise to disadvantageous consumption due to partially combusted fuel and a loss of change-in-volume work. In combination with high EGR rates, it is also possible with this process to virtually suppress soot and nitrogen-oxide formation. The experimental results show a strong dependence of the (partly) homogenous combustion systems on the slowly controllable values such as charge composition and temperature. This makes a combustion control essential for the use in vehicle engines. For combustion systems {{with a high degree of}} homogenisation, the only control method is to vary the temperature and the composition of the cylinder charge. With a 1 D-cycle simulation of a variable valve train, it is shown that charge cooling by early intake valve closing or internal EGR with a second exhaust valve lift during the intake stroke could be a suitable control method. With a partly homogenous combustion system, there is an easier control method available, because there is a significant dependence of the start of injection and the combustion sequence. The development progress of homogenous and partly homogenous combustion systems is coupled with the injection and the mixture formation process. First results with an injection nozzle with a drastic reduction of the <b>spray</b> <b>hole</b> diameter show a combustion with hardly any soot and nitrogen-oxide emissions accompanied by acceptable combustion noise. The excellent mixture preparation and the high injection velocity lead to a start of combustion in well prepared mixture regions far away from the nozzle outlet. This could be one step towards the vision of a premixed diesel combustion in the whole engine map which is driven by the injection rate...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{deposits}} are carbon-rich {{high molecular}} weight species that are formed from the degradation of fuel. Diesel deposits may form on vital parts of a vehicle's engine or fuel system such as the fuel injectors. Once these deposits have formed, they can block the <b>spray</b> <b>holes</b> of the injector and may also cause moving parts within the injector to stick. Diesel deposits can cause engine failure, engine malfunction and affect engine performance. This study aims to investigate early stage deposits, formed in laboratory reactors, in particular a flow reactor. This was performed {{in order to gain}} insight into the processes by which these deposits form and what factors influence their formation. A flow reactor and closed sand bath reactor were employed to produce carbonaceous deposits, with the aim being that these might be similar to those formed in diesel injectors.

Soluble deposit precursors from the stressed fuels were assessed using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and electrospray ionisation-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) in order to provide further insight into the chemical processes preceding deposit formation.

In order to examine the macro characteristics of intersecting hole nozzles, three single-orifice intersecting hole nozzles, with the intersecting point of the axes of child holes locating inside, outside, and right at the exit surface, were manufactured.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the Squirting Balloon Toy project {{was to create a}} new toy that {{combined}} both a helium balloon and a squirting water component near the base of the balloon. The toy will be sold at theme parks, fairs, and to other retailers such as toy stores with the target audience of primarily children and their parents, or any individuals seeking a good laugh when they spray their unsuspecting target. As a result, the toy was designed to be both visually appealing and to have an element of surprise. After testing and analyzing four different conceptual designs, two final designs were chosen to be further developed. Both use a helium filled balloon, connected to flexible tubing and a water container and trigger, similar to a spray bottle. The user squeezes the trigger, water travels up the tube, into a floating disk connected {{at the base of the}} balloon, through small channels in the disk, ultimately exiting four small <b>holes</b> <b>spraying</b> individuals in its range. The pump and reservoir are similar to a common spray bottle, however the pump is vertical instead of horizontal in order to allow water to flow straight up the tubing instead of horizontally when exiting the pump device. Both incorporate a disk design and can float (including the weight of the tubing and water in the tube) when the balloon is filled with helium. Although the main {{goal of the}} designs is for no extra support to be required to hold up the balloon, the non-spinning design can have a rigid support incorporated, so the toy does not require helium to be functional. The only difference between the two toys is the design of the disk. For the spinning disk, there are four channels with two connecting at 90 ° angles. For the non-spinning disk, there are four channels that are straight, similar to spokes on a wheel. The final toy designs are sturdy enough to be used either for a short period of time, such as a few days inside a theme park, or for a longer period of time, such as at someone’s residence. The only maintenance required would be to change the balloon and refill the water reservoir, which can be done relatively quick and easy. Since the balloons are interchangeable, this also allows the toy to be sold to appear unique and entertaining depending on the event or occasion. The water reservoir is also interchangeable, allowing the user to change how they would like to disguise their device, such as in popcorn or candy cotton container. The reaction time of the water leaving the reservoir to where it exits the disk is also fast enough to provide an element of surprise in the design. As a result, it is believed that the two disk designs meet JumpSport’s criteria for the Squirting Balloon Toy and will be a success when sold to customers...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Havacılığın devamlı gelişmesi ve hava taşımacılığının artarak önem kazanmasıyla, günümüzde uçaklar en çok kullanılan ulaşım araçlarından biri haline gelmiştir. Yolcu ve kargo taşımacılığı yapan ticari havayolları da ekonomik nedenlerle genelde 9 - 12 km gibi yüksek irtifalarda uçuşlarını gerçekleştirmektedirler. Ancak bu yüksekliklerde hava sıcaklığı - 56, 5 °C’lere kadar düştüğünden bu irtifadaki uçuşların uçağın kontrol yüzeylerinde, kanatlarında ve turbo-jet, turbo-fan veya {{turbo-prop}} motorların ilk kademelerinde buzlanmaya neden olabildiği görülmektedir. Uçağın kontrol yüzeylerindeki ve kanatlarındaki buzlanmayı önlemek için uçuşlardan önce bu yüzeylere buz önleyici kimyasal sıvılar püskürtülmektedir. Ayrıca farklı uçaklarda kanatlarda buzlanmayı önleyici kapakçıklar gibi farklı sistemler de bulunmaktadır. Motorda oluşan buzlanma, eksenel kompresörün ilk kademesinde statör kanatçıklarında görülmekte ve motor performansını olumsuz yönde etkilemektedir. Bunu önlemek için statör kanatçıklarına kanallar açılmıştır ve motorun ileri kademelerinden alınan sıcak hava buralardan tahliye edilerek statör kanatçıklarının firar kenarlarındaki buzlanma önlenmektedir.   Ancak  kanal ağızlarındaki keskin kenarlarda oluşan gerilme yoğunluğu buralarda çatlak oluşumu ve ilerlemesi ihtimalini ortaya çıkarmaktadır. Bu noktalarda yapısal iyileştirme yaparak  mukavemeti artırmak için kanal ağızlarındaki keskin kenarlarda pah kırma işlemi yapılmaktadır. Uçak parçalarının üretiminin ve belirli küçük ölçülerde pah kırma işleminin çok hassas olmasından dolayı ufak hatalar bile büyük sorunlara veya performans farklılıklarına yol açmaktadır. Üretimdeki hatalar ve yetersizliklerden ötürü de pah kırma işleminde istenilen ölçü tam yakalanamamakta, hatta tolerans dışına çıkabilmektedir. Bu sebeple tasarlanacak, üretilecek veya tasarımında değişiklik yapılacak her parçanın çok dikkatli bir şekilde testlere tabi tutulması ve uçaklarda kullanılmadan önce, ilgili parçanın görevini doğru bir şekilde yerine getirdiğinden emin olmak gerekmektedir. Bu yüksek lisans tez çalışması kapsamında farklı pah yarıçaplarına sahip kanal ağızlarından tahliye olan havanın kanatçığın firar kenarı yüzeyine olan etkisi bilgisayar programlarıyla simule edilerek ve deneysel olarak araştırılmış ve karşılaştırılmıştır. Çalışmanın sonunda sayısal ve deneysel analizlerin genel olarak aynı sonuçta birleştiği, ancak birebir örtüşmediği görülmüştür. Farklılıkların sebebinin sayısal analizlerin kusursuz geometriler üzerinde, deneysel analizlerin ise üretimdeki hatalar ve yetersizlikler nedeniyle kusurlu modeller üzerinde yapılmış olduğu anlaşılmıştır. Sonuç olarak söz konusu deliklerde pah kırılmasının ve üretimdeki hataların deliklerden çıkan jetin kanatçık firar kenarı yüzeyine temasını olumsuz yönde etkilediği tespit edilmiştir. Due to {{continuous development}} of the aviation and increasing importance of the air transportation, nowadays, aircrafts have {{become one of the}} most widely used means of transportation. Passenger and cargo airlines perform their commercial flights at high altitudes around 9 - 12 km because of the economic reasons. However, since the air temperature decreases down to - 56, 5 °C at these altitudes, it is seen that flying at these altitudes can cause icing on the aircraft control surfaces, wings and early stages of the turbo-jet, turbo-fan or turbo-prop engines. To prevent the icing on the aircraft control surfaces and the wings, some anti-icing chemical liquids are sprayed to related surfaces before every flight. In addition, to prevent icing on the wings for several aircrafts, some alternative systems are available like anti-icing valves.   The icing formed in the engine is seen on the stator vanes of the first stage axial compressor and affects the engine performance in a negative way. To avoid this, holes are drilled on the stator vanes and hot air taken from forward engine stages is released from these holes to prevent icing on the trailing edges of the stator vanes. However, the stress intensity, which accumulates on the sharp edges of the holes,  increases the possibility of crack formation and propogation. In order to strenghten these points as a structural improvement, chamfering of the hole sharp edges is performed. Since the production of aircraft parts and edge chamfering process in certain small radius are very precise, even small errors can lead to big problems and performance differences. Also, the desired chamfer size cannot be reached and even sometimes it can be out of tolerance due to errors and inefficiencies during production. Therefore, parts to be designed, manufactured or modified must be subject to careful tests before installing on the aircraft and it is necessary to make sure that related parts fulfill their function properly. Within this thesis, investigation, computational and experimental simulations were done to see the effect of the air, which is released from the holes that have different chamfer radiuses, on the trailing edge surface of the stator vanes. After that results of computational and experimental analysis were compared. For computational analysis, geometries were prepared according to real stator vane models and other experimental setup to have the oppurtunity to compare the results in similar conditions as much as possible. Then, meshing of the whole geometry was generated and analysis were performed with appropriate boundary conditions and solution methods by using commercial CFD programmes. For experimental analysis, experimental setup was made ready, calibrations of the required tools were done, room temperature made constant and setup was run for a determined same duration for every single case.   Computational analysis can be divided into two groups. The first one is the real analysis that considers the actual working conditions of the engine and the second one is the computational analyis of the experimental study based on similarity conditions. So, for  the computational analysis, two pre-determined different actual working conditions of the engine were selected and considering them, thermo-physical properties of the flows were calculated. Afterwards, based on the related references, three similarity paramaters were decided as velocity ratio, mass flux ratio and momentum  ratio and analysis were made for two groups, three different chamfer radiuses, three similarity parameters and two turbulence approach including k-ε and LES. As a result of computational analysis, mass flux ratio was selected as the similarity parameter to calculate flow properties which were used in experimental analysis since it gave the most similar results to the real cases.   For experimental analysis, success criteriaof the anti icing jet was determined as the wet area that anti icing flow contacted the trailing edge surface of the stator vane. To evaluate and make this are visible, at first, trailing edge of the stator vane was painted and then paint thinner was atomized and <b>sprayed</b> from the <b>holes</b> drilled on stator vane. Consequently, following results were obtained as a result of both analysis: It is seen in the computational analysis results that the area jet flow contacted the surface of stator vane decreases with the increase in the radius of the chamfer. The surface contact area of jet flow is bigger for the stator vanes that have holes with smaller chamfer radius. The chamfer radius does not affect much the surface contact of jet flow at the holes located in the upper part of the stator vane due to the twisted aerofoil of stator vane. The effect of the jet velocity differences to the surface contact of jet flow increase with the increase in the chamfer radius and jet velocity is inversely proportional with the surface area jet flow contacted. As a result of experimental analysis, as expected, stator vane that has the biggest chamfer radius had the least succesful performance in terms of surface contact area. However, the most succesful performance belongs to stator vane that had  the medium sized chamfer radius instead of the smallest chamfer radius. The reasons behind this are the deficiencies in manufactaring of the holes and errors in dimensioning during chamfering process. Computational and  experimental analysis concurred on a final result in general, however it cannot be said that all results agreed one by one. The reasons behind this is that computational analysis were made using ideal stator vane geometry with perfect holes, but experimental analysis were made using imperfect stator vane geometry that has out of tolerance chamfer radiueses due to the errors and deficiencies during manufacturing process.   In final words, it was detected that chamfering of the hole edges and errors in production affects negatively the stator vane contact surface area of jet flow.  To prevent this negative effect and to get the desired anti-icing efficiency, smaller chamfer radius must be preferred, manufacturing quality must be improved and chamfering process must be more precise. If it is desired to expand the research on this subject, stator vane surface contact area of jet flow can be investigated  based on the flow properties inside the boundary layer. Additionally,  effect of aerofoil twist on contact surface area of jet flow and effect of the change of anti-icing holes’ coordinates on stator vane can be investigated and opitmum hole positions can be detected.
