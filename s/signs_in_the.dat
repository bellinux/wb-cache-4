5|$|All {{students}} study French, {{which is}} taught by language immersion, a technique {{in which they}} only speak French during language study. All <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building are written in both French and English. Students begin French instruction in junior kindergarten, and continue on to study French {{four times a week}} in groups one through eight. They culminate their study with a week-long experience in Quebec in group eight, during which they only speak French.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first two years}} of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E

Today the park features a variety of campsites, cabins, hiking and recreational activities.|$|E

25|$|In 1686, {{the first}} known Traffic Regulation Act in Europe is {{established}} by King Peter II of Portugal. This act foresees the placement of priority <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrowest streets of Lisbon, stating which traffic should back up to give way. One of these signs still exists at Salvador street, {{in the neighborhood of}} Alfama.|$|E
25|$|Occitan's {{decline is}} {{somewhat}} less pronounced in Bearn {{because of the}} province's history (a late addition to the Kingdom of France), though even there the language is little spoken outside {{the homes of the}} rural elderly.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of a tooth {{that can be seen}} microscopically is the distinction between the vestibular lamina and the dental lamina. The dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the epithelial layer of the mouth for a significant time. This is regarded as the initiation stage.|$|E

It is also common for street nameplates to use the serif font designed by David Kindersley.|$|E

25|$|Most {{warning signs}} display a black symbol {{on a white}} {{background}} within a red-bordered equilateral triangle. Since 2012, however, a more visibly distinctive design (taken from that used for school <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US) has been adopted for pedestrian-related signs: these consist of a fluorescent yellow-green pentagon with black border and symbol. Additional panels may be placed below signs to supplement their meanings.|$|E

Although signs containing other typefaces do appear occasionally in some places, they are explicitly forbidden in government guidelines, and are technically illegal.|$|E
