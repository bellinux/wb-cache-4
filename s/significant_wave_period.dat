The differences of the estimations using four wind products were relatively small whereas model errors were spatially inhomogeneous. The dependence on grid-resolution was relatively small at depth 100 m or so. On the other hand, the modeled <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> <b>period</b> had a large bias from the observation because of the inconsistency in the spectral moment used to estimate the <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> <b>period.</b> The energy period (T- 1, 0) was 5 % larger than the period from WW 3 (T- 0. 5, 0) and 20 % larger than the period from NDBC (T 0, 2).

40|$|The SMB {{method is}} an {{historical}} wave-forecasting method, {{which is based}} on fetch-limited and duration-limited growth of wind-waves. However, wind-wave growth envisaged by the words fetch-limited and duration-limited has been ambiguous, and clear explanation seems to have been absent. A simplest conceptual model is proposed here for the idealized growth of wind-waves, where the model equation is based on several assumptions: (1) a well-established fetch relation for small to moderate fetches, (2) ubiquitous equilibrium governed by the 3 / 2 -power law of Toba, (3) propagation of wind-waves as a whole at the group velocity of waves with the <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> <b>period,</b> (4) presence of the upper bound of the <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> <b>period,</b> and (5) tanh-type fetch dependence of wave energy. In particular, the fetch relation of (5) is a modified Wislon 2 ̆ 7 s formula I, where variables are normalized by a single scale of fectch and upper bounds of wind-waves. The model yields analytical formulas that clearly illustrate the growth of wind-waves, both fetch-limited and duration-limited. The result suggests that wave growth is better described by substantial duration t_ than the conventional discrimination of duration-limited and fetch-limited; t_ allows a unified description of wave-growth. Related problems are examined and discussed as well: fetch relations at large fetches, normalized and approximate formulas of fetch relations, momentum and energy input, and so on...|$|E

The collected data at the Joeutsu-Ogata coast of the Japan Sea were used to develop the models. In the models, significant wave height, wave period, wind direction, water depth, incident wave angle, and wind speed were considered as the input variables; and longshore and cross-shore current velocities as the output variables. The comparison of the models showed that the ANN model outperforms the ANFIS model. In addition, evaluation of the models versus the multiple linear regression and multiple nonlinear regression with power functions models indicated their acceptable accuracy.

The data for small waves or for weak winds indicate that the waves do not satisfy the criterion for the local equilibrium, because they may be affected by changing winds or remotely generated swells. In the seas near Japan, the data which satisfy the local equilibrium are about 6 % through a year. Otherwise swells are dominant in most situations. Changing winds also cause deviations from the local equilibrium. The degree of satisfaction of the local equilibrium can be classified by ranges of the significant wave height. As the significant wave height exceeds 4 m, the local equilibrium is more frequently satisfied. 1...|$|E

The enquiry begins by introducing the model that has been developed to simulate the hydrodynamics of the AUV, including the implementation of water exit and orbital wave, to preview the impact that water-exit and waves have on the dynamics of the vehicle. Secondly, the desired exit velocity and angle of the AUV for a successful jump were determined. It was observed that water exit effects have a large influence on the dynamics of the vehicle. Then, several types of landing platform were compared. It was observed that <b>wave</b> incidence angle; <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height; <b>wave</b> <b>period</b> and the type of platform have great impact on the probability of making the jump.

In estimating the bottom friction factor by the wave spectrum method, it isassumed conveniently that each component wave propagates independently. The values of bottom friction factors at Izumisano Coast estimated are 0. 14 and 0. 55 by thesignificant wave method, and 0. 013 - 0. 054 and 0. 25 - 0. 55 by the wave spectrum method.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the long-term wave data observed along the coastline of the Sea of Japan. The focus was mainly {{placed on the}} wave climate at Wajima Port, which {{is located on the}} outer coast of the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture. The wave characteristics at Wajima were first compared with those at Kanazawa, which is located relatively close (90 km) to Wajima. The wave climate at Wajima and Kanazawa indicated similar features in terms of <b>wave</b> height and <b>period.</b> The influence of Noto Peninsula was substantial only in terms of the incoming wave direction. While neither a statistically significant trend nor jump was found for the long-term variation of annual wave height at these sites, an increasing trend and an abrupt jump around 1990 have been detected in the long-term variation of <b>wave</b> <b>periods</b> at Kanazawa. The <b>wave</b> <b>periods</b> in July have significantly increased at both Wajima and Kanazawa. The wave properties were then compared with those at Rumoi and Hamada Port, which are respectively located 830 km and 510 km away from Wajima. Over a long stretch of the Sea of Japan coast covering Rumoi, Wajima, Kanazawa, and Hamada, wave climate indicated similar and significant seasonal changes. The difference in the properties of <b>significant</b> <b>waves</b> around these four sites was about 10 %. <b>Significant</b> <b>wave</b> height and <b>period</b> correlated very well with second order polynomials at each site. In contrast, wave directions along the coastline indicated significant differences. At Rumoi and Hamada, neither significant trends nor jumps in long-term annual <b>wave</b> <b>periods</b> were detected. The statistical test revealed that the long-term increasing trends and abrupt jumps of <b>wave</b> <b>period</b> in summer were intrinsic to the waves at Wajima and Kanazawa, located in the central coastal areas adjacent to the Sea of Japan...|$|R

The used methodology {{will serve as a}} starting point to establish the energetic potential in Colombia in this energy. The theoretical energetic potential estimated at the near shore in the Atlantic coast waves is approximately 1107 MW and this was possible with data that has been collected and processed since January 2016. We applied equations that take into account variables such as: <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height, <b>period,</b> sea water density, temperature and wind speed in the area. Also it is shown the progress of the near shore system design for the verification of the wave energetic potential consisting of a device which transforms kinetic energy of the sea waves into gravitational potential energy {{that is going to be}} used to move an alternating current generator...|$|R

This technical note discusses an alternative scheme based on artificial neural network. Wave spectral distribution over various wave frequencies was obtained for given values of <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height and <b>period</b> using feedforward back-propagation network. The rider buoy data at a site off the United States coast monitored by the National Data Buoy Center {{was used as a}} basis for network development.

The {{results show that the}} relationship between wave parameters and the radar backscattering cross section is similar to that between wind and the radar backscattering cross section. Therefore, the relationship between <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height and the radar backscattering cross section is established with a neural network algorithm. If the average <b>wave</b> <b>period</b> is {{less than or equal to}} 7 s, the root mean square errors of the <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> height retrieved from QuikSCAT data are 0. 58 m for HH polarization (HH-pol) and 0. 60 m for VV polarization (VV-pol).

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThrough {{the years}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry, the marine {{operations}} have been developing, and it continuous to develop. More production facilities offshore are under construction, and the activities offshore seem to increase rapidly. The operations done offshore are more advanced than ever and as a consequence of this, so does the marine operations, e. g. lifting operations. In this thesis, we will present several considerations when it comes to planning and performing a lifting operation. There are several factors to include in the planning and performing phase of a lift operation. Among them are waves, winds and currents, i. e. weather conditions. The weather conditions are also different in different geographical areas you are operating in. Another important factor is the vessel performing the operation. What is the capability of the vessel`s crane? How is the vessel availability? These questions will be discussed in the introduction below. This thesis will be concentrated on two specific areas, The North Sea and Offshore Angola. The reason for choosing these two areas is that they have two completely different sea states. The North Sea is mostly influenced by <b>waves</b> with higher <b>significant</b> heights and <b>wave</b> <b>periods</b> of around 8 to 10 s, while offshore Angola has <b>waves</b> with shorter <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> heights and <b>periods</b> of around 10 s to 12 s. In this thesis different sea states -, stability -, lifting – and simplified risk analyses will be presented. There will also be presented a simulation {{with the use of the}} software OrcaFlex...|$|R

This is done by simulating the wave fields generated in the Gulf of Mexico by two recent hurricanes: Gilbert (1988) and Isidore (2002). Wave spectra at four points in front of the most important ports of the area are also analyzed. The results of <b>significant</b> <b>wave</b> heights and <b>periods</b> are compared with field measurements from three oceanographic buoys located {{in the northern part of}} the Gulf of Mexico.
