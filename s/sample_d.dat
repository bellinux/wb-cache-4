50|$|Modifications of {{this early}} work have been {{implemented}} to perform AFM analysis on both conducting and non-conducting materials. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) is one such modification technique. The c-AFM technique operates by measuring fluctuations in current from the biased tip and sample while simultaneously measuring changes in the topographical features. In all techniques of AFM, two modes of operation can be used: contact mode and non-contact mode. In c-AFM resonant contact mode is used to obtain topographical from current that is measured between the biased AFM tip and the sample surface. In this type of operation, the current is measured in the small space between the tip and the sample surface. This quantification {{is based on the}} relationship between the current traveling through the sample and layer thickness. In the previous equation, Aeff is the effective emission area at the injecting electrode, q is the electron charge, h is planck’s constant, meff / m0 =0.5, which is the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band of a <b>sample,</b> <b>d</b> is the sample thickness and Φ is the barrier height.

Furthermore, the MCM <b>samples</b> (c) and (<b>d)</b> were all impregnated 1  h, and the only one difference was their calcination temperature, which led to the surface area and porous volume being changed significantly.

30|$|It was {{observed}} that <b>sample</b> <b>D</b> 1 {{has a lower}} average diameter, and the cylindrical shape of nanofiber {{can be attributed to}} the efficiency of solvent separation. Compared with <b>sample</b> <b>D</b> 1, The D 2 sample shows higher average diameter and higher ribbon-like structure because of lower spinning temperature. In the meantime, the <b>sample</b> <b>D</b> 3 shows higher average diameter compared to D 1 with regard to lower spinneret rotation speed. While the spinneret rotation speed increases, the upward motion in polymeric solution also increases. This effect enables applying the high voltage, which leads to the stretching effect in the produced nanofibers. When the speed is low, stimulation and tension effect in solvent compared to higher speed is low, and it could apply further stretching at still higher voltages. As can be expected, the <b>sample</b> <b>D</b> 4 shows the higher range of values of nanofiber diameter because of lower stretching tension in polymer streamline. Similarly, the <b>sample</b> <b>D</b> 5 shows higher average diameter for smaller distance, and therefore there is no room for sufficient stretching and solvent separation. As was previously mentioned, at the distances less than 10  cm, it is impossible to apply voltages higher than 50 kv. Hence, the shorter the distances it was, the less the voltage that was needed. It is observed that in the samples D 6 and D 7 prepared at 5  rpm speeds, regardless of other parameters, the average diameters of nanofibers are higher compared to those of other electrospun samples with disk spinneret. The C 1 sample is the only one that was done by cylindrical spinneret. In this sample, because of electric discharge during electrospinning, there was no possibility for spinning at 9  rpm—although, in this case little solvent evaporation could be seen; however, with regard to weakness of spinneret electric field, the maximum voltage is applicable. According to these interpretations, by considering the electrospinning device limitations, the speed, voltage, distance, and temperature, respectively, have values of 9  rpm, 55  kV, 10  cm, and 41  °C for the most homogenous sample with the lowest average diameter in D 1 sample.|$|E
