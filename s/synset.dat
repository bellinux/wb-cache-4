500|$|For {{many years}} {{starting}} from 1986, Miller directed {{the development of}} WordNet, a large computer-readable electronic reference usable in applications such as search engines. Wordnet is a large lexical database representing human semantic memory in English. Its fundamental building block is a <b>synset,</b> which {{is a collection of}} synonyms representing a concept or idea. Words can be in multiple synsets. The entire class of synsets is grouped into nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs separately, with links existing only within these four major groups but not between them. Going beyond a thesaurus, WordNet also includes inter-word relationships such as part/whole relationships and hierarchies of inclusion.Although not intended to be a dictionary, Wordnet did have many short definitions added to it as time went on. [...] Miller and colleagues had planned the tool to test psycholinguistic theories on how humans use and understand words. Miller also later worked closely with entrepreneur Jeff Stibel and scientists at Simpli.com Inc., on a meaning-based keyword search engine based on WordNet. [...] Wordnet has proved to be extremely influential on an international scale. [...] It has now been emulated by wordnets in many different languages.|$|E
5000|$|The wordnets {{follow the}} {{principles}} of minimality, coverage and replaceability for the synsets. That means, there {{should be at least}} a 'core' set of lexemes in the <b>synset</b> that uniquely give the concept represented by the <b>synset</b> (minimality), e.g., {house, family} standing for the concept of 'family' ("she is from a noble house"). Then the <b>synset</b> should cover ALL the words representing the concept in the language (coverage), e.g., the word 'menage' will have to appear in the 'family' <b>synset,</b> albeit, {{towards the end of the}} <b>synset,</b> since its usage is rare. Finally, the words towards the beginning of the <b>synset</b> should be able to replace one another in reasonable amount of corpora (replaceability), e.g., 'house' and 'family' can replace each other in the sentence [...] "she is from a noble house".|$|E
5000|$|GermaNet {{partitions}} the lexical space into a set {{of concepts}} that are interlinked by semantic relations. A semantic concept is modeled by a <b>synset.</b> A <b>synset</b> is {{a set of}} words (called lexical units) where all the words are taken to have the same or almost the same meaning.Thus a <b>synset</b> {{is a set of}} synonyms grouped under one definition, or [...] "gloss".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an approach}} to produce a prototype WordNet system for Malay semi-automatically, by using bilingual dictionary data and resources provided by the original English WordNet system. Senses from an English-Malay bilingual dictionary were first aligned to English WordNet senses, {{and a set of}} Malay <b>synsets</b> were then derived. Semantic relations between the English WordNet <b>synsets</b> were extracted and re-applied to the Malay <b>synsets,</b> using the aligned <b>synsets</b> as a guide. A small Malay WordNet prototype with 12429 noun <b>synsets</b> and 5805 verb <b>synsets</b> was thus produced. This prototype is a first step towards building a full-fledged Malay WordNet...|$|R

The mapping enables the application of plWordNet in machine translation, e.g. in the online service offered by Google Translate.|$|R

50|$|Each synonym set - <b>SYNSET</b> encodes the {{relation}} of equivalence between a number of lexical items - LITERALS (at least one should be explicitly represented in the <b>SYNSET),</b> each of them having a unique meaning (specified by the value of SENSE) - which pertain to {{one and the same}} part of speech (specified as the value of POS) and represent one and the same lexical meaning (specified as the value of DEF). Each <b>synset</b> is linked to its counterpart in PWN 3.0 by means of a unique identification number - ID. The common synsets in the Balkan languages are marked as common concepts subsets - BCS. In a monolingual database a <b>synset</b> should be linked to at least one other <b>synset</b> through an intralingual relation. Non-obligatory information may also be encoded such as examples of usage, stylistic peculiarities, morphological or syntactic properties, author and last edit details.|$|E

To this end the results of manual mapping – that is inter-lingual relations between plWN and PWN <b>synsets</b> – are juxtaposed with the automatic prompts that were generated for the source language <b>synsets</b> to be mapped.

5000|$|Words {{from the}} same lexical {{category}} that are roughly synonymous are grouped into synsets. Synsets include simplex words as well as collocations like [...] "eat out" [...] and [...] "car pool." [...] The different senses of a polysemous word form are assigned to different synsets. The meaning of a <b>synset</b> is further clarified with a short defining gloss and one or more usage examples. An example adjective <b>synset</b> is: ...|$|E

50|$|Adjective <b>synset</b> {{relations}} {{are very similar}} to verb <b>synset</b> relations. They are not quite as neatly hierarchical as the noun <b>synset</b> relations, and they have fewer tiers and more terminal nodes. However, there are generally less terminal nodes per ontological category in adjective <b>synset</b> relations than that of verbs. Adjectives in semantic lexicons are organized in word pairs as well, with the difference being that their word pairs are antonyms instead of entailments. More generic polar adjectives such as hot and cold, or happy and sad are paired. Then other adjectives that are semantically similar are linked to each of these words. Hot is linked to warm, heated, sizzling, and sweltering, while cold is linked to cool, chilly, freezing, and nippy. These semantically similar adjectives are considered indirect antonyms to the opposite polar adjective (i.e. nippy is an indirect antonym to hot). Adjectives that are derived from a verb or a noun are also directly linked to said verb or noun across sub-nets. For example, enjoyable is linked to the semantically similar adjectives agreeable, and pleasant, as well as to its origin verb, enjoy.|$|E
50|$|Hyponymy is {{the most}} {{frequently}} encoded relation among <b>synsets</b> used in lexical databases such as WordNet. These semantic relations {{can also be used}} to compare semantic similarity by judging the distance between two <b>synsets</b> and to analyse Anaphora.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} {{for building a}} Wikipedia-based semantic network by integrating Open Information Extraction with Knowledge Acquisition techniques.

50|$|A {{common use}} of WordNet is to {{determine}} the similarity between words. Various algorithms have been proposed, and these include measuring the distance among the words and <b>synsets</b> in WordNet's graph structure, such as by counting the number of edges among <b>synsets.</b> The intuition is that the closer two words or <b>synsets</b> are, the closer their meaning. A number of WordNet-based word similarity algorithms are implemented in a Perl package called WordNet::Similarity, and in a Python package called NLTK.Other more sophisticated WordNet-based similarity techniques include ADW, whose implementation is available in Java. WordNet {{can also be used to}} inter-link other vocabularies.|$|R

50|$|Both nouns and verbs are {{organized}} into hierarchies, defined by hypernym or IS A relationships. For instance, one {{sense of the}} word dog is found following hypernym hierarchy; the words at the same level represent <b>synset</b> members. Each set of synonyms has a unique index.|$|E
5000|$|At the top level, these {{hierarchies}} {{are organized}} into 25 beginner [...] "trees" [...] for nouns and 15 for verbs (called lexicographic files at a maintenance level). All {{are linked to}} a unique beginner <b>synset,</b> [...] "entity".Noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies ...|$|E
5000|$|These {{semantic}} relations hold {{among all}} members of the linked synsets. Individual <b>synset</b> members (words) can also be connected with lexical relations.

50|$|In {{metadata}} {{a synonym}} ring or <b>synset,</b> {{is a group}} of data elements that are considered semantically equivalent for the purposes of information retrieval. These data elements are frequently found in different metadata registries. Although a group of terms can be considered equivalent, metadata registries store the synonyms at a central location called the preferred data element.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} element defining words meanings are lexico-semantic and derivational relations, which hold between synsets and between lexical units. One <b>synset</b> groups such lexical units, which share {{the same set of}} relations. Based on the relations assigned to the synsets and units, tools for natural language processing can conclude about meaning of the lemma, which is important for example in word-sense disambiguation.|$|E
50|$|Another {{attribute}} of verb <b>synset</b> relations {{is that there}} are also ordered into verb pairs. In these pairs, one verb necessarily entails the other in the way that massacre entails kill, and know entails believe. These verb pairs can be troponyms and their superordinates, {{as is the case in}} the first example, or they can be in completely different ontological categories, as in the case in the second example.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for sentiment load annotation of the <b>synsets</b> of a wordnet, along {{the principles of}} Osgood’s “Semantic Differential ” theory and extending the Kamp and Marx calculus, by taking into account not only the WordNet structure but also the SUMO/MILO (Niles & Pease, 2001) and DOMAINS (Bentivogli et al., 2004) knowledge sources. We discuss the method to annotate all the <b>synsets</b> in PWN 2. 0, irrespective of their part of speech. As the number of possible factors (semantic oppositions, along which the <b>synsets</b> are ranked) is very large, we developed also an application allowing the text analyst to select the most discriminating factors {{for the type of}} text to be analyzed. Once the factors have been selected, the underlying wordnet is marked-up on the fly and it can be used for the intended textual analysis. We anticipate that these annotations can be imported in other language wordnets, provided they are aligned to PWN 2. 0. The method for the <b>synsets</b> annotation generalizes the usual subjectivity mark-up (positive, negative and objective) according to a user-based multi-criteria differential semantics model...|$|R
