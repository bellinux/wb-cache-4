25|$|The CPSS scale assesses {{avoidance}} {{and change}} of activities, {{which may not}} accurately reflect pathology. This could possibly result in higher PTSD prevalence estimations. In a study, the CPSS scale correctly classified 72.2% of children. Nearly one-quarter of children were misclassified and 5.6% were misclassified (false negative). CPSS is a self-reporting assessment and is, therefore, subject to <b>social</b> <b>desirability</b> bias. <b>Social</b> <b>desirability</b> bias influences respondents to answer questions {{in a way that}} presents them more favorably to others. This interferes with the purpose of the assessment and prevents clinicians from properly screening for PTSD.|$|E

Because talking about drinking behavior can be uncomfortable or stigmatized, people's responses {{may be subject to}} <b>social</b> <b>desirability</b> bias. The honesty and accuracy of responses may improve if the person trusts the person doing the interview or interpreting the score. Responses also may be more honest when the form is completed online, on a computer, or in other anonymous formats.|$|E

The older, lower results, which are even lower than estimated in the general population, were due to the methodology of questioning respondents face-to-face, which led to <b>social</b> <b>desirability</b> bias. In contrast, one study showed 7.5% of college students reporting zoophilia, while other studies find only 2.2% to 5.3% expressing fantasies of sex with animals.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to test a {{research}} model that investigates the effects of perceived <b>desirability,</b> <b>social</b> norms, and perceived feasibility as antecedents on entrepreneurial intention in a Malaysian context. Data for this empirical investigation were gathered from a sample of full-time undergraduate hospitality management programme students. Respondents self-administered the questionnaires. A total number of 427 questionnaires were obtained in the research location. Results based on hierarchical regression analysis reveal that perceived <b>desirability,</b> <b>social</b> norm, and perceived feasibility are significant predictors on entrepreneurial intention. Results also demonstrate that female students are more willing on their entrepreneurial intentions when compared to male counterparts. The current study provides further contribution to tourism and hospitality management literature and provides useful guidelines to practitioners as well...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the psychological characteristics of clerical and laymen who had sexually abused children. A three group design was used which permitted comparisons {{to be made}} between a group of 30 clerical men who had sexually abused children, a group of 73 laymen who had sexually abused children, {{and a group of}} 30 laymen who had not sexually abused children. The following instruments (all but two of which are from the Sex Offender Assessment Pack) were included in the assessment protocol: the Personal Reactivity Index, the Interpersonal Reaction Inventory, the Assertiveness Inventory, the Locus of Control Inventory, the UCLA Emotional Loneliness Scale, the Self-Esteem Inventory, the Victim Empathy Scale, the Children and Sex Scale, the SHAPS Lie Scale, the Multiphasic Sex Inventory, and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. Groups were compared on dependent variables using analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons for interval scale variables and found to differ significantly on 11 of 18 variables. Clerical offenders were more conscientious than lay offenders, and were more agreeable, more empathically concerned, and reported greater <b>social</b> sexual <b>desirability</b> than normal controls. But they also had lower self-esteem than the normal control group. The lay offenders had greater neuroticism, less extraversion, less openness, more agreeableness, greater emotional loneliness, more empathic concern, more personal distress, lower self-esteem, less assertiveness, and <b>social</b> sexual <b>desirability</b> than normal controls. In addition to the ANOVAs a multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) was completed to identify which set of dependent variables best predicted group membership. The MDA identified 2 discriminant functions that predicted group membership of 72 % of participants. Function 1 which accounted for 76 % of the variance, distinguished clerical and lay offenders from normal controls and included these variables: agreeableness, self-esteem, openness, <b>social</b> sexual <b>desirability,</b> extraversion, personal distress and neuroticism. Function 2, which accounted for 23 % of the variance, distinguished clerical offenders from the other two groups and included these variables: under assertiveness, conscientiousness, empathic concern and emotional loneliness.

40|$|Multifunctional {{land use}} {{projects}} aim to concentrate and combine several socio-economic functions in {{one and the}} same area so as to save scarce space and to exploit synergies. The need for efficient urban land use has generated much interest in this (re) new(ed) form of urban architecture. However, despite its positive aspects, the realisation of multifunctional land use is often not easy. Issues of <b>social</b> (un) <b>desirability</b> of the project, spatial quality, as well as cost considerations, such as the distribution of the financial burden across different stakeholders, can be an important obstacle during the decision-making process. By means of a questionnaire among employees located at the multifunctional ‘Zuid WTC’ area in Amsterdam, we try to obtain more information about the benefits that different stakeholders attach to multifunctional land use projects, enabling us to assess issues such as willingness to pay of employees, preferences for specific infrastructure facilities, and the overall <b>social</b> (un) <b>desirability</b> of a multifunctional land use project. In this paper we present empirical evidence concerning the assessment of multifunctional land use by employees in the ‘Zuid WTC’ area, based on questions about preferences for the design of such an area and the value that employees attribute to it. ...|$|R
25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget’s theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and <b>social</b> <b>desirability</b> into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E
25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with <b>social</b> <b>desirability</b> biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of the}} nature connectedness construct.|$|E

This paper aims at contributing {{to the field of}} social entrepreneurship by clarifying key elements, providing working definitions, and illuminating the social entrepreneurship process.

In the second part we develop a model on how intentions to create a social venture -the tangible outcome of social entrepreneurship- get formed. Combining insights from traditional entrepreneurship literature and anecdotal evidence in the field of social entrepreneurship, we propose that behavioral intentions to create a social venture are influenced, first, by perceived <b>social</b> venture <b>desirability,</b> which is affected by attitudes such as empathy and moral judgment, and second, by perceived social venture feasibility, which is facilitated by social support and self-efficacy beliefs. entrepreneurship; social enterprise;...|$|R

In order to make informed choices on these objectives, the flow of information in society in general, and in accounting in particular, needs to cater for democratic decision-making. In democratic systems, Gray argues, there must then be flows of information in which those controlling the resources provide accounts to society of their use of those resources: a system of corporate accountability.|$|R

She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, [...] "they appear {{to be subject to}} many of the same problems". Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter's scale, Duttweiler's 28-item ICI uses a Likert-type scale in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of gratification. A small (133 student-subject) validation study indicated that the scale had good internal reliability (a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85).|$|E
2500|$|The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS). This scale {{measures}} how emotionally {{connected people}} feel {{to the natural}} world, animals, and plants. It also assesses people's perceived equality between nature and themselves. An example of an item is [...] "I recognize and appreciate the intelligence of other living organisms." [...] These items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) where higher scores demonstrate a higher connection to nature. This scale can be used both at the trait and state level. The state version is 13-items and shows acceptable reliability (α = [...]91,). The trait version is 14-items and also demonstrates good reliability (α = [...]82). This scale's validity is demonstrated by its positive associations with other environmental scales (such as the New Ecological Paradigm Scale) but is not associated with verbal ability or <b>social</b> <b>desirability.</b> See also Connectedness to nature scale.|$|E
50|$|In {{free market}} economies, the {{maximization}} of profits is a powerful driver of technological change. Generally, only those technologies are developed and reach the market that promise to maximize profits for the owners of incoming producing capital. Any technologies that fail to meet this criterion {{even though they may}} satisfy very important societal needs, are not developed. Therefore, technological change is a social process strongly biased by the financial interests of capital. There are currently no well established democratic processes, such as voting on the <b>social</b> or environmental <b>desirability</b> of a new technology prior to development and marketing, that would allow average citizens to direct the course of technological change.|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{from society}} is also seen within the {{homosexual}} community. Homosexual men are {{at greater risk}} of eating disorder symptoms than heterosexual men. Within the gay culture, muscularity gives the advantages of both <b>social</b> and sexual <b>desirability</b> and also power. These pressures and ideas that another homosexual male may desire a mate who is thinner or muscular can possibly lead to eating disorders. The higher eating disorder symptom score reported, the more concern about how others perceive them and the more frequent and excessive exercise sessions occur. High levels of body dissatisfaction are also linked to external motivation to working out and old age; however, having a thin and muscular body occurs within younger homosexual males than older.|$|R

2500|$|Brody Costa et al. {{suggest that}} women's vaginal orgasm {{consistency}} {{is associated with}} being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina is the important zone for inducing female orgasm. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and preference for above-average penis length. Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip. His research indicates that [...] " [...] prominent and sharply raised lip tubercle {{has been associated with}} greater odds (odds ratio = 12.3) of ever having a vaginal orgasm, and also with greater past month vaginal orgasm consistency (an effect driven by the women who never had a vaginal orgasm), than less prominent lip tubercle categories."

[...] The first sample was of exclusively monogamous individuals that were not told the nature of what was being studied, and found that those with high attachment avoidance tended to view CNM more positively as well as being more willing to engage in it (but had not actually engaged in it). [...] The authors theorized this was [...] "because these relationships promote distance from their partners and support their accepting attitudes toward uncommitted and casual sex." [...] Individuals with high attachment anxiety tended to view CNM negatively, but no correlation was found regarding willingness to engage in it. [...] The second sample was a targeted recruitment of individuals currently engaged in CNM relationships. [...] This sample showed low levels of attachment avoidance, and no correlation related to attachment anxiety. [...] The lack of correlation with anxiety in either sample with regards to willingness or actual engagement suggested it may have little impact on the matter. [...] The large disparity in attachment avoidance between those willing to engage in CNM and those that actually engage in it could not be fully explained with{{in the context of}} the study, but the authors offer several hypotheses. [...] The study also had a few limitations, including that all subjects were heterosexual, the data was anonymous self-report and the second sample may have suffered from <b>social</b> <b>desirability</b> bias due to its targeted recruitment.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that group living poses certain {{challenges}} in that some individuals will be potentially threatening (eliciting either fight and flight or submissive responses), while others offer potential opportunities for reproduction, and forming cooperative, sharing alliances (requiring approach and display behaviour). The navigation of these challenges has led to the evolution of mechanisms for the estimation of threat versus opportunity (approach and avoidance). This chapter explores social anxiety in this evolutionary context. It highlights recent adaptations to social competition by which social rank and position are competed for with demonstrations of attractiveness (e. g., talent, physical beauty, humour, intelligence, personality, altruism). This is competition to be chosen by others for various roles (e. g., as friends, team mates, sexual partners, work employees). This chapter builds on earlier models of social anxiety which focused on impression management, and links them to evolutionary concepts of <b>social</b> status and <b>desirability</b> competition...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate negative attitudes concerning the eating disorder anorexia nervosa (AN). Method:A vignette describing a fictional 15 -year-old female meeting diagnostic criteria for AN was presented to 250 female university students, followed by a series of questions designed to assess perceptions of severity, self-centredness, contribution to society, <b>social</b> distance and <b>desirability.</b> Participants' levels of eating disorder psychopathology and familiarity with the problem described were also assessed. Results:Whereas attitudes were generally positive, negative attitudes were apparent in responses to items addressing self-centredness and social distance. In addition, many participants had at some stage thought that it “might not be too bad” to have the problem described. Exposure to information concerning the problem described through film or television was associated with less negative attitudes, whereas other types of exposure had little or no effect. Conclusions:Negative attitudes towards individuals affected by AN exist among women in the community, as well as ambivalence concerning the severity of the disorder.

The present paper follows this tradition and describes a prototype of a care robot that is endowed with affective capabilities. The paper describes some of the potential ethical problems arising from such a technology. This aspect of the paper is based on prior research in a European-funded technology foresight project that explored the ethical issues of emerging ICTs. The paper goes beyond the description of technical innovation and its ethical consequences. The recognition of the ethical relevance of research and innovation has spawned a discourse around responsible research and innovation. The paper draws on this discourse, which aims at anticipatory technology governance to ensure the <b>social</b> acceptability and <b>desirability</b> of technologies. The prototype vignette of the paper explores how responsible research and innovation could be realised in practice and {{how it could be}} used to address ethical issues such as those of affective care robots.

In this sense, it demonstrates moral innovation. It analyzes numerous cases and proposes perspectives that are rarely discussed in this emerging field (current practices of ethical evaluation, concerns of the integrity of research, means for participatory technological evaluation, etc.).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 74 - 78) Suggested as {{an alternative}} to the traditional normative methodology for the understanding and prediction of discretionary travel is the concept of individual and group influenced perceptions of movement space. The normative approach has long emphasized the importance of precisely measured physical, temporal and economic distance as the determinants of spatial interaction. Considering behaviorally those "determinants??? of travel, it is evident that miles, dollars, and hours are incorrectly perceived and that such errors in judgment may be a function of particular life styles. Possibly of greater relevance to the understanding of travel systems is the notion of socio-cultural distance; the idea that group influences direct the manner in which people perceive the <b>social</b> accessibility or <b>desirability</b> of particular destinations. The system of air travel between the mainland United States and Hawaii is chosen as an appropriate network from which examples of these concepts are drawn. Extending these considerations, a model is proposed whereby subjective responses regarding the accessibility and desirability of a place are used to locate places within movement space. This artificial placement divorces the perception of accessibility from traditional considerations of distance. The marketing implications of identifying such propensities to travel are obvious and guidelines for future behavioral research into transportation are suggested...|$|R
