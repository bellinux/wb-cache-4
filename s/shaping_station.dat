50|$|Voorschoten is {{a railway}} station in Voorschoten, Netherlands. The first station opened on 1 May 1843 on the Amsterdam-Rotterdam railway. A new station {{building}} opened in 1886 and was closed on 17 September 1944. The station re-opened in 1969 and a hexagonal <b>shaped</b> <b>station</b> building opened. A new station was opened in 1995. The train services are operated by Nederlandse Spoorwegen.|$|R

It also had a goods yard with two sidings and facilities for coal, livestock and general freight. The goods shed was just a small structure by the side of the station building on the R&MR down platform.|$|R
50|$|Ludwigshafen (Rhein) Hauptbahnhof is {{a railway}} station at Ludwigshafen am Rhein in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. A {{combination}} of a wedge <b>shaped</b> <b>station</b> and a two-level interchange, the station is at the junction on the lines from Mainz and Neustadt an der Weinstrasse to Mannheim. It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 2 station. The Ludwigshafen station was built in 1847 as a terminal station in the centre of modern Ludwigshafen. The current station was built in 1969 {{to the west of}} the city centre, but has not proved to be a success due to its poor location.|$|R

Subsequent extension works, such as the 1926 building of the westbound platforms, <b>shaped</b> the <b>station</b> into the “L” form, typical of expanded transit stations. The introduction of new platforms at the eastern half in 1934, brought another change to the station's configuration.|$|R
50|$|While WERG’s new Modern Rock format took <b>shape,</b> <b>station</b> {{management}} {{was looking for}} a new identity to go with the station’s new sound. Student manager Scott Powell was in Pittsburgh one weekend and listening to the “war” between the two Contemporary Hit stations in the city: B-94 and Energy 105. Something clicked. “Energy” was not only a good-sounding name, it fit the call letters of the station as well: WERG. ENERGY. On the morning of August 29, 1989, WERG began identifying itself as Energy-FM 90. Program Director Andy McNutt developed the station’s signature sound as a home for the best new rock on Erie’s radio dial, with a playlist featuring artists like U2, R.E.M., Depeche Mode, Concrete Blonde, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Michelle Shocked, Pere Ubu, Big Audio Dynamite, Sting, Social Distortion, the Hoodoo Gurus, and Sarah McLachlan. Songs by groups like EMF and The Divinyls-which Energy-FM premiered-went on to become #1 hits on the Pop Charts that summer.|$|R

500|$|Early {{stages of}} the MRT's {{construction}} paid relatively scant attention to station design, {{with an emphasis on}} functionality over aesthetics.

An exception to this was Orchard, chosen by its designers to be a [...] "showpiece" [...] of the system and built initially with a domed roof. Architectural themes became a more important issue only in subsequent stages, and resulted in such designs as the cylindrical <b>station</b> <b>shapes</b> on all <b>stations</b> between Kallang and Pasir Ris except Eunos, and west of Boon Lay, and the perched roofs at Boon Lay, Lakeside, Chinese Garden, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Choa Chu Kang, Khatib, Yishun and Eunos stations.|$|R

Most, though not all, corners have gazebos for protection from sun and wind.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} docking {{maneuver}} for an underactuated {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV) to dock into a funnel <b>shaped</b> docking <b>station.</b> The novelty of the proposed approach is enabling an underactuated AUV that is unable to control its sway motion, to dock with no crab angle, {{in the presence of}} cross-currents. Docking without a crab angle can be beneficial in cases where the geometry of the docking station entrance does not allow entering with crab angles. In order to successfully dock under such restrictions, a path planner and two guidance laws are proposed. By properly switching between the two guidance laws, it is possible for the vehicle to slide cross-current into the docking station...|$|R

50|$|Preparations for the {{introduction}} of the metric system in the Kingdom of Saxony were made as part of the work of the Standardization Commission (Normalaichungscommission), led by Albert Christian Weinlig and Julius Ambrosius Hülße. These two men envisaged a transition phase from the old units. Almost simultaneously, similar efforts were being made {{at the level of the}} German Confederation. A new survey was carried out in 1858, and between 1859 and 1865 a new system of milestones - the Royal Saxon milestones were made in the <b>shape</b> of <b>station</b> milestones (Stationssteine), full mile, half mile, junction (Abzweig-) and border crossing stones (Grenzübergangssteine), noting that, from 1840, 1 mile = 7.5 km. Upon the full introduction of the metric system around 1900, some of these were converted to kilometer, chaussee, boundary (Flurgrenz) and roadkeeper stones (Straßenwärtersteine).|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{we cannot}} exclude the {{possible}} effects that dispersive propagation could have on ducted Pc 1 waves. The effect can {{also contribute to}} the formation of Pc 1 pearl structures in the ionosphere. Because the group velocity of dispersive waves differs from the phase speed, it can cause the modulation of wave amplitude in a wave packet. The high-latitude transmission and reflection properties of the ionosphere in the Pc 1 frequency range is related to the wave number ω and the wave vector κ (Greifinger [1972]). As shown by model calculations by Fujita ([1987], [1988], the group velocity of Pc 1 pulsations as a function of frequency increases near the lower cut off frequency. If the observed Pc 1 waves have a broad bandwidth, the amplitude modulation of Pc 1 waves could be caused by dispersive propagation through the ionospheric duct. From our observations, Pc 1 pearl structures can have different <b>shapes</b> at different <b>stations</b> (case 1) and similar <b>shapes</b> at different <b>stations</b> (case 2). The bandwidth of case 1 (approximately 0.5 Hz) was wider than that of case 2 approximately, suggesting that dispersive propagation contributes more to the creation of Pc 1 pearl structures in the first case. However, in this study, we cannot quantify the contribution of this effect to the creation of Pc 1 pearl structures in the ionosphere.|$|R

The solar charge station is constructed on Classrooms Building in Engineering Faculty of Izmir Institute of Technology. Sixteen monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules having the dimensions of 1. 293 mx 0. 329 mx 0. 034 m and 55 W power rating are used as the photovoltaic generator of the solar charge station. Modules are mounted as if they create an. Omega Shape. which gives its name to the station (Omega Type Solar Charge Station). Vertical and tilted reflectors are used to enhance the electricity generation. Generated electricity is used to charge a lead acid battery, which is protected by five solar charge regulators in order to prevent discharging and overcharging. 50 W halogen lamps working with direct current are chosen as the loads. The system is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical results have shown that Omega Type Solar Charge Station generates more or less steady electricity, approximately 240 MJ through a year period. The reflectors operate better in winter than in summer, theoretically. According to the <b>stations</b> <b>shape,</b> it uses less space on rooftops. Experiments have shown that efficiency of the charge station during summer is considerably high. The efficiencies calculated by using direct solar radiation on inclined surface is 31. 65315 %, for the experiment on 21. 08. 2003, 27. 90379 % for the experiment carried out without reflectors on 11. 09. 2003 and 35. 70939 % for the experiment carried out with optimum inclination angles for September, on 12. 09. 2003.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} {{was used}} to compare the most used trend analysis techniques on data series of ionic concentrations in atmospheric deposition. The Seasonal Kendall Test (SKT) showed the highest power, which increased in particular when using original weekly data instead of pooling together the samples in monthly or yearly volume-weighted averages. The simulation also showed that differences in power among tests and pooling intervals would be negligible for data series longer than about 12 years. We tested these results using data from a network of bulk deposition samplers at nine forest sites in Italy, for which data have been available since 1998. These sites were selected in different forests, ranging from arid Mediterranean evergreen oak forest to rainy Alpine beech or spruce forests. The results showed relevant differences as regards the number of significant trends detected using different techniques and different data pooling, even for 13 -year data series.
