40|$|The low use of {{improved}} rice seed by farmers in west Africa {{is not well}} understood. This study assessed how institutional settings and stakeholder perceptions in the formal rice seed sector inhibit small-scale farmers’ access to improved seed. Data were collected in s Guinea, west Africa, in 2007 and 2008. To understand the dynamics of seed interventions in Guinea since the 1980 s, key persons were interviewed and relevant literature was reviewed. The results show that, although local seed dealers {{play a central role}} in providing seed of local and improved varieties to farmers, seed interventions have mainly relied on the national extension system, NGOs and a new class of contract <b>seed</b> <b>producers</b> that abide by rules and regulations set by the formal seed system. Within a linear model of seed sector development, governmental organizations, the most influential stakeholders of the formal seed system, have been unaware of the central role of local seed dealers in the informal seed system. We argue that in the context of weak extension service due to lack of financial and human resources, farmer-to-farmer dissemination approach centered on the local <b>seed</b> <b>producers</b> and dealers is an option that could be explored to enhance small-scale farmers’ access to improved seed.

40|$|The {{subject of}} market power is {{discussed}} frequently in debates about subsidies for ethanol production, and structural {{conditions in the}} industry create a prima-facie case for concerns about market power. This paper develops a prototype model for determining the production and price impacts and distribution of benefits from the U.

The impact of the subsidy is analyzed within a simulation framework for alternative levels of market power. Results demonstrate that the impacts on prices and output are limited for modest departures from competition. Distributional impacts are much greater. <b>Seed</b> <b>producers</b> and corn processors with market power are able to capture relatively large shares of the benefits from the subsidy. A perhaps surprising result is that upstream oligopoly power exercised by <b>seed</b> <b>producers</b> is prospectively as important in influencing the positive and distributional impacts of the subsidy as the much more frequently discussed and debated prospect that downstream corn processors may exercise buyer power.
