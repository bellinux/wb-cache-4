5000|$|Construction aggregate, {{or simply}} [...] "aggregate", {{is a broad}} {{category}} of coarse particulate material used in construction, including <b>sand,</b> gravel, <b>crushed</b> stone, <b>slag,</b> recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world. Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete; the aggregate serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite material. Due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity value as compared to most soils, aggregates are widely used in drainage applications such as foundation and French drains, septic drain fields, retaining wall drains, and road side edge drains. Aggregates are also used as base material under foundations, roads, and railroads. In other words, aggregates are used as a stable foundation or road/rail base with predictable, uniform properties (e.g. to help prevent differential settling under the road or building), or as a low-cost extender that binds with more expensive cement or asphalt to form concrete.|$|R

In India current guidelines recommend using natural <b>sand,</b> <b>crushed</b> gravel, stone or slag or combination of these, in the GSB layer. While the above combinations may fulfil the structural requirement, {{it is not clear whether}} they meet the minimum drainage requirements of 300 m/day as per AASHTO specifications. This paper summarizes the laboratory permeability carried out on 1) Crushed stone aggregates and slag in different combinations with non plastic fines such as quarry dust and 2) Gravel- Aggregate combination in the ratio 60 : 40. The first combination was tried for Grade III requirements as per MORT&H specification (5 th Revision) for High volume roads. The second combination was tried for Grade III requirements as per rural roads Manual, IRC SP 20, used for low volume roads in India. The objective is to compare the permeability characteristics of GSB gradations prepared with different mixes in order to assess their ability to drain, based on the permeability criteria. Horizontal and vertical permeability were tested in the laboratory for these GSB mixes and the results have been reported. From the study it is observed that while all the combinations of <b>crushed</b> stone – <b>slag</b> <b>mixes</b> meet the minimum permeability criteria in the horizontal as well as vertical directions, 100 % granulated steel slag (GLDS) does not meet the requirement in the vertical direction.

40|$|The {{effects of}} pore {{structure}} of concrete made with slag-blended cement on shrinkage behavior of concrete {{when exposed to}} drying were presented in this paper. The investigated parameters were the length of curing (1 -day and 7 -day curing), slag and gypsum contents in mixtures.

The results show that 65 % slag concrete with 7 -day curing exhibited the lowest shrinkage evolution compared to 0, 35, 50 % <b>slag</b> <b>mixes.</b> This is attributed to the highest pore radius where meniscus forms when drying in these concretes. It was found that addition of gypsum in <b>slag</b> <b>mixes</b> tend to reduce the nanopores (within the range from 4 to 20 nm pore size) and decrease the proportion of mesopores.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to use industrial wastes rather than natural soil, aggregates, etc. in roads and highway construction after enhancing its strength, stability and durability. Conventionally, soil, stone aggregates, sand, bitumen, cement etc. are used in construction of roads and highway. Characteristic materials being limited in nature and thereby need of alternate materials is necessary. Gigantic quantities of soil are utilized {{as a part of}} the development of street and parkway yet adequate quantity of soil of required quality is not available effectively. To meet this demand extensive deforestation is being done which cause deforestation, soil disintegration and loss of rich soil which hampers in the farming efficiency. Additionally, cost of procurement of suitable quality of material is increasing. Worried about this, the researchers are searching for option materials for thruway development, and modern waste item is one such class. Stabilization method highlighted in this thesis is mainly to enhance the inherent strength of wastes like fly ash and <b>crushed</b> blast furnace <b>slag</b> (CBFS). This will automatically reduce the use of natural soil in addition to mitigate the disposal problems of industrial solid wastes in a great way. Fly ash and blast furnace slag was collected from Rourkela steel plant (RSP). Tests were conducted by blending fly ash and blast furnace slag in different proportions. The compaction characteristics, strength properties and the bearing value of different mixes are determined. From the compaction tests the optimum moisture content and the maximum dry density are determined for respective mixes. The strength parameters that are the unconfined compressive strength and CBR value for different mixes compacted to their respective MDD at OMC are evaluated. Further these mixes are blended with lime varying as 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 8 % and the UCS values are determined after a curing period of 0, 7 and 28 days. Similarly, the soaked CBR values of lime stabilized mixes at 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 8 % are determined after a curing period of 0 and 28 days. The effect of lime, curing period, fly ash and slag content with the unconfined compressive strength values and California bearing ratio values were studied. From the experimental study, it was observed that with addition of blast furnace slag to fly ash- <b>slag</b> <b>mixes,</b> the MDD increases and thereby decreases its OMC value linearly. It was also observed that the UCS value of the fly ash- <b>slag</b> <b>mixes</b> increases with the addition of slag up to slag content of 80 % and there after the same decreases with further increases in <b>slag</b> content. The <b>mix</b> with 80 % slag shows higher value as compared to 100 % <b>slag</b> in the <b>mix.</b> Similar trend was observed for the CBR value for the fly ash- <b>slag</b> <b>mixes,</b> and it was seen that with increase with the slag content the CBR values also increases. However, for 100 % slag the CBR shows a lesser value. Higher UCS and CBR values were reported at 8 % lime content having a curing period of 28 days. The {{objective of}} the present study is to access the suitability of lime stabilized fly ash- blast furnace <b>slag</b> <b>mixes</b> as a highway construction material. So it is concluded that appropriate blending of fly ash with slag gives a better strength compared to individual materials. Further the desired strength required for different component of road can be achieved by stabilizing the mix with appropriate amount of lime...|$|R

C.) contain a mixture of lime and volcanic clay). The Egyptians (XXVI century B. C.) used mixed with straw to bind dried bricks, gypsum and lime mortars in stone masonry (in particular for the construction of pyramids); the Assyrians and Babylonians used clay as the bonding substance instead. The Greeks inhabitants in Crete and Cyprus used lime mortars as well (Eight century B. C.), whereas Babylonians and Syrians used bitumen to construct stone and brick masonries. Ancient Greeks, similarly, used claimed limestone, while Romans made the first concrete (opus caementicium) : mixed lime putty with brick dust or volcanic ash; Romans used with stone to construct roadways, buildings and aqueducts and walls around a fourth-century B. C. and “by the second century B. C. the new material began to be used for buildings in Rome” (Elliot C. D., 1992, p. 167). B. Herring and S. Miller wrote (Miller S., 2002, p. 16) : Lime-coated mud walls were constructed in central India as early as 2, 500 B. C., and many early civilizations, including that of the Romans, used it as a sort of stucco covering for mud walls and other crude structures.
