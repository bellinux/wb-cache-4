40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop a new algorithm for the detection of subpixel scale target materials on the hyperspectral imagery. The <b>signal</b> <b>decision</b> theory is typically to decide the existence of a target signal embedded in the random noise. This implies that the detection problem can be mathematically formalized by <b>signal</b> <b>decision</b> theory based on the statistical hypothesis test. In particular, since any target signature provided by airborne/spaceborne sensors is embedded in a structured noise such as background or clutter signatures as well as broad band unstructured noise, the problem becomes more complicated, and particularly much more under the unknown noise structure. The approach is based on the statistical hypothesis method known as Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). The use of GLRT requires estimating the unknown parameters, and assumes the prior information of two subspaces describing target variation and background variation respectively. Therefore, {{this research}} consists of two parts, the implementation of GLRT and the characterization of two subspaces through new approaches. Results obtained from computer simulation, HYDICE image and AVI RIS image show that this approach is feasible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] - This paper proposes an {{architectural}} {{approach to the}} design of low power VLSI for reconfigurable FIR filter. Depending on the magnitude of both the filter coefficients and inputs, the filter order can be dynamically changed. In other words, when the product of data sample and the coefficient is so small, as to reduce the effect of partial sum in FIR filter, the multiplication operation could be simply canceled. Generally, the amount of power consumption depends on the amount of operation, if dynamically cancelled off some of the multipliers; significant power savings could be achieved. However, switching activities on the multiplier lead to Dynamic Power Consumption. A Multiplier Control <b>Signal</b> <b>Decision</b> Window (MCSD) is used to solve the switching problem...|$|E

The VAD method proposed in this paper inte-grates multiple speech features and a <b>signal</b> <b>decision</b> scheme, namely the speech periodic to aperiodic component ratio and a switching Kalman filter. The integration is carried out by using the weighted sum of likelihoods outputted from each VAD (stream). The stream weight is decided adaptively each short time frame. The evaluation is carried out by using a VAD evaluation framework, CENSREC- 1 -C. The evaluation results revealed that the proposed method sig-nificantly outperforms the baseline results of CENSREC- 1 -C as re-gards VAD accuracy in real environments. In addition, we carried out speech recognition evaluations by using detected speech signals, and confirmed that the proposed method contributes to an improve-ment in speech recognition accuracy.

30|$|We analyze {{an optical}} {{wireless}} sensor network system that uses corner cube retroreflectors (CCRs). A CCR consists of three flat mirrors in a concave configuration. When a light beam enters the CCR, it bounces off {{each of the three}} mirrors, and is reflected back parallel to the direction it entered. A CCR can send information to the base station by modulating the reflected beam by vibrating the CCR or interrupting the light path; the most suitable transmission format is on-off keying (OOK). The CCR is attractive in many optical communication applications because it is small, easy to operate, and has low power consumption. This paper examines two <b>signal</b> <b>decision</b> schemes for use at the base station: collective decision and majority decision. In collective decision, all optical signals detected by the sensors are received by one photodetector (PD), and its output is subjected to hard decision. In majority decision, the outputs of the PDs associated with the sensors are subjected to hard detection, and the final data is decided by majority decision. We show that increasing the number of sensors improves the bit error rate (BER). We also show that when the transmitted optical power is sufficiently large, BER depends on sensor accuracy. We confirm that collective decision yields lower BERs than majority decision.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{activity}} of individual sensory neurons can be predictive of an animal’s choices. These <b>decision</b> <b>signals</b> arise from network properties dependent on feedforward and feedback inputs; however, the relative contributions of these inputs are poorly understood. We determined {{the role of}} feedforward pathways to <b>decision</b> <b>signals</b> in MT by recording neuronal activity while monkeys performed motion and depth tasks. During each session, we reversibly inactivated V 2 and V 3, which provide feedforward input to MT that conveys more information about depth than motion. We thus monitored the choice-related {{activity of}} the same neuron both before and during V 2 /V 3 inactivation. During inactivation, MT neurons became less predictive of decisions for the depth task but not the motion task, indicating that a feedforward pathway that gives rise to tuning preferences also contributes to <b>decision</b> <b>signals.</b> We show that our data are consistent with V 2 /V 3 input conferring structured noise correlations onto the MT population...|$|R

By means of this on-line process, sensor and decision agents learn the semantics of the communication action-signals. To expand our proposal to a large number of agents we deployed a hierarchical architecture composed of several levels. In this hierarchical architecture, communication signals flow from lower to higher hierarchical layers. To evaluate our architecture with large numbers of agents and a variety of information sources we used two simulated environments and created diverse tests emulating attacks under different network conditions. We found that our approach yielded positive results in its performance levels using predefined criteria. In the network environment we evaluated the performance of our proposal versus hand-coded solutions emulating simple misuse intrusion detection and a hybrid approach using misuse and anomaly methods. We found that our learning approach generates better results than the simple hand-coded misuse methods. Even though the hybrid hand-coded approach shows slightly better results than the learning mechanism, the main advantage of our learning method is that it does not need a designer with deep prior knowledge about the network environment. The agent architecture and the RL for signalling approach presented in this research can be applied to domains other than IDS. Domains where this methodology could be applied are Intrusion Prevention Systems, Network Management and Quality of Service enforcement. ...|$|R
