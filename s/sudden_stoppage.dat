The policy severely disrupted river-borne {{movement of}} labour, supplies and food, and compromised the livelihoods of boatmen and fishermen.

Moreover, artisans and other groups who relied on boat transport to carry goods to market were offered no recompense whatsoever; neither were rice growers nor the network of migratory labourers. The large-scale removal or destruction of rural boats, indispensable vehicles in the internal transport system of districts such as Khulna, 24Parganas, Bakargunj and Tipperah, caused a near-complete breakdown of the existing transport and administration infrastructure and market system for movement of rice paddy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a new model of}} gamma ray burst (GRB) that explains its observed prompt signals, namely, its primary quasi-thermal spectrum and high energy tail. This mechanism can be applied to either assumption of GRB progenitor: coalescence of compact objects or hy-pernova explosion. The key ingredients of our model are: (1) The initial stage of a GRB {{is in the form of}} a relativistic quark-gluon plasma lava”; (2) The expansion and cooling of this lava results in a QCD phase tran-sition that induces a <b>sudden</b> gravitational <b>stoppage</b> of the condensed non-relativistic baryons and form a hadrosphere; (3) Acoustic shocks and Alfven waves (magnetoquakes) that erupt in episodes from the epicenter efficiently transport the thermal energy to the hadrospheric surface and induce a rapid detachment of leptons and photons from the hadrons; (4) The detached e+e − and γ form an opaque, relativis-tically hot leptosphere, which expands and cools to T ∼ mc 2, or 0. 5 MeV, where e+e − → 2 γ and its reverse process becomes unbalanced, and the GRB photons are finally released; (5) The mode-conversion” of Alfven waves into electromagnetic waves in the leptosphere provides a snowplow acceleration and deceleration that gives rise to both the high energy spectrum of GRB and the erosion of its thermal spec-trum down to a quasi-thermal distribution. According to this model, the observed GRB photons should have a redshifted peak frequency at Ep ∼ Γ(1 + β/ 2) mc 2 /(1 + z), where Γ ∼ O(1) is the Lorentz factor of the bulk flow of the lava, which may be determined from the existing GRB data. 0 Originally released as SLAC-PUB- 8874 in 2001, this paper was never formally published...|$|R

40|$|In-memory {{computing}} {{is gaining}} popularity {{as a means}} of sidestepping the performance bottlenecks of traditional block-based storage devices. However, the volatile nature of DRAM makes these systems vulnerable to system crashes, while the need to continuously refresh massive amounts of passive memory-resident data increases power consumption. Emerging storage-class memory (SCM) technologies, like Phase Change Memory and Memristors, combine fast DRAM-like cache-line access granularity with the persistence of storage devices like disks or SSDs, resulting in potential 10 x - 100 x performance gains, and low passive power consumption. This unification of storage and memory into a single directly-accessible persistent storage tier is a mixed blessing, as it pushes upon developers the burden of ensuring that SCM stores are ordered correctly, flushed from processor caches, and if interrupted by <b>sudden</b> machine <b>stoppage,</b> not left in inconsistent states. The complexity of ensuring properly ordered and all-or-nothing updates is addressed in this thesis in both a software-hardware architecture and a software-only based solution. This thesis extends and evaluates a software-hardware architecture called WrAP, or Write-Aside Persistence, for atomic stores to SCM. This thesis also presents SoftWrAP, a library for Software based Write-Aside Persistence, which provides lightweight atomicity and durability for SCM storage transactions. Both methods are shown to provide atomicity and durability while simultaneously ensuring that fast paths through the cache, DRAM, and persistent memory layers are not slowed down by burdensome buffering or double-copying requirements. Software-hardware architecture evaluation of trace-driven simulation of transactional data structures indicates the potential for significant performance gains using the WrAP approach. The SoftWrAP library is evaluated with both handcrafted SCM- based micro-benchmarks as well as existing applications, specifically the STX B+Tree library and SQLite database, backed by emulated SCM. Our results show the ease of using the API to create atomic persistent regions and the significant benefits of SoftWrAP over existing methods such as undo logging and shadow copying. SoftWrAP can match non-atomic durable writes to SCM, thereby gaining atomic consistency almost for free...|$|R
40|$|Bearing {{is one of}} the {{important}} things in machining. Bearing are considered as critical mechanical components and a defect in a bearing causes malfunction to machine. Failed machines can lead to economic loss and safety problems due to unexpected and <b>sudden</b> production <b>stoppages.</b> These machines need to be monitored during the production process. Because of that, on-line condition monitoring become alternatives to solve this problem compared with off-line monitoring. Objective of this project is to analyze data acquired from testing of fault detection to differentiate between the defective bearings and good bearings using an accelerometer. A set of good bearing and defective bearing with different failure was using in this experiment. Four units of bearing which is one is good bearing, one corroded bearing, one sandy bearing, and one bearing with damage at the ball was used in this experiment. The data were obtained from experiment on test rig using Bruel & Kjaer accelerometer and data acquisition system. All the bearings were run with different speed which is 4000 rpm, 7000 rpm, and 10000 rpm. The data were analyzed using PULSE LabShop software. The data from three rotations for each bearing was analyzed using time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain analysis. The time-frequency domain method used in this experiment is Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), and S-transform. STFT and S-transform are applied to detect the location of the signal that has high vibration. The highly damaged bearing is detected based on the high magnitude distribution value in the obtained time-frequency domain. Based on the result, it has a different in vibration between all the bearings. The data for a good bearing were used as benchmark to compare with the defective bearing. For a good bearing, higher vibrations occur at low frequency which is below than 5 kHz using a STFT and below 5 μHz when using S-transform. For the defective bearings, the higher vibrations occur at high frequency which is above than 5 kHz when using a STFT analysis and above 5 μHz when using S-transform. From the graph, the different between good bearing and defective bearings can be made. The findings indicate that time frequency localization transform method can be used to develop an effective condition monitoring tool. The use of signal processing analysis in this study can be used in industrial applications. This signal processing analysis is recommended to use in on-line monitoring of parameters while the machine is producing...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was strange}} enough, {{in the silence}} of midnight, and the dead stillness that seemed to be created by the <b>sudden</b> and {{unexpected}} <b>stoppage</b> of the engine which had been clanking and blasting in our ears incessantly for so many days, to watch the look of blank astonishment expressed in every face: beginning with the officers, tracing it through all the passengers, and descending to the very stokers and furnacemen, who emerged from below, one by one, and clustered together in a smoky group about the hatchway of the engine-room, comparing notes in whispers. After throwing up a few rockets and firing signal guns in the hope of being hailed from the land, or at least of seeing a light - but without any other sight or sound presenting itself - it was determined to send a boat on shore. It was amusing to observe how very kind some of the passengers were, in volunteering to go ashore in this same boat: [...] for the general good, of course: not by any means because they thought the ship in an unsafe position, or contemplated the possibility of her heeling over in case the tide were running out. [...] Nor was it less amusing to remark how desperately unpopular the poor pilot became in one short minute. He had had his passage out from Liverpool, and during the whole voyage had been quite a notorious character, as a teller of anecdotes and cracker of jokes.

60|$|And now, {{fragments}} of ruinous enclosure, yawning window-gap and crazy wall, deserted houses, leaking wells, broken water-tanks, spectral cypress-trees, patches of tangled vine, {{and the changing}} of the track to a long, irregular, disordered lane where everything was crumbling away, from the unsightly buildings to the jolting road--now, these objects showed that they were nearing Rome. And now, a <b>sudden</b> twist and <b>stoppage</b> of the carriage inspired Mr Dorrit with the mistrust that the brigand moment was come for twisting him into a ditch and robbing him; until, letting down the glass again and looking out, he perceived himself assailed by nothing worse than a funeral procession, which came mechanically chaunting by, with an indistinct show of dirty vestments, lurid torches, swinging censers, and a great cross borne before a priest. He was an ugly priest by torchlight; of a lowering aspect, with an overhanging brow; and as his eyes met those of Mr Dorrit, looking bareheaded out of the carriage, his lips, moving as they chaunted, seemed to threaten that important traveller; likewise the action of his hand, which was in fact his manner of returning the traveller's salutation, seemed to come in aid of that menace. So thought Mr Dorrit, made fanciful by the weariness of building and travelling, as the priest drifted past him, and the procession straggled away, taking its dead along with it. Upon their so-different way went Mr Dorrit's company too; and soon, with their coach load of luxuries from the two great capitals of Europe, they were (like the Goths reversed) beating at the gates of Rome.|$|R

Before I could make out what it was, almost before I could think, the boat flew up into the air, as if a powder magazine had exploded beneath it.

Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a <b>sudden</b> <b>stoppage</b> of the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The driver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became interested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over their last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a consultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside, but they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.|$|E
60|$|He had not {{to remain}} long in suspense. The wooden fence that {{enclosed}} the stable-yard lay before him.

As he did not at the moment see that there was anything better to be done, he prepared for it. As the horse bent on his haunches to spring, he gave him a smart cut with the whip, went over like a rocket, and plunged up to the neck in the snow-drift, which brought his career to an abrupt conclusion. The <b>sudden</b> <b>stoppage</b> of the horse was one thing, but the arresting of Master Charley was another and quite a different thing.

The signal was given to stop the engines--to back them--to stop again. Eager inquiries followed--"What's that? Did you feel it? Hear it? Could it be a rock? Impossible, surely?" [...] No one could answer with knowledge or authority, save those who were too busy to be spoken to.

Under the impulse of lightheartedness, caused by the feeling that his labours for the time were nearly ended, and that his reward was about to be reaped, he went about with irresistible energy, like the proverbial bull in a china shop, without {{reaching}} that creature's destructive point. It was then that a beaming smile overspread his countenance, and he raged about the kitchen with Vulcan-like joviality. He pulled out the table from the wall to the centre of the apartment, with a swing that produced a prolonged crash. Up went its two leaves with two minor crashes. Down went the four plates and the cups and saucers, with such violence and rapidity that they all seemed to be dancing on the board together.

The instant it is thrown the first sailor turns the sand-glass. The log, being loaded on one side, floats perpendicularly in the water, {{remaining}} stationary of course; while the man who hove it watches sundry knots on the line as they pass over the stern of the ship, each knot representing a mile of rate of speed in the hour. As the last grain of sand drops to the bottom of the glass the first sailor gives a sharp signal, and the second clutches and checks the line, examines the knot nearest his hand, and thus knows at once how many knots or miles the ship is sailing at that time. The <b>sudden</b> <b>stoppage</b> of the line jerks the peg, before referred to, out of the log, thereby allowing the other two fixed cords to drag it flat and unresisting over the surface of the sea, when the line is reeled up and put by.

60|$|AFTER his {{marriage}} Sir Ratcliffe determined to reside at Armine. In {{one of the}} largest parks in England there yet remained a fragment of a vast Elizabethan pile, that in old days bore the name of Armine Place. When Sir Ferdinand had commenced building Armine Castle, he had pulled down the old mansion, partly for the sake of its site and partly for the sake of its materials. Long lines of turreted and many-windowed walls, tall towers, and lofty arches, now rose in picturesque confusion on the green ascent where heretofore old Sir Walsingham had raised the fair and convenient dwelling, which he justly deemed might have served the purpose of a long posterity. The hall and chief staircase of the castle and a gallery alone were finished, and many a day had Sir Ferdinand passed in arranging the pictures, the armour, and choice rarities of these magnificent apartments. The rest of the building was a mere shell; nor was it in all parts even roofed in. Heaps of bricks and stone and piles of timber appeared in every direction; and traces of the <b>sudden</b> <b>stoppage</b> of a great work might be observed in the temporary saw-pits still remaining, the sheds for the workmen, and the kilns and furnaces, which never had been removed. Time, however, that had stained the neglected towers with an antique tint, and had permitted many a generation of summer birds to build their sunny nests on all the coignes of vantage of the unfinished walls, had exercised a mellowing influence even on these rude accessories, {{and in the course of}} years they had been so drenched by the rain, and so buffeted by the wind, and had become so covered with moss and ivy, that they rather added to then detracted from the picturesque character of the whole mass.|$|E

50|$|As liquid starts {{filling the}} collabsible bladder a {{pressure}} drop inside the bladder causes the bladder to collapse and {{cutting off the}} fluid flow into the 'U' shaped tube (<b>sudden</b> <b>stoppage</b> of flow). As a result, a pulsatile flow is produced because of the continuously collapsing bladder. As the collapsing goes on the ‘U’ shaped tube strikes down with strong force pulling the spring down which was supporting the ‘U’ shaped tube from above. The force generated can be recorded directly with a dynamometer connected to the upper limb of the 'U' shaped tube.|$|E
