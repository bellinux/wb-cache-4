25|$|Ronnie {{learns that}} Vincent is seeking revenge on Phil because Phil's father Eric killed Vincent's father Henry. The {{tensions}} between the Mitchells and the Hubbards increase when Phil snatches Vincent's infant daughter, Pearl Fox-Hubbard. Ronnie helps negotiate what she thinks is a truce between the two men, but Fatboy informs her that Vincent is still planning to kill Phil. She organises for men to take Vincent, lock him in the boot {{of his car and}} have it crushed. She is distracted when Jack returns to spend Christmas with Amy. When Ronnie sees Vincent and he has no knowledge of the car, she realises the men put <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car boot, but finds it has already been taken to be crushed. After Ronnie tells Vincent what she had planned, he goes to the scrapyard and finds Fatboy is dead. He decides not to tell Ronnie this, and lies that the boot was empty. Ronnie then rekindles her relationship with Jack. She learns from Mick of Dean's attempted rape of Roxy, and Roxy plans to move to Portugal. Glenda returns and tells Ronnie to stop Roxy from leaving but they are unsuccessful when Roxy says Ronnie has controlled her and she needs to be alone. Ronnie re-evaluates her life and, believing that this is the reason why she and Jack are no longer together, asks Jack to leave with Amy as she too needs to be alone. Glenda tells Ronnie that Eric could not have killed Henry and that Vincent's mother, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), must be lying to him. Ronnie tells Claudette to remain civil towards the Mitchells or she will tell Vincent what she knows.|$|E

500|$|Chloe Sullivan was {{introduced}} by the show's creators to be a [...] "Lois Lane archetype", as well as be Smallvilles [...] "outsider", which series developers Gough and Millar felt the show {{needed in order to}} have a character that notices the strange happenings in Smallville. She is the original creation of Al Gough and Miles Miller, having not been produced first in the DC Comics Universe, unlike the other main characters Clark Kent, Lana Lang, Lex Luthor, and Pete Ross. When they first began developing the series, Gough and Millar had intended for Chloe to have an [...] "ethnic background". After learning about Smallville from the show's casting director, Dee Dee Bradley, Allison Mack toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang, but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan. Gough and Millar felt she had a [...] "rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary [...] dialogue conversationally", and decided to cast her against their initial intention to give the character an ethnic origin. According to Mack, the reason she got the role was because she went into her second audition with a [...] "very flippant attitude". Kristen Bell also auditioned for the role of Chloe Sullivan; she would eventually go on to star in the television series Veronica Mars. Aside from Allison Mack, Roan Curtis portrayed Chloe as a child in the season six episode [...] "Progeny", with Victoria Duffield taking on the role in the eighth season episode [...] "Abyss". Mack enjoys the fact that her character was created specifically for the show, because she feels like she does not have to worry about being compared to <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same role, which she likens to people comparing Michael Rosenbaum's performance as Lex Luthor to Gene Hackman's portrayal in the Superman film series of the 1970s – 1980s.

2500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars.

Jonathan is too {{much a part of}} us to replace him." [...] Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: [...] "When all the actors {{who are going to be}} working with the character don't want it, it's kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do." [...] The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in The Free Lance–Star: [...] "His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role." [...] Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by People magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, Zap2it named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: [...] "The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we're getting to see it." [...] During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. Zap2it named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: [...] " [...] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?" [...] When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: [...] "I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time." [...] Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on General Hospital, stating: [...] "He's still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part." ...|$|E
