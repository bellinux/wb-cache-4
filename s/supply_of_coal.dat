5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} site had become crowded, and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing and factories in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing carbolic acid from coal tar was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau rendezvoused with Scharnhorst in Nagasaki, Japan, {{where they}} {{received}} a full <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> They then sailed south, arriving in Truk in early July where they would restock their coal supplies.

On 17 July, the East Asia Squadron arrived in Ponape in the Caroline Islands. Spee now had access to the German radio network and he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia and the Russian mobilization against Austria-Hungary and possibly Germany. On 31 July, word came that the German ultimatum that Russia demobilize its armies was set to expire. Spee ordered his ships be stripped for war. On 2 August, Wilhelm II ordered German mobilization against Russia and its ally, France.|$|E

5|$|Rutherford's {{government}} {{appointed a}} commission in February, {{but it was}} not until May that it met. It consisted of Chief Justice Arthur Sifton, mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom. It began taking evidence in July. In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay; coal supply promptly increased, as did its price. In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended that Albertans keep a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.|$|E
5|$|The British ships {{set off in}} pursuit, and by 12:50, Sturdee's two battlecruisers had {{overtaken}} the Germans. A minute later, he {{gave the}} order to open fire at the trailing German ship, Leipzig. Von Spee ordered the three small cruisers to try to escape to the south, while he turned back with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{in an attempt to}} hold off the British squadron. Sturdee had foreseen this possibility, and so had ordered his armored and light cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. The battlecruisers quickly overwhelmed von Spee's armored cruisers, and destroyed them with heavy loss of life. Dresden, with her turbine engines, was able to outpace her pursuers, and was the only German warship to escape destruction. LÃ¼decke decided to take his ship into the islands off South America to keep a steady <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> available.|$|E

25|$|The Basin, {{built by}} the Regent's Canal Company, was {{formerly}} known as Regent's Canal Dock and was used by seagoing vessels and lighters to offload cargoes to canal barges, for onward transport along the Regent's Canal. Although initially a commercial failure following its opening in 1820, by the mid 19th century the dock (and the canal) were an enormous commercial success for the importance in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> to the numerous gasworks and latterly electricity generating stations along the canal, and for domestic and commercial use. At one point it was the principal entrance from the Thames to the entire national canal network. Its use declined {{with the growth of}} the railways, although the revival of canal traffic during World War I and World War II gave it a brief swansong.|$|E
25|$|Keelmen were {{traditionally}} {{bound to}} employment for a year, the binding day normally being Christmas Day but employment {{tended to be}} seasonal with hardly any work in winter. The availability of work was often affected by the weather, if ships were unable {{to come into the}} river, and also by the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> from the pits. Strikes might affect output and wily pit owners would sometimes curtail production to keep prices high. As a result, keelmen could spend long periods without work, during which they would have to live on credit or find employment in clearing wrecks and sand banks from the river. The Tyneside keelmen formed an independent society in 1556 but were never incorporated, probably because the Newcastle Hostmen feared their becoming too powerful. The Wearside keelmen were finally incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1792.|$|E
25|$|Cumberland was Maryland's {{second largest}} city in the 19th century, with ample nearby <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> iron ore and timber.

Later, coal was carted by lorries loaded from coal hoppers {{at the foot of}} the bank at the Albert Park side of Roma Street goods yards, c 1912. A weighbridge was constructed at the Beesley Street side of the site, presumably to measure incoming <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and outgoing sales of coke.|$|R

25|$|In the east, Russia invaded {{with two}} armies. In response, Germany rapidly moved the 8th Field Army from its {{previous}} role as reserve {{for the invasion}} of France to East Prussia by rail across the German Empire. This army, led by general Paul von Hindenburg, defeated Russia {{in a series of}} battles collectively known as the First Battle of Tannenberg (17 Augustâ 2 September). While the Russian invasion failed, it caused the diversion of German troops to the east, allowing the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne. This meant Germany failed to achieve its objective of avoiding a long, two-front war. However, the German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and effectively halved France's <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> It had also killed or permanently crippled 230,000 more French and British troops than it itself had lost. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a more decisive outcome.|$|E
25|$|In 1906 Union MiniÃ¨re du Haut Katanga {{was formed}} to exploit the Katanga mines. King Leopold favoured a railway route entirely in Congolese territory, linked to the Congo River. An Angolan railway from Lobito Bay to Katanga was also proposed, but in 1908, the BSAC agreed with Leopold to {{continuing}} the Rhodesian railway to Elizabethville and the mines. Between 1912, when full-scale copper production began, until 1928 when a Congolese line was completed, almost all of Katanga's copper was shipped over the Rhodesian network to Beira. Even after the Congo route was opened, up {{to a third of}} Katanga's copper went to Beira, and the mine's the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and coke mostly came from Wankie, the cheapest available source. This railway's revenue from Katanga enabled it to carry agricultural produce at low rates. Large-scale development of the Copperbelt only began in the late 1920s, with an increasing world market for copper. Transport was no problem as only short branches had to be built to connect the Copperbelt to the main line. The Beira route was well established and the BSAC wanted to prevent the Copperbelt companies taking advantage of other routes it did not control. The Benguela Railway to Angola, completed in 1931, provided the shortest, most direct route for copper from both Katanga and Northern Rhodesia, but it was never used to full capacity because both the Congo and the Rhodesias restricted its traffic in favour of their own lines.|$|E
500|$|Construction of Portishead [...] "B" [...] {{power station}} began in 1949; it became {{operational}} in 1955. The power stations {{became part of}} the nationalised electricity industry after 1949, and were operated in turn by the British Electricity Authority, the Central Electricity Authority and the CEGB. They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield, which was delivered by train along the Portishead branch of the Great Western Railway (GWR). The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company; it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879.

500|$|In 1907, Sifton was {{one member}} of a three-member {{commission}} assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators. [...] His colleagues were mining executive Lewis Stockett and miners' union executive William Haysom. [...] Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. [...] The mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum. [...] The commission recommended that children under sixteen {{should not be allowed to}} work in mines, that inspectors should post their reports, that mine sites should have bath houses, and that ventilation inspection should be improved. It also recommended that Albertans keep a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (except to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of mine unions (which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions). It made no recommendation about working hours, but Premier Alexander Rutherford's government legislated an eight-hour day anyway.|$|E

Additionally, the number of coal mines controlled by UMWA had fallen from 67 percent to 50 percent since 1974, leaving more mines in operation to supply national needs during a strike. The oil crisis which had powered the 1974 round of bargaining no longer existed, and coal demand was lower.|$|E
