5|$|Ankylosaurus {{existed between}} 68 and 66 million years ago, in the final, or Maastrichtian, {{stage of the}} Late Cretaceous Period. It was among the last dinosaur genera that {{appeared}} before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The type specimen is from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, while other specimens {{have been found in}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming and the Scollard Formation in Alberta, Canada, all of which date {{to the end of the}} Cretaceous. Fossils of Ankylosaurus are rare in these sediments, and the distribution of its remains suggest that it was restricted to the uplands of the formations, rather than the coastal lowlands. Another ankylosaur, an indeterminate nodosaur (formerly referred to as Edmontonia sp.), is also found in the same formations, but the range of the two genera does not seem to have overlapped. Their remains have <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> found in the same localities, and the nodosaur appears to have inhabited the lowlands. The narrower muzzle of the nodosaur suggests it had a more selective diet than Ankylosaurus, further indicating ecological separation.|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} {{that does not}} involve farming spiders is to extract the spider silk gene and use other organisms to produce the spider silk. Working under the trademark BioSteel, in 2000 Canadian biotechnology company Nexia successfully produced spider silk protein in transgenic goats that carried the gene for it; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3grams per denier. Nexia used wet spinning and squeezed the silk protein solution through small extrusion holes in order to simulate {{the behavior of the}} spinneret, but this procedure has <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> sufficient to replicate the properties of native spider silk.|$|E
25|$|Romansh {{speakers}} {{have been}} {{in close contact with}} speakers of German dialects such as Alemannic and Bavarian for centuries, as well as speakers of various Italian dialects and Standard German more recently. These languages have influenced Romansh, most strongly the vocabulary, whereas the German and Italian influences on morphology and syntax are much more limited. This means that despite German influence, Romansh has remained a Romance language in its core structure. Romansh linguist Ricarda Liver also notes that an influence of Swiss German on intonation is obvious, in particular in the Sursilvan dialect, even though this has <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> linguistically studied. The influence of German is generally strongest in the Rhenish varieties Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, and Sursilvan, where French loanwords (frequently not borrowed directly but transmitted through German) are also more numerous. In the dialects of the Engadine, by contrast, the influence of Italian is stronger.|$|E
25|$|The exact findspots of many objects {{retrieved}} {{during the}} 1920s excavations {{could no longer}} be reconstructed due to the poor publication standards, so that many can only be dated by comparing them with what has been found at other sites that do have a good stratigraphy and chronological control. Many of the objects found during the 1920s could be dated from the Uruk period to the Early Dynastic I period. Very few copper objects were found in Jemdet Nasr. These included an adze, a fish-hook and a small pendant {{in the shape of a}} goose. A particular type of stone vessel with ledge handles and a rim decorated by incised rectangles has <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> found at any other site. The function of a number of flat polished stones incised with lines forming a cross is uncertain, but it has been suggested that they were used as bolas. They are common in Uruk period sites. Because clay as a raw material is widely available around Jemdet Nasr, clay objects are very common. Clay objects included baked clay bricks, clay sickels, fragments of drain pipes, spatulas, spindle whorls and miniature wagon wheels. Beads, small pendants and figurines were made of bone, shell, stone, clay and frit.|$|E
30|$|However, {{for both}} breeds the traits’ {{standard}} deviations and the ranges in values were high. One {{reason for this}} might be the quality of depth measurement. According to the manual (MESA-Imaging 2013) the accuracy was 1 cm, but depth value deviation of up to 10 cm had been observed. As preliminary analyses had shown, this most likely depended on fur color (changes), sun light, dust, insects, humidity, and if the animal was moving.

Details of the attack were released by Portland Police on May 24. Forkner and Rosevear said a group of five men followed them from Tom McCall Waterfront Park across the bridge, then beat them as they came down a ramp along the Esplanade. According to the description released by Portland Police, [...] "as [...] walked they knew several men were behind them talking, laughing and pointing {{but they were not}} sure it was directed at them." [...] Three of the five men attacked the couple from behind. Forkner was pushed into a railing and punched multiple times before breaking away to call 9-1-1. The attackers reportedly continued hitting Rosevear on the head, face, back and ribs until Forkner was able to call for police help. Forkner later recalled that he did not hear specific homophobic remarks, but believed the attackers may have been yelling in a foreign language. Forkner had swelling on his face, and Rosevear required stitches in his lip. The victims said that several witnesses were nearby, but did not offer help in any form.

500|$|As {{part of the}} {{mediation}} between Kibaki and Odinga in 2008 the two parties agreed a series of accords. One of these was to establish the Commission of Inquiry into the Post-Election Violence, chaired by Kenyan judge Philip Waki to investigate the violence and particularly {{the actions of the}} police. Waki's report recommended that the Kenyan government set up a special tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the worst crimes. and although both Kibaki and Odinga voiced support for a local tribunal, the idea was rejected by the National Assembly. Waki passed his report, including a list of the names of those he considered most responsible for the violence back to Kofi Annan with instructions that it be passed to the International Criminal Court if progress with the local tribunal was not made. On 16 July 2009 the Waki commission delivered a copy of his report along with six boxes of documents and supporting materials to the International Criminal Court along with a sealed envelope containing a list of people who could be implicated in the violence. The prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo opened the envelope, inspected its contents and re-sealed it. Initially the ICC gave the Kenyan government a deadline of July 2010 to establish a local tribunal before it would refer the case to the ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo. The [...] "Waki List" [...] has <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> made public, and there is speculation that it may contain more names than the six who were initially indicted by the ICC; consequently there have been some calls in Kenya for either the ICC or Waki to release the list.|$|E

The field between the village and the M1 on the north side of Collingtree Road is an area designated by Northamptonshire County Council for sand extraction.
