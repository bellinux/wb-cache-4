5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E

25|$|In post civil-war Lebanon, {{since the}} Taif agreement, {{politically}} Phoenicianism, as an alternate to Arabism, has been restricted {{to a small}} group. Phoeniciansm is deeply disputed by <b>some</b> <b>scholars,</b> <b>who</b> have on occasion tried to convince these claims are false and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead. This conflict of ideas of an identity {{is believed to be}} one of the main pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Maronite Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country from national unity. It's generalized that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of Lebanese history and culture whereas Christians focus on the pre-arabized & non-Arab spectrum of the Lebanese identity and rather refrain from the Arab specification.|$|E
25|$|Zechariah 1–8, {{sometimes}} referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BC. Zechariah 9–14, often called Second Zechariah, contains within the text no datable references to specific events or individuals but most scholars give the text a date in the fifth century BCE. Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears {{to make use of the}} books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, the Deuteronomistic History, and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah. There are <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> go even further and divide Second Zechariah into Second Zechariah (9–11) and Third Zechariah (12–14) since each begins with a heading oracle.|$|E
25|$|The name 'Qin' (pronounced as 'Chin') is {{believed}} to be the etymological ancestor of the modern-day European name of the country, China. The word probably made its way into the Indo-Aryan languages first as 'Cina' or 'Sina' and then into Greek and Latin as 'Sinai' or 'Thinai'. It was then transliterated into English and French as 'China' and 'Chine'. This etymology is dismissed by <b>some</b> <b>scholars,</b> <b>who</b> suggest that 'Sina' in Sanskrit evolved much earlier before the Qin dynasty. 'Jin' (pronounced as 'Zhin'), a state controlled by the Zhou dynasty in seventh century BC, is another possible origin. Others argued for the state of Jing (荆, another name for Chu), as well other polities in the early period as the source of the name.|$|E

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> now {{date the}} arch's {{construction}} {{to the period}} under Arab rule during the seventh and eighth centuries AD base their conclusions on {{what they see as}} evidence from the period of excavation after the Six Day War, when Israel's Ministry of Religious Affairs began to excavate the area of the Western Wall still unexposed, and dig a tunnel beneath the existing structures above. During much of the time of these excavations, which went on 1968–82 and was restarted in 1985, the Israel Antiquities Authority's (IAA) District Archeologist for Jerusalem was Dan Bahat, who became the archaeologist of the site after resigning from IAA. In his book, , he writes that the evidence found was enough to convince him that despite earlier beliefs that the arch was built during Herod's time, the later dating is correct.|$|E
500|$|Madurai {{has been}} {{inhabited}} {{since at least}} the 3rd century BCE. Megasthenes may have visited Madurai during the 3rd century BCE, with the city referred as [...] "Methora" [...] in his accounts. The view is contested by <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> believe [...] "Methora" [...] refers to the north Indian city of Mathura, as it was a large and established city in the Mauryan Empire. Madurai is also mentioned in Kautilya's (370–283 BCE) Arthashastra. Sangam literature like Maturaikkāñci records the importance of Madurai as a capital city of the Pandyan dynasty. Madurai is mentioned in the works of Roman historians Pliny the Younger (61– c. 112 CE), Ptolemy (c. 90– c. CE 168), those of the Greek geographer Strabo (64/63 BCE– c. 24 CE), and also in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E

They believe that Candide's final decision is the same as Voltaire's, and see a strong connection between the development of the protagonist and his author. <b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> support the [...] "outside" [...] view also believe that the isolationist philosophy of the Old Turk closely mirrors that of Voltaire. Others see a strong parallel between Candide's gardening at the conclusion and the gardening of the author.

500|$|In a laudatory 76-line epigram {{inscribed on}} the walls of the church and {{preserved}} in its entirety (Anthologia Graeca, I.10), Juliana compares herself to past emperors Constantine I and Theodosius II as a monumental builder, and claims to have surpassed Solomon's Temple, on whose proportions the new church was allegedly based. The building constituted thereby a direct challenge to the prestige and authority of the low-born reigning dynasty, and it may have been one of the reasons for the massive scale of Justinian's reconstruction of the Hagia Sophia a few years later. In light of this rivalry, it is perhaps no coincidence that Justinian too, when he beheld the completed Hagia Sophia, is said to have cried out: [...] "Solomon, I have surpassed thee." [...] The importance of the Solomonic allusions is however questioned by <b>some</b> <b>scholars,</b> <b>who</b> see the church more as a statement of the imperial prestige of the Old Roman aristocracy, from which Juliana descended, and of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, which she had championed during the reign of the Monophysite emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518). A further aspect of the antagonism with Justinian however is evidenced by a tale recorded by Gregory of Tours: shortly after his accession, Justinian called upon the aged Juliana to contribute a part of her large fortune to the state treasury. After stalling for time, she had her gold melted down and fashioned into plates, with which she adorned the interior of the roof of the newly built church of St. Polyeuctus, thus preserving it from the emperor's avarice.|$|E

One exponent of the Documentary Hypothesis, Richard Elliott Friedman, argues that the laws of war in [...] and [...] appear to be directed to the entire Israelite people, rather than a professional army, and thus appear to derive from a period before the monarchy and thus may come from sources much earlier than the balance of the Deuteronomic Code.|$|E
2500|$|Still, some {{scholars}} have held the view that while this event took place, it was not miraculous: Albert Schweitzer, for example, suggested that the disciples saw Jesus walking on the shore, but were confused by high wind and darkness; <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>who</b> accept this [...] "misperception thesis" [...] argue that Mark originally wrote that Jesus walked on the seashore {{rather than on the}} shore, and that John had a more accurate version.

Branscomb, 1937), based perhaps on some lost incident; perhaps Jesus waded through the surf (Vincent Taylor, 1957), or perhaps he walked on a sand bar (Sherman Johnson, 1972, J.D.M. Derrett, 1981).|$|E
