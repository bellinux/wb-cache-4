Protectionism in Europe in its various forms is being given a final blow with the {{introduction of}} the common currency that, for the first time, will lead to genuine convergence in prices. The abolition of the internal foreign exchange borders has profound effects for competitiveness and trade. It entails more freedom for Euroland’s producers to swim competitively – and especially to sink. What looks like a more self-sufficient (or ‘closed’) Euroland is in effect an open domestic market that has converted into domestic-currency transactions what previously constituted international trade involving foreign exchange. This conversion is uniquely beneficial for the partners that previously had the relatively <b>softer</b> <b>currencies.</b> Finally, the benefits to the EMU partners multiply and spill over to the global level as the euro becomes a strong, and potentially a parallel resere currency.

Using case study analysis, three British Council country office social media channels are reviewed.

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to the etiology of financial crises focus on the fundamentals of an economy, more specifically on the disequilibrium {{in the balance of}} payments. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to extend this ‘first generation’ literature of financial crises with a general model that focuses on the quality of a currency as a store of value for asset holding purposes – as opposed to the medium-of-exchange characteristics of a currency that enter considerations of the balance-of-payments approach. A formal model is sketched around a utility function that includes money as an asset held in both local currency and foreign exchange. Given a steady stream of money supply, asset-price considerations in a free currency market make a fixed exchange rate untenable for the local currency and lead to devaluation and to crisis. Impressionistic evidence from the recent experience of financial crises corroborates the hypothesis of currency substitution. The policy implications of the hypothesis parallel those f market incompleteness for asymmetric information, as cast within the framework of asymmetric reputation between the <b>soft</b> and hard <b>currency</b> that leads to currency substitution for asset-holding purposes...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s drastic devaluations of several European currencies as well as the sustained weakness of the dollar have markedly impaired the price competitiveness of those countries whose currencies are linked to the German mark. For Austria's export and tourism sector, the weakness of the currencies of important trading partners, Italy in particular, constitutes a serious challenge. The revised WIFO exchange rate index, with 1992 as the base year, will improve the analysis of the macroeconomic effects of changes in the exchange rates. The index measures the relation between the schilling and a "basket of currencies" from 23 OECD countries. The weight of each currency is based on the importance of each country in Austria's foreign trade. As in the old index the international purchasing power of the schilling is mainly determined by the exchange rate of the schilling against the German mark. The weight of the German mark rose from 43. 2 percent in 1979 to 47. 5 percent in 1992, a rise of 4. 3 percentage points. The share of the dollar sank by 2. 2 percentage points to 8. 4 percent; but the dollar still takes third place behind the Italian lira (10. 6 percent). The weight of the Swiss franc dropped sharply to fifth place, from 6. 6 percent to 4. 7 percent; the French franc advanced to fourth place (5. 7 percent). The British pound (4. 4 percent) and the Dutch guilder (3. 7 percent) remain among the more important currencies. With a weight of 3. 1 percent (+ 0. 6 percentage point), the Japanese yen is ranked as number eight. The currencies of the EU countries have a total weight of 81. 5 percent, while the five overseas countries have a share of 12. 5 percent. "Third market effects", which reflect the competition between Austrian firms and exporters from other countries in foreign markets, have gained in importance in the computation of index weights. The weight of third market effects in the index of manufacturing products rose from 13. 4 percent in 1979 to 17. 1 percent in 1992. This shift is due to the intensification of international trade: domestic production as a percentage of production in OECD countries fell from 74. 1 percent to 62. 8 percent. Third market effects are almost twice as high in tourism (30. 7 percent) as in trade with manufactured goods. Since the establishment of the EMS in 1979, the value of the schilling rose against all currencies {{with the exception of the}} Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. Over the last fifteen years, the trade-weighted exchange rate of the schilling rose by 28 percent in nominal terms, by slightly less than 2 percent per year. The strongest contributions came from the small soft-currency countries and from Italy (8. 7 percent). If the trade-weighted index is adjusted for inflation differentials, the appreciation in real terms is 9. 2 percent. Nominal exchange rate gains of the schilling against <b>soft</b> <b>currencies</b> are largely offset by higher inflation rates in these countries. The largest contribution to the rise in the trade-weighted exchange rate of the schilling in real terms comes from the German mark: in the long run inflation rates were lower in Germany than in Austria. But Austria has lost ground in terms of price stability in comparison with other trading partners as well: while in the first half of the eighties the accumulated rate of inflation in the OECD countries was 10 percentage points higher than in Austria, this differential dropped to 4 percentage points during the period 1990 to 1994. This means that since the mid- 1980 s the appreciation in real terms has become more pronounced, reducing the price competitiveness in international trade. Since 1992 Austria has been less and less successful in compensating the rise in the nominal exchange rate by lower inflation rates.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. A {{growing number}} of {{national}} militaries, with the United States Department of Defense (US DoD) leading the way, have been taking more proactive roles in foreign disaster response. Involvement in disaster response {{has been associated with}} improving a nation’s <b>soft</b> power <b>currency.</b> This has led to a “mission creep” for many militaries with an expansion of military engagement into the traditional roles of other non-military government and civilian emergency response and emergency planning agencies. These include a broad spectrum of security cooperation activities linked to disaster response preparedness (DRP) via associated training and planning exercises. A study of this phenomena through a study of perceptions from key stakeholder of the world’s largest military’s (US DoD) DRP related activities {{in one of the most}} disaster affected regions of the world can help answer some critical questions around the changing roles of military organizations in response to the security challenges of the twenty-first century. The hypothesis of this research is that the US DoD can provide important support to DRP that would support an enabling environment for soft power. This soft power potential is limited by the US Government’s one-dimensional approach to power, which equates inputs with outcomes. To date, US DoD success in DRP has been measured by selfevaluation thus limiting a more thoughtful approach toward DRP. This limited perspective and approach has obscured the tangible successes of this type of engagement with soft power window dressing. To analyze this trend, this research will document the perspectives of professionals working in the field of DRP and examine US DoD activities linked to DRP in the ASEAN region following the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Using feedback (survey, interview) from the key stakeholders in DRP primarily from the US DoD and International Humanitarian and Development Community, this research will help discern the extent to which these activities are perceived as an acceptable approach to DRP, how these efforts can (or) have supported improved disaster response capabilities, and the perceived limits to US DoD effectiveness in these engagements...|$|R

Our model shows that, controlling for the fundamentals of an economy, the more pronounced the currency substitution is in a country, the earlier and the stronger is the tendency for the local currency to devalue.

This indicates that <b>soft</b> <b>currency</b> countries have a systematic tendency to have under-valued currency. Second, there is a systematic negative relationship between the softness of a currency and the level of economic development. The policy recommendations of the paper refer to the means of achieving “moderately repressed exchange rates, ” and thus helping diffuse the pressure for devaluation of soft currencies that is exogenously determined through the opportunities afforded for currency substitution in a globalization environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{devaluation}} of the Mexican peso of 1995 along with the more recent financial crises in emerging economies are viewed as systematic outcomes of the operation of free currency markets. The hypothesis is that there exists a distortion in free currency markets that makes developing countries systematically misallocate resources. The distortion lies in "asymmetric reputation" that leads to substitution of the reserve currency for the country's <b>soft</b> <b>currency</b> in liquid asset holdings, thus making systemic devaluations inevitable. Moreover, the empirical analysis shows that currency-substitution-led endemic devaluations misallocate resources in competitive devaluation trade, as opposed to comparative advantage trade. In a case that is parallel to asymmetric information and incomplete credit markets, the appropriate policy intervention in asymmetric-reputation driven incomplete currency markets is maintaining mildly repressed exchange rates. The operational definition of "mild" is imposing restrictions on the home-grown variety of currency substitution.

40|$|European {{integration}} and the incompatibility of different varieties of capitalism Problems with institutional divergence in a monetary union Alison Johnston (Oregon State University) and Aidan Regan (University College Dublin) ____________________________________________________________________________ Recent {{literature on the}} European debt crisis emphasizes that rising external trade and lending imbalances between the European Monetary Union’s (EMU) Northern and Southern member states served as a crucial determinant behind speculative divergence between these two regions. However, these gaping external imbalances only emerged with {{the launch of the}} single currency. In this paper, we examine how three different currency regimes: monetary union, fixed exchange rate and flexible exchange rates, influence the mutual co-existence of export-led growth models (which predominate in the Eurozone’s crisis-spared Northern economies) and domestic demand-led growth models (which predominate in the Eurozone’s crisis-prone Southern economies). We hypothesize that external imbalances between these two growth models did not emerge prior to EMU {{because of the presence of}} two adjustment mechanisms in the real exchange rate; the nominal exchange rate (in <b>soft</b> <b>currency</b> regimes) and the promotion of inflation convergence by national central banks (in hard currency regimes).

40|$|In {{the run-up}} to European Monetary Union (EMU), Italy put in place an {{extraordinary}} fiscal adjustment, whereas Germany encountered serious difficulties that go beyond the re-unification shock. "War-of-attrition" models are employed to explain this puzzle. It is argued that Italy's high debt burden and <b>soft</b> <b>currency</b> regime from 1992 to 1996 turned out as an opportunity. The prospect of EMU membership opened up room for market-induced credibility gains. By allowing a sensible reduction of interest payments, the high-debt GDP ratio de facto reduced the scope for welfare retrenchment, thus minimising conflicts between socio-economic groups over {{the distribution of the}} fiscal adjustment burden. At the same time, social concertation offered a locus of conflict resolution. Social partners' fiscal preferences stemmed from an evaluation of the distributional impact of deficit reduction and of trade-offs in other policy areas, e. g. exchange rate policy. Thanks to Italy's soft-currency regime, domestic business agreed to unions' demands for a tax-imposed fiscal consolidation as the devalued Lira allowed them to maintain a competitive edge. The opposite is true for Germany, where the low debt burden and hard currency regime functioned, paradoxically, as straightjackets. With a low debt level, deficit reduction had to come from real government activities, either on the revenue or on the expenditure-side. Also, the appreciated Deutschmark did not offer an alternative "pressure valve" to Germany's export-oriented business. The failure of the 1996 social pact is understood against this background. This thesis sheds light on the political economy of EMU-induced fiscal adjustment {{as well as on the}} determinants of social concertation in the EU. In this respect, it contributes simultaneously to two strands of literature; the now flourishing research agenda on fiscal policy in EMU -of which it rejects the strong institutionalist flavour, and the equally recent revival of corporatist studies since the 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The United States {{has had a}} {{long history}} of {{promoting}} agricultural exports, and the return to conditions of extreme surplus in many agricultural markets in recent years has revived interest in this topic. Some products received imperial bounties during our colonial era, but the systematic collection of trade statistics for the purpose of investigating agricultural export opportunities did not begin until 1883. In the early 1890 's, agents were sent to Europe to promote the use of corn as a human food. With the entry of the United States into World War I, massive government shipments for relief purposes were authorized, and the value of commodities exported under government programs reached a similar magnitude during World War II. Since World War II, numerous government programs such as Section 32 subsidies, <b>soft</b> <b>currency</b> sales, long-term dollar credits, barter, disaster relief and short-term credit sales have been used to increase agricultural exports. However, the long-run implications of these increases deserve consideration. Research in the field of international economic development has indicated that the emphasis of primary product exports may retard beneficial structural change in small primary product oriented economies. Research to test the applicability of these theories to farm states with small populations seems justified in light of recent interest in economic development. Patterns of income growth in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, Idaho and Arkansas, as well as four other small manufacturing states and seven large states were studied for evidence of structural change in response to increased agricultural exports. The evidence indicates that the large increases in agricultural export values seen since 1958 have speeded, not delayed, the process of structural change in the farm states. Consequently, the fear that increased exports will encourage a heightened dependence on agriculture in these states seems not to be borne out...|$|E
40|$|THE IMPORTANCE of the {{governmental}} and institutional publications, which form {{the bulk of}} current exchange materials, has been recognized by governments {{as well as by}} research institutions. The fact that the system of barter known as exchange can secure important foreign publications for use in this country, circumvent the <b>soft</b> <b>currency</b> problem, make our publications available to technically-backward countries, and place our publications in countries whose citizens know too little about us, is recognized and appreciated. There {{have been a number of}} significant developments and trends in exchanges since the beginning of World War 11. They are as follows: the increased concern of governments for the extension and improvement of international exchanges; Unesco leadership in the same field; the establishment of national book centers, such as the United States Book Exchange; the use of procurement officers; and finally, the small beginnings of multilateral exchanges. One of the most striking trends in the exchange of current publications during the past decade has been the increased interest which governments have shown in it. World War I 1 made painfully apparent to our government the shortage in this country of vital information about other countries. Efforts to avoid World War I 11 have pointed up the importance of the wide distribution of publications from this country which might make for better understanding with other nations. Both of these needs are met by the single operation of exchanges. The United States government has supported exchanges for more than a century.
