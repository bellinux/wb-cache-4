40|$|The food {{industry}} of today is {{in a constant}} state of change [...] becoming increasingly globalised and consumer driven. Moreover, food consumption patterns in industrialized and many developing nations are changing dramatically, moving seemingly in parallel directions. As previous research has shown, food consumption patterns are altered with fluctuations in relative prices, changes in real income, emergence of technological forces, effects of advertising and promotion, shifts in the demographic structure of households and changes in lifestyles. Further, concerns regarding nutrition and health, food safety and environmental integrity are proliferating around the world. Consequently, these dynamic issues and trends have stimulated the diversification of consumption patterns and preferences within individual countries. This study is an initial attempt to identify key variables affecting meat consumption in the international marketplace and examine their potential effect on New Zealand sheepmeat's competitive position. The overall goal of the report was to explore and help define strategic issues, trends and challenges facing New Zealand's <b>sheepmeat</b> <b>sector</b> in today's fiercely competitive global environment. This study provides: 1. an in-depth look into the current and changing dynamics of world meat trade; 2. specific meat production and consumption trends worldwide; 3. a current snapshot of the New Zealand livestock and export meat industry with an emphasis on possible strategic responses to existing and emerging meat industry trends and challenges; and 4. an analysis of selected markets around the world and the potential for garnering increased market share. Some implications for the New Zealand sheepmeat industry are drawn based on emerging international trends, issues and challenges identified. This research effort represents the culmination of a comprehensive review of the extant literature as well as government and trade reports, joined with the personal observations of prominent trade analysts and observers from various parts of the world...|$|E
