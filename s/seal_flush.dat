40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{seal leakage}} of {{centrifugal}} pumps (especially hot oil pumps) {{is the main}} fault reason of the petrochemical equipments. The fuction of the <b>sealing</b> <b>flush</b> system is to maintain the mechanical shaft seal function correctly. The misconduct of flush system settings will directly lead {{to the failure of}} mechanical seal. In this paper, the problems are analyzed for the present mechanical <b>seal</b> <b>flushing</b> system. When the centrifugal pump is in a standby state, flushing system may not provide normal flush flow in self flush plan. This may lead to surface fouling of the hot mechanical shaft seal, resulting in seal failure. Our research focus on solving these problems. The way is to change the source of flush fluid, that is to change the flush plan to external flush plan or toChange the fluid pipe position...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirement}} of bringing an outside coolant source {{to run through}} the seals of a multiphase pump {{has always been a}} costly endeavor. Using a separator to extract liquid from the exhaust of the pump to use as a coolant is often more expensive than providing an outside source of coolant. This research proposes a cost effective separator design which efficiently separates the liquid from gas, while maintaining a high enough residence time to remove any gas entrainment, and separates only the <b>seal</b> <b>flush</b> requirement by letting any excess liquids carryover with the gas. Conventional multiphase separators operate by substantially decreasing the velocity of the mixture, which reduces the drag force put forth by the gasses and allows gravity to force the liquids downward. Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclones (GLCCs) operate by increasing the velocity of the mixture, using radial force to separate liquids and gasses. This technique requires a smaller diameter vessel to achieve separation. The separator in this research uses gravity as the separation force while maintaining a pipe diameter similar to the GLCC. This way, only standard pipe and pipe fittings are used. The effectiveness of this design is measured two ways. First, efficiency is studied at varying gas volume fractions (GVFs), velocities, pressures, and pipe diameters. Second, the length of air entrainment (LAE) is measured at the same varying conditions. The efficiency and air entrainment studies provide design recommendations to accommodate <b>seal</b> <b>flush</b> requirements and size limitations. The following investigation also offers further areas of research to improve the understanding and modeling of using standard pipe and pipe fittings to create more effective design equations...|$|E

Disease, increased predation, emigration, depletion of prey resources, and disturbance by vessels {{all have been}} implicated as causal factors of the abundance decrease. This study involved evaluating the role of disturbance by vessels during 2007 and 2008 as a causal factor in the harbor seal abundance decrease by (1) quantifying the vessel disturbance regime experienced by seals in JHI and (2) quantifying behavioral and bioenergetic impacts of vessels on seals in JHI. The presence of vessels altered the haulout patterns and behavioral activity budgets of seals by increasing the rate of flushing (vacating an iceberg and entering the water) and increasing vigilance behavior. According to the bioenergetic model used during this study, all <b>seals</b> <b>flushed</b> by vessels incurred an energetic cost, though that cost was disproportionately greater for pups than non-pups. The overall proportion of the JHI seal aggregation that was impacted by vessel disturbance was relatively low; however, repeated disturbance may be inducing the relocation of seals to other areas, and direct energetic impacts may be decreasing the individual fitness levels of pups.

The least reliable pump {{in the unit}} was a single stage overhung centrifugal pump in demethanizer reflux service. The process fluid is marginally over its vapor pressure at a temperature of - 140 F (- 96 C) and pressure of 502 psig (3461 kPa). The pump was originally installed with a dual nonpressurized mechanical seal using n-propanol as the barrier fluid. There were numerous seal problems on the pump and the mean time between repair (MTBR) averaged four months. Many modifications {{were made to the}} sealing system with little or no improvement in the MTBR. A joint development project was initiated involving plant and seal supplier personnel to investigate the use of dual gas seal technology in this service. A cartridge, nonpressureized series arrangement dual gas seal was designed and thoroughly tested before installation in the plant. Testing included operation with a light hydrocarbon in both the liquid and vapor phases. Incorporating an interstage and external labyrinth with an inert gas sweep satisfied low environmental emissions requirements. A purge and vent control panel system was developed to monitor and establish appropriate gas purge and vent settings for containment and emissions purposes. Installation at the plant included a close clearance throat bushing and removal of the <b>seal</b> <b>flush</b> to encourage vapor accumulation in the seal chamber. The first seal was installed in the plant on January 1, 1997, and has operated through November 1998 without problems. The methane vapor emissions at the outboard labyrinth are consistently measured at less than 250 parts per million. The seal has dramatically improved the reliability of this critical pump even under upset conditions.

40|$|Although the {{probability}} of Earth microbes growing (dividing) in the Martian environment is extremely low, {{the probability}} of their survival on the Martian surface is unknown. During the course of landed missions to Mars terrestrial microbes may reach the surface of Mars via inadequately sterilized spacecraft landers, rovers, or through accidental impact of orbiters. This investigation studied the potential for Earth microbes {{to survive in the}} windblown dust on the surface of Mars. The rationale for the study {{comes from the fact that}} Mars regularly has huge dust storms that engulf the planet, shading the surface from solar UV radiation. These storms serve as a mechanism for global transfer of dust particles. If live organisms were to be transported to the surface of Mars they could be picked up with the dust during a dust storm and transported across the planet. Washed, dried spores of Bacillus subtilis strain HA 101 were aseptically mixed with sterile sieved (size range of 1 - 5 microns) Mars soil standard (obtained from NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA), or Fe-montmorillonite such that the number of microbes equals 5 x 10 (exp 6) /g dry wt soil.

Every year NDOT is responsible for approximately 13, 150 lane miles of existing infrastructure. With that in mind, resources need to be provided to maintain the highway system. The purpose {{of this research was}} to estimate annual routine maintenance cost for several typical treatment methods of highways. Five prioritization categories of highways used by NDOT were considered. Linear regression models were developed that present the relationship between costs including total maintenance cost and five maintenance cost components: labor, equipment, materials, manpower and stockpile, and the influencing factors: traffic load, road geometry, pavement structure, and climate. It was expected that the cost model depends on various roadway factors including elevation, number of lanes, age of the pavement, last year of pavement construction work, average daily traffic (ADT), number of trucks, single axial load (ESAL), district work done, and weather conditions. This research undertook the following steps: data review, data correlation check, and ordinary least square regression analysis. Data used for the analysis was extracted from NDOT pavement management system. Five NDOT prioritization categories were used for data processing and the analysis. The regression models incorporated the same parameters used in the NDOT pavement management system; therefore they can be simply combined with the existing database. The analysis conducted in this study indicates that road age is a noteworthy factor for a number of life cycle segments and several maintenance cost activities. The life cycle segments varied with each prioritization category including routine maintenance activities and their schedule. For segments where the roadway age {{does not appear to be}} significant, the routine maintenance cost estimate stays constant. Routine maintenance activities may be scheduled at the times that are close to the time when a preventive maintenance or reconstruction is scheduled. This practice is reflected in the cost model that the annual maintenance cost may decline with time and suddenly increase at the end of their life cycle stages. Lastly, recommendations have been made to provide fundamentals for future study needs. Several research needs in the cost estimation model are apparent from this assessment. These include additional information regarding cost model development using various statistical tools, periodical data update, use of a larger sample size, and different approaches for constructing prioritization categories life cycle. Also, historical data should be updated constantly due to changes in the material and construction technology. Further, the construction technology might require more or less steps with certain treatments like chip <b>seal</b> or <b>flush</b> <b>seal.</b> Thus, it is recommended to update the data as major construction or material technology is implemented in the routine maintenance work...|$|R

Spectra from extracts of the open tube pyrolyzed material had a series of ions characteristic of tetra- and pentabrominated dibenzofurans as evidenced by comparison with spectra from 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrabromodibenzofuran (TBDF). Confirmatory evidence for the brominated dibenzofurans was obtained by high resolution MS dual ion analysis of certain fragment and molecular ions. Recovery values of TBDF through the cleanup procedure averaged 50 % and, using this recovery value and TBDF as an external standard, dual ion analyses indicated that 40 ppm tetra- and 4 ppm pentabrominanted dibenzofuran were produced based on the PBB level used in the pyrolysis experiments. Additional analysis of the open tube pyrolyzed material by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry provided evidence that there was one tetrabromodibenzofuran compound with a retention time equal to that of TBDF. Trace levels (less than 1 ppm) of the molecular ion of tetrabrominated dibenzofuran were found after analysis by low resolution MS of the PBB pyrolyzed under nitrogen in sealed tubes.

Such limitations are expected in long-duration space exploration missions and in remote or austere places on Earth. This design uses regular drinking water that is pumped through two filters to produce, in minutes, sterile, ultrapure water that meets the stringent quality standards of the United States Pharmacopeia for Water for Injection (Total Bacteria, Conductivity, Endo - toxins, Total Organic Carbon). The device weighs 2. 2 lb (1 kg) and is 10 in. long, 5 in. wide, and 3 in. high (25, 13, and 7. 5 cm, respectively) in its storage configuration. This handheld device produces one liter of medical-grade water in 21 minutes. Total production capacity for this innovation {{is expected to be}} in the hundreds of liters. The device contains one battery powered electric mini-pump. Alternatively, a manually powered pump can be attached and used. Drinking water enters the device from a source water bag, flows through two filters, and final sterile production water exits into a sealed, medical-grade collection bag. The collection bag contains pre-placed crystalline salts to mix with product water to form isotonic intravenous medical solutions. Alternatively, a hypertonic salt solution can be injected into a filled bag. The filled collection bag is detached from the device and is ready for use or storage. This device currently contains one collection bag, but a manifold of several pre-attached bags or replacement of single collection bags under sterile needle technique is possible for the production of multiple liters. The entire system will be <b>flushed,</b> <b>sealed,</b> and radiation-sterilized. Operation of the device is easy and requires minimal training. Drinking water is placed into the collection bag. Inline stopcock flow valves at the source and collection bags are opened, and the mini-pump is turned on by a switch to begin fluid flow. When the collection bag is completely filled with the medical- grade water, the pump can be turned off. The pump is designed so it cannot pump air, and overfilling of the collection bag with fluid is avoided by placing an equal amount of water in the source bag. Backflow is avoided by inline check valves. The filled collection bag is disconnected from its tubing and is ready for use. The source bag can be refilled for production of multiple liters, or the source bag can be replaced with an input tube that can be placed in a larger potable water source if the device is attended. The device functions in all orientations independent of any gravity fields. In addition to creating IV fluids, the device produces medical-grade water, which can be used for mixing with medications for injection, reconstituting freeze-dried blood products for injection, or for wound hydration or irrigation.

40|$|An {{excess of}} fine {{sediment}} {{is the leading}} cause of impairment of rivers in the United States. Fine sediment poses particular problems for salmon, which bury their eggs within gravel riverbeds. Sand infiltrates the salmon nest and creates a sand seal in the upper pore spaces near the surface. Silt and clay then deposit in the sand seal, reducing bed permeability and cutting o the supply of dissolved oxygen. Large stormflows can mobilize the riverbed and flush out the silt and clay, increasing permeability. Reservoir releases on dammed rivers can simulate this effect; it may also be possible to engineer releases to both increase reservoir flood storage and improve the quality of spawning habitat. Understanding the fraction of fines as a function of depth would allow estimation of bed permeability and ideal flushing depths, which would aid in the design of flushing flows. This dissertation improvesunderstanding of the sand fraction as a function of depth in the sand seal by analyzing infiltration data, testing an existing model, and developing new models. It is found that a simple exponential model performs well at predicting the sand fraction as a function of depth but there is evidence of a more complex structure driven by a change in trapping efficiency as the bed clogs. This study allows for direct calculation of the effect of sand seals on bed permeability and can inform future studies of silt and clay deposition in the sand seal, but it is limited to uniform-flow, plane-bed conditions. The location and structure of salmon nests takes advantage of three-dimensional flowfields to enhance flow over the eggs. Theseforcing mechanisms should affect infiltration into nests. This relationship is explored in an experiment on sand infiltration into a gravel bed with alternate-bar topography. This study demonstrates that sand seals are created throughout the riverbed, even where sand transport is too small to measure. There is spatial variability in the thickness of a sand seal but not in the mean sand fraction in the sand seal. Local infiltration is increased by bed topography that promotes downwelling and is limited by very high sand transport and by thick sand deposits on the surface. The structure of a sand <b>seal</b> will affect <b>flushing</b> depth, but theduration of a flushing flow depends on the entrainment rate of silt and clay from within the sand seal. The entrainment rate of subsurface fines into suspension is not generally known. A case study on the Russian River in California is performed to estimated the entrainment rate during dam releases large enough to mobilize the riverbed. High-frequency turbidity and discharge data from two USGS gauging stations are used to create a timeseries of cumulative entrainment from the reach. Estimates of bed mobility are used to develop rough estimates of local entrainment. Entrainment decays exponentially at a timescale on the order of days,and this timescale decreases as the discharge event increases. Total estimated entrainment is similar to the supply of suspendable sediment calculated to be in the bed...|$|R
