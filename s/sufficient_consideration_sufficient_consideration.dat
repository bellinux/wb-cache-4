50|$|Generally past <b>consideration</b> is not <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> but a past service {{performed}} {{at the request of}} the promisor with an implication they will be paid for is <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> for a subsequent promise to pay for them.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{things that}} ordinarily {{constitute}} <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> may be deemed insufficient {{when they are}} being exchanged for fungible things. For example, $1 is ordinarily <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration,</b> and $100 is ordinarily <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration.</b> However, if Alan and Betty agree to exchange $1 for $100, {{it would not be}} an enforceable contract for lack of consideration. An exception to this exception is when there is special significance to the $1 bill itself, such as if it was the first dollar a person made in business and carries tremendous sentimental value, similar to the peppercorn rule. Fungible things {{do not have to be}} money, though. They can be grains stored in a silo, for example. One bushel of grain being exchanged for 100 bushels of the same grain would not be <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Consideration</b> must be <b>sufficient,</b> but courts do not {{weigh the}} {{adequacy}} of consideration, partially because in a capitalistic society private parties are entitled and expected to determine the value of things for themselves. In other words, the things being exchanged must have some value {{in the eyes of}} the law, but the general rule is that courts do not care how much. Love and affection, for example, would not constitute <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration,</b> but a penny would. However, <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> that is grossly inadequate may be deemed unconscionable, discussed below.|$|R

[...] "There is nothing," [...] he says, [...] "Pope would not have sacrificed, not the most solemn of his opinions, nor the most pathetic memorial from his personal experiences, {{in return for a}} <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration,</b> which consideration meant always with him poetic effect. Simply and constitutionally, he was incapable of a sincere thought, or a sincere emotion. Nothing that ever he uttered, were it even a prayer to God, but he had a fancy for reading it backwards.

40|$|A new assault {{has lately}} been made upon the {{established}} doctrine that a part payment of a debt already due {{is not a}} <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> for a promise by the creditor to forego his right to the residue. As is well known, the rule is based upon what is probably a misinterpretation of a dictum in Pinnel 2 ̆ 7 s Case, 5 Coke, 117, as followed in Foakes v. Beer, 9 App. Cas. 605. See 12 Harv. Law Rev. 521. The supreme court of New Hampshire nowholds in Frye v. Hubbell, 68 Atl. 325, that such a part payment is a <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration.</b> That there is a considerable tendency in America toward this result {{is evidenced by the}} fact that the former rule has been changed by statute in some ten States and by court decision on common-law grounds in two States besides New Hampshire.

50|$|The court {{unanimously}} {{affirmed the}} Appellate Division.

50|$|Suppose B commits a tort against A, causing $5,000 in {{compensatory}} damages and $3,000 in punitive damages. Since {{there is no}} guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 {{compensatory damages}}. This is <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration,</b> since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.|$|R

50|$|The House of Lords (Earl of Selborne LC, Lord Watson and Lord Fitzgerald) {{upheld the}} ruling of the Court of Appeal {{in favour of}} Beer.

However, the promise {{to pay a debt}} was deemed not to be <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> as there was no additional benefit moving from Foakes to Beer that was not already owed to her.|$|R

This paper further explores the granularity of the “softness” of systems methodologies, and identifies a missing part: emotion.

Unfortunately, existing literature does not demonstrate a <b>sufficient</b> <b>consideration</b> {{of the role}} of emotion in systems methodologies.
