25|$|The Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament {{refused to}} ratify the {{articles}} of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the penal laws, which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish <b>saying</b> <b>was,</b> cuimhnigí Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh ("remember Limerick and Saxon treachery"). The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope Pope Innocent XII changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693. This factor hardened Protestant attitudes towards Catholics and Jacobitism in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In {{recording}} {{the words of}} his teachers, Judah used extreme care, and frequently stated explicitly that his authority for a given <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> uncertain, and that his informant did not know positively whether it was Rav's or Samuel's (Ḥul. 18b). His own memory, however, never failed him, and the traditions recorded by him are reliable. When his brother Rami says, in one place, that a certain sentence of Rav's, quoted by Judah, should be disregarded (Ḥul. 44a), he does not question the accuracy of Judah's citation, but implies that Rav had afterward abandoned the opinion quoted by Judah, and had, in a statement which the latter had not heard, adopted an opposite view.|$|E

500|$|In 1890, Congress passed {{legislation}} giving federal sponsorship to an exposition {{to commemorate the}} 400th anniversary of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World. The act had established a World's Columbian Exposition Commission to oversee the fair. Leading citizens of Chicago established a World's Columbian Exposition Company ("the Company") to organize the construction, and the Company generally emerged as successful in the resulting infighting as to which group would be in charge. Had {{it not been for}} Daniel Burnham, head of the Company's Board of Architects, the fair might never have been built. Burnham, whose favorite <b>saying</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood", became the czar of the exposition's construction.|$|E
500|$|MercyMe's {{lead singer}} Bart Millard wrote [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] while touring {{in support of}} their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine". The travel was exhausting, and Millard commented in an {{interview}} that, {{on one of the}} nights on tour, he [...] "went to bed just really frustrated... It started feeling like everything I was <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> the same. I just thought, I have nothing else to say. So I went to bed with that on my mind". After falling asleep, Millard woke up {{early in the morning and}} wrote several lines to the song in his journal before going back to sleep. Several weeks later, he was searching through his journal and found the notes again; when he went to the band's studio, he showed the notes to his producer, Pete Kipley. The two finished the lyrics to the song in less than thirty minutes, and recorded the piano track the same night; they also brought in someone to compose a string track for the song. Millard wanted [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] to contain only piano, avoiding the big production that could assure the song success on the radio, as he felt the simple production would mirror the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by <b>saying</b> (<b>was</b> that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E

But if he be a liar, what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> untrue, and consequently the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore what he <b>says</b> <b>is</b> true; <b>saying</b> the Cretans <b>are</b> liars, Epimenides is himself a liar, {{and what he}} <b>says</b> <b>is</b> untrue. Thus we may go on alternately proving that Epimenides and the Cretans are truthful and untruthful." ...|$|R

Davidson vehemently denied the charge, claiming that jokes about blind people and cancer sufferers would have merited a [...] "mass walkout". He also said the comments about the Damilola Taylor trial were taken out of context: [...] "My actual remark was that I thought the killers should be locked away forever.

2500|$|Because of the ubiquitousness of license plates, special plates - or even regular ones - {{can raise}} controversy. The state of Colorado, in {{recognition}} of the Columbine High School massacre, released a license plate with the picture of the eponymous state flower, the Columbine, with the words [...] "Choose Life" [...] in a crayon-line scrawl. Some people complained that they felt the [...] "Choose Life" [...] <b>saying</b> <b>was</b> intended to be an anti-abortion message. Sometimes even ordinary plates can spark controversy. For instance, George Maynard did not like the state motto on his New Hampshire license plate, [...] "Live free or die" [...] and chose to cover it with tape. He was prosecuted and convicted for defacing a license plate. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977), that since one is compelled to have a license plate on one's vehicle, they are permitted not to have to show a message from the state to which they have a moral objection, and overturned his conviction.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{returned}} to the diplomatic scene and responded to the ongoing 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis, in which plans for the Honduran fourth ballot box referendum had led to the 2009 Honduran coup d'état, and which was becoming Latin America's worst political crisis in some years. In early July, she sat down with ousted President of Honduras Manuel Zelaya, who agreed on a U.S.-backed proposal to begin talks with the de facto Roberto Micheletti government. Later, in September, Zelaya {{returned to}} the country, and President of Costa Rica Óscar Arias, who had become a mediator in the matter, as well as Clinton expressed hope that Zelaya's return could break the impasse with the Micheletti government. In particular, Clinton said, [...] "Now that President Zelaya is back it would be opportune to restore him to his position under appropriate circumstances – {{get on with the}} election that is currently scheduled for November, have a peaceful transition of presidential authority and get Honduras back to constitutional and democratic order." [...] At the end of October, Clinton took a leading role in convincing Micheletti to accept a deal – which she termed an [...] "historic agreement" [...] – in which Zelaya would return to power in advance of general elections in which neither figure was running. Micheletti said that Clinton had been insistent on this point: [...] "I kept trying to explain our position to her, but all she kept <b>saying</b> <b>was,</b> 'Restitution, restitution, restitution.'" [...] That agreement broke down, despite efforts of the State Department to revive it, and Clinton and the U.S. ended up supporting the winner of the 2009 Honduran general election, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, with Clinton characterizing the elections as [...] "free and fair" [...] and Lobo as holding a strong commitment to democracy and the rule of constitutional law.|$|E
