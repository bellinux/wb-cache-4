The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978-79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around {{the world and into your}} home, the stories that touch your life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E
