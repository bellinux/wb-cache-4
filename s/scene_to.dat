5|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} by the Alliance Defense Fund, a {{conservative}} Christian {{group in the}} United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, {{the decision was made}} to permit a nativity <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included.|$|E
5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> that received by the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination.|$|E

After the tornado hit, students from both schools who were not injured were relocated by emergency personnel to Hillcrest Baptist Church, adjacent to the schools and which was not damaged, {{in order to meet}} up with shocked parents. Emergency personnel also rushed to the school to send the most seriously injured to local hospitals and provide treatment on the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> others.|$|E

Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style {{for the film}} that involved relatively little camera movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{dialogue}} between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show. Parker likened the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> an afterthought, as he felt it was not necessarily central to the episode's story.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E

5|$|To {{create a}} death scene, Aronofsky drew from Mayan mythology the {{description}} of flowers and butterflies emerging from the bodies of valiant warriors when they die. Aronofsky excluded butterflies from the death <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> minimize the film's computer-generated imagery but kept the effect of flowers bursting from the body.|$|E
5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between the texts is uncertain and many modern editions print both. As an Elizabethan playwright, Marlowe {{had nothing to do}} with the publication and had no control over the play in performance, so it was possible for <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> be dropped or shortened, or for new <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> be added, so that the resulting publications may be modified versions of the original script.|$|R

5|$|About 10 {{years after}} the death of her father, Shi Jianqiao tracked down Sun Chuanfang in Tianjin. Shortly after 3pm on November 13, 1935, she {{approached}} him from behind while he was leading a sutra-recitation session at his lay-Buddhist society on Nanma Road. She then killed the kneeling former warlord by shooting him three times with her Browning pistol. After the assassination, she stayed at the crime <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> explain her deed and distribute mimeographed pamphlets to bystanders. Her case drew a significant amount of public and media attention.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men arrived on the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force {{and all of his}} artillery pieces.|$|E

A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent agents to assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why he chose a geology class on Valentine's Day to open fire. Investigators were expected {{to spend at least}} three more weeks until releasing a report on the incident.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{conflicts}} with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, {{the album was}} renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986. Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal <b>scene.</b> <b>To</b> support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven. In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.|$|E

Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.|$|E

Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|By 1941, Göring was at {{the peak}} of his power and influence, and Hitler {{designated}} him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of German cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> be {{the one in which}} Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.|$|E
