5|$|Three weeks later, on Raw, Vince McMahon signed another {{handicap}} match pitting the Spirit Squad against Shawn Michaels. The match never started, however, {{because the}} Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, in storyline, shattering his knee with a steel chair. McMahon then called Triple H {{to the ring}} to attack Michaels with a <b>sledgehammer,</b> however, Kenny snatched the <b>sledgehammer</b> away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Triple Threat {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between Chris Benoit, Shawn Michaels and Triple H. One spot in the match saw Michaels miss a flying bodypress and crash through a {{broadcast}} table. Another included Triple H assaulting Michaels with a <b>sledgehammer.</b> The last moments in the match saw Benoit force Michaels submit to the sharpshooter to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The oppressive {{taxes and}} brutal {{collection}} methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. Süß {{goes so far}} as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks Süß's coach with a <b>sledgehammer,</b> Süß has the blacksmith hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sledgehammers</b> {{are often}} used in {{destruction}} work, for breaking through drywall or masonry walls. <b>Sledgehammers</b> are seldom used in modern mining operations, particularly hand steel. <b>Sledgehammers</b> are also used when substantial force is necessary to dislodge a trapped object (often in farm or oil field work), or for fracturing concrete. Another common use is for driving fence posts into the ground. <b>Sledgehammers</b> are used by police forces in raids on property to gain entry by force, commonly through doors. They were and still are commonly used by blacksmiths to shape heavy sections of iron. The British SAS counter terrorist team used <b>sledgehammers</b> {{to gain access to}} rooms during the 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege. However, today they use a tool called a [...] "dynamic hammer".|$|R
5000|$|In 2011 {{the team}} was one of seven teams to leave the AMNRL to form the new USA Rugby League. They changed their name to the Pittsburgh <b>Sledgehammers</b> shortly after. In February 2011 it was {{announced}} the <b>Sledgehammers</b> would be participating as a [...] "developmental" [...] team in the new league.|$|R

5|$|With Orton {{trapped in}} Bryan's {{submission}} hold, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage {{and pulled the}} original referee {{out of the ring}} to prevent the match from ending. Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf, as Batista performed the Batista Bomb on a distracted Bryan. Armstrong made the count, but Bryan kicked out at two. A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when Bryan dodged. With no disqualifications in a triple threat match, Bryan kicked referee Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H, Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong. Triple H tried to retaliate with a <b>sledgehammer,</b> but Bryan snatched it and used the <b>sledgehammer</b> on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron. This ended Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's interference in the match.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were {{summoned to the}} hillside {{by the sound of}} a hunting horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, <b>sledgehammer</b> throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E
5|$|After four-month hiatus, Triple H {{returned}} to Raw on October 3, 2005 {{as part of}} WWE Homecoming. He teamed with fellow Evolution member Flair to defeat Chris Masters and Carlito. After the match, Triple H turned on Flair hitting Flair with a <b>sledgehammer,</b> sparking a feud between the duo. Flair defeated Triple H in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday for Flair's Intercontinental Championship. Subsequently, Triple H defeated Flair in a non-title Last Man Standing match at Survivor Series to end their feud.|$|E

50|$|Post mauls {{are similar}} to <b>sledgehammers</b> in shape, but are meant to drive wooden fence posts or tree stakes into the earth. Newer mauls have broad, flat {{circular}} faces that are significantly larger in diameter than {{the body of the}} head (where the handle attaches). Older post mauls are significantly larger than <b>sledgehammers</b> like their newer counterparts except the outside diameter (body) of older post maul designs remained the same large diameter as that of the faces of the hammer {{from one side to the}} other side. <b>Sledgehammers</b> usually have octagonal faces that are the same diameter or slightly smaller than the body of the head, and they are not nearly as large in overall diameter as a post maul.|$|R
50|$|The handle {{can range}} from 50 cm to a full 1 m long, {{depending}} on {{the mass of the}} head. The head mass is usually 1 to 3 kg. Modern heavy duty <b>sledgehammers</b> come with 10 to(-) 20 lb heads. <b>Sledgehammers</b> usually require two hands and a swinging motion involving the entire torso, in contrast to smaller hammers used for driving in nails. The combination of a long swinging range, and heavy head, increases the force of the resulting impact.|$|R
5|$|Before September 2, 2002, WWE {{recognized}} {{only one}} world champion, the WWE Undisputed Champion, {{for both the}} Raw and SmackDown! brands. After SummerSlam, then WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown!, leaving Raw without a world champion. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff then awarded Triple H the World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the Big Gold Belt (which previously {{had been used to}} represent the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Heavyweight Championship), making him the first World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H retained his title against Rob Van Dam at Unforgiven when Ric Flair hit Van Dam with a <b>sledgehammer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Events {{included}} horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, <b>sledgehammer</b> throwing, {{fighting with}} swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes, and abundant food was supplied {{for everyone who}} attended. A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what {{is now known as}} Dover's Hill, complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the event was a Hell in a Cell bout between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Triple H choked Batista with a chain and {{hit him in the}} back with a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire. Batista regained the {{momentum}} by grabbing Triple H's <b>sledgehammer</b> and hitting him with it. Batista performed a spinebuster onto the steel steps on Triple H, which was followed with a Batista Bomb for the win to retain the title. After the Hell in a Cell match, Triple H was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E

5|$|After {{a four-month}} hiatus, Triple H {{returned}} on the WWE Homecoming episode of Raw on October 3. He {{took part in}} a match, teaming up with Ric Flair, who was wrestling as a face, to take on Chris Masters and Carlito. The duo defeated Masters and Carlito; after the match, Triple H turned on Flair and hit him with a <b>sledgehammer.</b> This led to an angle between Triple H and Flair. At Taboo Tuesday, Triple H and Flair met in a Steel cage match, a stipulation chosen by the fans, for the Intercontinental Championship. The match saw Flair retain the Intercontinental Championship, after escaping through the cage door.|$|E
5|$|In June 1998 {{the brother}} of the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, was sued by his former {{business}} partners in a case that was settled out of court. During the case the Manoukians claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester. In 1999, the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards. In March 2002, a robbery took place {{in the lobby of the}} hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewellery cabinets with a <b>sledgehammer</b> and took off with jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Triple H faced Kevin Nash inside Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During {{the start of}} the match, both men used a steel chair, a hammer, and the cell to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat many times before Triple H hit him with the steel steps. As Triple H brought a <b>sledgehammer</b> into the ring, Foley {{attempted}} to take it away from him, resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and Nash with a steel chair. Triple H followed up, Pedigreeing Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Title.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} album Blood Fire Death, {{one of the}} first {{definitive}} Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies and folk music elements such as bourdon sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of musique concrète. Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a <b>sledgehammer.</b> The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections– introduction, bridge, and finale– and two vocal sections– stanza and refrain.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a <b>sledgehammer</b> to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between Triple H and Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff banned Evolution (Batista and Ric Flair) from ringside. Orton had the {{advantage}} until Triple H countered an RKO by throwing Orton out of the ring. Triple H kept the advantage and targeted Orton's left knee until Orton knocked him into a broadcast table. Orton kept the advantage until he missed a DDT. Triple H knocked both Orton and the referee down with a clothesline and tried to hit Orton with a <b>sledgehammer</b> but Orton pulled him into the ringpost. Triple H performed another clothesline and a Pedigree to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Triple H and Ric Flair began at WWE Homecoming, when Triple H {{returned}} to WWE television after {{an absence of}} three months. The two had been aligned since 2002, as members of Evolution, and were partners in a tag team match on the show. After they won the match, Triple H attacked Flair with a <b>sledgehammer.</b> The week after, Triple H explained his actions, saying that he realized Flair {{was no longer the}} legend he was, and he needed to stop Flair. Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday, which Flair won. A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Triple H and Umaga, voted by the fans to be a Street Fight, where the match {{could take place}} {{anywhere}} in the arena, and any weapon could be used. The match began in the entrance area and involved Umaga getting speared through the stage setting. The match moved to into the audience {{before returning to the}} ring. Several weapons were used, and Umaga splashed Triple H through an announce table. The match ended when Triple H hit Umaga with a <b>sledgehammer</b> and performed a Pedigree to score the victory via pinfall. Mickie James was then announced to be the winner of the Divas Halloween costume contest.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, McMahon {{scheduled}} another handicap match, with The Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead The Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart {{his ring}} attire and, {{as part of}} the storyline, shattering his knee with a steel chair. McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, Kenny snatched the <b>sledgehammer</b> away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group. Triple H and Michaels revived D-Generation X (DX), since their teased reunion in 2002, and as a team began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric pranks on the team and the McMahons (Vince and Shane), as well as defeating The Spirit Squad in handicap matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E
5000|$|In China {{and many}} other countries, after the {{demolition}} of a concrete structure, workers are called in to remove the rebar.
