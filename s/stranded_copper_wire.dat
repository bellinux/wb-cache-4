Four types of storage devices are identified:- electro-chemical (batteries) - hydrogen- electro-mechanical (flywheels) - Molten salt heat storage A high speed flywheel {{with a small}} permanent magnet motor/generator has more advantages {{than any of the}} other systems and might become a real competitor to the internal combustion engine. A flywheel/motor/generator system for automobiles becomes now practical, because of the technological advances in materials, bearings and solid state control circuits. The motor of choice is the squirrel cage induction motor, specially designed for automobile applications. Some of the special design considerations are: high speed (up to 16000 rpm), high break-down torque, 83 % coil pitch, <b>stranded</b> stator <b>copper</b> <b>wire,</b> and special cooling arrangements. The preferred controller for the induction motor is a forced commutated cyclo-converter, which transforms a variable voltage/variable frequency source into a controlled variable-voltage/variable-frequency supply. A modulation strategy of the cyclo-converter elements will be selected to maintain a unity input displacement factor (power factor) under all conditions of loads voltages and frequencies.

40|$|A {{common mistake}} in biomagnetic {{experimentation}} {{is the assumption}} that Helmholtz coils provide uniform magnetic fields; this is true only for a limited volume at their center. Substantial improvements on this design have been made during the past 140 years with systems of three, four, and five coils. Numerical comparisons of the field uniformity generated by these designs are made here, along with a table of construction details and recommendations for their use in experiments in which large volumes of uniform intensity magnetic exposures are needed. Double-wrapping, or systems of bifilar windings, can also help control for the non-magnetic effects of the electric coils used in many experiments. In this design, each coil is wrapped in parallel with two separate, adjacent <b>strands</b> of <b>copper</b> <b>wire,</b> rather than the single strand used normally. If currents are flowing in antiparallel directions, the magnetic fields generated by each strand will cancel and yield virtually no external magnetic field, whereas parallel currents will yield an external field. Both cases will produce similar non-magnetic effects of ohmic heating, and simple measures can reduce the small vibration and electric field differences. Control experiments can then be designed such that the only major difference between treated and untreated groups is {{the presence or absence of}} the magnetic field.

Based on the analysis, the cooling flow rate at each flow branch (rotor-stator gap, rotor subslot, outside space block, and small ventilation holes to the heat exchanger) was determined, and the high-pressure gradient zones were identified.

40|$|Wire bonding {{technology}} is the earliest chip level interconnection technology, {{but it is still}} the most widely used one in integrated circuit (IC) assembly for its noticeable advantages over other interconnection technologies. Traditionally, gold wire has been the dominating wiring materials in wire bonding technique. Gold wire has many distinguished characteristics such as excellent ductility, conductivity and chemical stability. However, the biggest reliability issue of gold wire bonding is associated with intermetallic compound (IMC) generated at the gold wire-aluminum bonding pad interface. The rapid development of IC technology desires devices that are smaller, faster and cheaper; progressive high current or high power devices demand alterative interconnection materials which have thermal properties and electrical conductivity that are superior to those of gold. With many distinguished advantages such as a higher conductivity, superior mechanical properties, less tendency of forming IMC and especially a much lower cost, copper have rapidly gain a foothold as the main potential material to replace gold for the wire bonding in electronic packaging. Although many integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless semiconductor companies are considering the application of <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire</b> in at least some product designs, there are still deep reservations in the industry over the use of this material, particularly due to concerns over in-service product reliability. Corrosion issue is the biggest problem of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. To prevent the corrosion, epoxy molding compound (EMC) is required to have excellent properties to provide good protection to <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. Thus the evaluation and selection of epoxy molding compound for <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages are very important. In this study, the corrosion mechanism of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> package is studies and discussed, EMC inherently absorbs moisture or water from the environment, substances contained in EMC may have a tendency to dissolve and ionize in the absorbed water and form an electrolyte, corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> will take place if placed in a suitable electrolyte. Due to its lower nobility compared with gold, <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> has a higher possibility to be corroded under the same conditions, than means the requirement of epoxy molding compound is stricter when used in <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages.

Although economics has been the driving mechanism to lower semiconductor packaging costs for a savings of about 20 % by replacing gold <b>wire</b> bonds with <b>copper,</b> copper also has materials property advantages over gold. When compared to gold, copper has approximately: 25 % lower electrical resistivity, 30 % higher thermal conductivity, 75 % higher tensile strength and 45 % higher modulus of elasticity. <b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds on aluminum bond pads are also more mechanically robust over time and elevated temperature due to the slower intermetallic formation rate - approximately 1 / 100 th that of the gold to aluminum intermetallic formation rate. However, there are significant tradeoffs with <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonding - <b>copper</b> has twice the hardness of gold which results in a narrower bonding manufacturing process window and requires that the semiconductor companies design more mechanically rigid bonding pads to prevent cratering to both the bond pad and underlying chip structure. Furthermore, copper is significantly more prone to corrosion issues. The semiconductor packaging industry has responded to this corrosion concern by creating a palladium coated <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire,</b> which is more corrosion resistant than pure <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire.</b> Also, the selection of the device molding compound is critical because use of environmentally friendly green compounds can result in internal CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatches with the <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds that can eventually lead to device failures during thermal cycling.
