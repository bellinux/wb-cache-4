500|$|Most {{references}} to alternative rock {{music in the}} United States past 2010 are to the indie rock genre, a term that previously had limited usage on alternative rock channels and media. While there have been conflicting opinions on the relevance of alternative rock to mainstream audiences beyond 2010, Dave Grohl commented on an article from the December 29, 2013 issue of the New York Daily News stating that rock is dead: [...] "speak for yourself... rock <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> alive to me." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Kenneth Nguyen from The Age commented [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist', {{is perhaps}} the most complex, confronting installment thus far of a series that prides itself on being complex and confronting." [...] The reporter went on to praise the [...] "expertly scripted" [...] reveal and thought Diane Ruggiero's [...] "command of the tightrope high-school milieu <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> much spot-on. It is Ruggiero's resolution of the mystery, however, that will keep fans talking. Like the best resolutions, I suppose, it raises more questions than it answers." ...|$|E
500|$|Hockey {{attempted}} to resolve his dilemma by declaring that as leader he {{would allow a}} conscience vote on the ETS legislation. Abbott rejected Hockey's declaration, and reneged on his earlier indication that he would withdraw his candidacy for Hockey. Abbott stated: [...] "It now <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> clear we could change the leader to Joe and these offensive bills could still go through the Parliament". On Hockey's candidacy, Turnbull claimed that Hockey had pledged {{his opposition to the}} spill motion. However, it was expected that if the spill motion succeeded, Hockey would stand for the leadership against Turnbull and Abbott. Hockey was generally expected to win the ballot and become leader. [...] To the end, Turnbull refused to stand aside as leader, insisting he would defeat the spill motion. Hockey later alleged that Turnbull had promised he would not stand against Hockey if the spill motion was successful. Turnbull denied that he had given, and therefore broken, any such undertaking.|$|E

6000|$|... 'And {{all things}} considered,' said Mrs Gamp sharply, 'she might have know'd {{better than to}} go a-tirin herself out, by doin' anythink of the sort. Did they <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> {{pleasant}} together, sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "New York canoe club model," [...] Cliffe replied. [...] "Had her {{brought down}} on a freight-car. Evelyn's fond of sailing and smart at the helm. She's all right--though the breeze does <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> fresh." ...|$|R
500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When I first got called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} neither West, Jay Z or Ocean, {{but instead}} focuses on two groups: [...] "protestors and the police, both {{at war with}} one another. And yes, this is war — it's an unsettling and savage clip, depicting protestors being beaten and pepper-sprayed as they mercilessly combat with the police, though the protestors-turned-rioters also inflict {{a large part of}} the violence: they destroy property, loot stores, and set fire to cars — and humans. The video refuses to take sides, as there's no winner when a conflict turns to violence." [...] Young men are beaten, choked, sprayed with mace and dragged across the concrete as Frank Ocean soulfully croons, [...] "Will he make it out alive?" [...] in time with the staged anarchy. [...] By the end of the five-minute video, [...] "the freedom fighters seem to have notched a victory of some sort, standing in triumph in the face of their oppressors. But even if a single battle is won, there is no conclusive ending, meaning that the war still rages on." [...] Popping up at the end of the clip is an actual elephant, chained at the neck and trying to resist getting choked to death. Pitchfork gave the clip a positive review, however noted [...] "Kanye's [...] "you will not control the threesome"/"never fuck nobody without telling me" [...] verse <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> out of place when you're watching a cop get set on fire." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{he later}} told The New York Times [...] "I {{guess it is}} sort of a storybook ending. [...] When you think about where I was and where I am now, it <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> incredible." ...|$|E
50|$|In no time, {{the giant}} notices their escape and tosses large forks {{on the table}} to entrap them. The giant then holds Oswald and the big beagle in {{separate}} hands, and their doom <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> much sealed.|$|R
6000|$|The colonel asked {{a number}} of {{cautious}} and well-considered questions-- questions which <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> odd and flighty to Tracy--but the answers conveyed the information desired, apparently, for the colonel said to himself, with mixed pride and gratification: ...|$|R

2500|$|Mozilla {{developer}} Asa Dotzler noted: [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> {{obvious to}} me that the Chrome team is bowing to pressure from Google's advertising business and that's a real shame. I had hoped they'd demonstrate a bit more independence than that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{get to see}} 'em, as I {{only put}} up my hoss there," [...] he replied. [...] "But I know the stage took some away this mornin': it <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> well loaded up when I passed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My way of {{thinking}} is too robust for Marian, Miss McQuinch. I admit that it does not, at first sight, <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> or sentimental. But I {{do not know how}} even Marian can prefer the church bells to Bach." ...|$|R
6000|$|The lawyer listened gloomily; he did {{not like}} his friend's feverish manner. [...] "You <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> sure of him," [...] said he; [...] "and for your sake, I hope you may be right. If it came to a trial your name might appear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> cock-sure," [...] {{returned}} Pat, {{who was in}} a contradictory {{mood that}} day; [...] "but you know scholards sometimes differ in their opinions about books." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Climb round him?" [...] I queried, as I gazed dubiously upward. [...] "You mean to {{slip out}} on the {{branches}} and go up hand-over-hand till I get above him. The branches up there <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> close--I might. But suppose he goes higher?" ...|$|R
60|$|Madame {{effected}} {{the reunion}} of her troupe, and all <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> much as before. She {{had decided to}} dance the next night, the Saturday night. On Sunday the party would leave for Warsall, about thirty miles away, to fulfil their next engagement.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} that I did," [...] answered Ned Lowe. [...] "I {{was in such}} a hurry to get the instrument that I didn't pay much attention. And, besides that, it <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> dark in here after coming away from that big bonfire." ...|$|R

60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say I had {{expected}} to see Cyril showing a few more traces of last night's battle. I {{was looking for a}} bit of the overwrought soul and the quivering ganglions, if you know what I mean. He <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> ordinary and quite fairly cheerful.|$|R
5000|$|The Boston Globes Claude R. Marx {{wrote that}} [...] "Suskinds sources <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> solid, and the denials from the White House and former CIA {{director}} George Tenet were {{what you would}} expect of policymakers trying to salvage their reputation; they didnt try to disparage Suskind or threaten legal action".|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> {{tough to}} go yet further south; but Mr. Walters is a {{cautious}} sailin' master, an' {{when he makes}} up his mind to a thing {{you can count on}} its bein' mighty nigh right." ...|$|E
