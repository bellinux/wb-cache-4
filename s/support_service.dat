5|$|The US Army's basic wartime racial policy, {{established}} in 1937, dictated that both whites and African Americans {{were to be}} inducted into the Army in equal proportions and strength, but that they were to be assigned to segregated units. Black soldiers could be led by white officers, but not vice versa, and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department. The mix of combat and <b>support</b> <b>service</b> units was, in theory, to be roughly equal between both groups. This caused tension between the Department and operational commanders, with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units. In practice, almost all combat units in the pre-war period were white.|$|E

40|$|Since the ICU is an {{extremely}} data-intensive environment,automated data processing is needed in the ICU. The Intensive Care Service Platform facilitates the abstraction of relevant information and supports the physicians through medical <b>support</b> <b>services.</b> These medical <b>support</b> <b>services</b> can be reused as building blocks to create new more advanced services as WS-BPEL compositions.

Therefore, in this paper, we present {{the extension of the}} Intensive Care Service Platform (ICSP) with support for automatic composition of medical <b>support</b> <b>services.</b> The on-line created new medical <b>support</b> <b>services</b> are automatically deployed within ICSP so that physicians can immediately use these medical <b>support</b> <b>services.</b> As a result, the automatic composition of medical <b>support</b> <b>services</b> is a major improvement since now physicians can create new medical <b>support</b> <b>services</b> on the fly without the intervention of programmers, resulting in greater development efficiency and an increasing number of implemented medical <b>support</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

5|$|While {{a celebrated}} {{cause for the}} Australian left—{{particular}}ly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement—the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality. Australian opposition to the Republican cause was marshalled by B.A. Santamaria on an anti-communist basis, rather than a pro-Nationalist basis. Equally, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public <b>support.</b> <b>Service</b> in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently, returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries, at least 14 were killed.|$|E

40|$|In this article, I {{study the}} {{interaction}} between cost accounting systems and pricing decisions in a setting where a monopolist sells a base product and related <b>support</b> <b>services</b> to customers whose preference for <b>support</b> <b>services</b> is known only to them. I consider two pricing mechanisms-activity-based pricing (ABP) and traditional pricing-and two cost-accounting systems-activity-based costing (ABC) and traditional costing, for <b>support</b> <b>services.</b> Under traditional pricing, only the base product is priced, whereas <b>support</b> <b>services</b> are provided free because detailed cost-driver volume information on the consumption of <b>support</b> <b>services</b> by each customer is unavailable. Under ABP, customers pay based on the quantities consumed of both the base product and the <b>support</b> <b>services</b> because detailed cost-driver volume information is available for each customer. Likewise, under traditional costing for <b>support</b> <b>services</b> the firm makes pricing decisions on cost signals that are noisier than they are under ABC. I compare the equilibrium quantities of the base product and <b>support</b> <b>services</b> sold, the information rent paid to the customers, and the expected profits of the monopolist under all four combinations of cost-driver volume and cost-driver rate information.
