50|$|<b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease</b> {{is named}} after him and William Stokes.|$|E
50|$|Soon afterwards, {{he married}} an American, Florence Brewer, known to all as Gretchen and they later had a {{daughter}} Diana. In 1939, he returned to London and volunteered for service, but was rejected on medical grounds having suffered from <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
40|$|The facts {{collected}} in the third part of this paper justify the following conclusions: (1) All of the cardinal symptoms of <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease</b> may be duplicated by heart-block resulting from a lesion {{in or near the}} auriculo-ventricular bundle of His, and by this alone. (2) No typical case of <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease</b> has been described in which heart-block might not have been the cause of the trouble. (3) It can be shown that all cases of <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease</b> which have been studied by sufficiently accurate methods were cases of heart-block. (4) It would appear that heart-block without and with syncopal attacks are two stages of the same disease process...|$|E
40|$|Adams {{disease has}} been renewed and many new {{approaches}} have been developed. For-merly, {{it was considered}} a rare disease of the aged for which the prognosis was poor and the treatment was unsatisfactory. Now, it seems more common and is seen not infre-quently in young people. Furthermore, new types of treatment provide solutions {{for many of the}} problems of <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease</b> and even offer the possibility of complete preven-tion of seizures. These new developments in-elude external electric cardiac stimulation ' 2 and countershock, 3 eardiac monitoring, 4 intra-venous administration of sympathomimetic amines, 0 mouth-to-mouth breathing, 6 hypo-thermia 7 short-term 8 and long-term direct electric stimulation, 9 1 and external cardiac compression. ' 2 Elsewhere in this issue is described an effec-tive pharmacologic approach to one of the remaining problems of <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease,</b> the prevention of recurrent attacks due to ventricular tachyeardia and fibrillation. 13 Epi-nephrine and isoproterenol, despite their well-known excitatory effects on ventricular rhyth-micity, were found to prevent ventricular irritability in <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease</b> poses three majo...|$|E
40|$|Ten patients, {{between the}} ages of 39 and 75 years, {{underwent}} subcutaneous implantation of an electrode pacemaker for relief of recurrent syncopal episodes of <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease.</b> Their prolonged course of severe disability on medical therapy is in marked contrast to their new life, free of syncopal attacks, on pacemaker therapy. Experience in the management of these patients has shown that the electrode catheter, introduced intravenously to stimulate the right ventricular endocardium, is the best temporary therapy in a patient with uncontrollable syncopal attacks, and it should be used in all patients undergoing the surgical procedure of implantation. Pacemaker therapy is applicable to patients in sinus rhythm as well as to those in complete heart block. Observations on the effect of heart rate on cardiac output have shown the need of a faster rate in the presence of congestive failure for the maintenance of an adequate cardiac output. The favourable course of patients after implantation of a pacemaker indicates that this is the treatment of choice in <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nine {{patients}} with complete heart block and <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>disease</b> {{were treated with}} subcutaneously implanted, fixed-rate, artificial cardiac pacemakers. All of these patients were refractory to medical treatment and confined to bed by the frequency of their attacks. One patient died in uremia one month after operation; in the remaining eight, the implanted pacemakers are providing adequate stimulation at present. These patients are free of seizures and show an improvement {{in the amount of}} their physical activity. A fixed rate of 60 to 65 per minute was adequate in all cases. The results of our clinical experience with cardiac pacemakers is satisfactory, but the possibility of mechanical failure limits their use to situations in which the patient is incapacitated despite medical treatment...|$|E
