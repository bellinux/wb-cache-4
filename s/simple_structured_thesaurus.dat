40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the query}} {{expansion}} techniques in information retrieval systems, structure-based query expansion for XML search engines, {{which is designed}} to ease the query for XML data while keeping the power and flexibility of XML query, is introduced in this paper. To enable the structure expansion, a <b>structure</b> <b>thesaurus</b> should be built first, which involves the construction of a weighted graph from XML documents and the linkage-based clustering method to cluster the nodes into several groups. After a query comes, the <b>structure</b> <b>thesaurus</b> is examined, so that for each tag in the original query, the tags in the same group are retrieved. Unrelated tags are filtered and some heuristic rules are applied to replacing the tags in the original query with the related tags and to expanding the structure. It is shown that using structure-based query expansion, the system can return result with high precision and recall. 1...|$|R

40|$|The AGROVOC is a {{multilingual}} <b>structured</b> <b>thesaurus</b> in {{the agricultural}} domain. It has already been mapped with several vocabularies, for example AGROVOC-CAT, AGROVOC-NALT, AGROVOC-SWD. Although these vocabularies already contained {{a good portion of}} non-preferred terms, the terms are collected under the literary warrant and institutional warrant principles; which means vocabularies were collected based on the documents and publications rather than user‟s queries. It is still very common that end users would use different terms to express the same concept. In light of above discussion, we need to bridge these vocabularies and the users‟ terms Backgroun...|$|R
40|$|Factor {{analysis}} and {{principal components analysis}} (PCA) are often followed by an orthomax rotation to rotate a loading matrix to <b>simple</b> <b>structure.</b> The <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> is usually {{defined in terms of}} the simplicity of the columns of the loading matrix. In Three-made PCA, rotational freedom of the so called core (a three-way array relating components for the three different modes) can be used similarly to find a <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> of the core. <b>Simple</b> <b>structure</b> of the core can be defined with respect to ail three modes simultaneously, possibly with different emphases on the different modes. The present paper provides a fully flexible approach for orthomax rotation of the core to <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> with respect to three modes simultaneously. Computationally, this approach relies on repeated (two-way) orthomax applied to supermatrices containing the frontal, lateral or horizontal slabs, respectively. The procedure is illustrated by means of a number of exemplary analyses. As a by-product, application of the Three-mode Orthomax procedures to two-way arrays is shown to reveal interesting relations with and interpretations of existing two-way <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> rotation techniques...|$|R

Their study makes links to <b>simple</b> <b>structures</b> and improviser learning. Other scholars such as Jan Rivkin and Sigglekow, and Nelson Repenning revive an older interest in how structure and strategy relate in dynamic environments.|$|R

40|$|Factor {{analysis}} and {{principal component analysis}} result in computing a new co-ordinate system, which is usually rotated to obtain a better interpretation of the results. In the present paper, the idea of rotation to <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> is extended to two dimensions. While the classical definition of <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> is aimed at rotating (one-dimensional) factors, the extension to a <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> for two dimensions {{is based on the}} rotation of planes. The resulting planes (principal planes) reveal a better view of the data than planes spanned by factors from classical rotation and hence allow a more reliable interpretation. The usefulness of the method as well as the effectiveness of a proposed algorithm are demonstrated by simulation experiments and an example. Key words: principal component analysis, factor analysis, orthogonal rotation, <b>simple</b> <b>structure.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program to rotate two factor matrices to maximum congruence is described. The program {{is based upon}} the confactor principle and not upon <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> principles. The two factor matrices must contain the same variables and number of factors but should be from disparate populations or treatment phases. Two, and only two, principles have been proposed as a basis for unique factor resolution in the general case, i. e., when no specific hy-potheses exist to guide rotation. They are <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> (Thurstone, 1947) and confactor, or parallel proportional profiles (Cattell, 1944). Both methods are discussed in Gorsuch (1974) and Cattell (1978). Both authors have stressed the limitations of the <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> prin-ciple. Solutions are not unique, in fact, they are highly dependent on the variables selected. Confactor analysis which provides one unique solution, can be used with any choice of variables.

40|$|Problems with {{parallel}} {{analysis in}} data sets with oblique <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> André Beauducel 1 Parallel analysis, {{one of the}} most promising methods to determine the number of principal components or factors to retain (Velicer, Eaton, & Fava, 2000), has been shown to underestimate the number of components to retain when the first eigenvalue is large (Turner, 1998). In order to further explore the potential problems with parallel analysis, orthogonal and oblique 4 -, 8 -, and 12 -component solutions with four different degrees of <b>simple</b> <b>structure</b> were computed for simulated data. Since the first eigenvalue of the oblique solutions was generally large, parallel analysis was expected to underestimate the number of components to retain in these solutions. This was confirmed in the present simulation study. Even in solutions with pronounced oblique <b>simple</b> <b>structure,</b> parallel analysis tended to result in underextraction for the 8 - and 12 -component solutions. Thus, one should be aware of the possibility of underextractions when parallel analysis is used with data yielding components or factors with oblique <b>simple</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R
