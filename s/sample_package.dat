A whiskey-crazed farmhand is walking bare footed {{up and down the}} middle of the road defying the world.--From a corner of the street I watch with tense interest another lithe, pock-marked bully menacing with cat-like action, a cowering young farmer in a long linen coat. The crowd jeers at him for his cowardice--a burst of shouting is heard. A trampling follows and forth from the door of a saloon bulges a throng of drunken, steaming, reeling, cursing ruffians followed by brave Jim McCarty, the city marshal, with an offender under each hand.--The scene changes to the middle of the street. I am one of a throng surrounding a smooth-handed faker who is selling prize boxes of soap and giving away dollars.--"Now, gentlemen," [...] he says, [...] "if you will hand me a dollar I will give you a <b>sample</b> <b>package</b> of soap to examine, afterwards if you don't want the soap, return it to me, and I'll return your dollar." [...] He repeats this several times, returning the dollars faithfully, then slightly varies his invitation by saying, [...] "so that I can return your dollars." ...|$|E

The paper became the idea of FedEx (for years, the <b>sample</b> <b>package</b> displayed in the company's print advertisements featured a return address at Yale). Smith became a member and eventually the president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity and the Skull and Bones secret society. He received his bachelor's degree in economics in 1966.

30|$|Both {{gravimetric}} and instantaneous samplers {{were used}} for testing the CAC for respirable dust control. Each gravimetric sampler consisted of an Escort ELF® pump, a 10 -mm Dorr-Oliver cyclone, and a 37 -mm, 5 -µm PVC filter. The Escort ELF pumps were calibrated to maintain 2.0  L/min airflow. The Thermo Scientific pDR- 1000 ®was used as the instantaneous sampler. The typical <b>sampling</b> <b>package</b> was comprised of two gravimetric samplers and one instantaneous <b>sampler.</b> One <b>sampling</b> <b>package</b> was placed approximately 0.91  m (3 ft.) upstream of the shuttle car cab and another was placed 0.91  m (3 ft.) downstream of the shuttle car cab.

40|$|Voice over IP and {{the open}} source {{technologies}} are becoming popular choices for organizations. However, while accessing the VoiceXML gateways these systems fail to attract the global users economically. The objective {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate how an existing web application can be modified using VoiceXML to enable non-visual access from any phone. Moreover, we unleash a way for linking an existing PSTN-based phone line to a VoiceXML gateway even though the voice service provider (VSP) does not provide a local geographical number to global customers to access the application. In addition, we introduce an economical way for small sized businesses to overcome the high cost of setting up and using a commercial VoiceXML gateway. The method is based on Asterisk server. In order to elucidate the entire process, we present a <b>sample</b> <b>Package</b> Tracking System application, which is based on an existing website and provides the same functionality as the website does.

30|$|Impact of {{fish gelatin}} film {{incorporated}} without and with palm {{oil on the}} quality changes of fried shrimp cracker stored for 15  days at room temperature was investigated, in comparison with nylon/linear low-density polyethylene (nylon/LLDPE) film. The moisture content and water activity of shrimp cracker packaged with all films increased during storage (p <  0.05). The lowest moisture content and water activity {{were found in the}} <b>sample</b> <b>packaged</b> with nylon/LLDPE film throughout the storage (p <  0.05). <b>Sample</b> <b>packaged</b> with fish gelatin films incorporated with palm oil generally had lower moisture content than those without oil added during the first 12  days of storage (p <  0.05). During 15  days of storage, shrimp cracker packaged with nylon/LLDPE film generally had the lower PV and TBARS value as well as volatile compounds, except for n-nonanal, than those stored in fish gelatin films, regardless of oil incorporation. The decrease in crispiness and increase in toughness occurred in all samples during the 15  days of storage. Nevertheless, the lower changes were observed in the <b>sample</b> <b>packaged</b> with nylon/LLDPE film. Overall, gelatin film showed excellent oxygen barrier property, which was associated with the retardation of lipid oxidation. The incorporation of oil into gelatin film could lower WVP, but negatively increased oxygen permeability of the resulting film. Thus, the improvement of gelatin film is still required.|$|R

40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of the safety of radioactive material transportation {{it is important to consider}} the response of Type B packages to environments more severe than that prescribed by the hypothetical accident sequence in Title 10 Part 71 of the Code of Federal Regulations (NRC 1995). The impact event in this sequence is a 9 -meter drop onto an essentially unyielding target, resulting in an impact velocity of 13. 4 m/s. The behavior of 9 packages when subjected to impacts more severe than this is not well known. It is the purpose of this program to evaluate the structural response of a test package to these environments. Several types of structural response are considered. Of primary importance is the behavior of the package containment boundary, including the bolted closure and 0 -rings. Other areas of concern are loss of shielding capability due to lead slump and the deceleration loading of package contents, that may cause damage to them. This type of information is essential for conducting accurate risk assessments on the transportation of radioactive materials. Currently very conservative estimates of the loss of package protection are used in these assessments. This paper will summarize the results of a regulatory impact test and three extra-regulatory impact tests on a <b>sample</b> <b>package...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{mycotoxin}} {{contamination in}} foods {{has become a}} growing threat and aroused many researches in science area. According to the food control authorities, Ochratoxin A (OTA) is among mycotoxins priority of food contaminants. The current work focuses on coffee cherries quality environment in Ivory Coast. The neglecting of good agricultural practices would lead to recurrent contamination of ivorian coffee in mycotoxinogen fungi and mycotoxin. We investigated and sampled during the post-harvest drying process of Robusta coffee bean, brought from Ivory Coast in 2008 and 2009. Morphological identification of total fungal flora and the determination of OTA producers of Aspergillus section Nigri have been performed. The reliability of the overall evaluated fungal contamination is estimated at 97 %, being 7. 03 in one coffee <b>sample</b> <b>package</b> of 300 g. Strains were isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) by the direct plating technique, and were grown at 25 °C.

40|$|International audienceThe {{primary goal}} of an {{irradiation}} facility for fusion applications will be to generate a material irradiation database for the design, construction, licensing and safe operation of a fusion demonstration power station (e. g., DEMO). This will be achieved through testing and qualifying material performance under neutron irradiation that simulates service up to the full lifetime anticipated in the power plant. Preliminary investigations of 14 MeV neutron effects on different kinds of fusion material could be assessed by the SPIRAL 2 Project at GANIL (Caen, France), aiming at rare isotope beams production for nuclear physics research with first beams expected by 2009. In SPIRAL 2, a deuteron beam of 5 mA and 40 MeV interacts with a rotating carbon disk producing high-energy neutrons (in the range between 1 and 40 MeV) via C (d, xn) reactions. Then, the facility {{could be used for}} 3 - 4 months y^− 1 for material irradiation purposes. This would correspond to damage rates in the order of 1 - 2 dpa y^− 1 (in Fe) in a volume of ∼ 10 cm^ 3. Therefore, the use of miniaturized specimens will be essential in order to effectively utilize the available irradiation volume in SPIRAL 2. <b>Sample</b> <b>package</b> irradiation temperature would be in the range of 250 - 1000 °C. The irradiation level of 1 - 2 dpa y^− 1 with 14 MeV neutrons (average energy) may be interesting for micro-structural and metallurgical investigations (e. g., mini-traction, small punch tests, etc.) and possibly for the understanding of specimen size/geometric effects of critical material properties. Due to the small test cell volume, sample in situ experiments are not foreseen. However, sample packages would be, if required, available each month after transfer in a special hot cell on-site...|$|E
