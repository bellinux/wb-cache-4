50|$|The Webley-Fosbery is a recoil-operated revolver. It {{has three}} {{functional}} sections: the barrel and cylinder section, {{the lock and}} hammer action, and the frame which houses the trigger, recoil <b>spring,</b> <b>grip,</b> and safety.|$|E
50|$|One product, the Multy Kontact <b>spring</b> <b>grip</b> socket (3-pin plug), {{soon became}} a market leader and the British Engineering Standards Association (BESA) changed {{standards}} to adopt this new product. By 1923 demand for these new products was growing rapidly and new production facilities were built in Edmonton, London. The company was then renamed MK Electric after its flagship product.|$|E
40|$|Part of the David Elliott {{theatrical}} postcard collection.; "The Dairymaids" is a farcical {{musical comedy}} in 2 acts and 3 scenes by Alexander M. Thompson and Robert Courtneidge. Six {{of the seven}} players are depicted holding Eugen Sandow's patented <b>spring</b> <b>grip</b> dumb-bells in the 'Gymnasium Scene': "Oh, the Sandow, Sandow girl,/ She is smooth and slim and supple,/ And compared with any couple of other girls,/ The Sandow, Sandow girl/ Is a priceless, peerless pearl. / You don't need the police/ if your wife or your niece/ Is a Sandow girl. "; Publicity image for the 1907 - 1908 Australian season of "The Dairymaids", pictured left to right are: Misses Georgie Musgrove (Georgina Mary Musgrove), Mignon Ashton, Linnett Caffyn (also known as Lybus Caffyn or Elizabeth Hutchinson Chester, nee Caffyn), Fanny Dango (Fanny Mackay, nee Rudge), Ruby Hooper or Lottie Bennett?, Ethel Raleigh and Hilda Smith...|$|E
50|$|In {{the most}} normal use, cables have a {{standard}} plug on each end, {{consisting of a}} central male connector, surrounded by a ring. The ring is often segmented to provide <b>spring</b> <b>gripping</b> pressure when mated. Devices mount the socket (female jack), consisting of a central hole with a ring of metal around it. The ring is slightly larger in diameter and longer than the ring on the plug, allowing the plug's ring to fit tightly over it. The jack has a small area between the outer and inner rings which is filled with an insulator, typically plastic (very early versions, or those made for use as RF connectors, used ceramic).|$|R
60|$|He got no further, for {{the young}} man had <b>sprung</b> forward and <b>gripped</b> his hand.|$|R
50|$|Garters in the 18th century {{could be}} elaborately decorated. And were {{sometimes}} embroidered with names, dates, mottoes or humorous phrases. Prior to {{the invention of}} elastic, they were fastened by buckles, or threaded with spiral <b>springs</b> to <b>grip</b> the wearer's leg.|$|R
60|$|Martin <b>sprang</b> {{forward and}} <b>gripped</b> the tiller with his outstretched hand as it glided away from him.|$|R
5000|$|More modern [...] "prehensors" [...] called GRIPS utilize {{voluntary}} closing systems. The {{differences are}} significant. Users of voluntary opening systems rely on elastic bands or <b>springs</b> for <b>gripping</b> force, while users of voluntary closing systems {{rely on their}} own body power and energy to create gripping force.|$|R
50|$|The PF-9 uses {{many parts}} {{originally}} designed for Kel-Tecâ€™s P-11 and P-3AT models, {{and is a}} compromise between those pistols. From the P-11, the PF-9 uses a slightly modified barrel, trigger, ejector, and front sight. The P-3AT parts used in the PF-9 include the extractor and various <b>springs.</b> The <b>grip</b> is available {{in a variety of}} colors, while the slide is available in blued, Parkerized, ceramic (Cerakote), and hard chromed finishes. The PF-9 is shipped with an extended magazine floorplate, an Allen wrench for adjusting the rear sight, and an owner's manual.|$|R
5000|$|Functionality {{is added}} to both models via an {{electric}} powered lift hill, running on a 12v adapter. The lift carries the train to the highest point of the model using a motor, a small fan belt and a <b>spring</b> to <b>grip</b> the train. The model then disengages the lift spring as it is pushed through a steep drop gaining a massive increase in acceleration. The train then navigates around {{the rest of the}} circuit and back to the lift hill by the force of gravity alone. In the event that the layout of the model is too large to be undertaken by the speed gained from the drop, the train will simply stop in the valley or rollback.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crocodile}} clip (also alligator clip or spring clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a <b>spring</b> to <b>grip</b> an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or [...] "boot" [...] to prevent accidental short-circuits.|$|R
5000|$|In the Improver case, {{the patent}} covered a {{depilatory}} device having a curved [...] "helical spring" [...] {{driven by a}} motor. The <b>spring</b> when rotated <b>gripped</b> hairs between its coils and plucked them from the skin. The alleged infringement replaced the spring with a rubber rod having slits in its surface. The question was whether the slitted rubber rod was [...] "a helical spring". The judge answered the three questions as follows: (i) the change to a rubber rod had no material effect {{on the way the}} invention worked; and (ii) it would have been obvious to an expert that the rubber rod would work in the same way; but (iii) the expert would have understood from the patent that the patentee meant to confine his claim to a [...] "helical spring", in its primary meaning and not in a wide generic sense. For this last reason, the rubber rod did not infringe.|$|R
50|$|The {{main reason}} for the program {{is the same for}} when the Colt M1911A1 was {{replaced}} by the Beretta M9 previously: the pistols were {{at the end of their}} service life and wearing out. All firearms have a finite life cycle. While parts such as the barrel, <b>grips,</b> <b>springs,</b> pins, and others can be replaced, the frame cannot and eventually becomes unserviceable. The M9, in service since the late 1980s, is approaching this limit. Examples in service are showing signs of terminal wear, and rather than replacing them with newly built M9s, the Army decided to opt for a new weapon to address design weaknesses. Special Forces use pistols more often and reach the end of the M9's service life relatively quickly, and regular troops are also reaching their handguns' lifecycle end through sheer age. Special operators have opted for other side arms like the SIG Sauer P226 and P228 (Navy SEALs) as well as the Glock 19 (Army Rangers) and Glock 22 (Delta Force). Conventional soldiers have problems with M9 features, or perceived lack thereof, including no accessory rail or suppressor attachment, an ergonomically poor grip, a heavy trigger pull, poor safety selector placement, and an open slide that lets in debris and can cause a malfunction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{detachable}} chairlift didn't {{start with}} a chairlift, rather, it started with the Platter lift in 1908, as the sticks left the cable and attached when someone loaded onto the stick. A detachable two person chairlift called White Lady was installed in Cairngorm Mountain, Scotland in 1961. [...] In 1981, the first ever high speed detachable quad {{in the world was}} installed, the Doppelmayr-built Quicksilver SuperChair at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado, in 1981. This lift was relocated in 1999 to the Owl's Head Ski area in Quebec. Until 1985, this was also the only detachable quad in Colorado when Vail Ski Resort installed four Doppelmayr high speed quads. In 1988, Vail Ski Resort opened up (Orient Express Lift #21), which was the first Doppelmayr chairlift in the U.S. to have rectangular tower heads. The (Orient Express) was also the first Doppelmayr chairlift in the U.S. to have 800 horsepower. The original grip was slightly modified later before the Vail quads were built. Known as the <b>Spring</b> Series, these <b>grips</b> were known as DS-104 grips on high speed quads and DS-108s on eight passenger gondolas. In 1995, a newer grip was introduced called the Torsion series. Torsion grips were called DT-104 if on a high speed quad, DT-106 on a high speed six pack, or DT-108 on an eight-passenger gondola. The Torsion grip is still made today as Doppelmayr (North America)'s primary grip option.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was awful}} {{here in the}} mouth of the cave, for I had not yet learned the secret of the stone, and if I had known it, should I have dared to close it, leaving myself alone with the dead wolves and him whom the wolves had {{struggled}} to tear down? I walked out yonder on to the platform and looked up. The moon shone full upon the face of the stone Witch who sits aloft forever. She seemed to grin at me, and, oh! I grew afraid, for now I knew that this was a place of dead men, a place where spirits perch like vultures in a tree, as they sweep round and round the world. I went back to the cave, and feeling that I must do something lest I should go mad, I drew to me the carcase of the great dog-wolf which I had killed, and, taking my knife of iron, I began to skin it {{by the light of the}} moon. For an hour or more I skinned, singing to myself as I worked, and striving to forget him who sat in the cleft above and the howlings which ran about the mountains. But ever the moonlight shone more clearly into the cave: now by it I could see his shape of bone and skin, ay, and even the bandage about his eyes. Why had he tied it there? I wondered--perhaps to hide the faces of the fierce wolves as they <b>sprang</b> upwards to <b>grip</b> him. And always the howlings drew nearer; now I could see grey forms creeping to and fro in the shadows of the rocky place before me. Ah! there before me glared two red eyes: a sharp snout sniffed at the carcase which I skinned. With a yell, I lifted the Watcher and smote. There came a scream of pain, and something galloped away into the shadows.|$|R
