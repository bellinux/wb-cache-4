40|$|Although the WTO Agreement {{contained}} many {{provisions for}} 2 ̆ 018 special and differential 2 ̆ 019 treatment, {{it is now}} generally accepted that developing countries have yet received rather few real benefits from the Uruguay Round. The hunt is on {{to find ways to}} better address the needs of these countries in the new Round; some suggest the credibility and viability of the WTO itself is at stake. Several suggestions already exist about what further might be done. This paper proposes an additional step which might be taken in the agricultural field. Developing and transitional country governments have a need to protect their farmers (and, often, consumers) against external shocks, particular arising from world market price swings. Typically lacking fiscal resources, their only feasible approach to do this may be through the use of border measures to moderate price transmission to the domestic market. With non-tariff barriers and export subsidies now effectively removed from the choice set for most, what remains are variable tariffs, variable import subsidies and variable export taxes (and, to a limited extent, controls on export quantities). Many developing countries emerged from the Uruguay Round with bound tariffs quite high relative to applied tariffs. This gives them considerable 2 ̆ 018 room 2 ̆ 019 to vary the applied tariff as a domestic price <b>stabilising</b> <b>measure.</b> Some have formal policies in place to do so systematically. Others have done it on a more ad hoc basis. However, questions have been raised about the WTO-legality of such practices because the Agreement on Agriculture explicitly bans some types of variable tariffs (2 ̆ 018 variable import levies 2 ̆ 019 and 2 ̆ 018 minimum import prices 2 ̆ 019). The reality is that such 2 ̆ 018 banned 2 ̆ 019 schemes are still in operation in the EU and Japan, and some other existing forms of variable tariffs (e. g., 2 ̆ 018 seasonal 2 ̆ 019 tariffs) have not been challenged, and appear to be widely acceptable. It is concluded that clarification is needed about which types of variable tariff practices are to be allowed and which are not. Rather than opposing developing countries 2 ̆ 019 use of 2 ̆ 018 sliding scale 2 ̆ 019 tariff schemes and lamenting their high levels of tariff bindings, the OECD group could recognise these countries needs, not exaggerate the costs to themselves, and endorse the practice of varying the applied tariff as a <b>stabilising</b> <b>measure</b> for importcompeting agricultural producers and for consumers of the same commodities. As a 2 ̆ 018 special and differential 2 ̆ 019 concession, developing and transition countries could be allowed to retain tariff bindings at a level high enough to provide a capacity for using variable tariffs as a safety net measure. Conditions and incentives could be attached to ensure transparency, predictability, and a principally stabilising (not permanently protective) tariff use. Any new disciplines on export taxes or controls should take into consideration the logical linkage and be made consistent with such a concession...|$|E
40|$|In 2014, a {{landslide}} in a steep slope beneath an apartment block in Refne {{in the city}} of Halden, Norway led to the evacuation of over 60 residents from their homes. The landslide is assumed to have been triggered by unusually high levels of rainfall over the preceding months, leading to accumulative long-term rainfall not previously seen in the lifetime of the block. Raised groundwater level and increased pore water in the saturated and unsaturated (vadose) zones are assumed to have contributed to reduced stability of the slope. An initial risk assessment was performed to aid communication with local authorities and stakeholders and to clarify necessary actions. Following the evaluation of potential scenarios affecting the structural integrity of the pile foundations, the risk to residents was found to be unacceptable, and evacuation was therefore maintained. In particular, the potential development of a quick clay slide would have had catastrophic consequences. In order to improve the basis for further risk analyses and allow the design of <b>stabilising</b> <b>measures,</b> geotechnical site investigations (SI) were undertaken. Following the SI results and the completion of <b>stabilising</b> <b>measures,</b> an updated risk analysis was issued. This concluded a reduced level of risk for all landslide scenarios previously evaluated, and that the risk to residents was adequately reduced. This paper shows how the visualization of risk using diagrams for risk analysis enabled communication and understanding between the geotechnical and structural engineers, police, local authorities and other stakeholders throughout the project, and formed the basis for decisions regarding evacuations and necessary mitigation measures. Engineering judgment is essential when reviewing risks in any natural hazard situation. Graphical risk analysis tools allow experience to be quantified and communicated to both experts and laymen alike so that operational decisions regarding public safety can be taken...|$|R
40|$|The {{delicacy}} of socio-political consequences {{during the recent}} commodities’ prices spikes {{has given rise to}} <b>stabilising</b> <b>measures</b> that might have had repercussions on public policy alternatives. This effect may be worrying for developing countries, which because {{of the importance of the}} share of imports in their households’ basket, have observed a remarkable increase of their food import bills. This paper attempts to evaluate the effect of food price shocks on public expenditure in level and composition on 47 African countries between 1980 and 2011. After solving for endogeneity issues, our results show that food price shocks positively and significantly affect total government expenditure and the share of current government consumption in the total government expenditure. More precisely, an additional one standard deviation of the food price shock increase is associated to an increase of 0. 06 standard deviation of the percentage of current government consumption in the total government expenditure. Interestingly, this effect highly depends on the vulnerability level. Future studies will use more disaggregated data of fiscal variables, including those on revenue, to better assess food security policies...|$|R
40|$|Background Crisis {{situations}} in dementia {{can lead to}} hospital admission or institutionalisation. Offering immediate interventions may help avoid admission, whilst <b>stabilising</b> <b>measures</b> can help prevent future crises. Objective Our objective was to identify the main causes of crisis and interventions to treat or prevent crisis in persons with dementia based on different stakeholder perspectives. Methods An online questionnaire was developed to identify the causes of crisis and appropriate interventions in a crisis. Participants included people with dementia, family carers and staff working in health and social care, including emergency and voluntary sectors, and academia. Results The results ranked the main causes of crisis, interventions that can prevent a crisis and interventions that {{can be useful in}} a crisis. Wandering, falls and infection were highly rated as risk factors for crises across all stakeholder groups. Consumers rated aggression as less important but severity of memory impairment as much more important than the other groups did. Education and support for family carers and home care staff were highly valued for preventing crises. Well-trained home care staff, communication equipment, emergency contacts and access to respite were highly valued for managing crises. Conclusions We identified triggers and interventions that different stakeholders see as important for crisis in dementia. Recognition of these may be critical to planning effective and accepted support and care for people with dementia...|$|R
40|$|Weathered {{soils are}} used {{extensively}} as fill materials for constructing slopes in tropical regions such as Hong Kong. Safe and successful implementations of many slope <b>stabilising</b> <b>measures</b> often require {{the understanding of}} the fundamental mechanical behaviour of soils that are to be strengthened. Behaviour of loose weathered fill materials especially at unsaturated state is not often investigated and far from fully understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand the mechanical behaviour of loosely compacted unsaturated weathered fill materials through first studying the stress-strain relationship, the effects of suction and stress path, in particular the wetting path, on shear strength and volumetric behaviour; and second interpreting the behaviour by the critical state framework and the elasto-plastic constitutive model. Three series of triaxial tests were conducted on loose decomposed volcanic and granitic soils. The tests included consolidated undrained tests on saturated specimens, constant water content tests and wetting tests at constant deviator stress on unsaturated specimens. The last series of tests was designed to simulate the effect of rainfall infiltration in initially unsaturated slopes. During undrained shearing, the saturated loose decomposed volcanic soil shows a tendency to dilate and possesses ductile stress-strain behaviour. However, the saturated loose decomposed granitic soil shows a tendency to contract and possesses brittle stress-strain behaviour if the initial state lies on the loose side of the critical state. Hence, static liquefaction is very unlikely to occur for saturated volcanic soil but is possible for saturated granitic soil. On the other hand, the observed volumetric behaviour of the unsaturated loose weathered soils is influenced by the imposed stress paths and the stress conditions. For unsaturated specimens sheared at constant water content, both soils exhibit volumetric contraction for the range of net mean stress considered. This seems to imply that static liquefaction is possible if the rate of air escaped from the voids is slower than the rate of volumetric collapse of the soil structure, from which excessive pore-air pressure will be generated. Regarding wetting tests at constant deviator stress, both unsaturated soils behave differently. Decomposed volcanic soil contracts at low net mean stress but decomposed granitic soil contracts at high net mean stress. Since the behaviour of the unsaturated loose decomposed soils is stress and path dependent, only results from relevant stress paths and stress conditions should be adopted for the design of <b>stabilising</b> <b>measures.</b> An elasto-plastic constitutive model for unsaturated soils was proposed in this study. The proposed model is formulated using independent stress state variables and state-dependent dilatancy. Predictions from the model are in good agreement with experimental results, in particular stress-strain and axial-volumetric strain relationships, from undrained tests and constant water content tests on saturated and unsaturated loose decomposed soils, respectively. Regarding wetting tests at constant deviator stress on unsaturated specimens, the predictions underestimate suction and volumetric strain at failure. Despite this, the model is able to capture the stress and path dependent volumetric behaviour of the saturated and unsaturated loose decomposed soils...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis (GFC) of 2008 sent {{the economies of}} major developed nations into freefall. As credit markets froze and investor and consumer confidence collapsed to levels {{not seen since the}} Great Depression, governments clamoured to develop policies and interventions aimed at preventing wholesale economic meltdown. The Australian economy has come through the crisis relatively unscathed. In contrast to most other advanced economies, Australia avoided recession and, despite dire forecasts, has experienced only modest increases in rates of unemployment. Consumer confidence has recovered, investment is returning and the economy has performed consistently above expectations. What accounts for Australia's success in navigating the {{global financial}} crisis? Economists will emphasise the combination of monetary and fiscal policy responses - significant cuts to interest rates, large stimulus packages, bank guarantees and other <b>stabilising</b> <b>measures</b> that were rapidly deployed as the crisis unfolded; the underlying strength of the nation's economy, surplus budgets, comparatively low rates of debt and effective prudential regulation. Each of these was undoubtedly crucial, but as this paper argues, features inherent to the institutions of Australian governance must also be taken into account. This paper examines the structures of advice and support to Australian decision-makers that enabled decisive action to be taken and decisions implemented as the financial crisis loomed. It highlights the significance of the economic policy settings established by successive Australian governments, supported by a cadre of economic advisers - career officials and partisans, whose experience and institutional memory proved valuable to the newly-elected Labor government. The paper argues that Australia's success owes much to timely and effective policy responses deployed quickly as the financial crisis loomed. The government's pre-emptive and aggressive response to the global financial crisis and the design of its fiscal policies was supported and enabled by an advisory system that had prepared for and which consciously drew on the lessons learned during earlier downturns. It concludes that the policy learning of key actors within the advisory and decision-making system was significant in helping to position Australia's economy to withstand the most significant economic shock since the Great Depression.

40|$|Recently, we have {{demonstrated}} that intrinsic hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon, as deposited by the very high frequency glow-discharge technique, {{can be used as}} the active layers of p–i–n solar cells. Our microcrystalline silicon represents a new form of thin film crystalline silicon that can be deposited (in contrast to any other approach found in literature) at substrate temperatures as low as 200 °C. The combination of amorphous and microcrystalline material leads to a ‘real' silicon-based tandem structure, which we label ‘micromorph' cell. Meanwhile, stabilised efficiencies of 10. 7 % have been confirmed. In this paper, we present an improved micromorph tandem cell with 12 % <b>stabilised</b> efficiency <b>measured</b> under outdoor conditions. Dark conductivity and combined SIMS measurements performed on intrinsic microcrystalline silicon layers reveal a post-oxidation of the film surface. However, a perfect chemical stability of entire microcrystalline cells as well as micromorph cells is presented. Variations of the p/i interface treatment show that an increase of the open circuit voltages from 450 mV up to 568 mV are achievable for microcrystalline cells, but such devices have reduced fill factors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Video-based driver {{assistance}} systems {{are a key}} component for intelligent vehicles today. Applications for lane detection, traffic sign recognition, and collision avoidance have been successfully deployed in cars and trucks. State-of-the art algorithms rely on machine learning and therefore depend on invariance conditions, e. g. a fixed image perspective. In order to apply current modules in two-wheeled vehicles one needs to determine the roll angle, i. e. the angle between the road plane and the slanted vehicle. It can either be used for parametrisation of the algorithms or for rotation of the video image back to a horizontal alignment. Using an inertial measurement unit to acquire this data is unreasonably expensive. We propose a video-based module that estimates the current roll angle based on gradient orientation histograms to overcome this flaw. Due to the visual structure of a traffic scene {{we are able to}} derive possible roll angles from the gradient statistics by correlation with learnt data. Analogously, we estimate the roll rate by correlating subsequent image statistics and <b>stabilise</b> both <b>measures</b> within a linear Kalman filter. Experiments on real image data from various test scenarios show high accuracy of the proposed approach. Thus, estimating the roll angle / rate from video only, enables us to employ established video-based assistance modules for two-wheeled vehicles without any additional hardware expense. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Many {{instruments}} for velocity measurement {{are based on}} the physical phenomenon, a Doppler effect. The paper deals with accuracy of laser meters used in the measurement of automobile velocity. The measurement results of such devices as well as of any other electronic or mechanical devices inevitably possess errors. For error analysis we will use a probabilistic method assuming that only random errors are present. To analyse systematic errors algebraic methods are usually used expressing systematic error as a function of some variables. For that purpose special measurements are performed when the measurement results are compared with the known values of the variables or those having been measured by the devices of higher accuracy. The accuracy of measurement by Doppler meters depends mostly on the parameters of two kinds – <b>stabilising</b> and <b>measuring</b> laser emission frequencies and the errors of determining the emission speed in the atmosphere. These are the systematic errors of measurement. Other errors appear as a result of direct and indirect measurement of differential frequency. Since measurement is based on Doppler effect, the main parameter of emission affecting measurement accuracy is the frequency of emission. The influence of the changes in emission speed in the atmosphere due to the instability of atmospheric parameters on measurement accuracy is markedly weaker. A Doppler meter can operate in one system with a pulse-phase range-finder enabling the determination of the distance to a moving object. The measurement accuracy of such system is higher...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Manual and {{physical}} therapists incorporate neurodynamic mobilisation (NDM) to improve function and decrease pain. Little {{is known about}} the mechanisms by which these interventions affect neural tissue. The objective of this research was to assess the effects of repetitive straight leg raise (SLR) NDM on the fluid dynamics within the fourth lumbar nerve root in unembalmed cadavers. Methods: A biomimetic solution (Toluidine Blue Stock 1 % and Plasma) was injected intraneurally, deep to the epineurium, into the L 4 nerve roots of seven unembalmed cadavers. The initial dye spread was allowed to <b>stabilise</b> and <b>measured</b> with a digital calliper. Once the initial longitudinal dye spread stabilised, an intervention strategy (repetitive SLR) was applied incorporating NDMs (stretch/relax cycles) at a rate of 30 repetitions per minute for 5 minutes. Post-intervention calliper measurements of the longitudinal dye spread were measured. Results: The mean experimental posttest longitudinal dye spread measurement (1. 1 ± 0. 9 mm) was significantly greater (P = 0. 02) than the initial stabilised pretest longitudinal dye spread measurement. Increases ranged from 0. 0 to 2. 6 mm and represented an average of 7. 9 % and up to an 18. 1 % increase in longitudinal dye spread. Discussion: Passive NDM in the form of repetitive SLR induced a significant increase in longitudinal fluid dispersion in the L 4 nerve root of human cadaveric specimen. Lower limb NDM may be beneficial in promoting nerve function by limiting or altering intraneural fluid accumulation within the nerve root, thus preventing the adverse effects of intraneural oedema.

40|$|Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) {{measures}} {{are needed to}} control soil erosion and sustain agricultural production on steep slopes of West Usambara mountains. However, the adoption by farmers of the recommended {{soil and water conservation}} measures is low and soil erosion continues to be a problem. It could well be that the reason for the low adoption is that the costs to invest in soil and water conservation are higher than the eventual benefits. This research assessed {{the costs and benefits of}} bench terraces, grass strips and fanya juu, which are major SWC measures. Financial Cost Benefit Analysis (FCBA) was undertaken for farmers with low, moderate and high opportunity costs of labour at different slopes and soil types. The results show that labour is the major cost item in implementing SWC measures and is higher with bench terraces than with fanya juu and grass strips. The results also show that the costs of establishing the three SWC measures exceed the returns in the initial 2 years. However, in the long term, the three SWC {{measures are}} profitable to farmers with low to medium opportunity costs of labour on gentle to moderate slopes. It was also found that SWC measures are not financially attractive to most farmers with off-farm activities and other sources of income. It is concluded that high investment costs and initial negative returns are the major hindrances to the adoption of SWC measures by smallholder farmers in West Usambara mountains. Options to overcome the initial investment costs include the gradual investment in SWC measures, introduction of high value crops and small credit facilities. The promotion of dairy cattle under zero grazing system can also increase the adoption of SWC measures because of the high benefits from grasses used to <b>stabilise</b> SWC <b>measure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{systematically}} review the literature on measurement of muscle strength in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and other pathologies and to suggest guidelines to standardise protocols for future research in the field. Methods The Cochrane and PubMed libraries were searched for any publications using the terms ‘hip’, ‘muscle’, ‘strength’, and ‘measurement’ in the ‘Title, Abstract, Keywords’ field. A further search was performed using the terms ‘femoroacetabular’ or ‘impingement’. The search was limited to recent literature only. Results A total of 29 articles were reviewed to obtain information on a number of variables. These comprised the type of device used for measurement, rater standardisation, the type of movements tested, body positioning and comparative studies of muscle strength in FAI versus normal controls. The studies found that hip muscle strength is lower in patients with FAI; this is also true for the asymptomatic hip in patients with FAI. Conclusions Current literature on this subject is limited and examines multiple variables. Our recommendations for achieving reproducible results include <b>stabilising</b> the patient, <b>measuring</b> isometric movements and maximising standardisation by using a single tester and familiarising the participants with the protocol.

Pulse oximetry testing can be a useful tool in order to detect congenital heart defect. There are several types of monitors on the market. We wanted to find the differences in these monitors regarding technology, qualities, price and oxygen saturation values. SpO 2 below 95 % {{was used as the}} border value for a positive test. Material and methods. 18 children were included in the study. Three different apparatus were tested and compared against each other. The study included Masimo SET Radical tm, Nellcor OxiMax N- 550 og MiniCorr Oximeter BCI 3402. The sensor was placed on the childs lower extremitet. We observed how fast the oximeters <b>stabilised</b> and <b>measured</b> the pulse and oxygen saturation values six times in the space of three minutes. Results. The oximeters stabilised after 13 too 21 seconds. MiniCorr was the fastest. Masimo showed significant higher SpO 2 -value than the other two and the lowest number of false positive. Masimo showed a greater variation in the values measured than the other two. Interpretation. Pulse oximeter measurement is simple and fast. In order {{to reduce the number of}} false positive testes the child must stay calm and while the saturation is low, the registration has to continue for at least two to four minutes after the oximeter count the correct pulse. Abstract 2 : Can pulse oximeter screening in the newborn period decrease the age at diagnosis for children with transposition of the great arteries or total anomalous venous connection? Background. An early diagnosis of some congenital heart defects is of vital importance for the further prognosis. Our study has looked at the time of diagnose for two cyanotic heart defects, transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and total anomalous pulmonary venous connections (TAPVC). The purpose of the study was to see if an early screening with pulse oximeter could reveal the mentioned diagnosis at an earlier stage. Material and method. Retrospectively we studied the journals of all children who had been diagnosed with TGA and TAPVC between 1993 and 2004 at Ullevål University Hospital. Our main focuses were the age, ethnicity signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Results. A total number of 68 children were included in the study. 58 % of the children did not have the diagnosis within their first two days, when they normally would have been sent home from the hospital. Children of non ethnic Norwegian parents were given a diagnosis later than others, median values were 7 and 2 days respectively. TAPVC was diagnosed later than TGA, median values were 9 and 1 ½ days respectively. Interpretation. Screening with pulse oximeter on newborns could potentially reveal cyanotic heart defects in children earlier and thus give them a better prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Surfactants, {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of detergent formulations, {{have the ability to}} adsorb at air/water interfaces due to their amphiphilic nature. Surfactants can, therefore, be used as excellent foam stabilising agents in several systems, eliminating or preventing major destabilisation phenomena including drainage, coalescence and disproportionation. In this project the addition of a small concentration of surface active or non- surface active components to the surfactant-stabilised system; has been studied in relation to their ability of improving the foam stability of the system. Several additives have been examined as. to their ability to act as effective foam stabilizers. These included surface active proteins, polymers and surface and non-surface active particles. Probably the most effective foam stabilising material was a particle material formed after the complexation of Ethylcellulose with Cellulose. This complex, along with other additives that showed a modest improvement on the foam stability of the surfactant stabilised system, has been tested on their ability of resisting to bubble coalescence, disproportionation and drainage phenomena. Most of the tests have been completed using equipment specially designed at the workshop of the School of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Leeds. The surface activity of the surfactant system on its own and {{in the presence of the}} <b>stabilising</b> additives was <b>measured</b> in relation to the surface tension and the surface viscoelasticity properties of the systems in order to determine the mechanism of action of these stabilising additives. It has been shown that the possible mechanism of action is one that the particles are adsorbing at the interface acting synergistically with the surfactant and effectively enhance the foam stability of the system. Another possible way of stabilising could be that the particles are collected in the plateau borders and this slows down the liquid drainage and therefore the thinning and rupture of the lamellae. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy~ (CLSM) was used to exarrune the structure of the EC-C complex and explore how it is adsorbed at the interface in order to stabilise the bubbles on its own and at the presence of the anionic surfactant. As it has been concluded the particles are probably adsorbed at the bubble interface and even though the surfactant predominates at the interface the appearance of a certain concentration of particles can be seen through the confocal images, indicating that the complex is strongly adsorbed at the interface.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the principle selenate carrier phases for two selected soils, by comparing their reactivity with selenate to that of pure phases of the solids. Silica, calcium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide, goethite, bentonite and humic acid were selected as the main soil carrier phases. Comparisons were made first on the parameter values obtained with the best fit of a kinetic sorption model which can discriminate instantaneous sorption from kinetically limited sorption. Then comparisons were made of the ability for each solid to <b>stabilise</b> selenate by <b>measuring</b> the ratio of the partition coefficient for sorption (Kdsorption) over that of the desorption (Kddesorption). Kinetics and stabilisation were used to help elucidate the nature of interactions with the test solid phases for a large range of selenate concentrations. The experiments were conducted over 165 h in batch reactors, the solid being isolated from the solution by dialysis tubing, at two pH (5. 4 and 8) and three selenate concentrations (1 ?? 10 - 3, 1 ?? 10 - 6 and 1 ?? 10 - 8 mol L- 1). The results obtained showed that only aluminium hydroxide can sorb selenate throughout the studied pH range (pH 5. 4 to 8. 0). The sorption capacity on this mineral was high (Kdsorption 100 to 1 ?? 104 L kg- 1) and the selenate was mainly stabilized by the formation of inner sphere complexes. The sorption on goethite occurred at pH 5. 4 (Kdsorption 52 L kg- 1), mainly as outer sphere complexes, and was null at pH 8. On silica, a weak sorption was observed only at pH 5. 4 and at 165 h (Kdsorption 4 L kg- 1). On bentonite, calcium carbonate and humic acid no significant sorption was observed. Concerning the two soils studied, different behaviours were observed for selenate. For soil Ro (pH 5. 4), Kdsorption was low (8 L kg- 1) compared to soil Bu (pH 8) (70 L kg- 1). The sorption behaviour of selenate on soil Ro was mainly due to outer sphere complexes, as for goethite, whereas for soil Bu the sorption was mainly attributed to inner sphere complexes followed by reduction mechanisms, probably initiated by microorganisms, in which no steady state was reached {{at the end of the}} 165 h experiments. The sorption of selenate decreased when concentrations reached 1 ?? 10 - 3 mol L- 1, due to solid saturation, except for aluminium hydroxide. Reduction of selenate seemed also to occur on goethite and soil Ro, for the same concentration, but without preventing a decrease in sorption. Thus, this work shows that the comparison of selenate behaviour between soil and pure phases helps to elucidate the main carrier phases and sorption mechanisms in soil. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the experimental work undertaken {{to investigate the}} possibility of using oil lake residue to stabilise Sabkha soils in Kuwait. Sabkha is a problematic salt-encrusted soil deposited under arid conditions which cannot be used for construction in its natural condition. The oil lake residue being considered is the waste hydrocarbons resulting from the destruction of oil wells in Kuwait during the Gulf War, 1990. The oil lake residue covers an overall area of 24 km 2, and represents an environmental hazard that needs to be eliminated. The experimental programme included laboratory and field testing of physical properties and strength, consolidation and leaching aspects of the natural and oil mixed Sabkha soils. A soil survey of a large area was undertaken to select representative soil samples. Sabkha soils from four main locations were selected for the detailed experimental testing. Oil residue was added to the Sabkha soils at different percentages ranging from 0 % to 10 %. The focus of the experimental work was towards physical and mechanical behaviours due to low clay (less than 0. 5 %) and organic (less than 2 %) contents of the soil and high content of non-polar compounds (85 %) in the oil residue. Results showed that the addition of oil residue reduced the friction between the soil particles in the range of 5 % to 28 % and the facilitated sliding over each other resulted in an increase in the density of the compacted Sabkha soils of between 2 % to 8. 5 %. The UCS increased in the range of 34 % to 504 % of the natural values. The shear strength slightly increased with oil addition since the internal friction decreased and the cohesion intercept values increased in the range of 45 % to 150 %. The adsorbed oil residue on the cemented soil lumps acted as a waterproofing agent that reduced both salt dissolution by 56 % of the natural soil and the long term coefficient of permeability in the range of 73 % to 88 %. Under soaked conditions, the improvement in strength properties were pronounced. The natural Sabkha soil disintegrated upon soaking while oil mixed Sabkha maintained its integrity. Yield stress increased in the range of 25 % to 60 % from the values of natural soils and compression index and collapsibility decreased in the stabilised Sabkha. Field testing on 5 % stabilised compacted test beds revealed an additional increase in CBR and UCS above that of the laboratory results. Density and shear strength of field samples showed similar results as those obtained by laboratory testing. Leachability of oil from the 5 % oil <b>stabilised</b> Sabkha soil <b>measured</b> in the laboratory under a hydraulic gradient of 40 was less than 1 mg/ 1, which can be considered very low. Leachability of oil residue in the field was undetectable. The main conclusion of the work is that the addition of 5 % oil residue improved the performance of Sabkha soils especially under soaked conditions, which may result in its applications in the construction industry. These results are encouraging. However the acceptance of oil residue as a stabilising material necessitates further research and this future programme is briefly mentioned...|$|R
