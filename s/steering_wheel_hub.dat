2500|$|The 1968 models {{featured}} additional safety features, including {{side marker}} lights and shoulder belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model's large <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> {{was replaced by a}} soft [...] "bar" [...] spoke that ran though the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic horn ring was also featured.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, Ebony leather {{with red}} {{stitching}} accents dominate, while the seats, {{steering wheel and}} armrests feature microfiber suede accents. The headrests have an embossed Centennial Edition logo and the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> carries the same [...] "Louis Chevrolet 100" [...] graphic found on the car's B-pillar and wheel center caps. Arguably the most subtle variation to be found {{is seen in the}} signature crossed-flags exterior badge, which sees the traditional fleur-de-lis element replaced with [...] "100" [...] in all Centennial Edition cars.|$|E
2500|$|The Teletouch {{pushbutton}} {{automatic transmission}} selector {{was an extremely}} complex feature. [...] It proved problematic {{in part because the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> where the pushbuttons were located, was the traditional location of the horn button. [...] Some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn. [...] While the Edsel was fast, the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing. There were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons: D for Drag, L for Leap, and R for Race (instead of Drive, Low and Reverse). [...] The control wires for Teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold, which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and, in some cases, complete failure. The electrical design required drivers to shift from Park to Reverse to Neutral to Drive, in that order, to avoid overloading the Teletouch motor. The motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of Park while on a hill, so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the Park button.|$|E
50|$|Volkswagen's {{association}} with 'Wolf' is referenced {{on many of}} its vehicles. Up until the 1980s, the 'Wolfsburg Crest', in various guises, was displayed on VW products, the most famous being the Type 1. Until 1964, the Wolfsburg crest badge {{was placed on the}} bonnet. The crest also appeared on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> on many models. The Lupo (Italian for Wolf) was named in honour of Wolfsburg, the home of Volkswagen.|$|R
5000|$|Fratzog: Dodge's logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a {{fractured}} deltoid composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo {{first appeared on}} the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers {{came up with the}} meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck. As the Dodge Division's logo, Fratzog was incorporated in various badges and emblems on Dodge vehicles. It was also integrated into the design of such parts as <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> center <b>hubs</b> and road <b>wheel</b> covers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A most {{important}} issue in vehicle industry is the existence of differences in the physical properties and manufacturing methodologies. Deterministic approaches are incapable {{to take into account}} these variabilities without leading to oversized structures. The necessity of assessing the robustness of a particular design requires a methodology based on strength and design optimization through probabilistic models of design variables (DOE). In general it is identified the steering knuckle {{which is one of the}} critical components of vehicle which links suspension, <b>steering</b> system, <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> and brake to the chassis.

40|$|This Steering Knuckle {{is one of}} the {{critical}} components of vehicle which links suspension, <b>steering</b> system, <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> and brake to the chassis. It undergoes varying loads subjected to different conditions, while not affecting vehicle steering performance and other desired vehicle characteristics. This paper focuses on optimization of steering knuckle targeting reducing weight as objective function, while not compromising with required strength, frequency and stiffness. A vehicle steering knuckle undergoes time-varying loadings during its service life. Fatigue behavior is, therefore, a key consideration in its design and performance evaluation. This research program aimed to optimized best use of material for the steering knuckle and compare analysis of steering knuckles made from two materials i. e. cast iron which is recently using and aluminium alloy which is suggested material...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{weight of}} the vehicle is going on {{increasing}} due to additional luxurious and safety features. The increasing {{weight of the}} vehicle affects the fuel efficiency and overall performance of the vehicle. Therefore the weight reduction of the vehicle is the real need of today’s automotive industry. Steering knuckle is one of critical component of vehicle. It links suspension, <b>steering</b> system, <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> and brake to the chassis. There is scope to reduce the un sprung weight vehicle. Steering Knuckle is a non-standard part and subjected to various loads at different conditions. Weight reduction of steering knuckle is {{the objective of this}} exercise for optimization. Typically, the finite element software like OptiStruct (Hyper Works) is utilized to achieve this purpose. For optimization, Nastran / Ansys / Abaqus could also be utilized. The targeted weight or mass reduction for this exercise is about 5 % without compromising on the structural strength. Keywords- un sprung weight, Steering Knuckle, I...|$|R
40|$|A vehicle {{dynamics}} {{human machine interface}} (HMI) concept for the operation of a highly maneuverable vehicle is presented. This is motivated by the research vehicle ROMO, which is being developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to facilitate research on {{a wide spectrum of}} scientific questions dealing with electric and autonomous mobility. With four wheel individual large range <b>steering</b> and electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> motors, the {{vehicle dynamics}} variables of yaw rate, side slip angle and vehicle velocity can be decoupled, thus opening new motion possibilities. The HMI approach includes distinction of various motion operating modes, suitable reference motion parameterization and adequate filtering of the operator’s inputs, both depending on the operating mode. For rotating on the spot the instantaneous center of rotation may be interactively set by the operator on a touch screen...|$|R

50|$|The first button {{added to}} the {{steering}} wheel was a switch to activate the car's electric horn. Traditionally located on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow steering wheel, integrated the horn switch into the steering wheel rim.|$|E

2500|$|The ACR Neon, {{available}} with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio <b>steering,</b> heavy-duty <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter [...]81 fifth gear and {{final drive ratio}} of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to [...] on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights {{and a lack of}} side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name [...] "ACR" [...] was initially the internal ordering code for the [...] "Competition Package", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The backronym [...] "American Club Racer" [...] was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} field study investigating {{the impact of}} single <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> motor failures on the dynamic behavior of a vehicle and the corresponding driver reaction is presented in this work. The experiment is performed at urban speeds on a closed off test track. The single <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> motor failure is emulated with an auxiliary brake system in a modified electric vehicle. Driver reaction times are derived from the measured data and discussed in their experimental context. The failure is rated and evaluated objectively based on the dynamic behavior of the vehicle. Findings indicate that driver reactions are more apparent for the accelerator pedal compared to the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> response. The controllability evaluation of the vehicle behavior shows that no critical traffic situation occurs for the tested failure conditions. However, even small deviations of the vehicle can impair traffic safety, specifically for other traffic participants like bicyclist and pedestrians. QC 20150520 </p...|$|R
