Reports emerged in September 2008 that Poundland's owners, Advent International, were to put the retail chain up for sale, with figures showing that value retailers were seeing business boom during the economic recession, whilst noting that value-conscious customers were switching from traditional larger supermarket retailers for everyday necessities. The retailer had a good start into 2010 when they announced they had seen a surge in sales by nearly 35% over the 2009–2010 festive period.|$|E

40|$|This thesis proposes {{equilibrium}} {{models to}} link the wholesale and retail electricity markets which allow for reconciliation of the differing time scales of responses of producers (e. g., hourly) and consumers (e. g., monthly) to changing prices. Electricity market equilibrium models with time of use (TOU) pricing scheme are formulated as large-scale variational inequality (VI) problems, a unified and concise approach for modeling the equilibrium. The demand response is dynamic in these models through a dependence on the lagged demand. Different market structures are examined within this context. With an illustrative example, the welfare gains/losses are analyzed after an implementation of TOU pricing scheme over the <b>single</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme. An approximation of the welfare change for this analysis is also presented. Moreover, break-up of a large supplier into smaller parts is investigated. For the illustrative examples presented in the dissertation, overall welfare gains for consumers and lower prices closer to the levels of perfect competition can be realized when the retail pricing scheme is changed from <b>single</b> <b>pricing</b> to TOU pricing. These models can be useful policy tools for regulatory bodies i) to forecast future retail <b>prices</b> (TOU or <b>single</b> <b>prices),</b> ii) to examine the market power exerted by suppliers and iii) to measure welfare gains/losses with different retail pricing schemes (e. g., <b>single</b> versus TOU <b>pricing).</b> With the inclusion of linearized DC network constraints into these models, the problem size grows considerably. Dantzig-Wolfe (DW) decomposition algorithm for VI problems is used to alleviate the computational burden and it also facilitates model management and maintenance. Modification of the DW decomposition algorithm and approximation of the DW master problem significantly improve the computational effort required to find the equilibrium. These algorithms are applied to a two-region energy model for Canada and a realistic Ontario electricity test system. In addition to empirical analysis, theoretical results for the convergence properties of the master problem approximation are presented for DW decomposition of VI problems...|$|R

40|$|Crowdsourced {{wireless}} community networks {{can effectively}} alleviate the limited coverage issue of Wi-Fi access points (APs), by encouraging individuals (users) {{to share their}} private residential Wi-Fi APs with others. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive economic analysis for such a crowdsourced network, with the particular focus on the users' behavior analysis and the community network operator's pricing design. Specifically, we formulate the interactions between the network operator and users as a two-layer Stackelberg model, where the operator determining the pricing scheme in Layer I, and then users determining their Wi-Fi sharing schemes in Layer II. First, we analyze the user behavior in Layer II via a two-stage membership selection and network access game, for both small-scale networks and large-scale networks. Then, we design a partial price differentiation scheme for the operator in Layer I, which generalizes both the complete price differentiation scheme and the <b>single</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme (i. e., no price differentiation). We show that the proposed partial pricing scheme can achieve a good tradeoff between the revenue and the implementation complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that when using the partial pricing scheme with only two prices, we can increase the operator's revenue up to 124. 44 % comparing with the <b>single</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme, and can achieve an average of 80 % of the maximum operator revenue under the complete price differentiation scheme.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{there are}} two market models for {{valuation}} and risk management of interest rate derivatives, the LIBOR and swap market models. In this paper, we introduce arbitrage-free constant maturity swap (CMS) market models and generic market models featuring forward rates that span periods other than the classical LIBOR and swap periods. We develop generic expressions for the drift terms occurring in the stochastic differential equation driving the forward rates under a <b>single</b> <b>pricing</b> measure. The generic market model is particularly apt for pricing of Bermudan CMS swaptions, fixed-maturity Bermudan swaptions, and callable hybrid coupon swaps. Key words: market model, generic market models, generic drift terms, hybrid products, BGM mode...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to testing for the hypothesis of a <b>single</b> <b>priced</b> risk factor driving the term structure of interest rates. The method does not rely on any parametric specification of the state variable dynamics or the market price of risk. It simply exploits the constraint imposed by the no-arbitrage condition on instantaneous expected bond returns. In order to achieve our goal, we develop a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and apply it to data on Treasury bills and bonds for both the United States and Spain. We find that the single risk factor hypothesis cannot be rejected for either dataset. Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
