40|$|A {{modification}} of the starch-gel electrophoresis technic of Smithies is presented, which enables quantitation of the resolved fractions {{to be carried out}} with little equipment other than that used for paper electrophoretic fractionation of proteins. ‘A sheet of plastic (<b>Stabilene</b> film) wrapped around a kymograph type drum is evenly coated with starch-gel. The sheet is suspended in an “open strip ” Durrum type cell and electrophoresis carried out. After staining with suitable stain to demonstrate proteins, lipids, or other components, the patterns are scanned in a photoelectric densitometer. Results obtained with this procedure show good reproducibility when fractionating solutions of hemoglobin and serum proteins. STARCH-GEL electrophoresis (1) {{is one of the most}} useful methods for fractionating proteins. The quantitation of the fractions resolved has been difficult, and some technics used have been time-consuming. By use of specially designed and expeimsive equipment these difficulties have been partially resolved. The {{modification of}} the starch-gel method to be described requires, in addition to equipment routinely used for paper electrophoresis, only a relatively inexpensive drum and pan for use in coating the sheet of film with starch-gel. Since the preliminary description of the method (2), modifications have been introduced which permit applicatiomm of the technic to the study of lipoproteins arid enzyme componeimts...|$|E
