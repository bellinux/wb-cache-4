50|$|Fluxes for <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> are {{typically}} of organic nature, though inorganic fluxes, usually based on halogenides and/or acids, {{are also used}} in non-electronics applications. Fluxes for brazing operate at significantly higher temperatures and are therefore mostly inorganic; the organic compounds tend to be of supplementary nature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>soldering</b> is {{characterized}} by having a melting point of the filler metal below approximately , whereas silver soldering and brazing use higher temperatures, typically requiring a flame or carbon arc torch to achieve the melting of the filler. Soft solder filler metals are typically alloys (often containing lead) that have liquidus temperatures below 350 °C.|$|E

50|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of CuproBraze is generally better than <b>soft</b> <b>soldered</b> heat exchangers. This {{is because the}} materials in CuproBraze heat exchangers are of equal nobility, so galvanic differences are minimized. On <b>soft</b> <b>soldered</b> heat exchangers, the solder is less noble than fin and tube materials and can suffer from galvanic attack in corrosive environments.|$|R

50|$|The {{distinction}} between soldering and brazing {{is based on}} the melting temperature of the filler alloy. A temperature of 450 °C is usually used as a practical demarcation between soldering and brazing. <b>Soft</b> <b>soldering</b> can be done with a heated iron whereas the other methods typically require a higher temperature torch or a furnace to melt the filler metal.|$|E
5000|$|... "Soft zinc" [...] is a newer, {{proprietary}} flashing material. It is {{a relatively}} malleable material, making it useful for complex roofing connections. It provides normal <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> capabilities and delivers easy folding. Soft zinc {{is said to be}} an [...] "environmentally friendly" [...] replacement for lead flashing; like lead, it is recyclable, while avoiding lead-contaminated runoff.|$|E
50|$|Each type of solder offers {{advantages}} and disadvantages. Soft solder is so called {{because of the}} soft lead that is its primary ingredient. <b>Soft</b> <b>soldering</b> uses the lowest temperatures (and so thermally stresses components the least) but {{does not make a}} strong joint and is unsuitable for mechanical load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature applications as it loses strength, and eventually melts. Silver soldering, as used by jewelers, machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than <b>soft</b> <b>soldering.</b> Brazing provides the strongest of the non-welded joints but also requires the hottest temperatures to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron furniture, etc.|$|E
50|$|Different {{equipment}} is usually required since {{a soldering iron}} cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based <b>soft</b> <b>solder.</b> Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).|$|R
50|$|One of {{the issues}} with the CSP type of package (which was {{intended}} to be soldered directly to an FR4 or flex circuit) was that for high-density interconnects, the <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> bump provided less of a stand-off as the solder bump diameter and pitch were decreased. Different solutions were employed including one developed by Focus Interconnect Technology (former APTOS engineers), which used a high aspect ratio plated copper post to provide a larger fixed standoff than was possible for a <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> collapse joint.|$|R
50|$|CuproBraze can {{be easily}} repaired. This {{advantage}} of the technology is especially important in remote areas where spare parts may be limited. CuproBraze can be repaired with lead-free <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> (for example 97% tin, 3% copper) or with common silver-containing brazing alloys.|$|R
5000|$|Soldering and brazing {{processes}} rely on {{a filler}} metal added to the joint to form the junction between the base metal parts. <b>Soft</b> <b>soldering</b> uses a filler that melts at a lower temperature than the workpiece, often a lead-tin solder alloy. Brazing and hard soldering use a higher temperature filler that melts at a temperature which may approach that of the base metal, and which may form a eutectic alloy with the base metal.|$|E
50|$|Brazing (sometimes {{known as}} silver {{soldering}} or hard soldering) requires {{a much higher}} temperature than <b>soft</b> <b>soldering,</b> sometimes over 850 °C. As well as removing existing oxides, rapid oxidation of the metal at the elevated temperatures has to be avoided. This means that fluxes {{need to be more}} aggressive and to provide a physical barrier. Traditionally borax was used as a flux for brazing, but there are now many different fluxes available, often using active chemicals such as fluorides as well as wetting agents. Many of these chemicals are toxic and due care should be taken during their use.|$|E
50|$|For many years, {{the most}} common type of flux used in {{electronics}} (<b>soft</b> <b>soldering)</b> was rosin-based, using the rosin from selected pine trees. It was nearly ideal in that it was non-corrosive and non-conductive at normal temperatures but became mildly reactive (corrosive) at elevated soldering temperatures. Plumbing and automotive applications, among others, typically use an acid-based (hydrochloric acid) flux which provides rather aggressive cleaning of the joint. These fluxes cannot be used in electronics because their residues are conductive leading to unintended electrical connections, and because they will eventually dissolve small diameter wires. Many fluxes also act as a wetting agent in the soldering process, reducing the surface tension of the molten solder and causing it to flow and wet the workpieces more easily.|$|E
40|$|For an {{electrically}} conductive joining of surface assembled components on substrates besides <b>soft</b> <b>solders</b> metal filled adhesives {{are used to}} an increasing extent. These adhesives mainly are based on epoxide resins and are filled with silver flakes of approx. 70 - 80 wt. %. The dimensions of the silver flakes are in the mym-range. Thereby a specific electrical resistance of approx. 10 high - 4 Ohm cm can be achieved which is tenfold that of <b>soft</b> <b>solders</b> but acceptable f or technical application. In no case the 36 -hours PC-test led to an adhesional failure of the adhesive joints. However the test occasionally caused a functional failure of the components because of excessive total resistance {{which could not be}} explained by the resistance of the chips...|$|R
50|$|Today, {{flip chip}} {{is a well}} {{established}} technology and collapsed <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> connections {{are used in the}} vast majority of assemblies. Interestingly, the copper post stand-off developed for the CSP market has found a home in high-density interconnects for advanced micro-processors and is used today by IBM for its CPU packaging.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>solder</b> {{typically}} has {{a melting}} point range of , and {{is commonly used}} in electronics, plumbing, and sheet metal work. Manual soldering uses a soldering iron or soldering gun. Alloys that melt between [...] are the most commonly used. Soldering performed using alloys with a melting point above [...] is called [...] "hard soldering", [...] "silver soldering", or brazing.|$|R
5000|$|Nipples {{are also}} {{available}} separately from the cable, for purposes of repair or custom cable construction. They are fitted to the cable by soldering. Where free rotation of nipples, relative to the cable axis is required, the cable end may be finished with a brass ferrule or [...] "trumpet" [...] soldered to the cable. The barrel nipple will be a sliding fit over the brass ferrule, and can thus rotate, to ensure alignment of the nipples {{at each end of}} the cable, and avoidance of twisting of the inner cable. Applying heat to the inner cable for soldering may weaken the steel, and although <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> is less strong than silver solder, a lower temperature is required to form the joint, and there is less likelihood of the inner cable being damaged as a result. Silver soldering may require additional heat treatment of the wire to preserve the temper of it in order to prevent it from becoming too soft or too brittle ...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} interconnection of Nb 3 Sn/Cu strands is a {{key issue}} {{for the construction of}} Nb 3 Sn based damping ring wigglers and insertion devices for third generation light sources. We compare the electrical resistance of Nb 3 Sn/Cu splices manufactured by solid state welding using Electromagnetic Pulse Technology (EMPT) with that of splices produced by <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> with two different solders. The resistance of splices produced by <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> depends strongly on the resistivity of the solder alloy at the operating temperature. By solid state welding splice resistances below 10 nOhm can be achieved with 1 cm strand overlap length only, which is about 4 times lower than the resistance of Sn 96 Ag 4 soldered splices with the same overlap length. The comparison of experimental results with Finite Element simulations shows that the electrical resistance of EMPT welded splices is determined by the resistance of the stabilizing copper between the superconducting filaments and confirms that welding of the strand matrix is indeed achieved. EMPT allows interconnecting the ductile, unreacted strands, which reduces the risk of damaging the brittle reacted Nb 3 Sn strands...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the use of}} lead free solders in most electronic applications, replacement of high-lead materials has not yet been possible for die attach in power electronics. Accordingly, there is still some need for creep data input in related simulations. Several creep models of high-lead <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> die attach materials were published, which were extracted from macro-scale material samples. However, as it is generally known for <b>soft</b> <b>solders,</b> their creep behavior depends strongly on microstructure and a creep description close to the application is to be preferred. In order to assess the validity of the creep models at micro-scale in a use-scenario, this work uses two recently developed experimental setups with sub-μm warpage measurement capability. The warpage of three-layered samples is measured over temperature and simulated using four different published creep models. The solder models are able to reproduce the measured change in warpage direction with certain accuracy, but also show deviations from the measured behavior of the test samples which requires further investigation...|$|R
