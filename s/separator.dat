40|$|Aim: To examine {{three types}} of {{orthodontic}} <b>separators,</b> focusing on the separating effect and patient′s perception of pain and discomfort. Materials and methods: The <b>separators</b> tested were spring-type, elastomeric and brass wire <b>separators.</b> Fifty subjects, who were scheduled for treatment with a fixed orthodontic appliance, {{were divided into two}} groups. In Group I subjects, spring-type and elastomeric <b>separators</b> and in Group II subjects, elastomeric and brass wire <b>separators</b> were placed alternately in the left or the right quadrant of the maxillary arch. After a period of 7 days, the amount of separation was measured with a leaf gauge. Six questionnaires with visual analog scale and questions with fixed answers were used to register the patient perceptions. Results: The mean separation was 0. 32 mm for the spring-type, 0. 41 mm for the elastomeric <b>separators</b> and 0. 40 mm for brass wire <b>separators.</b> The Kesling springs were considered less painful than the elastomerics and brass wire <b>separators.</b> Both elastomeric and brass wire <b>separators</b> produced more separation as compared to Kesling springs. Conclusion: Separation achieved by Kesling <b>separators</b> was less than that achieved by elastomeric and brass wire <b>separators</b> but discomfort with Kesling <b>separators</b> was considerably less than that with elastomeric and brass wire <b>separators...</b>|$|R

5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed <b>separator,</b> but after cooler fires the seed <b>separator</b> often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed <b>separator</b> are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Elastic <b>separators</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{orthodontic}} clinic, in different sizes and thicknesses. Their function is to promote the separation between the teeth that will receive orthodontic bands, however, when subgingivally lost, they may cause periodontal problems and, ultimately, cause tooth extraction. OBJECTIVE: Concerned not only about their function but also about their properties, this experimental work was performed in order to evaluate, with a clinical perspective, the plasticity and radiopacity of the elastic <b>separators,</b> usually used in orthodontic clinic, through physical traction tests and radiographs. METHODS: Six different brands were analyzed and divided in two groups: extruded <b>separators</b> (American Orthodontics, GH, Morelli Blue and Morelli Green) and modular <b>separators</b> (Abzil, Dentaurum, GAC, Blue Modular Morelli and Green Modular Morelli). The plasticity was evaluated after physical traction tests, stretching the <b>separators</b> to 3 times their initial diameter. While the radiopacity was assessed using x-rays. RESULTS: When stretched to three times their inner diameter (ID), the extruded <b>separators</b> American Orthodontics, GH, Morelli Blue and Morelli Green and the modular ones Dentaurum, Morelli Blue Modular and Morelli Green Modular, presented elastic deformation, recovering their original inner diameter. The modular <b>separators</b> from Abzil and GAC showed permanent plastic deformation. With respect to radiopacity, the Abzil, American Orthodontics, Dentaurum, GAC and GH <b>separators</b> were radiopaque. CONCLUSION: Correlating the results concerning the plasticity and radiopacity, the <b>separators</b> which showed the most satisfactory results on both tests were, among the extruded <b>separators,</b> American Orthodontics and GH, and among the modular <b>separators,</b> GAC and Dentaurum...|$|R

50|$|<b>Separators</b> {{between the}} {{positive}} and negative plates prevent short-circuit through physical contact, mostly through dendrites ("treeing"), but also through shedding of the active material. <b>Separators</b> obstruct the flow of ions between the plates and increase the internal resistance of the cell. Wood, rubber, glass fiber mat, cellulose, and PVC or polyethylene plastic have been used to make <b>separators.</b> Wood was the original choice, but deteriorated in the acid electrolyte. Rubber <b>separators</b> are stable in battery acid and provide valuable electrochemical advantages that other materials cannot.|$|R
5|$|Seed {{release in}} B.prionotes is {{promoted}} by repeated wetting of the cones. The seed <b>separator</b> {{that holds the}} seeds in place is hygroscopic; its two wings pull together then wet, then spread and curl inwards as it dries out again. In doing so, it functions as a lever, gradually prying seeds out of a follicle {{over the course of}} a wet-dry cycle. This adaptation ensures that seed release following fire is delayed until the onset of rain, when germination and seedling survival rates are higher.|$|E

In his early years as a faculty member, Ijaz devoted much of his time to his teaching responsibilities, including acting as adviser to the university's roster of graduate students and doctoral candidates. He conducted his early research at the Physics department's newly installed nuclear reactor, which at the time was equipped with a neutron activation analysis laboratory. Ijaz's early experimental results earned him an appointment as research collaborator at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in 1966 under a University Isotope <b>Separator</b> at Oak Ridge (UNISOR) grant funded by the U.S. Energy Department.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic <b>separator.</b> They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E

5|$|Brown's 1810 {{monograph}} did {{not include}} an infrageneric classification of Dryandra, and neither did his Prodromus, published later that year. In 1830, however, he introduced the first taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra, placing D.floribunda in section Dryandra verae along with most other species, because its follicles contain a single seed <b>separator.</b> Dryandra verae was renamed Eudryandra by Carl Meissner in 1845. Eleven years later Meissner published a new arrangement, retaining D.floribunda in D.sect. Eudryandra, and further placing it in the unranked subgroup § Ilicinae, because of the similarity of its leaves to those of Ilex (holly). In 1870, George Bentham published a revised arrangement in his Flora Australiensis. Bentham retained section Eudryandra, but abandoned almost all of Meissner's unranked groups, including § Ilicinae. D.floribunda was instead placed in D.ser. Floribundae along with four other species with small, mostly terminal flowers, left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency {{may be one reason}} why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed <b>separator.</b> If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous <b>separator,</b> and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
