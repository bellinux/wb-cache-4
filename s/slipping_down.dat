The ditch was inaugurated as a public garden in March 2013. All ERDF-financed work was completed in late 2013, but the Restoration Directorate later restored other parts of the fortifications, including the northern walls, St. Peter Bastion and the area around Greeks Gate. The project was fully completed in early 2016.|$|E
25|$|With {{nearly all}} her {{remaining}} ranking points to defend concentrated {{in a little}} over {{the first four months}} of the year, Li Na began the year faced with the challenge of equaling her strong results from the early part of 2005 in order to maintain her position in the middle reaches of the WTA top 100. Early-round draws against high-ranked players towards the beginning of 2006 took a heavy toll on Li's singles ranking, bringing it <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> to no. 71 by the end of February.|$|E
25|$|No. 50 Whitechapel was {{purchased}} by Municipal Borough of Sutton and Cheam in 1963 (after the originally intended purchase, No.61 Sutton, had been cut up). The intention was to display the engine outside the new Civic Centre, and the engine was offered a home on the K until the work was completed. The engine was restored and used to haul the opening train on the preserved K in 1974. After <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> the overhaul queue at Rolvenden, the engine {{was moved to the}} Spa Valley Railway by the owners (the engine still being owned by Sutton Borough Council) and restoration work commenced.|$|E

25|$|The team's form {{began to}} slip, however, with a disappointing 1–1 home draw against Stoke City, and a 2–2 home draw against West Ham, {{resulting}} in Chelsea <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> to tenth. Chelsea registered a 1–4 away win at AFC Bournemouth, with Eden Hazard finally {{getting on the}} score sheet, and after going down 0–2 against rivals Tottenham, fought back to draw 2–2, Hazard again scoring to seal away any chances of title contenders Tottenham winning the Premier League. Chelsea drew 1–1 away to Liverpool and played out a 1-1 home draw against Leicester City, with Claudio Ranieri, former Chelsea boss, being received a guard of honour. Former Juventus and then-current Italy national team head coach Antonio Conte was confirmed as new Chelsea manager in March 2016. He took charge for the 2016–17 season following Italy's participation at UEFA Euro 2016.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of {{mattocks}} are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and parallel with it to secure the head from <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done. When made to be dismantled, the shaft of a mattock fits into the oval eye of the head, and is fixed by striking the head end of the shaft against a solid surface, such as a tree stump, rock, or firm ground. The head end of the shaft is tapered outwards, and the oval opening of the iron head is similarly tapered so that the head will not fly off when used. The mattock head ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, {{so that it will}} not slide down and hit the user's hands. The mattock is meant for swinging between the user's legs, as in digging a ditch with one foot on either side. Tapping the handle end of the shaft while holding the head allows the handle to slide down and be removed.|$|E
25|$|Heavy rains fell in December 1999 {{along the}} north-central coast of Venezuela, {{culminating}} {{in a period of}} extreme intensity from 14 to 16 December. Starting around 8 PM local time (AST) on 15 December, runoff entered channels and rushed towards the sea, picking up and depositing sediments on its way. Generally after this first wave of flooding, from the coast to just past the crest of the Sierra de Avila, these rains triggered thousands of shallow landslides that stripped soil and rock off of the landscape and sent them <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> the mountainside. Additional water liquefied these landslides into debris flows, which are granular flows in which water mixes with high concentrations of rock and mud. The first eyewitness accounts of debris flows were from 8:30 PM on the 15th, and the final debris flows were reported between 8 and 9 AM on 16 December. Many catchments released multiple debris flows, some of which carried large boulders and tree trunks onto the alluvial fan deltas. Starting between 7 and 9 AM on the 16th and continuing until late that afternoon, a new wave of floods occurred. These floodwaters were less concentrated in sediment and were therefore able to entrain new material and incise new channels into the flood and debris flow deposits from the previous days.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} {{featured}} in several high-profile industry polls: in 1977 it was voted {{the most popular}} film by the American Film Institute (AFI), in a poll of the organization's membership; the AFI also ranked the film fourth on its [...] "100 Greatest Movies" [...] list in 1998, with it <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> to sixth place in the tenth anniversary edition in 2007. Film directors ranked it 322nd in the 2012 edition of the decennial Sight & Sound poll, and in 2016 it {{was selected as the}} ninth best [...] "directorial achievement" [...] in a Directors Guild of America members poll. In 2014, it placed fifteenth in an extensive poll undertaken by The Hollywood Reporter, which ballotted every studio, agency, publicity firm and production house in the Hollywood region. Gone with the Wind was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{described}} Mr. Hooper as [...] "slightly cranky but good-hearted". [...] Gikow called Mr. Hooper [...] "curmudgeonly". [...] Davis {{stated that}} since Mr. Hooper's {{appearance in the}} first episode of Sesame Street, he had become many things to many young children, [...] "...the guy in the apron {{at the far side}} of the generation gap, his half-lens glasses <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> his nose". [...] Davis also stated that Hooper's Store, which he called [...] "an idealized social institution", is an extension of Mr. Hooper's personality. [...] Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character Big Bird, who would often come into Hooper's Store for a birdseed milkshake and a chat. A running gag in the show was that Big Bird would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper's name, although most attempts ended in [...] "ooper," [...] such as [...] "Looper" [...] or [...] "Cooper". [...] Mr. Hooper's first name, Harold, was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school.|$|E
500|$|The opener [...] "Wasat" [...] {{sets the}} scene of the story, {{starting}} with a short, atmospheric prelude before it moves into [...] "an uptempo, hypercolor groove". The [...] "VHS-quality dubstep" [...] track [...] "Mind" [...] is where the record gets suspenseful, as the drums [...] "threaten" [...] to become, but doesn't entirely become, a fully developed hard-hitting four-on-the-floor beat. These two tracks were described by a Spectrum Culture critic as [...] "a practice in coalescence; taking a moment to take shape and then defying one another’s difference until they too find their peaceful plane of existence." [...] The most melodic track on the EP, [...] "Declination", as well as probably the [...] "most straightforwardly melodic" [...] cut in Com Truise's discography as of the release of the EP, [...] "glides into your headphones like a starship <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> out of hyperspace", featuring vocals of Joel Ford from the projects Ford & Lopatin, Airbird and Young Ejecta. As a reviewer analyzed, the track opens as [...] "spine-tingling sci-fi dissonance" [...] before turning into a 1980s-esque new wave song.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1968, Lennon was {{featured}} in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (not released until 1996) {{in the role of}} a Dirty Mac band member. The supergroup, composed of Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell, also backed a vocal performance by Ono in the film. Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called [...] "Bag One" [...] depicting scenes from their honeymoon, eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated. Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: [...] (known more for its cover than for its music), [...] and Wedding Album. In 1969, they formed the Plastic Ono Band, releasing Live Peace in Toronto 1969. Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] (widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam-War anthem in 1969), [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] (documenting his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin) and [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] In protest at Britain's involvement in [...] "the Nigeria-Biafra thing" [...] (the Nigerian Civil War), its support of America in the Vietnam war and (perhaps jokingly) against [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> the charts, Lennon returned his MBE medal to the Queen, though this had no effect on his MBE status, which could not be renounced.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the pole}} {{used by the}} athlete dislodges the bar from the uprights, a foul attempt is ruled, even if the athlete has cleared the height. An athlete does not benefit from quickly leaving the landing pad before the bar has fallen.

This call is made {{at the discretion of}} the pole vault official. [...] If the pole breaks during the execution of a vault, it is considered an equipment failure and is ruled a non-jump, neither a make nor a miss. Other types of equipment failure include the standards <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> or the wind dislodging the bar when no contact was made by the vaulter.|$|E
2500|$|Crocodiles {{can move}} quickly over short distances, even out of water. The land speed {{record for a}} {{crocodile}} is [...] measured in a galloping Australian freshwater crocodile. Maximum speed varies between species. Some species can gallop, including Cuban crocodiles, Johnston's crocodiles, New Guinea crocodiles, African dwarf crocodiles, and even small Nile crocodiles. The fastest means by which most species can move is a [...] "belly run", in which the body moves in a snake-like (sinusoidal) fashion, limbs splayed out to either side paddling away frantically while the tail whips to and fro. Crocodiles can reach speeds of [...] when they [...] "belly run", and often faster if <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> muddy riverbanks. When a crocodile walks quickly, it holds its legs in a straighter and more upright position under its body, which is called the [...] "high walk". This walk allows a speed of up to 5km/h.|$|E
2500|$|Slugs produce {{two types}} of mucus: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are hygroscopic. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal. The mucus {{secreted}} by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from <b>slipping</b> <b>down</b> vertical surfaces. The [...] "slime trail" [...] a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced {{by one of the}} same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs. Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful. Some species of slug, such as Limax maximus, secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation.|$|E
