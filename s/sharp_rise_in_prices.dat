5000|$|After the NEP was instituted, {{agricultural}} production increased greatly. Instead {{of the government}} taking all agricultural surpluses with no compensation, farmers now had the option to sell some of their produce, giving them a personal economic incentive to produce more grain. This incentive, coupled with {{the breakup of the}} quasi-feudal landed estates, surpassed pre-Revolution {{agricultural production}}. The agricultural sector became increasingly reliant on small family farms, while heavy industries, banks, and financial institutions remained owned and run by the state. This created an imbalance in the economy where the agricultural sector was growing much faster than heavy industry. To maintain their income, factories raised prices. Due to the rising cost of manufactured goods, peasants had to produce much more wheat to buy these consumer goods, which increased supply and thus lowered the price of these agricultural products. This fall in prices of agricultural goods and <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> of industrial products was known as the Scissors Crisis (due to the crossing of graphs of the prices of the two types of product). Peasants began withholding their surpluses in wait for higher prices, or sold them to [...] "NEPmen" [...] (traders and middle-men) who re-sold them at high prices. Many Communist Party members considered this an exploitation of urban consumers. To lower the price of consumer goods, the state took measures to decrease inflation and enact reforms on the internal practices of the factories. The government also fixed prices, in an attempt to halt the scissor effect.|$|E
50|$|During this period, Tuzun {{played an}} active role. He is first {{mentioned}} in early 941, when the Baridis moved against Baghdad, {{and he was}} tasked by Bajkam, along with Nushtakin, with confronting them. Battle was joined at Madhar, which at first went against the Baghdad troops, but eventually Tuzun and Nushtakin prevailed and routed the Baridis. Bajkam was killed, however, by Kurdish brigands on 21 April, and turmoil ensued: Caliph al-Muttaqi appointed a vizier of his own, but was soon compelled to install the Baridi leader Abu Abdallah al-Baridi in the post, who held it until an army mutiny resulted in the appointment of the Daylamite leader Kurankij as amir al-umara (1 July). In the meantime, following Bajkam's death, Tuzun, Nushtakin, Khajkhaj and several other Turkish military leaders at first went north to Mosul and tried to enter the employ of Nasir al-Dawla, but he turned them away. As a result, they turned to Ibn Ra'iq, who used the opportunity to recover his old post (23 September). In November, however, Tuzun and other Turkish leaders mutinied against Ibn Ra'iq and deserted him for the Baridis. This increased the latter's strength an emboldened them to march on Baghdad: on 7 March 942 the Baridi troops fought {{their way into the}} city, while Ibn Ra'iq and the Caliph withdrew north to seek the aid of the Hamdanids. Now master of the capital, the head of the Baridi family Abu'l-Husayn appointed Tuzun as sahib al-shurta of the eastern half of the city, across the Tigris. Baridi rule soon proved unpopular, however, as the plunder of his undisciplined Daylamites was coupled with a <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> and stifling taxation. Tuzun and the other Turks conspired to seize Abu'l-Husayn, but was betrayed by Nushtakin, and his attack on the Baridis' palace was repulsed by the forewarned Daylamite troops. Tuzun then abandoned Baghdad and with many of the Turks marched north to Mosul. Strengthened by these defections, the Hamdanids marched south onto Baghdad, which the Baridis abandoned. This was followed by the murder of Ibn Ra'iq by the Hamdanids (11 April 942) and the accession of Nasir al-Dawla to the post of amir al-umara a few days later. Tuzun in turn was rewarded with the post of sahib al-shurta of the capital {{on both sides of the}} river.|$|E

40|$|Recently in Tunisia, {{vegetables}} prices increased rapidly, especially green pepper, {{tomato and}} potato. The <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> {{led to the}} deterioration of consumer’s purchasing power and the depletion of their food basket. Since price is the mechanism linking the different stages of the production chain, information on price transmission and causality can provide guidance on the {{actions to be taken}} by the actors. The results of the price transmission show a long-term relationship between retail prices and producer prices. The important role played by intermediaries influences the symmetric transmission mode. In the case of tomatoes, the transmission is asymmetric and the causality has gone from retail to producer prices, whereas for potatoes the transmission is symmetrical and the causality of production prices towards the retail price. For green pepper the transmission is also symmetrical and the causality is from retail price to the production price. The transmission depends on the causality but it also depends on the supply of the market and if the product is storable or not. Actions to be undertaken by the actors must concentrate on the control and transparency of commercial transactions along the food chain. Prices regulation must be placed on the wholesale level and not on the level of the producers in order to clear the margin of intermediaries and avoid the shortage of certain products in markets. ...|$|E

40|$|N° ISBN - 978 - 2 - 7380 - 1284 - 5 International audienceThe global {{economic}} crisis lived in 2007, {{related to the}} <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> of cereal on the world market, has induced a doubling of the imported cereal invoice. This situation has constrained authorities to encourage the development of irrigated cereals as technical alternative to the weak and fluctuating yields. This paper aims to analyze the place of technical innovations in improvement yields {{and the role of}} institutional innovations to ensure their transfer. At the micro-economic level, an analysis of the socioeconomic and technical factors determining yield cereal was carried using a regression logistic model in five irrigated perimeters of Kairouan (center of the country). The results show positive significant effects of the new techniques adoption, encouragements by providing supplies and high academic level of farmer in improvement yields. The negative effect of water consumption of the farmers with high yield asks the question of the resource's durability. At the macro-economic level, the institutional innovations (structures and approaches), created recently in agricultural innovation system, were presented and analyzed. Those could improve the farm performances, but could not modify some socioeconomic factors related to the farmers and their families. The authority is the only guarantee of the innovation and its transfer. Efforts should be focused on a closed extension and targeted population taking into account the specific needs of each group in order to ensure a better transfer of the technical innovations. This activity of innovation transfer is now still complex and the participation of the profession is emergent...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade the water {{industry}} throughout Great Britain has undergone its most radical restructuring in over half a century. In England and Wales privatisation of the ten regional water authorities in 1989 removed the industry from the public sector at a stroke. In Scotland the privatisation option was rejected, and responsibility for {{water and sewerage services}} was instead transferred from local to central government control through the creation of three public water authorities in 1996. Despite these fundamental differences, however, domestic customers {{on both sides of the}} border have faced increases in thencharges, year on year, well above the rate of inflation. In Scotland these increases have been underpinned by the need for additional capital investment, tariff harmonisation across water authority areas and reductions in central government financial support in the form of transitional relief for sewerage services. The statutory body established to protect consumer interests - the Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers Council - has viewed the <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> with increasing concern, taking the controversial step of rejecting the 1998 / 99 water authority charging proposals in January 1998. The final settlement determined by the Secretary of State for Scotland allowed these increases to stand, but arranged a redistribution of the transitional relief grant of £ 30 million to limit the effect of the price rises on low-income households. For the 1999 / 2000 determination transitional relief was phased out completely, leading to rises in average domestic water bills of the order of 20 %. Against this background our paper analyses the distributional impact of water and sewerage price rises on domestic households in Scotland. Following the introduction, section two contains a brief theoretical discussion and an analysis of the recent charging reforms in Scotland. In section three we employ data from the Family Resources Survey, a source not used previously in this context, to examine the relative burden of water and sewerage charges on households classified according to income, property value and geographical location.

40|$|Importance of {{the potato}} as a staple food {{markedly}} {{increases in the}} Ob North. The urgency of the issue {{is determined by the}} existing climatic and environmental features, and their conditions. In this regard, the objective is to study ways of improving the fertility of podzolic soils with usage of liming, using of organic fertilizers, methods and timing of tillage [1]. In recent years, interest in the use in crops of different growth factors, that can significantly strengthen the physiological and biological processes in plant tissues and, thus, affect the yield and quantity of production has increased due to the <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> for mineral fertilizers. [2, 3] The studies were carried out at Yugra State University. The soil of experimental plot was podzolic, and argillaceous by its mechanical composition. The results showed that the use of dolomite powder under the potato has brought a reduction in all types of soil acidity. Organo-mineral system of fertilizers and liming significantly affect the improvement of nutrient status of the soil. Such method of tillage as spring plowing + spring ridge tillage + planting in ridges had a positive impact on tuber yield and its quality. Potato yield strongly depends on doses of manure and norms of liming. This is determined by the basic parameters of photosynthetic activity of crops. The content of dry matter, starch and vitamin C, as well as the infestation of tubers with potato scab depends not only on the system of fertilizers and liming, but also on the prevailing agro-ecological conditions of vegetation. Thus, the agroecological basis of the technology is tillage + spring plowing with subsequent ridge tillage and planting in ridges. Optimal planting density is 71. 5 thousand tubers per hectare. Liming, placement of organomineral fertilizer improves agrochemical properties of the soil, thus creating conditions favorable for the growth and development of potato plants, which ultimately affects the increase in yield of tubers and tuber quality.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the <b>sharp</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> and the {{depletion}} of resources of petroleum, an alternative to fossil resources is needed. A probable alternative {{is the use of}} lignocellulosic raw material to produce biofuels. The “first generation” biofuels are highly controversial because of the use of food plant material. The aim of the “second generation” biofuels is to take lignocellulosic non-food plant material as raw material. Lignocellulosic biomass has a very complex structure made of linkages between lignins, cellulose and hemicelluloses. The saccharification of these lignocellulosic materials requires the fractionation of its constituents. Research has lead to many lignocellulosic biomass fractionation pre-treatments. This study particularly focuses on the steam explosion pretreatment followed by an enzymatic saccharification. Steam explosion is a thermomechanical process which allows the breakdown of the lignocellulosic material structure by the combined action of steam heating, hydrolysis induced by the organic acids formed during the process and shear stress resulting from the pressure rough drop. This treatment leads to modification of the physical parameters such as water retention capacity, cristallinity rate of the cellulosic fraction, hydrolysis of the hemicellulosic fraction and rearrangement in the lignin structure. Such modifications are supposed to make cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis from complex lignocellulosic material easier. In order to verify this hypothesis, different lignocellulosic raw materials have been pre-treated by steam explosion. These materials were sugar beet pulp, corn straw and miscanthus. In order to check the effect of steam explosion pre-treatment on cellulose, a microcrystalline cellulose was also treated. Steam explosion was performed at a vapor pressure of 18 bars and with a retention time of 2 minutes. The steam exploded lignocellulosic materials and the untreated one were submitted to a hydrolysis with a mixture of enzymes composed of cellulases and cellobiase activities during 24 hours. The quantification of glucose in the hydrolysates at different times was performed by HPAEC-PAD. Rate of cellulose converted into glucose were better with steam exploded raw material showing that steam explosion allows improvement of lignocellulosic material for enzymatic saccharification...|$|E
