40|$|To be precise, number {{needed to}} treat (NNT) {{is defined as}} the answer to the question: ‘‘How many {{patients}} would I have to treat with treatment 1 (T 1) to expect one more success than if I had treated them with treatment 2 (T 2) ?’’ 1 Obviously, the answer depends on what outcome measure is used and how ‘‘success’ ’ is defined. In the original context in which NNT was proposed, for a binary outcome, one outcome was labeled ‘‘success,’ ’ the other ‘‘failure. ’ ’ The expected number of successes among N subjects in T 1 was Np 1 and in T 2 was Np 2, where p 1 and p 2 are the success rates in the two treatments. Then NNT is the value of N such that Np 1 Np 2 1, that is, NNT 1 /(p 1 p 2), where the success rate difference is SRD p 1 p 2. (Note that negative NNT indicates that T 2 is preferred to T 1.) One can estimate NNT in a variety of ways, the simplest with binary outcome to estimate p 1 and p 2 by the proportion of successes observed in the T 1 and T 2 samples. Alternatively, as noted by Zimmermann and Rahlfs, one might base estimation on the Mann–Whitney U-statistic, or the area under the <b>sample</b> <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) curve. It is well not to confuse the method used in estimation of a population parameter with the definition of that population parameter.
