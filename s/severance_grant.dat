40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{unemployment}} benefits raise unemployment durations. This result has traditionally been interpreted as a substitution effect caused by a distortion in the price of leisure relative to consumption, leading to moral hazard. This paper questions this interpretation by showing that unemployment benefits can also affect durations through an income effect for agents with limited liquidity. The empirical relevance of liquidity constraints and income effects is evaluated in two ways. First, I divide households into groups that are likely to be constrained and unconstrained based on proxies such as asset holdings. I find that increases in unemployment benefits have small effects on durations in the unconstrained groups but large effects in the constrained groups. Second, I find that lump-sum <b>severance</b> payments <b>granted</b> at the time of job loss significantly increase durations among constrained households. These results suggest that unemployment benefits raise durations primarily because of an income effect induced by liquidity constraints rather than moral hazard from distorted incentives. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) benefits raise unemployment durations. This result has traditionally been interpreted as a substitution effect caused by a reduction in the price of leisure relative to consumption, generating a deadweight burden. This paper questions the validity of this interpretation by showing that UI benefits can also affect durations through a non-distortionary income effect for agents who face borrowing constraints. UI benefits have a pure substitution effect only for those who have sufficient resources to smooth con-sumption while unemployed. The empirical relevance of borrowing constraints and income effects is evaluated in two ways. First, I classify households into groups that are likely to be constrained and unconstrained based on their asset holdings, mortgage payments, and spouse’s labor force status. Non-parametric and semi-parametric tests reveal that unemployed benefits raise durations much more sharply in the constrained groups. Second, I find that lump-sum <b>severance</b> payments <b>granted</b> at the time of job loss significantly increase durations. These results suggest that transitory benefits affect search behavior primarily through an income effect, challenging the prevailing view that social safety nets create large efficiency costs...|$|R
40|$|Essay I: Employment Security Agreements, {{which are}} {{elements}} of Swedish collective agreements, offer {{a unique opportunity}} to study very early job search counselling of displaced workers. These agreements provide individual job search assistance to workers who are dismissed due to redundancy, often as early as during the period of notice. Compared to traditional labor market policies, the assistance provided is earlier and more responsive {{to the needs of the}} individual worker. In this study, I investigate the effects of the individual counseling and job search assistance provided through the Employment Security Agreement for Swedish blue-collar workers on job finding and subsequent job quality. The empirical strategy is based on the rules of eligibility in a regression discontinuity framework. I estimate the effect for workers with short tenure, who are dismissed through mass-layoffs. My results do not suggest that the program has an effect on the probability of becoming unemployed, the duration of unemployment, or income. However, the results indicate that the program has a positive effect on the duration of the next job. Essay II: The well-known positive relationship between the unemployment benefit level and unemployment duration can be separated into two potential sources; a moral hazard effect, and a liquidity effect pertaining to the increased ability to smooth consumption. The latter is a socially optimal response due to credit and insurance market failures. These two effects are difficult to separate empirically, but the social optimality of an unemployment insurance policy can be evaluated by studying the effect of a non-distortionary lump-sum <b>severance</b> <b>grant</b> on unemployment durations. In this study, I evaluate the effects on unemployment duration and subsequent job quality of a lump-sum <b>severance</b> <b>grant</b> provided to displaced workers, by means of a Swedish collective agreement. I use a regression discontinuity design, based on the strict age requirement to be eligible for the grant. I find that the lump-sum grant has a positive effect on the probability of becoming unemployed and the length of the completed unemployment duration, but no effect on subsequent job quality. My analysis also indicates that spousal income is important for the consumption smoothing abilities of displaced workers, and that the grant may have a greater effect in times of more favorable labor market conditions. Essay III: Evidence from around the world suggest that individuals who are awarded disability benefits in some cases still have residual working capacity, while disability insurance systems typically involve strong disincentives for benefit recipients to work. Some countries have introduced policies to incentivize disability insurance recipients to use their residual working capacities on the labor market. One such policy is the continuous deduction program in Sweden, introduced in 2009. In this study, I investigate whether the financial incentives provided by this program induce disability insurance recipients to increase their labor supply or education level. Retroactively determined eligibility to the program with respect to time of benefit award provides a setting resembling a natural experiment, which could be used to estimate the effects of the program using a regression discontinuity design. However, a simultaneous regime change of disability insurance eligibility causes covariate differences between treated and controls, which I adjust for using a matching strategy. My results suggest that the financial incentives provided by the program have not had any effect on labor supply or educational attainment...|$|E

Rapidly {{changing}} economic factors, such as growing competition, {{forcing the}} employer to decrease production and delivery costs, and social factors, including rapid development of technology or changing consumer needs, growing service sector and other objectives of social character conditioned establishment and higher popularity of {{certain type of}} flexible work organisation and labour relations. It requires changes in the labour market with regard to growing demand for more flexible forms of work organisation. New forms of flexible work organisation take place {{and at the same}} time change regulation of available forms of flexible work organisation. One of the most widely spread forms of flexible work organisation in the member states of the European Union is the fixed-term employment contract. Aim of the fixed-term employment contract is to assure modern work organisation and flexibility. The main element of the contract is temporary nature of work, which is considered as the prerequisite, when drafting such a contract. In order to protect employee‘s as economically weaker party’s interests within labour relations, Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania sets regulations and prohibitions to prolong, update or renew fixed-term employment contracts. The main difference between fixed-term employment contract and permanent full-time employment contract is that, in case of fixed-term employment contract, the employer and employee agree on the end date of the employment contract. Fixed-term employment contract is such a contract that is drafted for a certain period of time or for execution of temporary works. With reference to the legal practice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Lithuania, temporary nature of work cannot be assessed according to employee‘s or employer‘s subjective needs, that is, the contract has to be drafted only in case of objective reasons, serving as the ground for occurrence of temporary nature of work. One of such examples is when one female employee goes on the maternity leave and another employee has to take her place for fixed period of time. This example shows that essence of the fixed-term employment contract is temporary nature of work and agreement between the employee and the employer regarding the end date of the contract. Thus this contract serves as legalisation of temporary labour relations, drafting, execution and termination of which is regulated by Articles 109 - 111 of the Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter – the LC RL). Though, on 14 September 2016, Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania adopted a new Labour Code, which is going to take effect on 1 January 2017. The new Labour Code ensures more flexible legal organisation of work and labour relations, if to be compared with current Labour Code. Drafting, execution and termination of fixed-term employment contracts is regulated by different articles of the new Labour Code, that is, by Articles 67 - 71. This paper analyse forms of flexible work organisation: fixed-term employment contract in Lithuania and other selected member states of the European Union (France, Germany, and United Kingdom). Trends of forms of flexible work organisation available in the European Union are reviewed. Attention is drawn at the aims provided by the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts and three instruments intended to prevent misuse of fixed-term employment contracts in member states of the European Union, that is, at objective reasons for updating of such contracts or relations, including maximum net duration of fixed-term employment contracts in a row and the number of updates of such contracts or relations. Member states of the European Union can select one or several such instruments; also every country may set additional equivalent instruments that would prevent misuse of fixed-term employment contracts. The paper also reviews topics of drafting, execution and termination of the fixed-term employment contract with regard to assurance of balance between safety of labour relations and flexibility, and analyses assurance of the principle of non-discrimination, when drafting fixed-term employment contracts in the available Labour Code, in comparison to the new Labour Code, adopted on 14 September 2017. Attention is drawn at the legal practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter – the CJEU) and legal practice of national courts, when interpreting concepts of fixed-term employment contracts, as provided in the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts, that is, what is considered as objective reasons or equivalent instruments. The first part of Master Thesis assesses forms and types of flexible work organisation available in the European Union and flexibility trends of fixed-term employment contracts, including the purpose and the main element of the fixed-term employment contract. The second part of Master Thesis assesses regulation of fixed-term employment contracts on the level of the European Union, to be more precise, the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts is analysed together with the main envisaged aims and instruments, preventing misuse of fixed-term employment contracts, including application of the principle of non-discrimination. Regulation of labour relations in selected member states of the European Union, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, including transfer of the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts into the national law of these countries, is pointed out. The second part also analyses legal practice of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which interprets provisions and concepts set by the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts, for instance, what is considered as objective reasons to draw a fixed-term employment contract, interpretation of the principle of non-discrimination. The third part of the paper analyses regulation of the fixed-term employment contract within Lithuanian legislation. Provisions of available and the new Labour Code are reviewed. Purpose and the main elements of this contract, temporary nature of work, which in legal practice of Lithuanian courts is defined as essential one, cannot be assessed according to subjective needs. Provisions of the new Labour Code in relation to fixed-term employment contracts are also analysed, comparison in regard to the available Labour Code is carried out, differences and novelties are reviewed. Conclusions reveal topics of fixed-term employment contract within the new Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania. It is concluded, that Lithuania eliminates the prohibition to draw fixed-term employment contracts for execution of works with non-temporary nature, to be more precise, it eliminates objective reason to draw fixed-term employment contract and this fact shall change legal practice of Lithuanian courts, interpreting objective reasons for drafting a fixed-term employment contract only for execution of work of temporary nature. With reference to the European Union Directive 1999 / 70 /EC Regarding Fixed-Term Employment Contracts, Lithuania in the new Labour Code selects not all instruments preventing misuse of fixed-term employment contracts, that is, it defines only net maximum duration of fixed-term employment contracts in a row as 2 years, in exceptional cases – 5 years. Nevertheless, it clearly defines application of the principle of non-discrimination. Cases, when the contract is considered as fixed-term one and allocation of <b>severance</b> <b>grant</b> is also provided, contrary to the current Labour Code, where severance grants are not envisaged...|$|E

In those instances where evidence of financial hardship has not resulted in <b>severance</b> being <b>granted,</b> it {{is often the case}} that either the plaintiff's impecuniosity was the only factor in its favour, or it failed to demonstrate that it would be beneficial to sever. Here the motions court judge, in the exercise of his discretion, while recognizing the criteria set forth in Investors Syndicate, gave, in the particular circumstances before him, significant weight to considerations of the plaintiff’s impecuniosity and the resulting access to justice issue.
