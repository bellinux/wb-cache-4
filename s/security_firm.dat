40|$|The idea of {{development}} of capital markets and hence <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> had resurfaced after 1980 ’s in Turkey, {{the latest and}} probably the final liberal period of Turkish economy. First regulations on <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> business appaeard after Banking Crisis of 1982 (or Banker Crisis). The number of <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> were dramatically increased in Turkey {{during the first half}} of the 1990 ’s. But it has observed that the number has gradually decreased after this periodic movement. This tendency is still going on in the <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> business (Coşkun, 2009 a: 2). In this process, some argue that risk management problems were relatively less important in the failed <b>securities</b> <b>firms.</b> But, because of the problems of data availability and lack of proper reporting, it would be too optimistic to assume that all <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> failures in the above period were related to market conditions. In this context, it is important to define specific risks of <b>securities</b> <b>firms.</b> To define sector specific risks is also important to develop ideal risk management framework for <b>securities</b> <b>firms.</b> Therefore, in this article, the author analyses the features of the <b>securities</b> <b>firm</b> business, typical balance sheet and industry specific risks. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{securities}} markets, {{entities that}} can deal securities {{are limited to}} members of market associations like <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> {{in order to maintain}} efficiency of their operation. Naturally, those <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> hold <b>securities</b> not only for themselves but also for clients. Although clients should be the owners of their own securities, the Japanese legal system does not give a satisfactory explanation for the ownership of clients 2 ̆ 7 securities as such held by <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> in certain situations. The main obstacle to this problem is that the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> necessarily deal with clients 2 ̆ 7 securities in the markets by their own names. Moreover, Japanese civil code obligates the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> as delegates to transfer assets which they obtain through market trades to their clients. It presumes that the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> obtain the property rights to the securities first then transfer them to their clients. This presumption, however, faces to a difficult problem when the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> go into bankruptcy before transferring the securities to their clients. 　This study will focus on the relationship between the <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> and the clients and will argue to utilize trust theory to solve the problem as above. Especially, dual ownership construct of legal ownership and equitable interest is a useful concept for further study in relation to intangible assets such as money held by intermediaries...|$|R

5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector <b>security</b> <b>firm</b> was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were several}} [...] "loopholes" [...] that {{regulators}} and financial firms {{were able to}} exploit during the lifetime of Glass–Steagall restrictions.

Glass–Steagall also did not prevent <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> from owning such institutions.

50|$|The Consumer Federation of America {{and other}} {{commentators}} suggested <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> had avoided becoming “financial holding companies” {{because they wanted}} to avoid Federal Reserve supervision as bank holding companies. The SEC (through its Chairman Arthur Levitt) had supported efforts to permit <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> to engage in non-FDIC insured banking activities without the Federal Reserve’s “intrusive banking-style oversight” of the “overall holding company.” After the GLBA became law, <b>securities</b> <b>firms</b> continued (and expanded) their deposit and lending activities through the “unitary thrifts” and “nonbank banks” (particularly industrial loan companies) they had used before the GLBA to avoid regulation as bank holding companies.

5|$|The {{first major}} public {{corruption}} scandal of Daley's tenure as mayor involved {{the circumstances of}} the resignation of his City Council floor leader, Alderman Patrick Huels, in October 1997. Daley, Huels, and another close friend Michael Tadin grew up within two blocks on S. Emerald Avenue in Bridgeport. Huels attended De La Salle Institute, the same high school attended by Daley, his father, and Michael Bilandic. Huels worked for the city's Public Works Department as a laborer and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor Richard J. Daley died, 11th Ward Alderman Bilandic was named acting mayor, and Huels, then 26, replaced Bilandic as alderman. Huels chaired the Council's Transportation Committee and became Mayor Richard M. Daley's floor leader. In the summer of 2007, in reaction to ongoing indictments and convictions of aldermen, Daley and Huels shepherded a package of ethics reforms through city council. Huels owned a <b>security</b> <b>firm,</b> SDI Security, Inc. along with his wife and his brother, a Chicago police lieutenant. In the mid-1990s, the firm had about 390 full-time employees and was grossing $7 million a year. Huels was president and a director, and Council Finance Committee Chairman Alderman Edward M. Burke (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971 in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on SDI for $326,951 and in June 1996 for $997,382 for failing to pay payroll taxes, including money withheld from its employees' pay checks.|$|E
