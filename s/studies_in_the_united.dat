25|$|After {{three years}} with her {{paternal}} grandmother, Alexandra left Florence to continue her <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, while her mother settled in Venice.

25|$|There is {{debate as}} to whether the higher rate of breast cancer {{associated}} with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese {{women are more likely to}} list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding mammograms. Other reasons obese women may avoid mammography are due to lack of insurance, low income, or embarrassment at the procedure, although when these factors are accounted for, the effect of lower rates of screening are still significant. In contrast, other studies have shown that mammography patterns did not differ among women who were obese compared to those at a healthy weight indicating that there may be biological differences in cancer presentation between these groups.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of a lack}} {{of clarity}} about laws about {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, retailers in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) commercialized and marketed them in smartshops in the Netherlands and the UK, and online. Several websites emerged that have contributed to the accessibility of information on description, use, effects and exchange of experiences among users. Since 2001, six EU countries have tightened their legislation on psilocybin mushrooms in response to concerns about their prevalence and increasing usage. In the 1990s, hallucinogens and their effects on human consciousness were again the subject of scientific study, particularly in Europe. Advances in neuropharmacology and neuropsychology, and the availability of brain imaging techniques have provided impetus for using drugs like psilocybin to probe the [...] "neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations". Recent <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States have attracted attention from the popular press and thrust psilocybin back into the limelight.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} used to teach {{literary}} theory at universities beginning not long after publication and remained dominant into the mid-1960s, at which time an increasingly heterogeneous academia questioned the universal value of literature; literary theorist Terry Eagleton finds that, after the 1960s, [...] "it was {{no longer possible to}} take for granted what what literature was, how to read it, or what social functions it might serve". Steven Mailloux describes Theory of Literature as crystallizing an American movement towards intrinsic literary criticism, as dominated by New Criticism, while van Rees credits the book with popularizing a text-oriented interpretation. Grabowicz writes that its importance for both American and general literary studies is [...] "indisputable". Writing in 1987, Jeremy Hawthorn described the book as an [...] "excellent introductory study", despite extrinsic studies having become more dominant in literary criticism, while Holquist found that the book could still [...] "be usefully invoked" [...] in literary debates of the early 21stcentury. In an obituary of Wellek, Robert Thomas Jr. credited Theory of Literature with [...] "introduc European scholarship to the United States" [...] and establishing a framework for comparative literature <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
