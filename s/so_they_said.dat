2500|$|On 18 August 2014, Pope Francis {{said that}} [...] "he process [...] {{was at the}} Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, blocked for 'prudential reasons', <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> [...] Now it is unblocked." [...] Pope Francis stated that [...] "There are no doctrinal {{problems}} {{and it is very}} important that [...] is done quickly." [...] The beatification is widely seen as the pope's strong affirmation of Romero's work with the poor and as a major change in the direction of the church since he was elected.|$|E
2500|$|Buck himself sized up CBS' {{handling}} of the announcers by saying [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> 'Let [...] McCarver run the show.' In television, all {{they want you to}} do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of [...] "trying to predict plays, as if to prove he was still on top." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver. Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> 'Let McCarver run the show ... In television, all {{they want you to}} do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck was criticized by some for his alleged habit of predicting plays on air.|$|E

2500|$|Ney did not {{immediately}} resign from the House, even though under House rules {{he would not have}} been able to vote or participate in any committee work during the chamber's [...] "lame duck" [...] session in December. He claimed that he had outstanding work to finish in his congressional office. Also, several officials said that he was in severe financial straits and needed to continue drawing his congressional salary for as long as possible. The four highest-ranking members of the Republican House leadership—Hastert, Boehner, Majority Whip Roy Blunt and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Deborah Pryce—issued a joint statement demanding that Ney resign before the lame duck session. If he didn't do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> they would make a resolution to expel him the first order of business at the lame duck session.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, amid increasing criticism, the McDaniels rescinded {{the reward}} offer. [...] "Not {{only did it}} endanger the lives of divers who would risk going farther than they should," [...] said Sorenson, who was by then even more firmly convinced that their son had not died in the cave, [...] "it put {{all of our lives}} at risk because we have to go in to recover the bodies." [...] By that time the McDaniels had also come to believe that, if he had not died in the cave, Ben had been murdered. A phone tip line they set up had not received any calls, and no one who had not yet said anything was likely to be further motivated to do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> (Ben's father elaborated the following year that the family was told to rescind the reward while in the Vortex Spring area for exactly this reason).|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} not do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> later, was a [...] "strategic decision"; {{in order to}} secure a conviction, police and prosecutors would have to prove that they believe Biryukova did in fact leave her son alone in the vehicle for an unreasonable length of time. But if evidence later emerged suggesting Sky had been murdered or kidnapped that implicated his mother in some capacity, evidence that suggested he had never been in the car to begin with, arresting her on charges that she had indeed left him there could make a prosecution for the more serious charges impossible, a police spokesman said. Later, Solomon's lawyer told the Seattle Weekly another reason for the inaction: If police did arrest Biryukova, she and her attorney would be able to review all the evidence the police had accumulated up to that point, which neither they nor Solomon wanted her to be able to do.|$|E

2500|$|After Chris Brown {{winning a}} Grammy for his [...] "F.A.M.E" [...] album, in the {{category}} [...] "Best R Album of the Year", Eric Bellinger, who co-wrote [...] "Say it With Me" [...] for the album, admitted he was like, [...] "Wow, I'm actually doing something here. I was doing something right {{because so many people}} get nominated and that's it; but {{to be a part of}} a project that actually won was the moment I realized I was in the right business." [...] Bellinger also told Billboard Magazine that he stayed with Brown in the studio everyday for about two months. Then, RoccStar and PK played the beat and he immediately thought about Michael Jackson. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Go in the booth and do some Michael-type stuff." [...] In another interview, Bellinger said, [...] "He [...] really, really went back to the days of Sam Cooke, but we were still able to keep it 2013 at the same time." [...] Bellinger also cited Justin Timberlake as another influence for the song and Brown's upcoming album [...] "X".|$|E
2500|$|Then {{they went}} away to Fårö and settled there. They couldn't support {{themselves}} in that place, so {{they went to a}} certain island off the coast of Estland, called Dagö, and settled there and built a town that can still be seen. But they couldn't support themselves there either, so they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came {{to the land of the}} Greeks (i.e. the Byzantine empire). They asked leave of the Greek king to stay there while the moon waxed and waned. The king granted that, thinking it was just for one month. Then after a month, he wanted to send them away, but they answered that the moon waxed and waned for ever and always, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they were allowed to stay. Word of this dispute of theirs reached the queen. She said, [...] "My lord king, you granted them permission to dwell while the moon waxed and waned; now that's for ever and always, so you can't take it off them." [...] So they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.|$|E
2500|$|He {{returned}} to London, {{where he was}} diagnosed with an inoperable prostate cancer, which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. [...] "Great loss for me and all of us," [...] he wrote. [...] "Greater than I would have thought." [...] He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with G. H. von Wright; to London to stay with Rush Rhees; then to Oxford to see Elizabeth Anscombe, writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then {{returned to}} Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into Storey's End at 76 Storey's Way, the home of his doctor, Edward Bevan, and his wife Joan; he had told them {{he did not want to}} die in a hospital, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, [...] "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does." [...] In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176. These and other ...|$|E

So thither they came; and he called at the door, and the old man within knew his tongue so soon as ever he heard it; so he opened, and they all came in. Then said Mnason their host, How far have ye come today? <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> From the house of Gaius our friend.

Well, she might have been twelve then: it was so long ago and the Vicar was always <b>so</b> unreliable. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> it was twenty years ago, but people used round figures, and it was just as likely to be eighteen years, or seventeen. Seventeen and twelve were only twenty-nine, and hang it all, that wasn't old, was it? Cleopatra was forty-eight when Antony threw away the world for her sake.|$|R

60|$|Thus, {{after all}} the {{patients}} had been sent away, Dr. Slyder and his colleagues of Plutoria Avenue managed to slip away themselves {{for a month or}} two, heading straight for Paris and Vienna.
