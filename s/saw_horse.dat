60|$|There was a clatter, a crash, {{and looking}} back Hereward <b>saw</b> <b>horse</b> and man {{rolling in the}} rut, and rolling with them Martin Lightfoot.

60|$|After {{this little}} {{procession}} had passed away--you may laugh at it, but upon my word and conscience, Miss Smith, I saw {{nothing in the}} course of the day which affected me more--after this little procession had passed away, the other came, accompanied by gun-banging, flag-waving, incense-burning, trumpets pealing, drums rolling, and at the close, received by the voice of six hundred choristers, sweetly modulated to the tones of fifteen score of fiddlers. Then you <b>saw</b> <b>horse</b> and foot, jack-boots and bear-skin, cuirass and bayonet, National Guard and Line, marshals and generals all over gold, smart aides-de-camp galloping about like mad, and high in the midst of all, riding on his golden buckler, Solomon in all his glory, forsooth--Imperial Caesar, with his crown over his head, laurels and standards waving about his gorgeous chariot, and a million of people looking on in wonder and awe.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{they have}} only two [...] "legs", A-frames are usually set up in rows {{so that they can}} have good stability. A <b>saw</b> <b>horse</b> {{is a good example of}} this structure. More complex {{structures}} will have a crossmember connecting the two materials in the middle to prevent the legs from bowing outwards under load, giving the structure the appearance of the capital letter A.|$|E
50|$|Formed by a {{partnership}} between James Ross and William Mackenzie, a 30-year franchise was granted in 1891 to modernize transit operations after a previous 30 year franchise that <b>saw</b> <b>horse</b> car service from the Toronto Street Railway (TSR). At {{the end of the}} TSR franchise, the city ran the railway for eight months, but ended up granting another 30-year franchise to a private operator, the TRC. The first electric car ran on August 15, 1892, and the last horse car ran on August 31, 1894, to meet franchise requirements. When the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the Toronto Transportation Commission was created.|$|E

The only known photograph of 42-9004 dates from around this time: {{it shows the}} nose resting on a <b>saw</b> <b>horse</b> with the nose wheel main leg hyper-extended so the nose wheel rests on the ground. According to a VVS color scheme research website, 42-9004 was struck by inadvertent gunfire from a badly damaged Il-2 that had a rough landing, and on one of its last bounces the guns went off and, among other things, the gunfire struck, such as the aircrew dugout, hit the parked Airacobra.|$|E
50|$|Formed by a {{partnership}} between James Ross and William Mackenzie, a 30-year franchise was granted in 1891 to modernize transit operations after a previous 30 year franchise that <b>saw</b> <b>horse</b> car service from the Toronto Street Railways (TSR). At {{the end of the}} TSR franchise, the city ran the railway for eight months, but ended up granting another 30-year franchise to a private operator, the TRC. The first electric car ran on August 15, 1892, and the last horse car ran on August 31, 1894, to meet franchise requirements. There came to be problems with interpretation of the franchise terms, for the city. A series of annexations, especially in 1908 - 12, significantly extended the city limits to include such areas as Dovercourt, Earlscourt, East Toronto, Midway (formerly between Toronto and East Toronto), North Toronto, and West Toronto. After many attempts to force the TRC to serve these areas, the city created its own street railway operation, the Toronto Civic Railways to do so, and built several routes. Repeated court battles did force the TRC to build new cars, but they were of old design. When the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the Toronto Transportation Commission was created, combining with the city-operated Toronto Civic Railways lines.|$|E

The first boat to {{reach the end of}} the gutter is the winner. The overall winner is determined by an elimination system.|$|R
60|$|This {{picture of}} human indignity {{tortured}} Benham's imagination {{much more than}} it tortured the teller of the tale. It filled him with shame and horror.

He could not endure the neighing of horses: when he <b>saw</b> <b>horses</b> galloping in a field with him his heart stood still. And all his life thereafter he hated horses.|$|R

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Agriculturally cultivated, also {{growing in}} {{disturbed}} places. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: An annual, dense, tufted, soft grass. Leaves: The leaves are green and shiny and the culms usually unbranched. Flowers: The inflorescence is flat with the spikelets evenly arranged {{on either side}} of the central axis. The size of the awns is up to 10 mm, which distinguishes it from Lolium perenne. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: The seedheads can contain nematode galls (Anguina sp.) but when they are overgrown by the bacterium, Rathayibacter toxicus, bacterial galls containing the neurotoxic orynetoxin are produced. SYNDROMES: ARGT - Annual Rye Grass Toxicosis ABPE – Acute Pulmonary Oedema and Emphysema. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Central nervous and respiratory systems. CLINICAL SIGNS: Clinical signs precipitated by disturbing or exercising - especially in mild cases. Chase animals for 100 - 200 metres if suspected. • Hypersensitivity• Muscular twitching• Locomotory disturbances - unsteady, <b>saw</b> <b>horse</b> gait or high-stepping gait • Clonic/tonic convulsions (1 - 3 minutes). Lateral recumbent. Opisthotonus - legs extended • Permanent recumbent with leg paddling, twitching, trembling and show nystagmus Death 4 - 12 hours after onset. NECROPSY: Macroscopical findings: • Rapid rigor mortis • Lung oedema • Subepi- and endocardial haemorrhages • Hepatosis. HISTOPATHOLOGY: • Not much. • CNS changes consistent with anoxia arising from vascular obstruction. TREATMENT: •Tranquillizers and sedatives eg. Diazepam / xylazine • MgSO 4 injections (every 6 - 8 hours for 3 days) 200 mg/kg/ i/m. CONTROL: • Inspect stock on ryegrass pastures every day or even twice/day. Outbreak: Remove animals immediately • Identify infestation: Representative seed specimens collected from camps and forward to Stellenbosch for final identification. Identify the eelworm and bacterial galls with the aid of a stereomicroscope. If infested: • Grow wheat, rye or barley and spray with herbicide to kill rye grass. • Graze heavily before seed heads mature • High mowing of pasture • Burn toxic pasture. Colour photos.

5000|$|Autonomous Challenge: The {{autonomous}} {{challenge is}} the major event. Qualification for this event is required. A fully autonomous ground vehicle must navigate an outdoor obstacle course. The course consists of a lane painted with white or yellow lines on a grassy field. Obstacles come {{in a wide variety}} of shapes and colors including barrels, cones, <b>saw</b> <b>horses,</b> and posts. The vehicles often use a camera to detect the boundary lines and a laser rangefinder to detect obstacles, although a variety of other approaches have been used.|$|R
