[...] To celebrate the release of the new soundtracks, Mondo held an event at the House of Wax bar in Brooklyn on November 9, selling copies of all three albums to a live DJ set by Younge.

5000|$|Harder to get custom colors or cut—by {{nature of}} the press run, {{it is harder to}} get custom <b>spot</b> colors, <b>varnish</b> effects, or coatings.|$|R
50|$|High Lift Digital Embossing is {{absolutely}} stunning. It has {{the excitement of}} a <b>spot</b> UV <b>varnished,</b> embossed job but with perfect registration and without the matching, deep deboss on the reverse of the sheet below the embossing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} pressings of {{the album}} and cassette tape covers had the number 4 <b>spot</b> <b>varnished</b> over the R in both [...] "Green" [...] and [...] "R.E.M." [...] In return, [...] "R. Stand" [...] appears instead of [...] "4. Stand" [...] on the track list on the back cover. Allegedly, this {{was a product of}} an early typing mistake: due to [...] "4" [...] being a number very close to [...] "R" [...] on the keyboard, [...] "Green" [...] was once misspelled [...] "G4een", and the mistake was adopted this way. The album was the first by the band to feature printed lyrics, although only the lyrics to [...] "World Leader Pretend" [...] appeared.|$|R
50|$|To {{simulate}} {{the effect of}} printing with engraved plates, a less-expensive process called thermography was developed that uses {{the application of a}} plastic powder, which adheres to the wet ink. The cards are then passed through a heating unit, which melts the plastic onto the card. <b>Spot</b> UV <b>varnish</b> onto matte laminate can also have a similar effect.|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{watercolor}} paints to inpaint damages on fresco is {{an example}} of a technique utilized to achieve almost complete reversibility. This is the technique used in the 20 year restoration of Da Vinci's [...] "The Last Supper" [...] in Milan. One of the most popular inpainting techniques used today is the Tinted Varnish Treatment. This process is done once the piece is fully cleaned and varnished. This last step in the restoration process is to then go into spots where original paint may be missing, or where patched holes and other irregularities may lie. The restorer then goes in with tinted varnish over the top of the non-tinted varnish. This gives the illusion that the spots have been [...] "re-painted", while in fact it is just a <b>spot</b> of tinted <b>varnish.</b> Most commonly [...] "stippling" [...] is used while using tinted varnish, in order for light to reflect similar to paint. This is done by using tiny dots in a row for variance.|$|R
