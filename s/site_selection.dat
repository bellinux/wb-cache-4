5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for <b>site</b> <b>selection,</b> construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act {{called for}} {{creation}} of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste, and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

In 2008 and 2009, <b>Site</b> <b>Selection</b> magazine ranked Dayton the #1 medium-sized metropolitan area in the U.S. for economic development. Dayton is also among the top 100 metropolitan areas in both exports and export-related jobs, ranked 16 and 14 respectively by the Brookings Institution.

5|$|Following on {{from the}} <b>site</b> <b>selection,</b> the Scottish Office {{announced}} that an international competition would be held to find a designer for a new building to house the Parliament. A design committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Dewar, and was tasked with choosing from a shortlist of designs. Proposals were submitted from internationally renowned architects such as Rafael Viñoly, Michael Wilford and Richard Meier. Twelve designs were selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final designs were put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the designs of the Spanish architect Enric Miralles were amongst the most popular. The design team took account of public opinion on the designs and invited all five shortlisted entrants to make presentations on their proposed designs before announcing a winner.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} oviparous, meaning these turtles produce {{offspring}} by laying eggs only {{and do not}} provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest <b>site</b> <b>selection</b> and construction. Females select nest sites based on soil temperature (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is four inches wide and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas {{in order to avoid}} flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles will cover the nest with leaves or dirt in order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles.|$|E

40|$|Using a coalescent {{model of}} multiallelic {{balancing}} selection with recombination, the genealogical {{process as a}} function of recombinational distance from a <b>site</b> under <b>selection</b> is investigated. We find that the shape of the phylogenetic tree is independent of the distance to the <b>site</b> under <b>selection.</b> Only the timescale changes from the value predicted by Takahata's allelic genealogy at the <b>site</b> under <b>selection,</b> converging with increasing recombination to the timescale of the neutral coalescent. However, if nucleotide sequences are simulated over a recombining region containing a <b>site</b> under balancing <b>selection,</b> a phylogenetic tree constructed while ignoring such recombination is strongly affected. This is true even for small rates of recombination. Published studies of multiallelic balancing selection, i. e., the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of vertebrates, gametophytic and sporophytic self-incompatibility of plants, and incompatibility of fungi, all observe allelic genealogies with unexpected shapes. We conclude that small absolute levels of recombination are compatible with these observed distortions of the shape of the allelic genealogy, suggesting a possible cause of these observations. Furthermore, we illustrate that the variance in the coalescent with recombination process makes it difficult to locate <b>sites</b> under <b>selection</b> and to estimate the selection coefficient from levels of variability...|$|R
