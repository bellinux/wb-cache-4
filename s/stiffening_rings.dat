Utilizing general {{finite element}} {{software}} ANSYS, the finite element computing {{model of the}} steel spatial tubular joint is built, {{which is used to}} analyze the mechanical properties under dead loads through changing its design parameters. According to the obtained and compared consequences, the different design parameters including <b>stiffening</b> <b>ring</b> thickness, cross-shaped ribbed plate thickness and <b>stiffening</b> <b>ring</b> length exert different influence on ultimate bearing capacity of the steel spatial tubular joint. Specifically, the ultimate bearing capacity under dead loads is affected by setting <b>stiffening</b> <b>ring</b> and changing cross-shaped ribbed plate thickness significantly. In contrast, if the thickness and length of <b>stiffening</b> <b>ring</b> are changed, the impact is insignificant. The results and conclusion can provide reference which is useful to optimize the design of steel spatial tubular joint in such category...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough most {{thin walled}} {{cylinders}} under external pressure are stiffened by rings {{with the same}} dimension, {{it is believed that}} the combination of large and small <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings</b> is helpful to the lightweight design of structures. In this paper, eigenvalue buckling analysis has been done to study the buckling pattern (BP) and critical pressure Pcr of thin walled cylinders with the combination of large and small <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings.</b> It is found that there is a map of buckling patterns for different ring combinations. Three BPs appear as buckling of cylinder together with both large and small <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings</b> (BP-I), buckling of cylinder together with small <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings</b> but without large <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings</b> (BP-II), and finally, buckling of cylinder without both large and small <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings</b> (BP-III). In the region of BP-I and BP-II, values of Pcr increase with the size of large and small ring, but remain constant in the region of BP-III. And it indicates a remarkable optimization space for the design of <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings.</b> The large ring location and sizes of both large and small rings are optimized for lightweight design of the example cylinder, which yields a reasonable result satisfying the stability requirement under external pressure...|$|E

At present, different assumptions and boundary simplification are adopted by different calculation methods which sometimes cause huge differences too. In this paper, we present an immune based artificial neural network model via the model and stability theory of elastic ring, we study effects of some factors (such as pipe diameter, pipe wall thickness, sectional size of stiffening ring, and spacing between <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings)</b> on penstock critical external pressure during huge thin-wall procedure of penstock. The results reveal that the variation of diameter and wall thickness can lead to sharp variation of penstock external pressure bearing capacity and then give the change interval of it.

Shells of this form are commonly used as cooling towers for electricity generating units and chemical plants.

40|$|Several planned {{accelerator}} facilities {{call for}} hundreds of elliptical cavities operating cw with low effective beam loading, and therefore require cavities that have been mechanically optimized to operate at high Q_{L} by minimizing df/dp, the sensitivity to microphonics detuning from fluctuations in helium pressure. Without such an optimization, the facilities would suffer either power costs driven up by millions of dollars or an extremely high per-cavity trip rate. ANSYS simulations used to predict df/dp are presented {{as well as a}} model that illustrates factors that contribute to this parameter in elliptical cavities. For the Cornell Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) main linac cavity, df/dp is found to range from 2. 5 to 17. 4 [*][*]Hz/mbar, depending on the radius of the <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings,</b> with minimal df/dp for very small or very large radii. For the Cornell ERL injector cavity, simulations predict a df/dp of 124 [*][*]Hz/mbar, which fits well within the range of measurements performed with the injector cryomodule. Several methods for reducing df/dp are proposed, including decreasing the diameter of the tuner bellows and increasing the stiffness of the enddishes and the tuner. Using measurements from a Tesla Test Facility cavity as the baseline, if both of these measures were implemented and the <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings</b> were optimized, simulations indicate that df/dp would be reduced from ∼ 30 [*][*]Hz/mbar to just 2. 9 [*][*]Hz/mbar, and the power required to maintain the accelerating field would be reduced by an order of magnitude. Finally, other consequences of optimizing the stiffening ring radius are investigated. It is found that <b>stiffening</b> <b>rings</b> larger than 70 % of the iris-equator distance make the cavity impossible to tune. Small rings, on the other hand, leave the cavity susceptible to plastic deformation during handling and have lower frequency mechanical resonances, which is undesirable for active compensation of microphonics.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} use of equivalent solid (EQS) modeling {{to obtain}} efficient solutions to perforated material problems using three-dimensional {{finite element analysis}} (3 D-FEA) programs. It is shown that the accuracy of EQS methods in 3 D-FEA depends on providing sufficient equivalent elastic properties to allow the EQS material to respond according to the elastic symmetry of the pattern. Peak stresses and ligament stresses are calculated from the EQS stresses by an appropriate 3 D-FEA submodel approach. The method is demonstrated {{on the problem of}} a transversely pressurized simply supported plate with a central divider lane separating two perforated regions with circular penetrations arranged in a square pattern.

Here the roof consists of a spherical dome and a <b>stiffening</b> <b>ring</b> of rectangular cross section attached {{to the edge of the}} dome.

We find a variant of the model which, despite being about as simple as the original one, is considerably more accurate in comparison with recent numerical solutions based on FEM and axisymmetric 3 D elastic formulation of the problem. The second approach in our study is to carry out an a posteriori error analysis of our refined old model. The analysis is based on variational methods and on the Hypercircle theorem of the linear theory of elasticity. The error analysis confirms, and largely also explains, the observed–rather high–accuracy of the refined old mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} a labyrinth-type turbine seal flutter in a large turbofan engine is described. The flutter analysis was conducted using a coupled fluid-structure interaction code, which was originally developed for turbomachinery blade applications. The flow model {{is based on an}} unstructured, implicit Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver. The solver is coupled to a modal model for the structure obtained from a standard structural finite element code. During the aeroelasticity computations, the aerodynamic grid is moved at each time step to follow the structural motion, which is due to unsteady aerodynamic forces applied onto the structure by the fluid. Such an integrated time-domain approach allows the direct computation of aeroelastic time histories from which the aerodynamic damping, and hence, the flutter stability, can be determined. Two different configurations of a large-diameter aeroengine labyrinth seal were studied. The first configuration is the initial design with four fins, which exhibited flutter instability during testing. The second configuration is a modified design with three fins and a <b>stiffened</b> <b>ring.</b> The steady-state flow was computed for both configurations, and good agreement was reached with available reference data. An aeroelasticity analysis was conducted next for both configurations, and the model was able to predict the observed flutter behavior in both cases.
