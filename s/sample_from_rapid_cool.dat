One such small reactor design consists of a fast spectrum reactor cooled with an array of in-core alkali metal heat pipes coupled to thermoelectric or Stirling power conversion systems. Heat pipes advantageous attributes include a simplistic design, lack of moving parts, and well understood behavior. Concerns over reactor transients induced by heat pipe instability as a function of extreme thermal transients require experimental investigations. One particular concern is <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the heat pipe condenser that would propagate to <b>cool</b> the evaporator. <b>Rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the reactor core beyond acceptable design limits could possibly induce unintended reactor control issues. This paper discusses a series of experimental demonstrations where a heat pipe operating at near prototypic conditions experienced <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the condenser.

40|$|New {{structural}} data and P-T estimates of syn-deformational assemblages within the Beni Bousera peridotites and their crustal envelope {{are used to}} explain their Alpine exhumation. The Beni Bousera peridotites occur as thin sheets within high grade crustal units of the lower Sebtides (inner Rif, Morocco) and are composed of weakly deformed spinel lherzolite {{in the core of}} the massif and garnet-spinel mylonite at the rim. The main foliation trajectories in both the peridotites and overlying crustal units show systematic rotation towards their mutual contact, indicating a kilometer-scale top to the NW shearing with a dextral component along this crust/mantle contact. Widespread top to the NW shear criteria within the crustal units overlying the peridotite support this feature. Available ages constrain the development of the main foliation in both the peridotites and crustal rocks between 25 and 20 Ma. New P-T data from the peridotites show that deformation occurs during decompression from approximate to 22 kbar, 1050 degrees C to approximate to 9 - 15 kbar, 800 degrees C. As a consequence, exhumation of the Beni Bousera peridotites takes place during the Oligo-Miocene lithosphere thinning in the footwall of a lithospheric extensional shear zone. The exceptional preservation of garnet within the mylonitic peridotites results <b>from</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the border of the massif due to the juxtaposition with colder crustal rocks along this shear zone.

Mild uremia was induced by partial (5 / 6) nephrectomy in male Wistar rats. After 4 weeks, ventricular myocytes were isolated, loaded with the fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator indo- 1, and contractile function and calcium transients recorded following electrical pacing at 0. 2 Hz. Relaxation <b>from</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> contractures (RCCs) was also studied. Cells from uremic animals (U) were hypertrophied compared with controls (C), with a significant increase in width (14 %; P< 0. 02) and cross-sectional area (13 %; P< 0. 03). There was a significant increase in diastolic intracellular Ca 2 + ratio in the uremic cells (C, 0. 33 ± 0. 00 vs U, 0. 37 ± 0. 02; P< 0. 02), although the amount of calcium released per twitch was similar. Uremic cells were slower to relax following RCCs, however when Na+/Ca 2 + exchange was inhibited using a Na+-free/Ca 2 +-free solution, this difference was abolished. Under these conditions, there was little difference in the relaxation rate of control cells, indicating that the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger plays only a minor role in relaxation in normal rat myocytes. However in uremia, the data indicate that the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger actively interfered with relaxation, possibly by working in reverse rather than forward mode. These results indicate that myocyte relaxation and Ca 2 + handling are abnormal in early uremia and may provide further evidence for the existence of a specific ‘uremic cardiomyopathy’...|$|R

40|$|W 49 B is a mixed-morphology {{supernova}} remnant with thermal X-ray emission {{dominated by}} the ejecta. In this remnant, the presence of overionized plasma has been directly established, with information about its spatial structure. However, the physical origin of the overionized plasma in W 49 B {{has not yet been}} understood. We investigate this intriguing issue through a 2 D hydrodynamic model that takes into account, for the first time, the mixing of ejecta with the inhomogeneous circumstellar and interstellar medium, the thermal conduction, the radiative losses from optically thin plasma and the deviations from equilibrium of ionization induced by plasma dynamics. The model was set up {{on the basis of the}} observational results. We found that the thermal conduction plays an important role in the evolution of W 49 B, inducing the evaporation of the circumstellar ring-like cloud (whose presence has been deduced from previous observations) that mingles with the surrounding hot medium, cooling down the shocked plasma, and pushes the ejecta backwards to the centre of the remnant, forming there a jet-like structure. During the evolution, a large region of overionized plasma forms within the remnant. The overionized plasma originates <b>from</b> the <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the hot plasma originally heated by the shock reflected from the dense ring-like cloud.

Direct contact cooling at different temperatures was carried out to mimic the Frozen Cone® process.

Critical developments are required in the supporting areas of measurement and in process inspection to achieve this. CM 247 LC is a nickel superalloy that is of interest for use in aerospace and civil power plants. However, {{it is difficult to}} process via selective laser melting (SLM) as it suffers <b>from</b> cracking during <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> and solidification. This limits the viability of CM 247 LC parts created using SLM. To quantify part integrity, spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy (SRAS) has been identified as a viable non-destructive evaluation technique. In this study, a combination of optical microscopy and SRAS was used to identify and classify the surface defects present in SLM-produced parts. By analysing the datasets and scan trajectories, it is possible to correlate morphological information with process parameters. Image processing was used to quantify porosity and cracking for bulk density measurement. Analysis of surface acoustic wave data showed that an error in manufacture {{in the form of an}} overscan occurred. Comparing areas affected by overscan with a bulk material, a change in defect density from 1. 17 % in the bulk material to 5. 32 % in the overscan regions was observed, highlighting the need to reduce overscan areas in manufacture...|$|R

40|$|Objective: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> of the heart during normothermic coronary circulation at reperfusion after ischemia promotes early recovery of cardiac function due to the positive inotropic effects on the myocardium produced by cooling. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the myocardial protective effect of <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> by measuring heat shock protein (HSP) levels and examining the relationship between cardiac function, intracellular Ca concentration, and intracellular pH after <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Methods: Isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to ischemia for 60 minutes at a myocar-dial temperature of 37 °C. One group of hearts (group R) was subjected to 3 minutes of <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling</b> (≤ 4 °C) 3 minutes after reperfusion was started. The other hearts (group C) were not cooled. Myocardial protection was then compared in the two groups by measuring heart rate, coronary flow, left ventricular contraction, intracellular Ca concentration (fura- 2 fluorescence), and intracellular pH (BCECF-AM fluorescence) and examining HSP 70 by western blot. Results: (1) Left ventricular contraction was 105 ± 0. 05 % of the pre-ischemia value in group R after <b>rapid</b> <b>cooling,</b> whereas recovery was poor in group C (63 ± 2 %). (2) The intracellular Ca concentration in group R rose to 141 ± 8 % of the pre-ischemia value during ischemia, but de...|$|R
