25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> or along lines of constant throttle. If the <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM. The first three speed lines have 6 points each while the highest speed line has five.|$|E
25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear <b>shaft</b> <b>speed.</b> The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{factory-installed}} locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit {{to join the}} shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|E

2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs.

50|$|Alternatively, {{adding a}} zero (i.e. front) stage to the compressor, to {{increase}} overall pressure ratio, will require {{an increase in}} <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> (to maintain the same blade tip Mach number {{on each of the}} original compressor stages, since the delivery temperature of each of these stages will be higher than datum). The increase in <b>shaft</b> <b>speed</b> raises the centrifugal stresses in both the turbine blade and disc.
