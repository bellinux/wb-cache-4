40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} exposure to constant light <b>started</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 1 month and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 14 months on the survival, life span, tumorigenesis and age-related dynamics of antioxidant enzymes activity in various organs in comparison to <b>the</b> rats maintained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> standard (12 : 12 light/dark) light/dark regimen. We found that exposure to constant light <b>started</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 1 month accelerated spontaneous tumorigenesis and shortened life span both in male and female rats as compared to <b>the</b> standard regimen. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the exposure to constant light <b>started</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 14 months failed to influence survival {{of male and female}} rats. While delaying tumors in males, constant light accelerated tumors in females. We conclude that circadian disruption induced by light-at-night <b>started</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 1 month accelerates aging and promotes tumorigenesis in rats, however failed affect survival when <b>started</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 14 months...|$|R

The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season, prior to a UK tour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} 14th century, {{no doubt}} {{on account of the}} devastation caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E

5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} force in the Everglades, shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. <b>Starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades, eroding some of it away, and created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|Aerobatic {{competitions}} {{take place}} for both powered aircraft and gliders, {{with up to}} 30 events {{each year in the}} UK and Ireland. <b>Starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Beginner level, pilots can move up to Standard (powered aircraft) or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, Advanced, and finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and Unlimited levels, and pilots who have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E

Another line <b>started</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Southern Pacific Bakersfield Station, and traveled east on Niles Street to Brown Street.

5|$|Apart {{from these}} sculptures, entire {{sequences}} from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> main entrance. The {{right to left}} sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, the weather and war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, {{in the act of}} killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.|$|E
5|$|Austria's Alexander Wurz {{drove through}} the field in his Williams from 19th at the start to finish third by taking one pitstop, {{completing}} 40 laps on super soft tires. By finishing third Wurz, recorded his third career podium, in the race that marked ten years since his debut race in F1. Nick Heidfeld finished in second place after trailing Hamilton {{for the majority of}} the race. The safety car deployments also allowed Heikki Kovalainen to move up to fourth after <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the grid. The race was the first time in the 2007 season where a driver from a team other than Ferrari or McLaren made the podium.|$|E
5|$|Beginning as Walworth Road, the A215 becomes Camberwell Road—much {{of which}} is a {{conservation}} area—after entering the former Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Crossing the A202, the A215 becomes Denmark Hill, originally known as Dulwich Hill, but renamed in 1683 to commemorate the marriage of Princess Anne (later Queen Anne) to Prince George of Denmark. After passing Herne Hill railway station the road becomes Norwood Road, Knights Hill, and then Beulah Hill at its crossroads with the A214. Beulah Hill was the site of Britain's first independent television transmitter, built by the Independent Television Authority in 1955. Descending towards South Norwood the A215 becomes South Norwood Hill and then Portland Road, just after crossing the A213. A short section <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> junction with Woodside Green is known as Spring Lane, leading to Shirley Road, the final section into Shirley, Croydon.|$|E

5|$|Filmmaker Terrence Malick {{originally}} {{worked on}} a screenplay limited to Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. When financing fell through, Malick left the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He {{realized that there was}} no context for Guevara's actions in Bolivia and decided that his participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was so long that Soderbergh decided to divide the film into two parts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the installments back-to-back <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first in Spain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.|$|E
5|$|Later on in 2012, Feeder took on {{one last}} tour for the year.

5|$|Since 1998, {{the victims}} of the Battle of Vukovar and the events that {{occurred}} in its immediate aftermath are commemorated annually on 18 November by a procession <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Vukovar hospital and reaching the city's memorial cemetery. In 2014, the event drew 80,000 participants. A monument sculpted by Slavomir Drinković that marks the site of the mass grave at Ovčara was unveiled on 30 December 1998. Monuments of the same design have subsequently been used to mark all the other mass graves from the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre itself has come to be referred to as the Vukovar massacre, the Ovčara massacre, or the Vukovar hospital massacre. It was by far the largest massacre committed during the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
