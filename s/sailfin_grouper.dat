40|$|The Galapagos <b>Sailfin</b> <b>grouper,</b> Mycteroperca olfax, locally {{known as}} bacalao and listed as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN, is culturally, economically, and ecologically {{important to the}} Galapagos archipelago and its people. It is regionally endemic to the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and, while an important fishery resource that has shown substantial declines in recent years, to date no effective management regulations are in place to ensure the sustainability of the Galapagos fishery for this species. Previous estimates of longevity and size at maturity for bacalao are inconsistent with estimates for congeners, which brings into question the accuracy of prior estimates. We set out to assess the age, growth, and reproductive biology of bacalao {{in order to provide}} more accurate life history information to inform more effective fisheries management for this species. The oldest fish in our sample was 21 years old, which is 2 – 3 times greater than previously reported estimates of longevity. Parameter estimates for the von Bertalanffy growth function (k = 0. 11, L∞ = 110 cm TL, and to = − 1. 7 years) show bacalao to grow much slower and attain substantially larger asymptotic maximum length than previous studies. Mean size at maturity (as female) was estimated at 65. 3 cm TL, corresponding to a mean age of 6. 5 years. We found that sex ratios were extremely female biased (0. 009 M: 1 F), with a large majority of the individuals in our experimental catch being immature (79 %). Our results show that bacalao grow slower, live longer, and mature at a much larger size and greater age than previously thought, with very few mature males in the population. These findings have important implications for the fishery of this valuable species and provide the impetus for a long-overdue species management plan to ensure its long-term sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. The Galapagos <b>sailfin</b> <b>grouper</b> Mycteroperca olfax, locally {{known as}} bacalao, is an {{important}} ecological, cultural, and economical resource in the Galapagos Archipelago. However, years of intensive fishing pressure have resulted clear signs of overfishing. Bacalao represent an important resource {{for which there is}} no management, but for which management cannot be implemented because of a lack of information on the current status of the fishery and inconsistencies in life history information. My research was, therefore, aimed at assessing life history and fisheries attributes for bacalao with the goal of providing management options for this species. Longevity of bacalao is greater than previously reported, with a maximum recorded age of 21 years. Growth estimates showed bacalao to grow larger and slower than previously thought. Size at maturity was also estimated to be larger than previously accepted assessments. Current status of the bacalao fishery is worrisome as it is undergoing both recruitment and growth overfishing. The percentage of fish above size at maturity in the catch has dropped to an all time low, and Spawning Potential Ratio suggests that bacalao is facing imminent reproductive failure. Furthermore, over a 20 -­‐‑year period there have been declines in all of the stock health indicators, with 2012 being the lowest year on record. In lieu of management regulations specifically aimed at bacalao, the Galapagos Marine Reserve relies on no-­‐‑take zones to provide protection from fishing. However, size of bacalao, catch rates, and catch composition were indistinguishable between areas open and closed to fishing. Bacalao showed high site fidelity and likely do not move outside no-­‐‑take zones, and therefore poaching within these zones may contribute to the patterns observed. An evaluation of the knowledge of fishers of the current GMR zonation suggests that this lack of compliance due to unwitting poaching. My research has provided valuable information upon which management regulations for bacalao can be built, these should include slot limits, temporal closures, and adequate enforcement of no fishing areas...|$|E
