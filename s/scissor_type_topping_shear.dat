40|$|In {{a dynamic}} and {{evolving}} society {{there is a}} need for temporary and mobile structures. For this, deployable scissor structures - structural mechanisms that can transform from a compact state to a fully deployed configuration - are suitable. However, this transformational capacity complicates the design process since there is a strong interaction between geometry, kinematic properties and structural response. In the conceptual design phase {{there is a need}} for more structural insight related to geometric aspects of deployable scissor structures. Toward this end, this research evaluates the influence of design parameters (height, span, structural thickness, number of units, and <b>scissor</b> <b>type)</b> on the structural behaviour (stress, deflection and mass) of scissor arches. A sensitivity analysis is first performed which determines the relative influence of each of these parameters. Then a comprehensive parametric structural study is performed to determine the best values for efficient (low mass) scissor systems. The result of this research is a set of guidelines to facilitate the design of competitive scissor structures and enhance further analysis and realisation.

40|$|Deployable scissor {{structures}} {{can transform}} from a compact bundle of elements to a fully expanded configuration. Due to this transformational capacity {{there is a}} mutual relation between the geometry, the kinematics and the structural response of the scissor system, resulting in a relatively complex design process. In order to understand how geometrical parameters influence the structural performance, it is beneficial to evaluate these structures at a pre-design stage. To reach this goal, we developed an integrated framework for pre-design evaluation using the parametric finite element tool Karamba in combination with Matlab. By doing so an automatic and immediate preliminary structural evaluation can be established that guides the designer in making efficient geometrical design decisions. This paper evaluates design parameters for deployable scissor arches using this framework. More specifically, {{the influence of the}} most important geometrical inputs - <b>scissor</b> <b>type,</b> number of <b>scissor</b> units, structural thickness and height of the arch - on structural performance (i. e. stress, deflection and mass) is determined. Results indicate the sensitivity of the considered parameters and their importance in the design of scissor arches.

A pilot survey (N = 291) examined the strength of combinations of <b>toppings</b> and bread <b>type</b> as carrier to select stimuli for the main study. In the main experimental study consisting of a two (bread <b>type)</b> by two (<b>topping</b> <b>type)</b> between-subjects design, participants (N = 226) were given a free sandwich at a university stand with either a relatively unhealthy deep-fried snack (croquette) or a healthy topping.

When the default of bread offered was white, 89 out of 111 participants (80 %) similarly chose to stick with this default. Across conditions, participants felt equally free to make a choice. The attractiveness of and willingness to pay for the sandwich were not affected by default type of bread. This study demonstrated a strong default effect of bread type.

These tests have been carried out within the frame of a joint R& D project called Orthoplus, in partnership with Eiffage Company, Arcadis engineering office and the Sétra (French Highways technical authority). This project aims at improving the design rules for orthotropic deck and developing a UHPFRC-based innovative solution to improve the durability of orthotropic deck. Loads have been applied to four specimens, 4 m-long and 2. 40 m-wide, consisting in a realistic steel orthotropic deck with different <b>types</b> of <b>topping</b> layers: traditional bituminous concrete, thin layer of UHPFRC, or no topping layer. The dimensions of the specimens have been chosen to limit the effect of boundary conditions on the effect of a local loading. The load application has been chosen as representative of real situations and of idealised cases considered in design codes: real truck wheels have been used as well as rectangular steel plates with dimensions complying with Eurocode 1 part 2. The investigation has been focused on the stress obtained at the weld between stiffener and deck plate, at mid-span between transverse crossbeams, which is critical to estimate the fatigue lifespan of real orthotropic deck structures under the effect of repeated local loads induced by traffic. The stress repartition in the different configurations has been assessed through static tests, then 2 million cycles have been applied to verify the fatigue resistance the specimen.
