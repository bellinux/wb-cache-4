An additional antenna base for this telescopic antenna is mounted {{on the left side of}} the turret. Because of the additional equipment the number of round for the 125mm tank gun had to be lowered from 44 to 38. In NATO code T-72MK was represented by three different designations: T-72MK1, T-72MK2 and T-72MK3 which represented the company command version, battalion command version and regiment command version.|$|E

5000|$|BMP (Ob'yekt 764) - The {{original}} main {{prototype of}} the BMP-1 {{was developed by the}} design bureau of the Chelyabinsk Tractor Works (ChTZ) and built in 1965.

The vehicle had a curved shock-absorber behind the first road wheel and the rear fender and two tool <b>stowage</b> <b>boxes</b> on the fenders. To start production of the new vehicle, the design of the fighting and troop compartments were improved. Unlike the BMP-1, Ob'yekt 764 used a waterjet for swimming, which was removed to save space inside the vehicle. Ob'yekt 764 also had a larger main fuel tank, while the BMP-1 had the main fuel tank reduced in size and partially placed under the troop compartment.|$|R

40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Bachillerato en Ciencia e Ingeniería de los Materiales) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ciencia e Ingeniería de los Materiales, 2015. This {{project was}} {{developed}} in the company of Boston Scientific Coyol plant, proposed by the Department of packaging and labeling manufacturing engineering. It consists of the highest <b>stowage</b> <b>boxes</b> to produce more finished and packed into sterilization in order to approach the maximum quantity of the space in sterilization chambers that perform the process products. The economically studies of savings were performed by industrial engineers in packaging and labeling department, this project has savings of approximately one million dollars annually. However, it is required to define if the boxes support the additional load due to the higher <b>stowage.</b> Three <b>boxes</b> of snares product from Polypectomy and Special Devices were performed an experimental compression tests were performed, an analytical model considering four phenomena, temperature, humidity, weight and transportation she resolved. Besides a computer modeling in SolidWorks. It was concluded that boxes resist the overweight with a safety factor of 2 for third box, 4 {{in the case of the}} first box and 6 for second box. In addition, it was found some problems in boxes design and bonding between the layers of the material. In the analytical model forces due to temperature and vibrations were almost negligible. The modelation of compressive stress had proved the results obtained by experimental testing, it showed the zones with more danger of failure. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.

50|$|In {{parallel}} with the T-80U and Russia in general, the Morozov Bureau in Ukraine developed a diesel-powered version, the T-80UD. It is powered by the 1,000-hp 6TD-1 6-cylinder multi-fuel two-stroke turbo-piston diesel engine, ensuring high fuel efficiency and a long cruising range. The engine support systems {{make it possible to}} operate the tank at ambient fuel temperatures of up to 55 °C and to ford to a water depth of 1.8 m. The T-80UD shares most of the T-80U's improvements, but can be distinguished from it by a different engine deck and distinctive smoke-mortar array and turret <b>stowage</b> <b>boxes.</b> It retains the remotely controlled commander's machine gun. About 500 T-80UD tanks were built in the Malyshev plant between 1987 and 1991. About 300 were still at the Ukrainian factory when the Soviet Union broke up, so the T-80UD tank was welcomed into Ukrainian Military service, and therefore is more common in Ukrainian service than Russian. The T-84 and Ukraine's older T-80s will be Ukraine's main battle tank well into the 21st century.|$|R
