The objectives of the study were to determine whether public primary schools of Suneka Division, Kisii County formulate <b>strategic</b> <b>plans,</b> to examine the framework compositions of the plans, to find out the parties involved in <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> and to analyze the effectiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> in public primary schools of Suneka, Division, Kisii County, Kenya. The target population of the proposed study was 52 head teachers, 580 teachers 103 SMC chairpersons, treasures and members and DQASO Kisii South District. The entire sampling size yielded 101 respondents involving 20 head teachers, 60 teachers 20 SMC chairpersons, treasures and members and DQASO Kisii South District. Data collection was carried out using questionnaires, Semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. The questionnaires were used to collect data from head teachers and teachers. The interview schedules were used to conduct interviews with SMC chairpersons, SMC treasures and SMC members and DQASO. From the findings 48. 5 percent of respondents had prepared <b>strategic</b> <b>plans</b> once, 25. 8 percent had prepared only thrice and 4. 4 percent had not prepared any.

5|$|The Army of Rhin-et-Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was {{deployed}} {{with its}} right flank at Huningue, its {{center on the}} Queich River and its left flank at Saarbrücken.

5|$|As a result, castle {{building}} by the Norman nobility across England and the Marches lacked a grand <b>strategic</b> <b>plan,</b> reflecting local circumstances such as military factors and {{the layout of}} existing estates and church lands. Castles were often situated along the old Roman roads that still formed the backbone for travel across the country, both to control {{the lines of communication}} and to ensure easy movement between different estates. Many castles were built close to inland river ports and those built on the coast were usually located at the mouths of rivers or in ports, Pevensey and Portchester being rare exceptions. Some groups of castles were located so as to be mutually reinforcing – for example the castles of Littledean Camp, Glasshouse Woods and Howle Hill Camp were intended to act as an integrated defence for the area around Gloucester and Gloucester Castle for Gloucester city itself, while Windsor was one of a ring of castles built around London, each approximately a day's march apart. Some regional patterns in castle building can also be seen – relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of available serfs, or unfree labour.|$|E

When compared to <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> practices employed outside of the healthcare field, however, most healthcare <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> processes have not evolved to the more advanced, state-of-the-art levels of planning being used successfully outside of healthcare. While organizations that operate in stable markets may be able to survive using basic <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> practices, the volatile healthcare market demands that pro-viders be nimble competitors with advanced, ongoing planning processes that drive growth and organizational effectiveness. What should healthcare organi-zations do to increase the rigor and sophistication of their <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> practices?

5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year <b>Strategic</b> <b>Plan</b> of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E

40|$|Following rapid {{economic}} growth, older sections of Seoul {{have experienced a}} decline. Mixed-used Developments (MXDs) offer viable approaches for urban regeneration in Seoul. The MXD projects that have been constructed were intended to improve built environments as well as revitalise social and local culture. Whilst visions and directions for urban regeneration in world cites are well documented, little is understood of the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> of urban projects in Seoul. This paper investigates five MXD projects via 12 <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> factors. It outlines the opportunities and challenges of MXD projects within Seoul contexts. The factors consisted of 41 <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> schemes, extracted from relevant literature and a survey of experts. We used 30 <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> schemes as indicators for measuring <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> to support urban regeneration. The results of a case study indicate that <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> for ‘User convenience’, ‘Functional integration’ and ‘Visual perception’ is commonly applied to five projects. However, strategic approaches to ‘Divergence of connection’, ‘Regional identity’, ‘Art & design unification’ and ‘Amenity of low levels’ vary with different visions and urban functions.
