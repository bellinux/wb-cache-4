Almost the entire animal can be eaten, {{rather than having to}} shell the animal to reach the meat, with the exceptions of the mouth parts, the gills and the abdomen, which must be discarded. The remaining, edible part of the crab is typically tossed in flour to which some combination of salt, pepper and Old Bay Seasoning have been added, before being deep fried or sauteed in butter. It is then placed on toasted bread, typically dressed with mayonnaise, sliced tomato and lettuce.

40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} fishery {{resources}} that have suffered {{the consequences of}} overexploitation, pollution or climate change, therefore, the population of marine organisms of commercial importance has diminished noticeably.

40|$|The Callinectes arcuatus {{population}} of the Gulf of Nicoya and its current level of exploitation were investigated based on size frequencyanalysis of trap and trawl catches. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K= 0. 89; CW&# 8734; = 142 mm for males) {{are in the range}} reported for otherspecies of this family and suggest that the male size at first maturity (CWmat = 94. 3 mm) is reached in about a year. Total and natural mortality(Zyr = 2. 49; Myr = 1. 32) were derived from catch curve analysis and age at first maturity, respectively, and indicate that the stock is below fullexploitation (E = 0. 47). A yield per recruit analysis suggests that yield could be maximised, if E was increased to 0. 7 under the preconditionthat recruitment was independent of stock size. Until this has been verified, the use of a precautionary exploitation rate (E 0. 1) of 0. 57 is advisedallowing for a 20 % increase in fishing effort (from 300 traps currently being fished to around 360 traps). A maximum effort of 1600 traps,as recommended by the Instituto Costarricense de Pesca y Acuicultura (INCOPESCA), is unlikely to be sustained by the population, since adecrease in the proportion of large males in the catches has already been observed over the past years under the current fishing regime. Thisresource is as yet only sold locally, but present catches of around 145 t seem to already cause market saturation. A greatly increased catch(at E > 0. 57) would thus not only be detrimental to the stock but also to the market price of the resource.
