According to the 1874 election law, which remained unchanged until 1918, only the upper 5.9% to 6.5% of the whole population had voting rights. That effectively excluded almost {{the whole of the}} peasantry and the working class from Hungarian political life. The percentage of those on low incomes was higher among other nationalities than among the Magyars, with the exception of Germans who were generally richer.

The objective of these reforms has been to achieve a reduction of the credit risk associated with the growth in intraday credit exposures that arises in net <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> and in real-time gross systems when the central bank provides daylight overdrafts. Intraday payments-related credit in net <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> has been reduced by restructuring payment systems into real-time gross <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> with collateralized overdrafts, while in the existing real-time gross <b>settlement</b> <b>systems,</b> the risk-abatement program currently in effect has taken the form of caps and charges on uncollateralized daylight credit. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1513, Ferdinand II of Aragon {{issued a}} decree {{establishing}} the encomienda land <b>settlement</b> <b>system</b> {{that was to}} be incorporated throughout the Spanish Americas. Velázquez, who had become Governor of Cuba relocating from Baracoa to Santiago de Cuba, was given the task of apportioning both the land and the indigenous peoples to groups throughout the new colony. The scheme was not a success, however, as the natives either succumbed to diseases brought from Spain such as measles and smallpox, or simply refused to work, preferring to slip away into the mountains. Desperate for labor to toil the new agricultural settlements, the Conquistadors sought slaves from surrounding islands and the continental mainland. However, these new arrivals followed the indigenous peoples by also dispersing into the wilderness or dying of disease.|$|E
25|$|The Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 {{gives the}} board power {{in areas of}} the law that were {{previously}} uncertain. It removed the zero hour rule that allowed a bankruptcy to date a bankruptcy the previous midnight and the Act made it so payments the same day could not be undone. Before the removal of the zero hour rule, the Real Time Gross <b>Settlement</b> <b>system</b> had been violated because payments in the system should inherently not be reversed. Some payments systems had previously agreed to pay and receive obligations to the whole system, rather than merely maintaining their own. But {{in the event of a}} bankruptcy, the bankrupt institution did not pay what it owed back to the solvent parties, while they had to pay their dues to the failed bank. This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution doesn't have the funds to back them up, after the Cheques Act 1986 was amended in 1998. The Trade Practices Act 1974 generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but if the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves. The ACCC and the Payments Systems Board are encouraged to work together regarding access and rivalry through the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998.|$|E

Because [...] "Chaco Canyon is the convergence point of all presently documented extra-canyon roads", the area may represent a locus of regional control, or [...] "the apex of the hierarchical system". Powers believes that great houses like Chetro Ketl were involved in civic coordination between the canyon sites and outlying communities. In 1993 David R. Wilcox proposed that a state-level society developed at Chaco, with an administrative center at Pueblo Bonito or Chetro Ketl. In a 2003 study of Chacoan artifacts, Frances Joan Mathien stated {{that the number of}} warrior-class individuals that would have been needed to support such a state– Wilcox estimated 500–1,000– precludes his theory, and Wilcox is assuming a [...] "greater Chacoan organizational complexity than any other scholar to date".|$|E

40|$|Clearing and <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> are {{essential}} to the smooth functioning of a modern market-based economy such as Canada's. During the past decade, there have been significant efforts in Canada and abroad to improve electronic clearing and <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> that handle payments obligations, either uniquely or in conjunction with transactions related to the purchase and sale of a broad range of financial instruments such as debt, equity, foreign exchange, or derivatives. This article examines some of the risks faced by participants and end-users of these systems and reviews the Bank of Canada's role in relation to these systems. For a number of years, the Bank has been involved informally with major clearing and <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> with a view to ensuring that systemic risk is adequately controlled. In July 1996, the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act was proclaimed. This Act formalized the role of the Bank in the oversight of clearing and <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> for the purpose of controlling systemic risk.
