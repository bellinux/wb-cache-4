40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the long-term outcome of 76 children (40 females and 36 males) diagnosed and treated with modern antituberculosis drugs. The median age of the children on admission was 29. 5 months and on follow-up 9 years. Antituberculosis therapy consisted of daily isoniazid (20 mg/kg), rifampicin (20 mg/kg), ethionamide (20 mg/kg), and pyrazinamide (40 mg/kg) for 6 months. Twenty-three children received daily prednisone (2 - 4 mg/kg) for the first month of treatment. Raised intracranial pressure was actively monitored and treated. Patients with non-communicating hydrocephalus received ventriculo-peritoneal shunts shortly after admission while communicating hydrocephalus was treated with oral acetazolamide (100 mg/kg/day) and furosemide (1 mg/kg/day) in 3 - 4 divided doses. Communicating hydrocephalus that did not respond to this regimen within the first month of treatment also underwent ventriculo-peritoneal <b>shunting.</b> <b>Only</b> 20 % of children were functionally completely normal at follow-up. Main areas of functional deficit were cognitive impairment (80 %), poor scholastic progress (43 %), and emotional disturbance (40 %). Twenty-five per cent of children had evidence of motor impairment, but all could walk and only 5 of 76 children (6 % of total) were unable to run. One child was blind but no child had sensori-neural deafness. It was concluded that these disabilities in children from mainly deprived socioeconomic backgrounds have serious implications for their future social, academic, and career prospects. A high index of suspicion of TBM in high tuberculosis incidence communities will help prevent the morbidity documented in this study. Articl...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The role of {{percutaneous}} hepatic vein angioplasty in {{the management}} of Budd-Chiari syndrome has not been well defined. Over a 10 year period at our unit, we have often used this technique in cases of short length hepatic vein stenosis or occlusion, reserving surgical mesocaval shunting for cases of diffuse hepatic vein occlusion or failed angioplasty.  AIMS—To review the outcome of angioplasty and surgical shunting to define their respective roles.  PATIENTS—All patients treated by angioplasty or surgical shunting for non-malignant hepatic vein obstruction over a ten year period from 1987 to 1996.  METHODS—A case note review of pretreatment features and clinical outcome.  RESULTS—Angioplasty was attempted in 21 patients with patent hepatic vein branches and was succesful in 18; in three patients treatment was unsuccessful and these patients had surgical shunts. Fifteen patients were treated by surgical <b>shunting</b> <b>only.</b> Mortality according to definitive treatment was 3 / 18 following angioplasty and 8 / 18 following surgery; in most cases this reflected high risk status prior to treatment. Venous or shunt reocclusion rates were similar for both groups and were associated with subtherapeutic warfarin in half of these cases. Most surviving patients in both groups are asymptomatic although one surgical patient has chronic hepatic encephalopathy.  CONCLUSION—With appropriate case selection, many patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by short length hepatic vein stenosis or occlusion may be managed successfully by angioplasty alone. Medium term outcome is good following this procedure provided that anticoagulation is maintained. Further follow up is required to assess for definitive benefits but we suggest that this should be included as a valid initial approach in the algorithm for management of Budd-Chiari syndrome. ...|$|E

The average time between the first operation and the revision was 9 [*]months. The most common indications for shunt revision were either shunt failure (55 %) or low-pressure headaches (21 %). Postoperatively, most of the patient’s clinical manifestations, especially the vision, stabilized or improved postoperatively. However, postoperative deterioration of vision was seen in six patients, complete loss of vision despite adequate shunt function was seen in four patients, loss of vision after initial improvement was seen in three patients, and improvement of vision in one eye and deterioration of vision in the other eye was seen in two patients. The relapse of IIH symptoms after shunt malfunction can occur as late as 7 [*]years from the initial shunt procedure.

40|$|Background. One-lung ventilation-related {{hypoxaemia}} (OLV-RH) {{can occur}} in patients with healthy lungs. In this case, PEEP frequently improves oxygenation. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine, in a healthy lung model of OLV, whether the increase in PEEP improved oxygenation and whether the mechanisms involved include both inspiratory lung recruitment and an end-expiratory lung volume increase. Since inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may have a synergistic effect on oxygenation in the case of PEEP-induced recruitment, their association was also tested. Methods. Twenty pigs were studied during open-chest, left OLV. Arterial blood gases and haemodynamic variables were measured at different levels of PEEP (0, 5, 10 and 15 cm H 2 O) applied in random order with or without iNO 4 p. p. m. Pressure–volume curves were measured at each level of PEEP. Results. PEEP 5 and PEEP 10 improved Pa O 2 /FI O 2 ratio (P< 0. 005) and shunt (P< 0. 005) regardless of the presence of iNO.

BackgroundPathophysiology and properly management of PFO still remain far from being fully clarified: in particular, the contribution of permanent right-to-left shunt remains unknown. MethodsBetween March 2006 and October 2010, we enrolled 180 (mean age 44 ± 10. 9 years, 98 women) of 320 consecutive patients referred to our center for transcatheter PFO closure, who had spontaneous permanent right-to-left shunt on transcranial Doppler and transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography. All patients fulfilled the standard current indications for transcatheter closure and underwent preoperative transesophageal echocardiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging, with subsequent intracardiac echocardiographic-guided transcatheter PFO closure. We compared the clinical echocardiographic characteristics of these patients (Permanent Group) {{with the rest of}} 140 patients with right-to-left <b>shunt</b> <b>only</b> during Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva Group). ResultsCompared with the Valsalva Group patients, patients of the Permanent Group had increased frequency of multiple ischemic brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, previous recurrent stroke, previous peripheral arteries embolism, migraine with aura, and—more frequently—atrial septal aneurysm and prominent Eustachian valve. The presence of permanent shunt confers the highest risk of recurrent stroke (odds ratio: 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 0 to 12, p < 0. 001). No differences were recorded between the 2 groups with regard to recurrence of ischemic events after the closure procedure.

BMC Veterinary Research 2012, 8 : 112 doi: 10. 1186 / 1746 - 6148 - 8 - 112 Published: 11 July 2012 Abstract (provisional) Background An inherited {{basis for}} congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (EHPSS) {{has been demonstrated}} in several small dog breeds. If in general both portocaval and porto-azygous shunts occur in breeds predisposed to portosystemic shunts then this could indicate a common genetic background. This study was performed to determine the distribution of extrahepatic portocaval and porto-azygous shunts in purebred dog populations. Results Data of 135 client owned dogs diagnosed with EHPSS at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University from 2001 ? 2010 were retrospectively analyzed.

Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by multipoint pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) /cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of 100 -microns (n = 6 dogs) or 1, 000 -microns (n = 6 dogs) glass beads to triple baseline Ppa were given and again 20 min after 5 mg/kg hydralazine in all the animals. Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique in each of these experimental conditions. Embolization increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts (by 6 mmHg) and the slopes (by 5 mmHg. l- 1. min. m 2) of the linear Ppa/Q plots, together with an 80 % angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction. These changes were not significantly different in the two subgroups of dogs. However, arterial PO 2 was most decreased after the 100 -microns beads, and arterial PCO 2 was most increased after the 1, 000 -microns beads. Both bead sizes deteriorated the distribution of ventilation (VA) /perfusion (Q) ratios, with development of lung units with higher as well as with lower than normal VA/Q. Only 100 -microns beads generated a <b>shunt.</b> <b>Only</b> 1, 000 -microns beads generated a high VA/Q mode and increased inert gas dead space. Hydralazine increased the shunt and decreased the slope of the Ppa/Q plots after 100 -microns beads and had no effect after 1, 000 -microns beads. We conclude that in embolic pulmonary hypertension, Ppa/Q characteristics are unaffected by embolus size up to 1, 000 microns.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A histologic {{study of}} {{cerebrospinal}} fluid tracers in Sprague-Dawley rats undergoing lumboperitoneal shunt insertion in the excitotoxic animal model of posttraumatic syringomyelia (PTS). OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effects}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion from the subarachnoid space on perivascular flow (PVS) and syrinx formation in posttraumatic syringomyelia. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In an animal model of PTS, fluid enters syringes from the subarachnoid space via perivascular spaces. Preferential PVS flow occurs {{at the level of the}} syrinx. It has been suggested that arachnoiditis predisposes to posttraumatic syringomyelia formation by obstructing subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid flow and enhancing perivascular flow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated using the CSF tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the excitotoxic model of PTS, and lumboperitoneal shunt insertion. Five experimental groups consisted of normal controls, syrinx <b>only</b> and <b>shunt</b> <b>only</b> controls, and <b>shunt</b> insertion before or after syrinx formation. In all groups except normal controls, CSF flow studies were performed 6 weeks after the final intervention. Grading scales were used to quantify HRP staining. RESULTS: All excitotoxic model animals formed syringes. Perivascular flow was greatest at the level of the syrinx. Cerebral cortex perivascular flow was significantly reduced after shunt insertion in animals with a syrinx (P < 0. 05). Shunt insertion did not alter syrinx length or size. There were no significant differences between shunt and syrinx first groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing caudal subarachnoid space compliance with a shunt does not affect local CSF flow into the spinal cord and syrinx. These results suggest that localized alterations in compliance, as opposed to obstruction from traumatic arachnoiditis, may act as an important factor in syrinx pathogenesis...|$|R

Also the peak flow velocities at the aortic and the pulmonary ends of the shunt vessels were measured by Doppler echocardiography and the ratio of these values was calculated for each shunt.

We have evaluated this approach by comparing measurements of valvular regurgitation made by this technique with (a) angiographic estimates in patients with mitral and aortic regurgitation, and with (b) direct flowmeter measurements of aortic regurgi tation in dogs with experimentally produced lesions (1 â€” 3). In this study, we evaluate the potentiality of this technique for the detection, location, and quantification of left-to-right shunts with RV or LV diastolic volum...|$|R
