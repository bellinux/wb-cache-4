5|$|Due to {{the civil}} war, Mongalla had {{suffered}} considerable physical neglect and damage, and population loss. In April 2006 the President of <b>Southern</b> <b>Sudan,</b> Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla {{as one of the}} Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated. He warned that demands for reconstruction spending would be much greater than available funding, so work had to be prioritized.|$|E

5|$|Eventually a rift {{developed}} between Amin and Obote, {{exacerbated by the}} support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in <b>southern</b> <b>Sudan</b> and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote {{took control of the}} armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.|$|E
5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The {{result was a}} victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Sudan</b> Federal Party competed in the election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, {{when it became clear}} that the party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of <b>Southern</b> <b>Sudan,</b> Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{seems to}} have been {{acquired}} from a number of sources. Gold probably came from Sasu (<b>southern</b> <b>Sudan),</b> as well as more nearby Ethiopian sources, though the latter isn't well documented for the north. A gold trade from the southern areas of Ethiopia such as the medieval province/kingdom of Innarya has been attested from the 6th century (i.e. from the writings of Cosmas Indicopleustes) and continued through James Bruce's day (18th century). Gold also came from more northerly sources such as Gojjam, Beja lands, and what is now Eritrea, though the latter two are less certain. However, a recent gold exploration assay in Eritrea has found significant gold deposits at Emba Derho, and deposits are also attested at Zara in central-western Eritrea.|$|E
5|$|The Lelwel {{hartebeest}} {{is listed}} as Endangered, and numbers have declined greatly since the 1980s, when its population was over 285,000. It was formerly distributed mainly in the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, northern and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo and <b>southern</b> <b>Sudan.</b> Fewer than 70,000 individuals are left. Most of the population nowadays is found in Chad in the Salamat region and the Zakouma National Park (Chad), the National Park population benefiting from improved protection and seeing an increase in population since the 1980s; Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park and Bamingui-Bangoran National Park and Biosphere Reserve in the Central African Republic, where the populations have been falling; Rumanyika Orugundu Game Reserve and Ibanda Game Reserve in Tanzania; and Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda.|$|E

5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in <b>southern</b> <b>Sudan</b> increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
