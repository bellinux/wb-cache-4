40|$|Abstract. New uvby data {{collected}} of AN Lyn {{together with the}} reanalysis of old data establish that this star is a multiperiodic pulsator. Three independent frequencies (ν 1 = 10. 1756, ν 2 = 18. 1309 and ν 3 = 9. 5598 cd − 1) and some interactions between them {{are found to be}} present in the light curve. Changes in amplitude with a large time scale are confirmed for the main frequency. Moreover, changes in amplitude are also present for the <b>secondary</b> <b>frequencies,</b> especially for ν 3. After subtraction of the <b>secondary</b> <b>frequencies</b> from the light curves, the classical O-C method has been used to analyse the behaviour of the main period. A comparison is made between AN Lyn and the other two known δ Sct stars with atypical light curves, i. e., V 1719 Cyg and V 798 Cyg. New uvby data have been also collected for V 1719 Cyg and the O-C method has been used to analyse the behaviour of the main period. It is found that the main pulsation of this star can be well described by means of a linear ephemeris with a period of P= 0. d 26729700 over the last eighteen years. Finally, analysis of the different data sets available in the literature do not reveal significative changes in the amplitude of the main frequency of V 1719 Cyg...|$|R

Commercial HVAC chillers may be well positioned to provide <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> regulation as a demand side resource. Commercial 200 ton (703 kWth) chillers serving two buildings in the Boston area are used to experimentally develop a practical closed-loop controller that modifies chiller power demand to provide <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> regulation. In the first setup, a physical controller is connected directly to the chiller and adjusts power through chilled water setpoint. In the second setup, both the chiller and air handling units are controlled through the BAS. Demonstrations using standard electric system operator test routines show the chiller power response to exceed qualification requirements while providing up to +/- 25 % of chiller nameplate power in <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> regulation capability. The controller is further demonstrated to provide <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> regulation continuously for several hours longer than the standard test routines, during which building cooling load changes significantly. Analysis of results indicate minimum power and variable COP as two factors that could be incorporated into future models to more accurately reflect observed chiller transient behaviour and predict performance. BAS communication delays, ramp rate limits, and compressor cycling are additional factors that can have significant negative impacts on controller performance. Extrapolation of experiment results to higher-level analysis indicates that chillers {{can contribute to the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> regulation requirements at the grid level in aggregate, although potential varies greatly depending on climate and building type. There is more potential in the south, where 21 % of <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> regulation requirements might be met with chillers; the contribution of chillers in colder climates is minimal. Short-term power balance to achieve stability is essential for the operation of the modern electrical power system. Providing stability through modified control of existing HVAC chillers in commercial buildings is a technologically feasible alternative to existing solutions and can make a meaningful contribution to the electrical grid. by Po-An (Leo) Su.

A new design of an actuator was designed and tested which can achieve a wide range velocity of without frequency dependence, is free of oscillating components as well as free of <b>secondary</b> <b>frequencies</b> and therefore can be scaled up easily, unlike a traditional synthetic jet. The actuator can achieve {{a considerable amount of}} jet vectoring, thus aligning the disturbance with the leading edge shear layer. Results indicate that unsteady mini-jet actuation is an effective actuation device capable of increasing the lift in the stall region of the airfoil. Moreover, pressure measurements showed that two parameters could be altered to maximize the lift. The momentum coefficient needed a minimum value to exert influence and the actuating frequency need not be at exact the natural shedding frequency to improve the lift and can be operated at harmonics of the natural shedding frequency and obtain improvements...|$|R

The second building produced less positive results due to communication delays associat ed with a modified setup and due to less favorable chiller characteristics, such as ramp-rate limitations and compressor cycling.

This paper deals with an alternative method of providing <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> control called rapid-start (RS). It consists in assigning a regulation band to several offline units (RS units) which are capable of being started and connected rapidly, therefore allowing the online units to function more closely to their nominal power. RS units have commonly been used for peaking generation and for tertiary control reserve, and have been rarely used for secondary control reserve. As RS operation may have economic benefits, since it allows for better dispatch of the other units in the control area, an appropriate algorithm to start up an RS unit needs to be developed. This paper proposes a machine learning based system (MLBS) to be employed {{in the decision to}} start up an RS unit while being used to provide <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> control. The decision-making procedure is carried out by a decision tree.

It consists in the destabilization of a primary wave and the spontaneous emission of two secondary waves, of lower frequencies and different wave vectors.

In order to implement a distributed control approach, local controllers should share their data over a data communication network whose structure is not necessarily the same as the physical power network.

In this work, we first derive stability condition for the distributed <b>secondary</b> <b>frequency</b> control that is composed of two parts; one part coming from dynamics of the individual generation units, and the other part from the structure of data communication network.
