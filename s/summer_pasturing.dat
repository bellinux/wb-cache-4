It was founded in 1991 and is a training school for students of archaeology and anthropology. Since 1991, several thousand students from 21 countries have come to Achill to study and participate in ongoing excavations. The school is involved in a study of the prehistoric and historic landscape at Slievemore, incorporating a research excavation at a number of sites within the deserted village of Slievemore. Slievemore is rich in archaeological monuments that span a 5,000 year period from the Neolithic to the Post Medieval. Recent archaeological [...] research suggests the village was occupied year-round at least as early as the 19th century, though it is known to have served as a seasonally occupied booley village by {{the first half of the}} 20th century. A booley village (a number of which exist in a ruined state on the island) is a village occupied only during part of the year, such as a resort community, a lake community, or (as the case on Achill) a place to live while tending flocks or herds of ruminants during winter or <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing.</b> Specifically, some of the people of Dooagh and Pollagh would migrate in the summer to Slievemore and then go back to Dooagh in the autumn. The summer 2009 field school excavated Round House 2 on Slievemore Mountain under the direction of archaeologist Stuart Rathbone. [...] Only the outside north wall, entrance way and inside of the Round House were completely excavated.|$|E
50|$|The {{village has}} been a minor tourism {{destination}} since 1891 when 30 to 40 guests stayed in homes that were empty due to the <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing.</b> Today there are hotels and about 20 rental properties with about 500 beds. The Pisten ski slopes opened in 1974 {{with the construction of}} the Skilift Junker. In the 1980s there were a record 50,000 lodger-nights per year, while in the 2000s it has dropped to about 30,000. The valley is firstly known for mountain climbing on the limestone peaks of the Rätikon mountain range of which nearby Sulzfluh hosts Via Ferrata in its southern face that was opened in 2005. Non climbers go skiing, ski touring or hiking along the whole of the impressive Rätikon mountains. Even though the first impression from the St. Antönien side would not seem to allow this, it is nevertheless possible to reach some of the summits on mountain paths without climbing.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1500s {{there was}} already a {{difference}} between the forest Sami and the fell Sami. The forest Sami remained in the lowlands in <b>summer,</b> <b>pasturing</b> their reindeer in bogs, while the fell Sami moved their herds high onto the fells, above the tree line, for summer pasturage. At that time, the forest Sami were called granlappar ("Spruce Lapps"). As a result of this cultural divide, the two groups were subject to different forms of taxation. In 1585 Olof Andersson Burman, a government liaison to the Sami (lappfogde) in Luleå and Piteå, wrote: De säges vara granlappar som utgöra skatt om året bland vildvaror /,/ fiskeskatt som är gäddor, sik, abborre. Men de andra som ingen fisk ränta förmältes i årliga längden kallas fjällappar, havande det namnet därav att de bo uppe i fjällen uti bergsskrevor, och komma till inga sjöar med mindre deras nabor granlapparna vele godvilligt efterlåta dem fiska med sig.

30|$|Marked herbage offer {{differences}} were observed between the Chinese and Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture.</b> Compared to the Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture,</b> higher water availability due to higher amounts of snow melt water and spring precipitation {{were likely to}} foster plant growth on the Chinese <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> during the late spring, the period immediately preceding <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> utilization. For 2013 and 2014, the average cumulated precipitation before <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> utilization amounted to 71  mm in China and 32  mm in Mongolia (Figure  1). These data imply that the Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> suffered from low soil moisture contents in the late spring/early summer season; in addition, very low average daily air temperatures before the utilization period was of − 11  °C in Mongolia as compared with only − 2  °C in China (Figure  1) and was delaying vegetation growth (Yiruhan et al. 2014). Additionally, strict regulations at the Chinese <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> (that is, limited animal numbers and restricted access to the pastures {{until the end of}} the main flowering period) may have favoured herbage production.|$|R
30|$|At the <b>summer</b> <b>pasture,</b> high herbage {{yields and}} nutritive values allow the {{fattening}} of livestock {{and the maintenance}} of milk production (used for processing cheese and butter for the winter; Behnke et al. 2011). The <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> at the alpine belt are characterized by a delayed snow melt which retards vegetation growth and therefore prolongs the availability of young vegetation, similar in quality to the spring pastures (Bauer et al. 2011). In addition, the Umbrisols prevailing in the <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> in both countries are relatively rich in organic carbon and nutrients, favouring high herbage yields and high CP concentrations (Fernández-Giménez and Allen-Diaz 2001; Schönbach et al. 2012), which was particularly true for the Chinese <b>summer</b> <b>pasture.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Storlien was mostly used by Norwegians for hunting, fishing and <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing.</b> The village was first settled in 1844, and late in the 19th century began its development into a tourist centre. The Central Line opened in 1882, and the physician Ernst Westerlund opened a summer practice there in the same year. A few years later, two hotels opened. Thanks to its easily accessible high mountain terrain and railway station, Storlien soon became a centre for the activities of the outdoor activities organisation Skidfrämjandet. In 1924, on the initiative of female instructors, they held a four-day course in [...] "modern ski technique" [...] at Storlien in collaboration with the Swedish Ski Delegation and the Swedish Tourist Association. The instructor was Gunnar Dyhlén, who taught different ways to turn the skis, and the course is thus also considered the starting point for organised Alpine skiing in Sweden. At New Year's in 1931, the first slalom course in Sweden, Möllers Backe, was spontaneously cleared on the mountain slopes of Skurdalshöjden. In 1933 Prince Gustaf Adolf and Princess Sibylla received as a wedding gift from Skidfrämjandet a holiday cabin which is still owned by the royal family.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{potential}} synergies and trade-offs between housing and management factors for {{different aspects of}} animal welfare is essential for farmers who aim to improve the level of welfare in their herds. The aim {{of this research was}} to identify and compare housing and management factors associated with prevalence of lameness, prevalence of lesions or swellings, prevalence of dirty hindquarters, and frequency of displacements (social behavior) in dairy herds in free-stall housing. Seven observers collected data regarding housing and management characteristics of 179 Dutch dairy herds (herd size: 22 – 211 cows) in free-stall housing during winter. Lame cows, cows with lesions or swellings, and cows with dirty hindquarters were counted and occurrence of displacements was recorded during 120 min of observation. For each of the four welfare indicators, housing and management factors associated with the welfare indicator were selected in a succession of logistic or log-linear regression analyses. Prevalence of lameness was associated with surface of the lying area, <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing,</b> herd biosecurity status, and far-off and close-up dry cow groups (P < 0. 05). Prevalence of lesions or swellings was associated with surface of the lying area, <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing,</b> light intensity in the barn, and days in milk when the maximum amount of concentrates was fed (P < 0. 05). Prevalence of dirty hindquarters was associated with surface of the lying area, proportion of stalls with fecal contamination, head lunge impediments in stalls, and number of roughage types (P < 0. 05). Average frequency of displacements was associated with the time of introducing heifers in the lactating group, the use of cow brushes, continuous availability of roughage, floor scraping frequency, herd size, and the proportion cows to stalls (P < 0. 05). Prevalences of lameness and of lesions or swellings were lower in herds with soft mats or mattresses (odd ratio (OR) = 0. 66 and 0. 58, confidence interval (CI) = 0. 48 – 0. 91 and 0. 39 – 0. 85) or deep bedding (OR = 0. 48 and 0. 48, CI = 0. 32 – 0. 71 and 0. 30 – 0. 77) in stalls, compared with concrete, and in herds with <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing</b> (OR = 0. 68 and 0. 41, CI = 0. 51 – 0. 90 and 0. 27 – 0. 61), compared with zero-grazing. Deep bedding in stalls was negatively associated with prevalence of dirty hindquarters (OR = 0. 50, CI = 0. 29 – 0. 86), compared with hard mats. It was concluded that some aspects of housing and management are common protective factors for prevalence of lameness, lesions or swellings, and dirty hindquarters, but not for frequency of displacements...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{development}} of summer activities in the high-altitude zone of the southern French Alps between the Neolithic and the Middle Ages. During these periods, there was enormous variety in the nature of high-altitude activity in these valleys. The Bronze Age witnessed the establishment of the first stone-built pastoral structures at 2200 m and above. This marked an important change in the engagement with this landscape, with high-altitude <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing</b> emerging as a new activity. The Iron Age and Roman era are characterised by a dearth of archaeological structures, but continued palaeoecological signals for pastoral (and possibly mining) activity. The medieval periods saw a substantial increase in activity; a combination of pastoralism and mining, with some large high altitude settlements created which imply the wholesale summer movement of communities from valley-bottom to the high altitude zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} and sustainable management of alpine summer pastures has been stated {{as a goal}} in Swiss national law since 1996, and direct payments from the state for <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing</b> have been tied to sustainability criteria since 2000. This reflects the increasing value of the alpine cultural landscape as a public good. However, provision of this public good remains {{in the hands of}} local farmers and their local common pool resource (CPR) institutions for managing alpine pastures. These institutions are increasingly struggling to maintain their institutional arrangements, particularly regarding the work needed to maintain the pastures. This paper examines two cases of local CPR institutions for managing alpine pastures in the Swiss Canton of Grisons that manifest different institutional developments in light of changing conditions. The differences in how these institutions reacted to change and the impacts this has had on the provision of the CPR are explained by focusing on relative prices, bargaining power, and ideology as drivers of institutional change that are often neglected within common property research.

40|$|In the European Alps {{many high}} {{mountain}} grasslands which were traditionally used for <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing</b> and hayinghave been abandoned during recent decades. Abandonment of mown or grazed grasslands causes {{a shift in}} vegetation compositionand thus a change in landscape ecology and geomorphology. Alpine areas are very fragile ecosystems and are highly sensitive tochanging environmental conditions, which can affect the geomorphic regime of these high energy environments. The effect of landuse intensification on erosion rates is well documented, whereas the effect of land abandonment on erosion rates is still discussedcontroversially, particularly in relation to its short-term and long-term consequences. Generally, an established perennial vegetationcover improves the mechanical anchoring of the soil and the regulation of the soil water budget, including run-off generation anderosion. However, changing vegetation composition affects many other above- and below-ground properties like root density,diversity and geometry, soil structure, pore volume and acidity. Each combination of these properties {{can lead to a}} distinct scenarioof dominating surface processes. The study of soil properties along a chronosequence of green alder (alnus viridis) encroachment onthe Unteralptal in central Switzerland revealed that shrub encroachment changes soil and vegetation properties towards an increaseof resistance to run-off related erosion processes, but a decrease of slope stability against shallow landslides.

30|$|Herders also {{explained}} that shortage of land {{was not only}} in terms of private land to accommodate and feed the animals in winter but also because their <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> were being occupied by Bjobsd (alpine yak herders) in winter, necessitating cattle to be moved further south. <b>Summer</b> <b>pastures</b> for cattle become winter pastures for the yaks.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the high}} herbage offers, herbage {{allowances}} were lowest on the <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> {{as a result}} of the relatively high density of herds during summer, leading to high stocking rates. The herbage quality on the <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> was relatively high primarily due to the occurrence of Allium sp. and Polygonum alpinum at the Chinese site and Artemisia sp. at the Mongolian site. At the Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture,</b> the high occurrence of grazing weeds (such as Carex duriuscula) indicated a strong anthropo-zoogenic influence {{as a result of}} intense pastoral utilization (Fernández-Giménez and Allen-Diaz 1999, 2001; Fujita and Amartuvshin 2013). The data from the Mongolian <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> revealed that both quality and quantity of herbage were not sufficient to adequately fatten livestock and help them recover from live weight losses experienced during winter. This highlights the importance of the Mongolian autumn pasture for livestock production and health.|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{fertiliser}} (farmyard manure), covers partially {{the nutrient}} elements demand of the vegetation cover. However, its application is difficult {{as regards the}} unknown concentration of fertilising elements contained and their biological availability for the plants, the important volumetric masses to manage and the general uneven land application. An inaccurate management of farmyard manure may cause groundwater pollutions with sometimes serious consequences, {{especially in the case}} of karst aquifers. The objective of this research was to specify various aspects of the farmyard manure cycle. It consists of three major parts: a general study of the difficulties related to the farmyard manure management in mountainous regions with the aim to provide practical recommendations to reduce the risk of groundwater contaminations, the evaluation of an alternative method of pig farming in liberty the study of the impacts of agricultural activities on the surface- and groundwater quality. Based on the analysed farmyard manure managements, the following practical recommendations have been made: split up the land application, but concentrate the input of nutrient elements in spring, during the period of plant growth. For sanitary reasons, a delay of at least 1 month has to be respected between the last land application and the beginning of pasture; collect in adequate installations all agricultural effluents which potentially cause water pollution, except if they are spread out immediately. minimise the production of fertiliser by the following two possibilities: infiltrate low contaminated waste water (from the roof, spring, eventually from the farm) reduce the time the animals stay in the stable. An alternative method of pig farming in liberty has been tested in the field. 25 pigs have been raised on a field of ca. 2 ha, representing a density of 0. 71 LiveStock Unit/ha/y, respectively 0. 18 LSU/ha/m during 4 months. Amongst others, the study has considered the impacts of pig pasture on the environment (vegetation cover, soil) and the animals health. The most important impact is in fact the destruction of the vegetation cover, with its direct repercussions on the botanical diversity and the concentration of nutrients in the soil. The experiment has made evident the importance to keep the vegetation cover intact, in order to adsorb the nutrient elements in the manure. An advantageous method to reduce the impacts on the vegetation cover is to equip the pigs with nose-rings. It is furthermore necessary to altemate the pasture parks in order to enable the vegetation to recover (2 to 3 different parks). The important impacts observed around the pig feeding through can be avoided by two ways: first, by changing the throughs placement during the pasture period or second, by the construction of a concrete place and the collection of the manure in the slurry pit. For the pasture of pigs in liberty one has to chose grasslands with thick soils of good quality but avoid oligotrophic ones. Cattle sheds and feeding through have to be placed in a manner to favour a maximum dispersion of the animals. Two hydrogeological observation networks, composed of 6 springs, 7 rivers and one lake, have been installed in order to study the potential contamination by pathogenic bacteria (Listeria, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Salmonella). No salmonella have been found, but several other species have been identified in the water samples of the different study sites: Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, C. fetus Listeria monocytogenes (sv 1 / 2 a, 1 / 2 b, 4 b), L. ivanovii ivanovii (sv 5) Yersinia intermedia, Y. frederiksenii, Y. enterocolitica, Y. kristensenii, Y. pseudotuberculosis. The most frequently identified species in the studied sites is C. jejuni. It has been isolated in 75 % of the sites, with an average percentage of isolation of 11 % of' the spring samples, 22 % of the river and 56 % of the lake samples. L. monocytogenes has been isolated several times in 9 of the 14 sites. It is less abundant than C. jejuni, except in the analysed springs. The presence of C. jejuni and L. monocytogenes 4 b has shown to be closely related to the <b>summer</b> <b>pasturing</b> period. Other germs, like L. monocytogenes 112 a and yersinias show a uniform annual distribution. The presence of bacteria in surface and groundwater is controlled by several factors, of which the presence of animals, precipitation and temperature have been identified to be the most conclusive ones. In case of source contamination, the factors controlling the presence or absence of pathogen bacteria are different for the case of surface and groundwater: In the first case, the influences of the hydroclimatological conditions are dominant, whereas in the second case it is controlled mainly by the local hydrogeological characteristics. In case of aquifers with interstitial porosity (Clos Ister, Confluent), the presence of pasturing anirnals is however the controlling factor. The persistence of a contamination is controlled by the storage capacity of the catchment basin and by the relation of seep water to the aquifer total volume. In the Brassus spring case, the presence of animals on the catchment area can not explain by itself the bacteriological findings. The presence of the found pathogen bacteria can however be explained by their transport by the run-off rain. The presence of pathogen germs and bacterial pollution indicators has been analysed in a comparative study. Result: 2. 3 % of the samples contained pathogen germs without containing bacteriological contamination indicator. The species found in the absence of bacterial pollution indicators, are rare species, showing a monotonous annual occurrence. They have been found only in low concentration and the danger when drinking this contaminated water was very small. That means the bacterial pollution indicators choice presently used for water bacteriological quality evaluation is accurate. However, they should be tested with high flow levels, when bacteriological contaminations are particularly important...|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{reindeer}} grazing and {{the increase}} of other land use forms have caused {{a decline in the}} amount of arboreal (Alectoria, Bryoria spp.) and reindeer (Cladina spp.) lichens in the Finnish reindeer management area during the last few decades. Supplementary feeding of reindeer has increasingly compensated for the lack of natural winter fodder. The amount of the supplementary feeding and {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> should therefore have an increasing effect on the productivity of reindeer stock. In order to outline better the present carrying capacity problems on pastures in the Finnish reindeer management area we focused some of the most important productivity factors of Finnish reindeer stock from 1993 to 1999. The results showed that the productivity of reindeer stock in Finland was dependent especially on two main elements: amount of reindeer feeding and reindeer densities on <b>summer</b> <b>pastures.</b> Winter pastures had no clear effect on productivity when analysing the entire management area. High productivity figures in reindeer stock (calf production, carcass mass and meat production per reindeer) were reached in the management districts where winter feeding was the most abundant, reindeer densities relatively low and <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> abundant. An increase in reindeer density on <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> raised meat production per total <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> area but decreased carcass mass of reindeer calves and meat production per reindeer. It seems that the fundamental factor for keeping the reindeer stock productivity sustainable at a high enough level is to optimize the longterm reindeer densities on <b>pastures.</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>pastures</b> may gradually become a limiting factor for reindeer stock productivity in some areas if overgrazed and decreased winter pastures are only compensated for by winter feeding of reindeer.  </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present state}} of {{reindeer}} winter and <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> in northern Finland has been mapped using field sampling, remote sensing, and GIS. The winter pasture inventory was made during 1995 – 96 and the <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> inventory during 1997 – 98. Winter pastures {{can be divided into}} ground lichen and arboreal lichen pastures. Autumn pastures, including pastures with grasses, dwarf shrubs, and mushrooms, were also mapped and added to the inventory of winter <b>pastures.</b> <b>Summer</b> and winter <b>pastures</b> partly overlap, but the main pasture areas are clearly distinct from each other. Major summer feeding areas are marshes, mires and river meadows, and mountain birch woodland. Biomass data were obtained by volumetric calculations of lichens and standard samples of the green parts of summer fodder plants. The results show that the most abundant lichen resources are found {{in the northern part of}} the management area, while the most abundant <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> resources prevail in the middle and southern parts. The overall accuracy of the winter pasture mosaic is 88 %, with a Kappa coefficient of 0. 84.

40|$|The {{practice}} of transhumance of livestock herds to Alpine <b>summer</b> <b>pasture</b> has experienced pronounced changes over recent decades {{due to the}} general process of agricultural intensification in productive areas and abandonment of farming in marginal areas. Instead of moving lactating cows to <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> raising replacement heifers recently gained much importance. Here, we analysed {{the impact of these}} changes in dairy farming on butterfly diversity inhabiting Alpine <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> in the eastern Italian Alps. We sampled butterflies (Lepidoptera) in 16 Alpine <b>summer</b> <b>pastures</b> that were either grazed by lactating cows (n = 11) or replacement heifers (n = 5) at two distances from the farm building. Butterflies were classified according to their mobility. Our results showed a distance effect on total butterfly species richness only in pastures grazed by lactating cows indicating a stronger impact on vegetation structure and composition nearby the farm building. Abundance of butterflies was higher with increasing distance from the farm building. In contrast to mobile butterflies, sedentary species reacted more strongly to disturbance induced by grazing livestock. Moreover, butterfly composition differed slightly between pastures grazed by lactating cows and heifers. Our results indicate that the widespread adoption of heifer grazing induces a shift in butterfly diversity and composition likely caused by the different behaviour of grazing livestock. In order to benefit butterfly diversity in Alpine <b>summer</b> <b>pastures,</b> we suggest that future agri-environment schemes should provide extra support for summer farming of lactating cows...|$|R
