5000|$|Karen Arnold (Olivia d'Abo): Kevin's older, hippie sister. Her free-spirited ways {{clash with}} her {{overbearing}} <b>father's</b> <b>conservatism,</b> and she depends upon her mother as a mediator. When Karen moves {{in with her}} boyfriend Michael (David Schwimmer) during her freshman year of college, she has a falling out with her father. The pair marry one year later and move to Alaska, where Michael has secured a good job. Karen ultimately accepts some of her parents' viewpoints and has a baby, while her husband learns to support his wife and child.|$|R

6000|$|Thenceforth Lydia had {{a growing}} sense of the power she had unwittingly been {{acquiring}} during her long subordination. Timidly at first, and more boldly as she became used to dispense with the parental leading-strings, she began to follow her own bent in selecting subjects for study, and even to defend certain recent developments of art against her <b>father's</b> <b>conservatism.</b> He approved of this independent mental activity on her part, and repeatedly warned her not to pin her faith more on him than on any other critic. She once told him that one of her incentives to disagree with him was the pleasure it gave her to find out ultimately that he was right. He replied gravely: ...|$|R
5000|$|Elected Governor of Vermont, Proctor served from October 4, 1906 to October 8, 1908. [...] As governor, rejecting his <b>father's</b> fiscal <b>conservatism,</b> he {{declared}} that the state had [...] "a higher duty than to live cheaply." [...] Proctor advocated progressive forestry policies, reorganized Vermont's courts and reformed the commission that regulated utilities and railroads.|$|R

5000|$|France {{supported}} the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, overthrew their own monarchy, with {{the cry of}} [...] "Liberté, égalité, fraternité". The bloodbath that followed, known as the reign of terror, soured many people {{on the idea of}} liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the <b>fathers</b> of <b>conservatism,</b> wrote [...] "The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world." ...|$|R
50|$|Father Rene Van de Walle {{a member}} of the Society for Biblical Studies in India was {{associated}} with the revision of the Marathi Bible. <b>Similarly,</b> <b>Father</b> Lucien Legrand was associated with the inter-confessional translation in Tamil language. With this background, the Society systematically built up a pool of Biblical Scholars who specialised in Old Testament with Biblical Aramaic and Biblical Hebrew and also New Testament with Biblical Greek. The Scholars include Yisu Das Tiwari, B. E. Devaraj, C. Arangaden, Victor Premasagar, E. C. John, K. V. Mathew, M. P. John, John Philipose, Gnana Robinson, G. Babu Rao, Timotheas Hembrom, N. K. Achumi, Basil Rebera, S. John Theodore and others.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences in interactions between mothers and fathers with their infants. Videotaped segments of parent-infant dyads (thirty mothers and thirty fathers) were examined. Four interaction areas were looked at specifically [...] (1) respect for autonomy/cognitive growth fostering, (2) quality of instruction, (3) enthusiasm for interaction with parent/responsiveness to parent, and (4) task orientation. These interactions were chosen from reviews of past literature that showed mothers to be more task oriented and fathers to be more playful. A fifth factor, warmth, was also explored. It was found that parents differed significantly on task orientation, with infants being more oriented when working with their mothers. <b>Similarly,</b> <b>fathers</b> were found to score higher on the scale for warmth...|$|R
50|$|Mstivoj's {{daughter}} Tove married Harald Bluetooth {{and raised}} the Sønder Vissing Runestone in memory of her mother. Another daughter, Hodica, was abbess of the monastery at the Mecklenburg. Mstivoj also had a son, Mstislaw, often being confused with his <b>similarly</b> named <b>father.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{one of the}} few Democrats in the then-overwhelmingly Republican community, he was {{nominated}} to be East Lansing postmaster at the beginning of Woodrow Wilson's presidential administration in 1913. <b>Similarly,</b> his <b>father</b> had been appointed postmaster in Milan by the previous Democratic president, Grover Cleveland.|$|R
50|$|In 1868, Ward {{was elected}} the first President {{of the newly}} formed Oxford Constitutional Association. He {{became known as the}} <b>father</b> of modern <b>Conservatism</b> in Oxford.Ward was also a leader in the Oxford Movement. He donated the land in Jericho for the {{building}} of St Barnabas' Church in 1869.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} fertility on parental labor-force participation in a developing country. In order to address the potential endogeneity in the fertility decision, I exploit Albanian parental preference for having sons as an exogenous source of variation. Using a repeated cross-section, I find that having an additional child has a positive and statistically significant effect on parental labor-force participation. IV estimates for mothers show that they increase labor supply, {{especially in terms of}} hours worked per week and the likelihood of working off-farm. <b>Similarly,</b> <b>father's</b> likelihood of working off-farm and having a second occupation increase as a consequence of further childbearing. The heterogeneity analysis suggests that this positive effect might be the result of two plausible mechanisms: childcare provided by non-parental adults in extended families and greater financial costs of feeding more children...|$|R
5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} imagine that if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the <b>father</b> of modern <b>conservatism.</b>|$|R
40|$|Edmund Burke {{is thought}} of as the {{founding}} <b>father</b> of modern <b>conservatism</b> and has been cited as a source of inspiration for the government’s ‘big society’ agenda. Ben James Taylor traces his intellectual legacy and its relation to government policies, noting how strongly evident his model of paternalism is in today’s Tory party...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wearing}} of newborns in particular, the mothers' {{oxytocin}} levels are increased through the physical contact with the infant, leading to a more intimate maternal bond, easier breastfeeding and better care, thus lowering the incidence of postpartum depression and psychosomatic illness in the mother; <b>similarly,</b> the <b>father</b> carrying the baby has benefits for the paternal bond.|$|R
50|$|Also, Karamzin is {{sometimes}} considered a founding <b>father</b> of Russian <b>conservatism.</b> Upon appointing him a state historian, Alexander I greatly valued Karamzin's advice on political matters. His conservative views were clearly expounded in The Memoir on Old and New Russia, written for Alexander I in 1812. This scathing attack on reforms proposed by Mikhail Speransky {{was to become}} a cornerstone of official ideology of imperial Russia for years to come.|$|R
5000|$|By {{going back}} in time, Sarah Jane meets her infant self and young father, just as Rose Tyler had done in [...] "Father's Day". Also <b>similarly,</b> their {{respective}} <b>fathers</b> voluntarilly die in automobile collisions to correct the timeline.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Ridley's The Young Disraeli was published, {{dealing with}} Benjamin Disraeli's early years. She {{disputes}} {{that he should}} be considered the <b>father</b> of one-nation <b>conservatism,</b> writing that [...] "Disraeli didn't use the expression and nor did he want to create a classless society... The legend of Disraeli was created largely by the Conservative party, which needed a hero on whom to pin its ideas about making the party electable in a democracy." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1750s, {{the palace}} was {{refurbished}} by Bartolommeo di Capua. He commissioned from Francesco de Mura, frescoes for the ballroom, recalling {{the exploits of}} his <b>similarly</b> named <b>father</b> in battles with King Charles VII of Naples (Charles III of Spain). At the 1744 Battle of Velletri, Bartolomeo the elder sacrificed his life by providing the King with a horse. The work was heavily damaged by bombardment during 1942. Other paintings inside are allegorical scenes (1765) by Giovanni Battista Maffei.|$|R
5000|$|Roman Catholics (and many Protestants) {{view the}} first day as a day for {{assembly}} for worship (2178, [...] ), but consider a day of rigorous rest not obligatory on Christians ( [...] , [...] ). Catholics count the prohibition of servile work as transferred from seventh-day Sabbath to Sunday (2175-6), but do not hinder participation in [...] "ordinary and innocent occupations". <b>Similarly,</b> second-century <b>father</b> Justin Martyr believed in keeping perpetual Sabbath by repentance, holding that Gentile Christians need not rest as Jews were commanded; but he accepted extant non-Judaizing seventh-day Sabbatarian Christians [...] "in all things as kinsmen and brethren".|$|R
50|$|Vuetasau never succeeded to his uncles {{title as}} he drowned in 1857 whilst in an {{expedition}} with Tongan Chief Enele Ma'afu. His eldest son Ratu Tevita Uluilakeba II would in time succeed {{to the title}} Roko Sau, but would <b>similarly</b> like his <b>father</b> share a premature death never succeeding to the title Tui Nayau.|$|R
50|$|<b>Similarly</b> to his <b>father,</b> Denis became {{chairman}} of Arsenal football club in 1962, a job which he held {{until his death}} in 1982. A bust of Hill-Wood was commissioned and used to stand inside the Directors' Landing of the East Stand of Arsenal's Highbury stadium, and now stands in the Directors' Entrance of Emirates Stadium after Arsenal's move there.|$|R
25|$|John Huston {{was born}} on August 5, 1906, in Nevada, Missouri. He was {{the only child of}} Rhea (née Gore) and Canadian-born Walter Huston, {{originally}} Walter Houghston. His father was an actor, initially in vaudeville, and later in films. His mother initially worked as a sports editor for various publications but gave it up after Huston was born. <b>Similarly,</b> his <b>father</b> gave up his stage acting career for steady employment as a civil engineer, although he returned to stage acting within a few years. He would later become highly successful on both Broadway and then in motion pictures. He had Scottish, Irish, English and Welsh ancestry.|$|R
50|$|His {{traditional}} training {{had taught}} him to seek inspiration from classical sculpture but, <b>similarly</b> to his <b>father</b> Pasquale, the most important characteristic of Raffaello’s work is its realism: he sought to portray with great accuracy his subject matter, looking to replicate natural states of being. He drew inspiration from scenes of everyday life and often picked his models from the local people residing in the studio’s neighbourhood.|$|R
50|$|The daughter's and mother's arms {{represent}} {{the two parts}} of a seat belt. The film was made for a British audience; cars are driven on the left hand {{side of the road}} in the UK and so the positioning of the mother's arms reflects the position of the upper seat belt strap for a driver in the UK. <b>Similarly,</b> the <b>father</b> turns the wheel to the left (the shoulder part of the road in the UK) to avoid the oncoming danger. If the film was shown in mirror image, it would correct these apparent inconsistencies for audiences in those parts of the world where cars are driven on the right hand side.|$|R
50|$|<b>Similarly</b> to his <b>father</b> Hor-Aha, Djer {{was buried}} in Umm el-Qa'ab at Abydos. Djer's tomb is tomb O of Petrie. His tomb {{contains}} the remains of 318 retainers who were buried with him. During later times, the tomb of Djer was revered as the tomb of Osiris, and the entire First Dynasty burial complex, which includes the tomb of Djer, was very important in the Egyptian religious tradition.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2015 Chris put {{a picture}} of himself and his 2 year old {{daughter}} in a bathtub together on Facebook. This resulted in a widely reported controversy by various media outlets, many of whose analysts thought that nudity or naturism between {{a father and a}} daughter is inappropriate. Chris responded by saying that [...] "Children and adults are allowed to be naked together. If we could not bear to see each other naked, we would feed / be born with clothes on (...). Nakedness with your child is not disgusting, but natural". The incident would resurface in subsequent moments and stories about <b>similarly</b> clothless <b>fathers.</b> Torben Chris subsequently stated that one of his motivations for his actions were to confront what he views as widespread prudishness surrounding the human body in Danish society.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{departure}} of the CFC International Council from the GK Board, Archbishop Oscar Cruz of the Lingayen-Dagupan archdiocese instructed the clergy and lay people in his area to withdraw from GK activities, because through this development, GK has disconnected itself with the Catholic Church and opened itself up to ties with organizations whose policies contradict Church teachings. This call was <b>similarly</b> made by <b>Father</b> Gammy Tulabing, a priest writing for The Negros Chronicle.|$|R
50|$|The nearly 17-year-old Prudence Friedman (Léa Seydoux) is {{struggling}} to cope with her mother’s death and her <b>father,</b> <b>similarly</b> upset, has now been in Canada much longer than the 48 hours it should’ve taken to settle his client’s inheritance. Over the phone, Prudence keeps up the pretence {{that she and her}} sister are living together in the family apartment but, in reality, Frédérique has moved out, unable to handle the painful memories of their mother’s death there.|$|R
5000|$|Jules Brown (voiced by Josh Keaton) - Verne's elder brother. His {{middle name}} is Erastosthenes. Unlike younger brother Verne, Jules is {{intelligent}} {{for his age}} and, <b>similarly</b> to his <b>father,</b> uses long words in his everyday vocabulary. He calls Marty McFly [...] "Martin". Jules is top of the class in his school; however, he is not very popular and has but a few friends. He has a crush on his classmate Franny Philips and enjoys baseball and inventing.|$|R
50|$|Leonor {{finally left}} the convent in 1777, {{when she was}} twenty-seven years old, at the orders of the newly {{acclaimed}} Queen Maria I, who sought to reverse all the policies and actions of the Marquis of Pombal, whom she despised. <b>Similarly,</b> her <b>father</b> and brother were released from Belém Tower and the two branches of the family reunited. The family's former palaces, {{the envy of the}} Portuguese nobility, had been destroyed by order of the Marquis of Pombal, and thus the family moved to the Quinta of Vale de Nabais, outside of Lisbon, which they renamed Quinta of Alorna. Though reduced from their previous standing, the family quickly rose in the Portuguese court and nobility. Leonor rapidly became a personality of the aristocracy, her intelligence and charm having captivated the nobles who expected a girl ruined by a forced convent life.|$|R
50|$|Some have {{suggested}} Oistin {{is the same}} person as Thorstein the Red, a figure who features in the Norse sagas. However, this is problematic since Thorstein {{is said to have}} died in Scotland after conquering much of the country, whereas Oistin {{is said to have been}} killed in Ireland in 875 by Albann (i.e. Halfdan). <b>Similarly,</b> Oistin's <b>father</b> Amlaíb is sometimes identified with Olaf the White, a Viking sea-king who also features in the sagas and is named as the father of Thorstein the Red. The sagas are of dubious historical value, but the figures featured within may be based on real people. To get around the problem whereby Oistin and Thorstein die in different places in different circumstances, but keeping the identification of Amlaíb with Olaf the White, it has been proposed that Oistin and Thorstein were brothers.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a summary}} of the history of Ecuador from 1860-1895. Gabriel García Moreno is the <b>father</b> of Ecuadorian <b>conservatism</b> and no doubt the most {{controversial}} figure in the nation's history, condemned by Liberal historians as Ecuador's worst tyrant but exalted by Conservatives as the nation's greatest nation-builder. In the end, both appraisals may be accurate; the man who possibly saved Ecuador from disintegration in 1859 and then ruled the nation with an iron fist for the subsequent decade and a half was, in fact, an extremely complicated personality. Born and raised under modest circumstances in Guayaquil, he studied in Quito, where he married into the local aristocracy, then traveled to Europe {{in the aftermath of the}} 1848 revolutionary uprisings and studied under the eminent Catholic theologians of the day.|$|R
2500|$|Martha Elizabeth Burchfield Richter (June 28, 1924 – April 10, 1977) was an American watercolorist, the {{daughter}} of artist Charles Ephraim Burchfield (1893-1967). <b>Similarly</b> to her <b>father,</b> Burchfield had an affinity for flowering plants, trees and landscapes. She painted almost exclusively with watercolors and is known for her depictions of nature throughout the seasons, and landscapes of rural America. She is known by the customary signature [...] "M. Burchfield" [...] on all her paintings. Including those painted after the change of her surname following her marriage in 1946 to Henry Richter.|$|R
50|$|With the 7th Dragoons, he {{took part}} in the 1882 Egyptian Campaign, serving on Lord Kitchener's staff as brigade major to the cavalry in the Army of Occupation at Egypt. Banks saw action at Massawa, where (<b>similarly</b> to his <b>father</b> at the Battle of Inkerman) he had his horse shot from under him. He also {{took part in}} the Moonlight Charge at Kassassin during the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. For his part, he {{received}} the Egypt Medal (1882-1889), and the Turkish awards of the Khedive Bronze Star and the Order of the Medjidie, 5th Class.|$|R
