5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} {{prior to the}} Norman invasion, England's great estates, owned by the king, bishops, monasteries and thegns, had been slowly broken up as a {{consequence}} of inheritance, wills, marriage settlements or church purchases. Most of the smaller landowning nobility lived on their properties and managed their own estates. The pre-Norman landscape had seen a trend away from isolated hamlets and towards larger villages engaged in arable cultivation in a band running north–south across England. These new villages had adopted an open field system in which fields were divided into small strips of land, individually owned, with crops rotated between the field each year and the local woodlands and other common lands carefully managed. Agricultural land on a manor was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage and cultivate directly, called demesne land, and the majority of the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants, who would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through cash or produce. Around 6,000 watermills of varying power and efficiency had been built in order to grind flour, freeing up peasant labour for other more productive agricultural tasks. The early English economy was not a <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> and many crops were grown by peasant farmers for sale to the early English towns.|$|E

25|$|Exports declined, and the {{domestic}} economy was depressed. The only segment that expanded was the <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy.</b> Resources (land, slaves, and transport animals) made idle by {{the decline of}} the export economy were absorbed into mostly self-consumption activities.|$|E

50|$|Another {{aspect of}} the macro-environment is the {{economic}} environment. This refers to the purchasing power of potential customers {{and the ways in}} which people spend their money. Within this area are two different <b>economies,</b> <b>subsistence</b> and industrialized. <b>Subsistence</b> <b>economies</b> are based more in agriculture and consume their own industrial output. Industrial economies have markets that are diverse and carry many different types of goods. Each is important to the marketer because each has a highly different spending pattern as well as different distribution of wealth.|$|R
25|$|Great {{economic}} disparities {{existed between}} {{different areas of}} the country, with the north and east being relatively highly developed, rich and involved in export of goods, whereas much of the west was roadless, hardly developed and had a cashless <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> with a growing dependence on the potato as the main food supply.|$|E
25|$|The diet of the {{inhabitants}} of El Paraíso consisted of a mix of domesticated and gathered resources. El Paraíso had a rather simple <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy.</b> There is a high amount of non-domesticated foods found in the archaeological record, which supports that there were sufficient resources that could be hunted or collected. Wild plants such as the roots of sedges, groundcherry and cat tails may have accounted for {{a substantial portion of}} the diet. More than 90% of their protein came from marine resources, predominantly bony fishes and molluscs. Based on minimum number of individuals (MNI) results, the bony fishes mainly consisted of anchovies and the most common molluscs were mussels. There is almost a complete absence of terrestrial fauna found at El Paraíso. The predominance of marine resources may have prevented any need for a complex agricultural <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy.</b> Cotton was cultivated to provide nets for fishing as well as clothing for {{the inhabitants}} of El Paraíso showing a prominence in industrial agriculture in subsistence strategies.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{province}} continued to grow. In 1914, the last spike {{of a second}} transcontinental rail line, the Grand Trunk Pacific, linking north-central British Columbia from the Yellowhead Pass through Prince George to Prince Rupert was driven at Fort Fraser. This opened up the North Coast and the Bulkley Valley region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> soon became a locus for forestry, farming, and mining.|$|E

40|$|In <b>subsistence</b> <b>economies</b> {{with general}} convex {{technology}} and rational optimising agents, a new, axiomatic approach is developed, which allows an explicit {{analysis of the}} core positive and normative intuitions behind the concept of exploitation.

Then, the main results of Roemer's (1982, 1988) classical approach and all the crucial insights of exploitation theory are generalised, proving that every agent's class and exploitation status emerges in the competitive equilibrium, {{that there is a}} correspondence between an agent's class and exploitation status, and that the existence of exploitation is inherently linked to the existence of positive profits.

25|$|The {{action was}} brought {{as a test}} case to {{determine}} the legal rights of the Meriam people {{to land on the}} islands of Mer, Dauar and Waier in the Torres Strait, which were annexed to the state of Queensland in 1879.

Land on the islands was not subject of public or general community ownership, but was regarded as belonging to individuals or groups.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 1832, the Regent, Peter IV of Portugal, {{elevated}} {{the settlement of}} Corvo {{to the status of}} village and municipal seat. Until this time Corvo had been under the jurisdiction of Santa Cruz das Flores, as a civil parish of its neighbor across the channel. And after 1853, the foral (the town's royal charter) granted to the dual jurisdiction was extinguished, resulting in a liberal movement, where tenant farmers were able to raise their cattle and till their own lands, marking out a <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> that supported porting ships.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure a}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy,</b> the Muisca {{irrigated}} their lands and varied their cultivation over different climatic zones. The {{geography of the}} area allowed for micro-ecological regions providing farmlands on the fertile plains and in higher altitude terrains such as mountain slopes. Quinoa and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) were cultivated on the highest altitudes, maize and coca in the temperate regions and yuca, arracacha, pineapples, tobacco and cotton in the low-lying valleys with a warmer climate. Additionally, Cucurbita maxima, Oxalis tuberosa (oca), peppers and Ullucus tuberosus were cultivated by the Muisca. The surplus of the agricultural production was available for trading on the many markets throughout the Muisca territories.|$|E

50|$|Dahrendorf {{argues that}} {{societies}} are quite considerably {{different from each}} other, and that any one set of economic policies will not be equally well adapted to all societies (e.g. the same policies will not work as well in poor, <b>subsistence</b> <b>economies</b> as they will in advanced industrial economies). The Dahrendorf hypothesis was developed in opposition to many traditional perspectives and theories in economics, most notably neoclassical economics, which implicitly or explicitly hold that one set of economic policies should be implemented globally and universally.|$|R
25|$|Similarly {{to other}} groups of {{immigrant}} Jews who made aliyah to Israel, the Ethiopian Jews have faced obstacles in their integration to Israeli society. Initially the main challenges of the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel were {{due in part to}} communication difficulties (most of the population could not read or write in Hebrew, and much of the veteran population could not hold a simple conversation in the Hebrew language), discrimination in certain areas of the Israeli society, manifestations of racism from some parts of the Israeli society. Unlike Russian immigrants, many of whom arrive with job skills, Ethiopians came from a <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> and were ill-prepared to work in an industrialized society.|$|E
25|$|Rome {{went from}} a {{population}} of 800,000 {{in the beginning of}} the period to a population of 30,000 by the end of the period, the most precipitous drop coming with the breaking of the aqueducts during the Gothic War. A similar though less marked decline in urban population occurred later in Constantinople, which was gaining population until the outbreak of plague in 541. In Europe there was also a general decline in urban populations. As a whole, the period of late antiquity was accompanied by an overall population decline in almost all Europe, and a reversion to more of a <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy.</b> Long-distance markets disappeared, and there was a reversion to a greater degree of local production and consumption, rather than webs of commerce and specialized production.|$|E
25|$|The Caribbean sugar boom {{brought about}} a steady decline in world sugar prices. Unable to compete, Brazilian sugar exports, which had peaked by the mid-seventeenth century, {{declined}} sharply. Between {{the fourth quarter of}} the seventeenth century and the early eighteenth century, Portugal had difficulties in maintaining its American colony. The downfall of sugar revealed a fragile colonial economy, which had no commodity to replace sugar. Paradoxically, however, the period of stagnation induced the settlement of substantial portions of the colony's territory. With the decline of sugar, the cattle sector, which had evolved to supply the sugar economy with animals for transport, meat, and hides, assimilated part of the resources made idle, becoming a <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy.</b> Because of extensive cattle production methods, large areas in the colony's interior were settled.|$|E
50|$|Halibut {{are often}} boiled, deep-fried or grilled while fresh. Smoking is more {{difficult}} with halibut meat than it is with salmon, due to its ultra-low fat content. Eaten fresh, the meat has a clean taste and requires little seasoning. Halibut is noted for its dense and firm texture.Halibut have historically been an important food source to Alaska Natives and Canadian First Nations, {{and continue to be}} a key element to many coastal <b>subsistence</b> <b>economies.</b> Accommodating the competing interests of commercial, sport, and subsistence users is a challenge.|$|R
50|$|The {{gender roles}} and {{responsibilities}} in <b>subsistence</b> <b>economies</b> of Sub-Saharan Africa are dynamic and change with new economic situations. One of the important change noted {{in the first decade}} of 21st century is increased participation of women in agriculture as men migrate to work outside of agriculture. For example, in Kenya, Jolou women in the 1980s performed more tasks that were originally considered ‘male’ tasks. Also when men move to non-farm activities, women become more involved in cash cropping. As a result, the gender division of labor by crop and tasks becomes less rigid.|$|R

25|$|The {{economy of}} Tanana Athabaskans {{is a mixed}} cash-subsistence system, like other modern {{foraging}} economies in Alaska. The <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> is main non-monetary economy system. Cash is often a rare commodity in foraging economies, {{because of lack of}} employment opportunities or perceived conflicts in the demands of wage employment and subsistence harvesting activities. The primary use of wild resources is domestic. Wild resource use in many Athabaskan villages is overwhelmingly for domestic consumption, since commercial fishing in Alaska is absent. Commercial fishing and trapping patterns are controlled primarily by external factors. The state's limited entry system, operational by 1974 (after ANCSA), limits the number of available fishing permits for commercial salmon (esp. the Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus species for salmon cannery) fishing. In Nenana, about one-third of households have a permit. Most (70%) sample households with a permit used. Those with a permit that did not fish commercially, did fish for subsistence.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture was {{introduced}} to the region around 400 AD to the present. Poor soil and the unreliability of rainfall reduced the viability of agriculture as a reliable subsistence pattern. Throughout the course of the occupation of Chibuene, the inhabitants practiced a broad <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> with the utilization of domestic animals, marine fauna, and wild plant life to augment agricultural production. Of particular significance to the site was the distinctive emphasis on marine fauna in the diets of the inhabitants. The 1995 excavations from a Swedish sponsored team revealed a rather high proportion of fish remains in comparison to sites in South Africa. The faunal remains of shark and turtle were notable features of the site. Shark fishing and turtle hunting are subsistence strategies more associated with East African, or Swahili coast, sites beginning in the first millennium, revealing a closer affinity of Chibuene to sites further north than the southern interior.|$|E
25|$|Solon's {{economic}} reforms {{need to be}} understood {{in the context of}} the primitive, <b>subsistence</b> <b>economy</b> that prevailed both before and after his time. Most Athenians were still living in rural settlements right up to the Peloponnesian War. Opportunities for trade even within the Athenian borders were limited. The typical farming family, even in classical times, barely produced enough to satisfy its own needs. Opportunities for international trade were minimal. It has been estimated that, even in Roman times, goods rose 40% in value for every 100 miles they were carried over land, but only 1.3% for the same distance were they carried by ship and yet there is no evidence that Athens possessed any merchant ships until around 525 BC. Until then, the narrow warship doubled as a cargo vessel. Athens, like other Greek city states in the 7th Century BC, was faced with increasing population pressures and by about 525 BC it was able to feed itself only in 'good years'.|$|E
30|$|Pastoralism {{is one of}} {{the primary}} sources of {{livelihood}} for mountain and rural communities throughout the world (Bagchi et al. 2004; Kreutzmann 2012; Ning et al. 2016; Wangchuk et al. 2013, 2013; Wiener et al. 2003), particularly in developing countries. In Asia, transhumant pastoralism is the mainstay of <b>subsistence</b> <b>economies</b> in temperate and alpine zones (Bagchi et al. 2004). In the Himalaya mountain regions, millions of pastoralists depend on the natural pasture resources. Pastoralism is a subsistence living pattern through livestock herding (Blench 2001; IFAD 2009). Yaks and yak-cattle hybrids are the dominant livestock species raised by the Himalayan mountain communities.|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} {{to the use of}} ceramics was not a swift transition. In fact, evidence shows that ceramic use was slowly applied and may have come after specialized <b>subsistence</b> <b>economies.</b> For instance, shell middens in Usenge 1 and Pundo show low ceramic density. Even more, non-ceramic artifacts, such as bone points, indicate that other material culture linked to specific activities and economies existed before ceramics. Nonetheless, even if the {{transition to}} ceramic use was slow and part of a process of change, by the Early Kansyore Phase, 5648-5299 cal. BC, it became a central part of the economy.|$|R
