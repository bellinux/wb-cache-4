During the natural cycle of illumination, egg hatching is rhythmical where most larvae emerge a few hours after dawn.

To do this, the levels of total immunoglobulin M, several enzymes and proteins (peroxidase, lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, esterases, proteases and antiproteases), as well as the bactericidal activity against opportunist fish pathogens (Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio angillarum, Photobacterium damselae) and non-pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis) were measured in the <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> and compared with those found in the serum.

40|$|Short-term (48 h) {{exposure}} of healthy Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. smelts to infectious salmon anemia (ISA) -inoculated cohort smelts {{showed that the}} disease was transmitted with near 100 % mortality from Day 7 post-inoculation and onwards. This {{is more than a}} week before the inoculated fish show any clinical signs and long before the typical petechial bleedings occur. A bloodborne transmission of the disease is therefore unlikely. <b>Skin</b> <b>mucus,</b> faeces, urine and blood, isolated from ISA-inoculated smelt, transmitted the disease to healthy cohort smelt with variable efficiency depending on how the inoculum was administered. All the sources were infectious and transmitted the disease with high efficiency when injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) into cohort smelt. After i. p. injection, <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> had somewhat lower infectivity than blood homogenates. Furthermore, in some experiments application of <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> to the gills was as efficient as i. p. injection for transmission of the disease. When introduced into the stomach none of the inocula caused ISA.

This indicates that the infectious agent is waterborne and absorbed by the <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> rather than being secreted with the <b>skin</b> <b>mucus.</b> Since healthy smelts have an intact skin barrier, proximity to inoculation directly to the vascular bed seems unlikely. An ultrastructural study of 10 different organs, all in close proximity to the secretions/excretions, revealed that at early stages of the disease, the virus was exclusively found in the pillar cells and endocardial cells.

Terminal carbohydrate composition and levels of total IgM antibodies, several immune-related enzymes (lysozyme, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, esterases, proteases and antiproteases) as well as the bactericidal activity (against fish pathogenic Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio angillarum, Photobacterium damselae and non-pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Shewanella putrefaciens) were identified and measured in the <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> of five marine teleosts: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa), common dentex (Dentex dentex) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus). First, lectin binding results suggests that <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> contain, in order of abundance, N-acetylneuraminic acid, glucose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and fucose residues. Second, results showed that while some immune activities were very similar in the studied fish (e. g. IgM and lysozyme activity) other such as protease, antiprotease, alkaline phosphatase, esterase and peroxidase activities varied depending on the fish species. High levels of peroxidase and protease activity were found in U. cirrosa respect to the values obtained in the other species while E. marginatus and S. aurata showed the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase and esterase activities, respectively. Moreover, <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> of S. aurata revealed higher bactericidal activity against pathogenic bacteria, contrarily, to what happened with non-pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, B. subtilis).

40|$|Abstract Cyprinid {{herpesvirus}} 3 (CyHV- 3) is the aetiological {{agent of}} a mortal and highly contagious disease in common and koi carp. The skin {{is the major}} portal of entry of CyHV- 3 in carp after immersion in water containing the virus. In the present study, we used in vivo bioluminescence imaging to investigate the effect of <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> removal and skin epidermis lesion on CyHV- 3 entry. Physical treatments inducing removal of the mucus up to complete erosion of the epidermis were applied on a defined area of carp skin just before inoculation by immersion in infectious water. CyHV- 3 entry in carp was drastically enhanced on {{the area of the}} skin where the mucus was removed with or without associated epidermal lesion. To investigate whether <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> inhibits CyHV- 3 binding to epidermal cells, tail fins with an intact mucus layer or without mucus were inoculated ex vivo. While electron microscopy examination revealed numerous viral particles bound on the fins inoculated after mucus removal, no particle could be detected after infection of mucus-covered fins.

The present study demonstrates that <b>skin</b> <b>mucus</b> removal and epidermal lesions enhance CyHV- 3 entry in carp.
