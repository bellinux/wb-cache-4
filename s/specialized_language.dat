In 1967 he wrote the first bill giving federal support to bilingual education, creating <b>specialized</b> <b>language</b> instruction for immigrant populations. As Chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, he led a successful campaign to restore $15 million in funding the low-cost health programs for senior citizens and an expanded public housing program for seniors. In 1982 he worked to preserve the Meals on Wheels program and veterans' preferences in hiring. In the early 1980s, against the wishes of many of his own constituents, he argued for expanded funding for AIDS research.|$|E
500|$|Consistent with German-Nordic {{heraldry}}, {{the most}} common charges in Swedish heraldry include lions and eagles. Additional animals that frequently appear in Swedish heraldry include griffins and (especially in the northern provinces) reindeer. Stars are common and are usually depicted with six points and straight sides, {{in contrast to the}} Gallo-British tradition, which typically depicts stars as either a five-pointed straight-sided star (mullet) or as a six-pointed wavy-sided star (estoile). In Swedish, these stars are usually described as [...] "six-pointed stars" [...] (sexuddig stjärna). In terms of blazoning, Swedish heraldry is described in plain terms using common Swedish language, rather than using <b>specialized</b> <b>language</b> such as Blazon. Canting arms occur frequently.|$|E

40|$|In Hungarian {{tertiary}} education {{the teaching of}} <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> and terminology traditionally belonged to professional training. The period of reforming higher education in Hungary (starting from the mid- 1990 s) coincided with the international boom in the application and theoretical revival of terminology. Terminology entered into higher education as an independent discipline, and in certain countries even as an independent major. Hungary joined this revival when we launched the MA in terminology. The talk aims to show how and at what fields the teaching of terminology and <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> appears in Hungarian university education, and what the most important theoretical and methodological questions are. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} fifty years, sociolinguistic {{relevance}} of specialized discourse has increased greatly so as {{to contribute to the}} evolution both of standard italian as well as literary one. In this book, typical features of scientific and professional languages such as historical continuity, constant updating and international dimension are shown in detail through morphosyntactic, lexical and textual properties of four main linguistic and disciplinary areas: science, medicine, economy and law. In the digital era, <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> are used by experts as well as lay people through a wider and wider range of communication channels and type of texts, so that linguistic forms of popularization and didactics also are several and various. These distinctive features and their highly dynamic linguistic profile make <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> being so flourishing and fascinating...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There {{is a huge}} {{gap between}} agent {{programming}} languages used for industrial applications and those developed in academia. While the former are mostly extensions of mainstream programming languages (e. g. Java), the latter are often very <b>specialized</b> <b>languages,</b> based on reactive rules. These <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> enjoy clear semantics and come {{with a number of}} knowledge repre-sentation features, but lack important aspects such as code re-use, modularity, encapsulation etc. We present a method to extend the syntax of existing specialized agent oriented programming languages to allow more efficient hierarchical structuring of agent programs. We illustrate our method through a simple language based on reac-tive rules. We then gradually extend the core language by several higher level syntactic constructs, thus improving the support for source code modularity and readability. ...|$|R

40|$|Assuming that {{translation}} {{is necessary in}} all <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> for either informative or even persuasive purposes {{as well as for}} popularizing objectives, this contribution considers the translation needs of two types of <b>specialized</b> <b>languages,</b> legal English and English for business and management. Their requirements, strictly connected with their specific discourse communities, are analysed {{from the point of view}} of a linguist involved in an interdisciplinary scientific group, which represents a particular situation in non-literary, non-linguistic faculties. In this context, the jurists’ needs seem to be more concerned with definitory, terminological issues, whereas in business the distribution of information and textual organization prevail. Evidence is given that, in the two sectors taken into consideration, activities such as translation and re-writing apply different strategies at a pragmatic and textual level, also in view of possible intercultural implications.      <br /...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{analysis}} of the Romanian e-commerce terminology, taking into consideration that the English language has had {{a major role in the}} linguistic globalization of the <b>specialized</b> <b>languages.</b> Therefore, e-commerce does not make an exception because its terminology is used worldwide and, concerning the Romanian e-commerce terms, we distinguished both the use of partial loan translations and full loan translations which make up fixed collocations, as special means of expressing the e-commerce terminology in Romanian. Furthermore, members of The Panlatin Network of Terminology have collaborated and made glossaries for various <b>specialized</b> <b>languages.</b> We gave examples of terms from The Panlatin Glossary of e-commerce, underlining that their conceptual equivalence is expressed in many ways, both in Italian and Romanian. This aspect leads to synonymy, because a “terme vedette” was not enforced. e-commerce terminology, loan translation, fixed collocations, concept, conceptual equivalence...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we argue}} that the methods of formal knowledge representation, especially description logics, first, are valuable tools for analyzing existing configuration systems and open problems in configuration systems research, second, should be used by developers {{in order to make}} clear statements about the performance of their systems, and third, can even directly be used for building practical systems. As a case study we analyze two languages dealing with knowledge-based configuration in technical domains. The paper demonstrates that <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> (e. g. object-oriented languages developed for configuration problems) can be interpreted as a special purpose description logic. It is demonstrated that the construction or configuration process can be "simulated" by a modelconstructing satisfiability prover. The constructed logical model represents the artifact to be designed. We also show a methodology for describing the meaning of <b>specialized</b> <b>languages</b> by applying synta [...] ...|$|R
