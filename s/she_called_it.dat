500|$|The {{sociologist}} Eileen Barker {{reviewed the}} book for The British Journal of Sociology. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> an [...] "impressive tome (it weighs 5 lb)" [...] and [...] "a comprehensive, beautifully laid out and illustrated reference book covering the amazing variety of animal social behaviour". She noted that the final section on [...] "Man" [...] contained [...] "several surprises for most sociologists", and that the book should counter [...] "many of the naive inferences that have recently been made about man's evolutionary heritage." ...|$|E
500|$|Karen Rought of Hypable {{considered}} The House of Hades as [...] "one of {{the most}} gripping tales Riordan has written in his Percy Jackson world." [...] She liked {{the development of the}} relationship between Percy and Annabeth during her journey in Tartarus and was surprised with the direction taken by some characters. Finally, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "the darkest book in the Heroes of Olympus series." [...] Kirkuss analysis highlighted the portrayal of Tartarus as a [...] "hellish, monster-infested landscape," [...] as well as the development of the characters, making moments of jokes rarer.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{disliked the}} episode, {{writing about it}} in a review for TrekNation. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "clichéd, {{predictable}} and boring", saying that the sudden differences in characterization in this episode, compared to how those characters acted in earlier appearances, could potentially lead to confusion as to when they were actually controlled by the aliens. She criticized the plot which only affected the senior crew members on the ship and said that it had [...] "ripped off" [...] several prior episodes of the franchise including [...] "The Empath", [...] "" [...] and [...] "".|$|E

Though Stefani had wanted to work with Kanal, she was concerned that his work would not fit with her dance-oriented album; however, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> her [...] "favorite track that [...] written so far", and the two worked on the track, modeling it after hip hop trio Salt-n-Pepa.|$|E
500|$|Just as {{they had}} done in Cheltenham, the Butlers began {{providing}} shelter {{in their own home}} for some of the women, often prostitutes in the terminal stages of venereal disease. It soon became clear that there were more women in need than they could provide for, so Josephine set up a hostel, with funds from local men of means. By Easter 1867 she had established a second, larger home, in which more appropriate work was provided, such as sewing and the manufacture of envelopes; the [...] "Industrial Home", as <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> was funded by the workhouse committee and local merchants.|$|E
500|$|On the New Directions {{collaboration}} with Sue on [...] "Sing", Futterman wrote, [...] "By turning down {{the rock and}} bringing in a choral element, the song actually came off as a great anthem for the bunch of misfits that is the New Directions.

[...] Although Gonzalez gave the performance a [...] "B", <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "lacking" [...] and not [...] "regionals material": [...] "We need to be blown away."

500|$|DeHavilland and Joan Fontaine are {{the only}} {{siblings}} to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category. A lifelong rivalry between the two actresses resulted in an estrangement that lasted over three decades. DeHavilland has lived in Paris since 1956, and celebrated her 100th birthday on July 1, 2016. In June 2017, two weeks before her 101st birthday, de Havilland was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to drama.

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{questioned}} why The WB made a TV show {{based on}} a cancelled, poorly-sold comic and criticized the [...] "uttering tired, condescending lines" [...] professed by Virgil. Nancy Imperiale Wellons from the Orlando Sentinel said [...] "Virgil has a believable relationship with his family -- including a strong father figure -- but the show's pacing lags." [...] Paul Schultz wrote for the New York Daily News that [...] "Many of the characters -- the conservative, the annoying sister -- are cliches." [...] Thelma Adams criticized the show in the New York Post; first <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "formulaic but appealing" [...] and ultimately dubbed it [...] "lame".|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-garde, 1957-1963, {{the piece was}} {{described}} as a [...] "humorous, Cubist abstraction of the currency". Discussing the piece after edition 10 was given to the National Gallery of Australia, critic Jaklyn Babington considered Lichtenstein's early works, including Ten Dollar Bill, to be [...] "intriguing precursors to the artist’s subsequent development". <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "finely hand-drawn lithograph", and considered the work to be [...] "the only hint of Lichtenstein’s imminent obsession with American popular culture". Babington finished by noting, [...] "we see Lichtenstein first taking an everyday object, symbolic of the growing American consumer culture, as his subject matter".|$|E

500|$|Monroe's {{next film}} was Otto Preminger's Western River of No Return, {{which had been}} filmed prior to her {{suspension}} and featured Robert Mitchum as her co-star. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "Z-grade cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process", although it was popular with audiences. The first film she made after returning to Fox was the musical There's No Business Like Show Business, which she strongly disliked but the studio required her to do in exchange for dropping The Girl in Pink Tights. The musical was unsuccessful upon its release in December, and Monroe's performance was considered vulgar by many critics.|$|E
500|$|A chapel {{was added}} {{on the south}} side of the {{building}} in 1664. St Cynfarwy's was largely reconstructed in 1867 under Henry Kennedy, the architect of the Diocese of Bangor. Kennedy's work, which rebuilt the church [...] "almost from the foundations" [...] in the words of a 2009 guide to the buildings of the region, left no datable features. When Llwyd described the church in 1833, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "spacious and handsome cruciform edifice", with transepts on the north and south sides; there is nothing on the north side of the present building apart from the porch in the north-west corner, added by Kennedy in 1867.|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{returned}} to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared {{to her like}} people [...] "in a burning house". Worse, anarchists and other radicals around the world refused to support their cause. The Nationalist forces declared victory in Spain just before she {{returned to}} London. Frustrated by England's repressive atmosphere—which she called [...] "more fascist than the fascists"—she returned to Canada in 1939. Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten, however. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT-FAI, Mariano Vázquez, {{sent a message to}} her from Paris, praising her for her contributions and naming her as [...] "our spiritual mother". <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "the most beautiful tribute I have ever received".|$|E

500|$|The biology teacher Lotte R. Geller, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The American Biology Teacher, thought the book meticulously researched; no one would take exception to its thesis, but {{for the inclusion of}} man. [...] " [...] is well aware of the difficulties this presents." [...] Geller called the last chapter, relating biology to sociology, a [...] "step from scientific study to speculation". In her view, the most controversial and disturbing thing was the call for scientist and humanists to [...] "temporarily" [...] remove ethics [...] "from the hands of the philosophers and biologize" [...] it. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "dangerous to say that biologists should have a monopoly on truth and ethics." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews among television critics. The Los Angeles Times Carina MacKenzie's {{review of}} the episode was largely positive, though <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "immature" [...] of the episode's writers to have the characters in constant battle with one another, and deemed the Mercy West resident's orange scrubs unnecessary. MacKenzie highly praised the characterization of Kepner, in addition to Capshaw's performance, commenting: [...] "Jessica Capshaw has an incredible ability to take even the most melodramatic of Grey's [...] speeches and deliver them with a subtlety and an honesty that makes them come off as sincere instead of overwrought." [...] MacKenzie concluded that Karev, Yang, and Meredith had appropriate reactions to Stevens' departure.|$|E
500|$|Blue Velvet was {{released}} to a polarized reception in the United States. The critics who did praise the film were often vociferous. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin directed much praise toward {{the performances of}} Hopper and Rossellini: [...] "Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best {{understood in terms of}} sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what's called for." [...] <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> [...] "an instant cult classic." [...] Maslin concluded by saying that Blue Velvet [...] "is as fascinating as it is freakish. It confirms Mr. Lynch's stature as an innovator, a superb technician, and someone best not encountered in a dark alley." ...|$|E
