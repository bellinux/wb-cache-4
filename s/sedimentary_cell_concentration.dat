40|$|We {{have succeeded}} in {{developing}} hollow branching structure in vitro commonly observed in lung airway using primary lung airway epithelial <b>cells.</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>concentration</b> gradient is the key factor that determines production of the branching cellular structures, as optimization of this component removes the need for heterotypic culture. The higher <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> leads to the more production of morphogens and increases {{the growth rate of}} cells. However, homogeneous high <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> does not make a branching structure. Branching requires sufficient space in which cells can grow from a high concentration toward a low concentration.

Thus, a high <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> gradient is required to make branching structures. Spatial distributions of morphogens, such as BMP- 4, play important roles in the pattern formation.

Results showed that matric potential {{had a significant effect}} on survival and activity of P. stutzeri P 16 luxAB 4 in soil. P. stutzeri P 16 luxAB 4 could survive better in Hutner’s minimal medium supplemented with 1 mg l- 1 phenanthrene than 1 mg ml- 1. However changes in viable <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> and luminescence activity of lux-marked and wild type strains of P. stutzeri P 16 were significantly different in Hutner’s medium, amended with high and low concentrations of phenanthrene. Inoculation of soil with high concentrations of phenanthrene caused an initial decline in the viable <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> of P. stutzeri P 16 luxAB 4 that took a longer time than liquid medium. Changes in viable <b>cell</b> <b>concentration</b> were similar to changes in luminescence indicating the advantage of Bioluminescence-marker systems for monitoring the survival and activity of biodegradative genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) in polluted environments. Our results also showed the importance of influence of environmental factors such as matric potential and pollutant concentration on the fate of GEMs...|$|R
