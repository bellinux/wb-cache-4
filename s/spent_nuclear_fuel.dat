5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from {{tens of thousands}} to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{has five}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 43% of its electricity around 2007 (34% in 2015). Some Swiss <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> {{has been sent}} for reprocessing in France and the United Kingdom; most fuel is being stored without reprocessing. An industry-owned organization, ZWILAG, built and operates a central interim storage facility for <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> and high-level radioactive waste, and for conditioning low-level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes. Other interim storage facilities predating ZWILAG continue to operate in Switzerland.|$|E

40|$|A {{management}} plan {{was developed for}} Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC) and Pacific Northwest Laboratories (PNL) {{to work together on}} a program to provide characterization data to support removal, conditioning and subsequent dry storage of the <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> stored at the Hanford K Basins. The Program initially supports gathering data to establish {{the current state of the}} fuel in the two basins. Data Collected during this initial effort will apply to all SNF Project objectives.

Characterization of the condition of these materials and their responses to various conditioning processes and dry storage environments are necessary to support disposition decisions. Characterization will utilize the expertise and capabilities of WHC and PNL organizations to support the <b>Spent</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fuels</b> Project goals and objectives.

5|$|Curium {{isotopes}} {{are inevitably}} present in <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> with {{a concentration of}} about 20 g/tonne. Among them, the 245Cm–248Cm isotopes have decay times {{of thousands of years}} and need to be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal.

This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{assessment}} of four sites occurred in 1997–98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto site near two existing reactors, {{and the local}} government approved it in 2000.

The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020.

The short-lived heavier isotopes 238Np and 239Np, useful as radioactive tracers, are produced through neutron irradiation of 237Np and 238U respectively, while the longer-lived lighter isotopes 235Np and 236Np are produced through irradiation of 235U with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron.|$|E

40|$|In 1992, {{the mission}} of the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant was changed from {{reprocessing}} of <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> to development of technologies for conditioning of <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuels</b> and other high-level wastes for disposal in a geologic repository. In addition, the Department of Energy (DOE) directed Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) to develop a program plan addressing the management of radioactive contaminated scrap metal (RSM) within the DOE complex. Based on discussions with the EM- 30 organization, the INEL Metal Recycle program plan was developed to address all issues of RSM management. Major options considered for RSM management were engineered interim storage, land disposal as low-level waste, and beneficial reuse/recycle. From its inception, the Metal Recycle program has emphasized avoidance of storage and disposal costs through beneficial reuse of RSM. The Metal Recycle program plan includes three major activities: Site-by-site inventory of RSM resources; validation of technologies for conversion of RSM to usable products; and identification of parties prepared to participate in development of a RSM recycle business...|$|R

Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix.

5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of <b>spent</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am.

The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides.
