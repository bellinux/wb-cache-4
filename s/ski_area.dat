5|$|Badger Pass <b>Ski</b> <b>Area</b> was {{established}} in 1935. The 9-hole Wawona Golf Course opened in June 1918 in a meadow adjacent to the Wawona Hotel. A golf course was later built near the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite Valley, but was removed and converted into a meadow in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Big Thunder Ski Jumping Centre was a twin {{ski jumping}} hill located in Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. It {{constitutes}} part of Big Thunder National Training Centre. The first hills were built by Knute and Thor Hansen and opened in 1963. They were originally known as Lille Norway <b>Ski</b> <b>Area,</b> then Mt. Norway <b>Ski</b> <b>Area,</b> and Sundance Northwest Resort {{before taking the}} current name. The large and normal hills were built in 1974 and the venue {{was taken over by}} the provincial government in 1985. The hills hosted 29 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and 50 Canadian Ski Jumping Championships tournaments between 1975 and 1995, climaxing with the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1995. Funding was then cut and the venue has since been closed and unmaintained.|$|E
5|$|A small {{downhill}} <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> provided recreation for {{personnel and}} their dependents, {{operating on the}} base from the early 1960s until Loring's closure in 1994. This ski chalet also included a lighted skating rink and {{could be used to}} host events in the area. The base also offered trips to regional ski resorts periodically, and cross country skiing was offered at the local golf course.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} {{there are two}} <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> {{just a few miles}} outside of Lead. Terry Peak and Deer Mountain are both full service <b>ski</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the small}} size of Ontario's <b>ski</b> <b>areas,</b> many 'public' <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> are at least {{partially}} on private land, and many private <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> offer reasonable passes to non-members. This significantly blurs the distinction between a public, and an exclusive and private ski club. The following list is compiled of those areas specifically advertising their private status.|$|R
50|$|The SkiArena Andermatt-Sedrun has 2 schools; {{one for the}} Sedrun <b>skiing</b> <b>area,</b> {{and one for the}} Andermatt <b>ski</b> <b>areas.</b> Each {{have several}} {{different}} classes, based on age and ability.|$|R
5|$|The road {{begins to}} climb again {{over the next}} few miles, passing a county park and finally the small Mount Peter <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> before {{crossing}} the Appalachian Trail along the ridgecrest of Bellvale Mountain. From here it once again drops down and bends in a northsouth direction to reach Greenwood Lake, where NY210 leaves to go {{along the side of the}} lake to the state line.|$|E
5|$|The town of Mammoth Lakes, {{located near}} the {{southern}} end of the chain and Mammoth Mountain, is the largest populated area nearby. Mammoth Mountain <b>Ski</b> <b>Area</b> is located nearby and gondola rides can be taken year-round (weather permitting) to the mountain's summit. The summit of Mammoth Mountain provides panoramic views of the craters and domes of the Mono–Inyo volcanic chain, Mono Lake, the Sierra Nevada and Long Valley Caldera.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} was first identified by Knute Hansen, a ski jumper {{who felt that}} a location in Mount McRae in Lakehead would be ideal for a ski jumping hill. He and Thor Hansen built the first jumps, which were opened in 1963 and named Lille Norway <b>Ski</b> <b>Area.</b> In 1969, after the Hansens had fallen into financial difficulties, the venue was sold and renamed Mt. Norway <b>Ski</b> <b>Area.</b> Additional land for the complex was also leased, and the provincial government provided funding to construct the main twin hill. Construction of the 70meter and 90meter (current K-90 and K-120) hills was completed in 1974. The following year, the venue hosted its first Canadian Ski Jumping Championships. Three years later, the venue was again sold, this time being named Sundance Northwest Resort. In 1981, the Provincial Government of Ontario started redeveloping the site to transform it into a national training center. In 1985, the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Recreation bought the site. In the course of five years, they built a K-64 hill, as well as Little Thunder, which consisted of K-10, K-20 and K-37 hills. The two largest of these were equipped with porcelain in-runs and plastic landing slopes, allowing for their use during summer.|$|E

5|$|An {{hour after}} the {{previous}} event caused destruction in Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant damage in the adjacent state of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a virgin forest known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain <b>Ski</b> <b>Area,</b> every ski lift was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds more trees, and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed by falling trees in Black Rock State Park.|$|E
5|$|For {{the battle}} {{sequence}} in North Africa, two actual Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images {{of them or}} by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little {{was left of the}} original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a <b>ski</b> <b>area</b> in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.|$|E
5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major <b>ski</b> <b>area.</b> It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} end of the bridge, M-26 turns east while US41 turns west into Hancock. M-26 passes through Ripley at the base of the Mt. Ripley <b>Ski</b> <b>Area</b> before turning north to Dollar Bay on the shore of the heavy {{polluted}} Torch Lake. Next are the twin communities of Lake Linden and Hubbell. M-26 forms the main streets of these as it passes north from Hubbell into Lake Linden. The highway then runs back to the west to rejoin US41 in Calumet. US41/M-26 connects with the northern end of M-203 on the north side of town before heading out to Keweenaw County. In the town of Phoenix, M-26 separates from US41 one last time, turning west for a stretch along the northern shoreline of the Keweenaw Peninsula. It passes through the communities of Eagle River (county seat of Keweenaw County) and Eagle Harbor.|$|E
5|$|US-89 {{meets the}} current {{alignment}} of US-91 {{in the southern}} outskirts of Brigham City, turning east for an overlap on the city's southeast bypass. (SR-13 and SR-90 are the former alignment through Brigham City.) The two routes head east up Box Elder Canyon in the southern Wellsville Mountains, finally leaving {{the valley of the}} Great Salt Lake into a small valley that contains Mantua Reservoir (elevation 5200 feet/1585 m). US-89/US-91 turns north there, bypassing the town of Mantua to the west, and continues to ascend through Dry Canyon to Sardine Summit (elevation 5900 feet/1798 m). Another small valley leads to Wellsville Canyon, where the four-lane roadway again turns east and descends into the Cache Valley. In that valley, US-89/US-91 heads northeast, bypassing Wellsville to the east, into downtown Logan. US-91 continues northerly from Logan into Idaho, but US-89 splits to the east, beginning a long climb of the Bear River Range through Logan Canyon. The Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, a Utah and National Scenic Byway, begins at Logan and follows US-89 up the canyon, past the access road to the Beaver Mountain <b>ski</b> <b>area,</b> to Garden City and on to the state line. Bear Lake Summit (elevation 7800ft/2377 m), {{at the top of the}} range, is the highest point on US-89 in Utah, from which it descends the east slope via horseshoe curves to Garden City on the shore of Bear Lake (elevation 5900ft/1798 m). The final segment of US-89 to the Idaho state line follows the lake's west shore, its location constrained by the Bear River Range just to the west.|$|E

The trails are often skied by those that know the area {{as a result of}} their ease of accessibility (only a short hike is required from Taft Slalom to find them). However, in the late 1990s/early 2000s (decade), the state of New Hampshire unveiled plans to purchase the north-northwestern face and use the already-cut trails as an expansion to the current <b>ski</b> <b>area.</b> The purchase was completed in 2008.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts in Serbian <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> are very strong, leading to landscape degradation and functionality losses. Construction or improvement works cause serious destruction of topsoil and native vegetation. Some activities enhance erosion production and sediment yield: clear cuttings; trunk transport down the slope; road construction and large excavations. Also, lack of erosion control works in <b>ski</b> <b>areas,</b> especially between April and October, result {{in various forms}} of land degradation such as furrows, gullies, landslides, or debris from rock weathering. The consequences of mismanagement in <b>ski</b> <b>areas</b> are noticeable in downstream sections of river beds, causing floods and bed-load deposition. Planning and designing activities, with the application of technical and biotechnical erosion control structures, through the concept of restoration, are necessary measures in the protection of <b>ski</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
