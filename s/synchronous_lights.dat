40|$|Firefly is famously {{known for}} the light {{emission}} from its abdominal light organ. Light produce by firefly is known as bioluminescence. Luciferase is the enzyme that catalyze the light emitting reaction that produce bioluminescence. Haematoxylin and Eosin staining were {{used to describe the}} histological structure of the light organ. Localization of luciferase was discovered by immunohistochemical staining with polyclonal anti-luciferase and DAB chromogen as secondary antibody. Microphotography of light organ tissues was taken by Carl Zeiss Axio Scope A 1 photomicroscope. This study revealed that the luciferase enzyme located at the photocyte cytoplasm of photogenic layer. This finding is an initial step to fully understand the regulation of <b>synchronous</b> <b>light</b> production in P. tener...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose is}} to study {{relative}} turbulent diffusion under controlled, reproducible conditions in the laboratory in order to estimate the constant C in Richardson-Obukhov’s law. We get C ≈ 0. 4 – 0. 6. We furthermore measure the distance-neighbour function, which is the probability density function {{of the separation of}} two fluid particles that are initially close to each other. We find that the model proposed by Richardson is far superior to the one suggested by Batchelor. To obtain these results we use the Particle Tracking (PT) technique to measure trajectories of fluid particles in a water tank with two oscillating grids generating turbulence. In the experiments reported here we have obtained Reynolds numbers based on Taylor’s microscale of about one hundred. The PT system, which is also described in this report, consists of four CCD cameras, a <b>synchronous</b> <b>light</b> source and a recording system with two computers each equipped with a frame grabber card. In the search for the best experimental methods we have revised the concep...|$|R

Evaluation of the conspicuity of roadway environments for their environmental impact on driving performance is vital for roadway safety. Existing meters and tools for roadway measurements cannot record light and geome-try data simultaneously in a high resolution. This study introduced a new method that adopted recently devel-oped high dynamic range (HDR) photogrammetry to measure the luminance and XYZ coordinates of millions of points across a road scene with the same device—a camera, and a MatLab code for data treatment and visualization. To validate this method, the roadway environments of a straight and flat section of Jayhawk Boulevard (482. 8 m long) at Lawrence, KS and a roundabout (15. 3 m in diameter) at its end were measured under clear and cloudy sky in the daytime and at nighttime with dry and wet pavements. Eight HDR images of the roadway environments under different viewing conditions were generated using the HDR photogrammetric techniques and calibrated. From each HDR image, <b>synchronous</b> <b>light</b> and geometry data were extracted in Radiance and further analyzed to identify po-tential roadway environmental hazards using the MatLab cod...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary source}} of {{information}} to determine where on the body we are being touched {{is derived from the}} somatosensory system. However, can visual information influence the perceived location of touch on the body? Ten participants localized a brief air puff (about 250 ms) applied to the smooth ventral surface of the right forearm somewhere between wrist and elbow. Localization was measured with a 2 AFC paradigm in which participants judged the location of the tactile stimulus relative to a visual reference using two opposing 1 -up/ 2 -down staircases. Participants’ task was to indicate whether the air puff was closer or further from the wrist relative to the reference. In one condition the visual reference was a line drawn on the forearm midway between elbow and wrist (AIR ONLY). In another, the air puff was accompanied by a temporally synchronous line of laser light projected onto the reference location (AIR+LASER). The experiment was analogous to that of Bertelson and Aschersleben [1], which investigated visual influences on auditory localization. Based on this, we expected the <b>synchronous</b> <b>light</b> to facilitate multimodal integration and therefore affect tactile discrimination performance without introducing a bias. In the AIR ONLY condition the PSE was on average on the reference location. Surprisingly, in the AIR+LASER condition we did not find a change in discriminability relative to the AIR ONLY condition. We found, however, a significant shift of the PSE by 0. 9 cm towards the elbow. This bias was evident in eight out of the ten participants. This demonstration of a visual effect on tactile localization may indicate that judging the location of a visual reference on the body is not free from biases...|$|R
50|$|The nonradiation {{condition}} went {{largely ignored}} for many years. Philip Pearle reviews {{the subject in}} his 1982 article Classical Electron Models. A Reed College undergraduate thesis on nonradiation in infinite planes and solenoids appears in 1984. An important advance occurred in 1986, when Hermann Haus derived Goedeke’s condition in a new way. Haus finds that all radiation is caused by Fourier components of the charge/current distribution that are lightlike (i.e. components that are <b>synchronous</b> with <b>light</b> speed). When a distribution has no lightlike Fourier components, such as a point charge in uniform motion, {{then there is no}} radiation.

40|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} of visible light by a living organism. The light commonly appears as flashes from point sources (involving one or more cells, usually described as photocytes) or as a glandular secretion. A visible flash usually involves <b>synchronous</b> <b>light</b> emission {{from a group of}} cells or, if from a single-celled organism such as a dinoflagellate, from a group of organelles. The number of cells (or organelles) responding synchronously is the main determinant of the flash intensity. Bioluminescence is a common phenomenon in many deep-sea animals and is widespread among the Cnidaria. In this paper, we compare and contrast in situ and laboratory recordings of the bioluminescent responses of specimens of the deep-sea scyphozoans Atolla wyvillei, Atolla vanhoffeni, Atolla parva, Nausithoe rubra, Paraphyllina intermedia, Periphyllopsis braueri and Periphylla periphylla. Displays in all seven species consist of localised flashes and propagated waves of light in the surface epithelium. The first few single waves propagate at rates of up to 60 cm s- 1 but subsequent ones in any sequence of stimuli gradually decrease in speed. After several single wave responses, a subsequent stimulus may elicit multiple waves that persist for several seconds. Following such a frenzy, the specimen becomes temporarily refractory to further stimuli, but if rested will recover its normal responses and may produce further frenzies. The dome area, situated above the coronal groove, of the genera Paraphyllina, Periphylla, and Nausithoe is covered with luminescent point sources. Such point sources are generally absent from the dome of species of Atolla. Captured specimens of A. parva also produce secretory bioluminescence, corroborating prior in situ observations of this ability. Secretory bioluminescence in P. periphylla takes the form of scintillating particles released from the lappet margins. We did not observe secretory displays in specimens of any other species in the laboratory, but one instance of apparent secretory luminescence was recorded in situ in a specimen of A. wyvillei...|$|R

40|$|The Intersensory Redundancy Hypothesis (IRH; Bahrick 2 ̆ 6 Lickliter, 2000, 2002, 2012) {{predicts that}} early in {{development}} information presented {{to a single}} sense modality will selectively recruit attention to modality-specific properties of stimulation and facilitate learning of those properties {{at the expense of}} amodal properties (unimodal facilitation). Vaillant (2010) demonstrated that bobwhite quail chicks prenatally exposed to a maternal call alone (unimodal stimulation) are able to detect a pitch change, a modality-specific property, in subsequent postnatal testing between the familiarized call and the same call with altered pitch. In contrast, chicks prenatally exposed to a maternal call paired with a temporally <b>synchronous</b> <b>light</b> (redundant audiovisual stimulation) were unable to detect a pitch change. According to the IRH (Bahrick 2 ̆ 6 Lickliter, 2012), as development proceeds and the individual 2 ̆ 7 s perceptual abilities increase, the individual should detect modality-specific properties in both nonredundant, unimodal and redundant, bimodal conditions. However, when the perceiver is presented with a difficult task, relative to their level of expertise, unimodal facilitation should become evident. The first experiment of the present study exposed bobwhite quail chicks 24 hr after hatching to unimodal auditory, nonredundant audiovisual, or redundant audiovisual presentations of a maternal call for 10 min/hr for 24 hours. All chicks were subsequently tested 24 hr after the completion of the stimulation (72 hr following hatching) between the familiarized maternal call and the same call with altered pitch. Chicks from all experimental groups (unimodal, nonredundant audiovisual, and redundant audiovisual exposure) significantly preferred the familiarized call over the pitch-modified call. The second experiment exposed chicks to the same exposure conditions, but created a more difficult task by narrowing the pitch range between the two maternal calls with which they were tested. Chicks in the unimodal and nonredundant audiovisual conditions demonstrated detection of the pitch change, whereas the redundant audiovisual exposure group did not show detection of the pitch change, providing evidence of unimodal facilitation. These results are consistent with predictions of the IRH and provide further support for the effects of unimodal facilitation and the role of task difficulty across early development. ...|$|R

Lower bounds on the orbital period (generally exceeding 10 y) have been obtained for 10 more systems. Mira S, SC and (Tc-poor) C stars have also been monitored and show intrinsic radial-velocity variations due to atmospheric phenomena. Tentative orbital solutions are proposed for 3 stars (S UMa, X Cnc, BD- 08 : 1900) where the velocity and photometric periods are different. Three stars (RZ Peg, SS Vir and R CMi) exhibit radial-velocity variations <b>synchronous</b> with the <b>light</b> variations. Pseudo-orbital solutions have been derived for those stars. In the case of RZ Peg, a line-doubling phenomenon is observed near maximum light, and probably reflects the shock wave propagating through the photosphere.

40|$|In {{a single}} {{skeletal}} muscle fibre treated with concentrations of caffeine below threshold for caffeine contracture, rapid lowering of {{the temperature of}} the bathing solution from 18 degrees C to below 5 degrees C induced a contracture (rapid cooling contracture). Intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) was recorded during rapid cooling contracture using aequorin. Low concentrations of caffeine often caused a slight elevation of the light signal in resting muscle without detectable tension. During rapid cooling contracture, the change in light signal occurred in three phases. The first phase was a transient change of [Ca 2 +]i accompanying slight tension. During the second phase, the light signal slowly increased as cooling produced maximum tension development. The third phase was an additional light signal induced after the second phase, even though the tension was saturated. The second and third phases were more sensitive to low concentrations of procaine (0. 2 - 0. 5 mM) than the first phase. <b>Synchronous</b> oscillations of <b>light</b> and tension were often observed during the second phase. The light signal during rapid cooling contracture was only slightly affected by long incubation in Ca-free or Ca-rich solutions. These results are interpreted as follows. A low concentration of caffeine elevates cytoplasmic resting Ca 2 + level without tension development. The oscillations of light and tension often observed in the second phase might represent a cyclic release of Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (s. r.). The third phase is considered to be due to a massive Ca 2 + release by a Ca-induced Ca-release mechanism which might be similar to that in skinned fibres. The second phase is probably essential for generation of rapid cooling contracture tension and the third phase represents an excess Ca 2 + for tension development...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for 3 D vision systems, many efforts have been recently concentrated to achieve complete 3 D information analogous to human eyes. Scannerless optical range imaging systems are emerging as an interesting alternative to conventional intensity imaging {{in a variety of}} applications, including pedestrian security, biomedical appliances, robotics and industrial control etc. For this, several studies have reported to produce 3 D images including stereovision, object distance from vision system and structured light source with high frame rate, accuracy, wide dynamic range, low power consumption and lower cost. Several types of optical techniques for 3 D imaging range measurement are available in the literature, among them {{one of the most important}} is time-of-flight (TOF) principle that is intensively investigated. The third dimension, i. e. depth information, can be determined by correlating the reflected modulated light signal from the scene with a reference signal <b>synchronous</b> with the <b>light</b> source modulation signal. CMOS image sensors are capable of integrating the image processing circuitry on the same chip as the light sensitive elements. As compared to other imaging technologies, they have the advantages of lower power consumption and potentially lower price. The merits make this technology competent for the next-generation solid-state imaging applications. However, CMOS process technologies are developed for high-performance digital circuits. Different types of 3 D photodetectors have been proposed for three-dimensional imaging. A major performance improvement has been found in the adoption of inherently mixing detectors that incorporate the role of detection and demodulation in a single device. Basically, these devices use a modulated electric field to guide the photo generated charge carriers to different collection sites in phase with a modulation signal. One very promising CMOS photonic demodulator based on substrate current modulation has recently been proposed. In this device the electric field penetrates deeper into the substrate, thus enhancing the charge separation and collection mechanism. A very good sensitivity and high demodulation efficiency can be achieved. The objective of this thesis has been the design and characterization of a Current Assisted Photo mixing Demodulator (CAPD) to be applied in a TOF based 3 D CMOS sensing system. At first, the experimental investigation of the CAPD device is carried out. As a test vehicle, 10 × 10 pixel arrays have been fabricated in 0. 18 µm CMOS technology with 10 × 10 µm 2 pixel size. The main properties of CAPD devices, such as the charge transfer characteristic, modulation contrast, noise performance and non-linearity problem, etc. have been simulated and experimentally evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate a good DC charge separation efficiency and good dynamic demodulation capabilities up to 45 MHz. The influence of performance parameters such as wavelength, modulation frequency and voltage on this device is also discussed. This test device corresponds to the first step towards incorporating a high resolution TOF based 3 D CMOS image sensor. The demodulator structure featuring a remarkably small pixel size 10 × 10 µm 2 is used to realize a 120 × 160 pixel array of ranging sensor fabricated in standard 0. 18 µm CMOS technology. Initial results demonstrate that the demodulator structure is suitable for a real-time 3 D image sensor. The prototype camera system is capable of providing real-time distance measurements of a scene through modulated-wave TOF measurements with a modulation frequency 20 MHz. In the distance measurement, the sensor array provides a linear distance range from 1. 2 m to 3. 7 m with maximum accuracy error 3. 3...|$|R
