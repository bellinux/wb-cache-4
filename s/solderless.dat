5000|$|JST {{connector}} are electrical connectors {{manufactured by}} J.S.T. Mfg. Co. (Japan <b>Solderless</b> Terminal). [...] JST manufactures numerous series (families) and pitches (pin-to-pin distance) of connectors.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{relatively}} large parasitic {{capacitance compared to}} a properly laid out PCB (approx 2pF between adjacent contact columns), high inductance of some connections and a relatively high and not very reproducible contact resistance, <b>solderless</b> breadboards are limited to operation at relatively low frequencies, usually less than 10 MHz, depending {{on the nature of}} the circuit. The relatively high contact resistance can already be a problem for some DC and very low frequency circuits. <b>Solderless</b> breadboards are further limited by their voltage and current ratings.|$|E
50|$|The {{breadboard}} {{most commonly}} used today is usually made of white plastic and is a pluggable (<b>solderless)</b> breadboard. It was designed by Ronald J. Portugal in 1971.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solderless</b> {{breadboard}} modules {{can also}} be found mounted on devices like microcontroller evaluation boards. They provide an easy way to add additional periphery circuits to the evaluation board.|$|E
50|$|Because the <b>solderless</b> {{breadboard}} {{does not}} require soldering, it is reusable. This {{makes it easy to}} use for creating temporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design. For this reason, <b>solderless</b> breadboards are also extremely popular with students and in technological education. Older breadboard types did not have this property. A stripboard (Veroboard) and similar prototyping printed circuit boards, which are used to build semi-permanent soldered prototypes or one-offs, cannot easily be reused. A variety of electronic systems may be prototyped by using breadboards, from small analog and digital circuits to complete central processing units (CPUs).|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "full size" [...] {{terminal}} breadboard strip typically {{consists of}} around 56 to 65 rows of connectors, each row containing the above-mentioned {{two sets of}} connected clips (A to E and F to J). Together with bus strips on each side this makes up a typical 784 to 910 tie point <b>solderless</b> breadboard. [...] "Small size" [...] strips typically come with around 30 rows. Miniature <b>solderless</b> breadboards as small as 17 rows (no bus strips, 170 tie points) can be found, but these are only suitable for small and simple designs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Solderless</b> {{breadboards}} usually cannot accommodate surface-mount technology devices (SMD) or components with {{grid spacing}} other than 0.1 in (2.54 mm). Further, they cannot accommodate components with multiple rows of connectors if these connectors {{do not match}} the dual in-line layout - {{it is impossible to}} provide the correct electrical connectivity. Sometimes small PCB adapters called [...] "breakout adapters" [...] can be used to fit the component to the board. Such adapters carry one or more components and have 0.1 in (2.54 mm) spaced male connector pins in a single in-line or dual in-line layout, for insertion into a <b>solderless</b> breadboard. Larger components are usually plugged into a socket on the adapter, while smaller components (e.g., SMD resistors) are usually soldered directly onto the adapter. The adapter is then plugged into the breadboard via the 0.1 in connectors. However, the need to solder the components onto the adapter negates some of the advantage of using a <b>solderless</b> breadboard.|$|E
5000|$|Maximite clones made by US {{producer}} CircuitGizmos remain {{compatible with}} the original Maximite design and include a very small CGMMSTICK1 [...] {{that can be used}} with <b>solderless</b> breadboards, and a Colour Maximite compatible CGCOLORMAX1.|$|E

50|$|EMG Inc. {{has four}} {{distinct}} product ranges; the EMG Standard Series, HZ / SRO Series, SA Series and the EMG X-Series. These pickups are all {{featured on the}} official EMG Inc. website and include <b>solderless</b> wiring harnesses.|$|E
5000|$|There are 2 {{distinct}} {{types of}} kit, those that will construct a single project, {{and those that}} can construct a range of projects. The latter are primarily aimed at children, and include a <b>solderless</b> construction board of some type, such as; ...|$|E

Exclusive Collection) came in [...] "White Bengal Custom Graphics" [...] and {{was loaded}} with EMG 81/85 active pickups.more {{recently}} a Blue Bengal was offered with EMG 81/85 Zakk Wylde signature ZW EMG's (with the <b>solderless</b> wiring harness.) ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} provide high-end {{versions of}} <b>solderless</b> breadboards. These are typically high-quality breadboard modules {{mounted on a}} flat casing. The casing contains additional equipment for breadboarding, such as a power supply, one or more signal generators, serial interfaces, LED display or LCD modules, and logic probes.|$|E
50|$|A modern <b>solderless</b> {{breadboard}} socket {{consists of a}} perforated block of plastic with numerous tin plated phosphor bronze or nickel silver alloy spring clips under the perforations. The clips are often called tie points or contact points. The number of tie points is often given in the specification of the breadboard.|$|E
5000|$|A {{breadboard}} is {{a construction}} base for prototyping of electronics. Originally it was literally a bread board, a polished {{piece of wood}} used for slicing bread. In the 1970s the <b>solderless</b> breadboard (AKA plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term [...] "breadboard" [...] is commonly {{used to refer to}} these.|$|E
50|$|In a {{more robust}} variant, {{one or more}} {{breadboard}} strips are mounted {{on a sheet of}} metal. Typically, that backing sheet also holds a number of binding posts. These posts provide a clean way to connect an external power supply. This type of breadboard may be slightly easier to handle. Several images in this article show such <b>solderless</b> breadboards.|$|E
50|$|In 1941, Aircraft Marine Products (AMP) {{was founded}} with <b>solderless</b> {{electrical}} connections for quick and removable wire connection used for aircraft and ships. After the war time boom {{the company had}} to adapt to post war economy and in 1956 the name was changed to AMP Incorporated when it incorporated. In 1999, Tyco International acquired American electronics connector manufacturer AMP Incorporated.|$|E
5000|$|Speedwire is a <b>solderless</b> {{prototyping}} system {{manufactured by}} BICC-Vero for constructing electronic circuit boards. The system {{is based on}} a circuit board pre-drilled with holes in a regular 0.1-inch (2.54 mm) square grid. The boards are available in standard sizes such as Eurocard modules. Some of the holes are through-plated and interconnected with copper strips to form power and ground rails.|$|E
50|$|The Euroblock is a <b>solderless</b> {{connector}} {{that uses}} screw terminals to clamp connecting wires. Once the wires are installed, the entire assembly is plugged into a matching socket {{in the electronic}} device. Euroblocks are more convenient than the terminal strips they replace as the signal cables can be quickly disconnected from or connected to the electronic device, rather than unscrewing and re-screwing each wire individually.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after graduating, Dibner {{designed}} and patented the first <b>solderless</b> electrical connectors and founded the Burndy Engineering Company in 1924. The company {{later became the}} Burndy Corporation and was bought by the French corporation Framatome Connectors International (FCI) in 1988. In 2009, Burndy was acquired and became a subsidiary of Hubbell Incorporated. [...] Dibner died {{at his home in}} Wilton, Connecticut on January 6, 1988.|$|E
50|$|Perfboard {{differs from}} stripboard in that each pad on perfboard is isolated. Stripboard {{is made with}} rows of copper {{conductors}} that form default connections, which are broken into isolated segments as required by scraping through the copper. This {{is similar to the}} pattern of default connections on a <b>solderless</b> breadboard. However, the absence of default connectivity on perfboard gives the designer more freedom in positioning components and lends itself more readily to software-aided design than stripboard or breadboard.|$|E
5000|$|The Gadgeteer {{platform}} {{centers around}} a Gadgeteer mainboard with a microcontroller running the [...]NET Micro Framework. Gadgeteer sets out rules about how hardware devices packaged as add-on modules may {{connect to the}} mainboard, using <b>solderless</b> push-on connectors. Gadgeteer includes a small class library to simplify the implementation details for integrating these add-on modules into a system. It {{is a way of}} assigning the plethora of functions that a microcontroller provides to sockets that have a standardized, small set of interfaces at the hardware level.|$|E
50|$|The Arduino board exposes {{most of the}} microcontroller's I/O pins for use {{by other}} circuits. The Diecimila, Duemilanove, and current Uno provide 14 digital I/O pins, six of which can produce {{pulse-width}} modulated signals, and six analog inputs, which {{can also be used}} as six digital I/O pins. These pins are {{on the top of the}} board, via female 0.1-inch (2.54 mm) headers. Several plug-in application shields are also commercially available. The Arduino Nano, and Arduino-compatible Bare Bones Board and Boarduino boards may provide male header pins on the underside of the board that can plug into <b>solderless</b> breadboards.|$|E
50|$|Very complex {{circuits}} {{can become}} unmanageable on a <b>solderless</b> breadboard {{due to the}} large amount of wiring required. The very convenience of easy plugging and unplugging of connections also makes it too easy to accidentally disturb a connection, and the system becomes unreliable. It is possible to prototype systems with thousands of connecting points, but great care must be taken in careful assembly, and such a system becomes unreliable as contact resistance develops over time. At some point, very complex systems must be implemented in a more reliable interconnection technology, to have a likelihood of working over a usable time period.|$|E
5000|$|F-crimp {{is a more}} {{mechanically}} robust {{crimp connection}} compared to the common barrel-crimp type readily available at retail locations (Radio Shack, Home Depot, etc.). It also has an optional second crimp section that crimps to the insulation, providing strain relief. Because of these characteristics, automobiles use F-crimp almost exclusively. F-crimp was devised to {{eliminate the need for}} soldered connections—crimping can be preferred to soldering in mass production because it is easier to reproduce reliable connections. These connections, when made with ratcheting application tooling, provide a <b>solderless,</b> [...] "gas-tight" [...] connection. F-crimp connections are never soldered as application of solder can lead to fracturing of the wire conductor.|$|E
