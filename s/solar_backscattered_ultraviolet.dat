40|$|Ozone {{measurements}} from 1970 to 1984 {{from the}} Nimbus 4 backscattered ultraviolet and the Nimbus 7 <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> spectrometers show {{significant decrease in}} total ozone only after 1979. The downward trend is most apparent in October south of 70 deg S in the longitude zone 0 to 30 deg W where planetary wave activity is weak. Outside this longitude region, the trend in total ozone is much smaller due to strong interannual variability of wave activity. This paper gives a phenomenological description of ozone depletion in the Antarctic region based on vertical advection and transient planetary waves...|$|E
40|$|Global ozone fluxes and flux divergences {{within the}} region between 30 and 0. 4 mbar are {{computed}} for the period from December 1, 1978, to November 30, 1979, using Nimbus 7 <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> ozone profiles and meteorological data derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites. The annual cycle of ozone transports in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres is presented and discussed. It is found that planetary scale waves are responsible for initiating the high-latitude ozone buildup in winter. The time of occurrence and {{the position of the}} annual maximum ozone are found to be closely related to the planetary wave activity in both hemispheres...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-eight {{latitudinal}} {{cross sections}} of stratospheric ozone observed by the SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) and SBUV (<b>Solar</b> <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet)</b> satellite instruments {{on the same}} days in March and April 1979 and at approximately the same latitude are compared. Differences in the zonal-mean mixing ratios are found. At pressures less than 5 mbar, SAGE gives approximately 20 percent larger mixing ratios at tropical latitudes (after a correction has been applied for the expected diurnal variation of ozone). The uncorrelated portion of the SBUV variances are smaller than the SAGE noise variances at altitudes above 10 mbar, which indicates that the SBUV experiment should provide excellent detectability of longitudinal ozone variations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} are to develop techniques {{to detect and}} remove long-term instrument drifts from the operational <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV/ 2) data base using periodic measurements made by the Shuttle <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Spectral Radiometer and to evaluate the potential effects of scattering by atmospheric aerosols on our ability to detect trends in ozone using SBUV-class instruments...|$|R
40|$|Modifications {{made to the}} SBUV/ 2 (<b>solar</b> <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> mod 2) to make it {{compatible}} with the Shuttle are examined. The Shuttle SBUV (SSBUV) in-flight radiometric calibration checking system is also described. Requirements, constraints, and methodology for combining SSBUV data with SBUV/ 2 data to remove its long-term drift are discussed...|$|R
30|$|More {{complete}} datasets {{have been}} accumulated, {{and this has}} led to new findings on trends. For example, a 33 -year PMC data from the satellite <b>solar</b> <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) instrument show significantly smaller trends than were previously published. Still, the data continue to indicate a long-term increase in PMC brightness, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{is comprised of}} the following tasks: use of simple analytical and numerical models of a coupled troposphere-stratosphere system {{to examine the effects}} of radiation and ozone on planetary wave dynamics and the tropospheric circulation; use of satellite data obtained from the Nimbus 7 Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) instrument and <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) experiment, in conjunction with National Meteorological Center (NMC) data, to determine the planetary wave vertical structures, dominant wave spectra, ozone spectra, and time variations in diabatic heating rate; and synthesis of the modeling and observational results to provide a better understanding of the effects that stratospheric processes have on tropospheric dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Multichannel Filter Radiometer (MFR) {{data are}} intercompared with <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data during a five-month period of their data overlap {{in order to}} {{determine}} the usefulness of MFR data to represent the SBUV/TOMS and backscatter ultraviolet spectrometer data during their data gap period. Total ozone differences found were latitudinally and monthly dependent. Average differences between the TOMS and the MFR ozone data vary from - 12. 4 to + 13. 3 percent, with differences in the tropical to middle latitudes generally between + or - 4 percent. Biases between the data sets can be removed for certain latitude zones by applying an appropriate algorithm to the MFR ozone data...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{understand}} the behavior of ozone in the transition region, the terms in the perturbation continuity equation have been evaluated from <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> ozone data, National Meteorological Center temperature data, and geostrophic winds derived from the temperature data at 2 mbar, winter 1978 - 1979. A linear parameterization is used to estimate the chemical source term. The perturbation ozone field calculated by integrating the net forcing evaluated from the data compares well with the measured perturbation ozone field. There are occasions during the winter when {{the sum of the}} dynamic terms is small due to cancellation, and the ozone and temperature perturbations are anticorrelated. The - 1 correlation between the ozone and temperature perturbations does not necessarily imply that chemical forcing is dominant...|$|E
50|$|Besides the Galileo spacecraft, Atlantis payload bay {{held two}} {{canisters}} containing the Shuttle <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SSBUV) experiment. SSBUV, which {{made its first}} flight on STS-34, was developed by NASA to check the calibration of the ozone sounders on free-flying satellites, and to verify the accuracy of atmospheric ozone and solar irradiance data. The experiment operated successfully.|$|R
50|$|Other {{payloads}} in Atlantisâ€™s {{cargo bay}} included the Shuttle <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SSBUV-7) payload and the Experiment on the Sun Complementing ATLAS (ESCAPE-II). Payloads {{located in the}} middeck include the Physiological & Anatomical Rodent Experiment (PARE/NIR-R), Protein Crystal Growth-Thermal Enclosure (PCG-TES), Protein Crystal Growth- Single Locker (PCG-STES), Space Tissue Loss/National Institute of Health (STL/NIH-C), Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) and the Heat Pipe Performance-2 Experiment (HPP-2).|$|R
40|$|Shuttle <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SSBUV) {{spectrometer}} {{observations of}} ozone {{concentrations in the}} upper stratosphere made in October 1989 are combined here with measurements made in October 1980 by the similar SBUV instruments on NASA's Nimbus- 7 satellite. It is shown that the ozone concentration near 45 km has decreased during this period by about 7 +/- 2 percent. The trend is consistent with predictions of a 2 D photochemical model...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS) onboard the Nimbus 7 {{satellite}} is an {{atmospheric ozone}} measuring experiment from <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> radiation off the earth atmosphere. The excellent spatial coverage and long lifetime of SUBV/TOMS makes this experiment viable {{for the long}} term monitoring of the global ozone. A technique used in the in-orbit calibration of SUBV/TOMS for the ozone data processing is presented. This technique employs a model to explain and correct the observed instrument output due to degradation. From the analyses with the corrected data to verify the model, it is concluded that the in-orbit instrument calibration for the ozone measurement is accurate within 2 percent for the first four years of the instrument operation...|$|E
40|$|Synoptic {{analyses}} of <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) ozone data {{have been performed}} {{on a daily basis}} for the first year of Nimbus 7 operation, November 1978 through October 1979, at the standard pressure levels: 30, 10, 5, 2, 1, and 0. 4 mbar. By combining these data with the daily NMC meteorological {{analyses of}} temperature and geostrophic wind at the same levels, elements of the ozone-temperature relationship as well as the horizontal eddy transports are examined. In particular, the existence of an upper stratospheric high-latitude ozone minimum in winter is discussed, and the eddy fluxes are found to {{play a significant role in}} this feature, mainly associated with stratospheric warming pulses. At the same time, monthly average quantities are examined, and standing eddy components are related...|$|E
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that during a solar proton event (SPE), large numbers of high-energy protons {{penetrate}} the earth's mesosphere and upper stratosphere and perturb the normal chemistry by ionizing molecules and changing the balance of odd nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. Changes in ozone caused by an SPE are produced very rapidly, typically {{in a matter of}} hours, and are confined to a limited geographic area, the region above 60 deg geomagnetic latitude. In this paper, an analysis is reported of the response of ozone to the significant SPE's in solar cycle 21 from the Nimbus 7 launch in October 1978 to date, using data from the <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> instrument (SBUV). Ozone data during 15 SPE's were examined. It was found that ozone depletion occurred during SPE's on at least five dates...|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric ozone {{depletion}} is an environmental problem of worldwide concern. At the time, NASAs NIMBUS-7 satellite and NOAAs TIROS satellites provided dailydata to permit researchers to detect ozone trends. The Shuttle <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Instrument, from the Goddard Space Flight Center, carried an ozone detector instrument {{identical to those}} on the satellites. By comparing Discoverys measurements with coordinated satellite observations, scientists were able to calibrate their satellite instruments to insure the most accurate readings possible.|$|R

He addresses the primary objective, and answered questions from the audience and other NASA Centers. Heflin also mentions the Shuttle <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> secondary payload, and several experiments. These experiments include Growth Hormone Crystal Distribution (Plants), Polymer Morphology, Sensor Technology Experiment, Mesoscale Lightning Experiment, Shuttle Student Involvement Program "Ice Crystals", and the Air Force Maui Optical Site...|$|R
50|$|STS-34 Atlantis (October 18-23, 1989) {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. During the mission, the crew deployed the Galileo probe to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone, conducted several medical experiments, and numerous scientific experiments. Mission objectives were accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth, traveling 1.8 million miles in 119 hours and 41 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies of}} solar-induced {{variations}} in stratospheric parameters have been mainly concerned with observed ozone responses. In the present investigation, attention {{is given to}} temperature responses as well as ozone responses at low latitudes, taking into account 22 months of Nimbus 7 <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) ozone and {{stratospheric and mesospheric sounder}} temperature data. A data description is provided, and cross-correlation and regression analyses are conducted. An extension is considered of an analytic model, which was derived by Frederick (1981) for the coupled behavior of ozone and temperature perturbations in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The extended model is applied to the results of the analyses. The obtained data provide statistical evidence for ozone and temperature responses to changes in solar ultraviolet flux on the time scale of the solar rotation period...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, Umkehr data {{taken by}} 20 Dobson {{stations}} {{around the world have}} been the principal source of information about the behavior of upper stratospheric ozone. Umkehr results are used also for detecting drifts in satellite instruments and for determining intersatellite biases. However, a systematic evaluation of the quality of Umkehr data taken by the various stations has been lacking. Five years of ozone profile data from the <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) have been used to examine and intercompare the quality of Umkehr stations, and to assess the degradation of their performance after the El Chichon volcano eruption in southern Mexico. In contrast to Umkehr, the SBUV ozone measurments in layers 7 through 9 (1 - 8 mb) were unaffected by the massive amounts of dust and gases ejected by El Chichon...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial features of stratospheric fluctuations are analyzed using 2. 5 years of ozone and temperature data from the Nimbus 7 <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> and the SAMS experiments. It is observed that the oscillations are dynamically induced perturbations in the winter hemisphere and the 27 -day modulation of the solar UV radiation. The fluctuations in the ozone and temperature are compared with solar activity. The effects of solar and temperature perturbations on stratospheric ozone are examined; it is shown that the dynamically induced oscillations are global and independent of solar activity. The seasonal, latitudinal, and altitudinal variations of the regression factors and their influence on the ozone are studied. Multiple regression and cross-spectral analyses of ozone, temperature, and solar flux data reveal that the ozone mixing ratio is more sensitive to changes in temperature than changes in solar activity...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to monitor the long-term calibration of the <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments. It {{is based on the}} fact that the radiance in one channel can be expressed as a linear sum of the radiances in neighboring channels. Using simulated radiances for the SBUV and TOMS instruments, various scenarios of changes in instrument calibration are investigated. Results from sample processing of SBUV data are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{from the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) provide <b>solar</b> UV flux in the 160 to 400 nm {{wavelength}} range, {{backed up by}} independent measurement in the 115 to 305 nm range from the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME). The full disc UV flux from spatially resolved measurements of solar activity was modeled, which provides {{a better understanding of}} why the UV variations have their observed temporal and wavelength dependencies. Long term, intermediate term, and short term variations are briefly examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have used}} an {{off-line}} 3 -D chemical transport model (CTM) {{to investigate the}} 11 -yr solar cycle response in tropical stratospheric ozone. The model is forced with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (re) analysis (ERA- 40 /operational and ERA-Interim) data for the 1979 â€“ 2005 time period.

40|$|Monthly average ozone {{profiles}} {{from the}} first year of operation of the <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) instrument on the Nimbus 7 satellite (November 1978 through October 1979) are tabulated for 10 deg latitude bands from 80 deg S to 80 deg N. For each month and latitude zone layer ozone amounts, standard deviations for 12 Umkehr layers (approximately 0 - 60 km), and the average total ozone for each zone are listed. The ozone mixing ratio and number density at the center of each layer are also given. It is found that the average SBUV profiles agree with average Umkehr profiles measured at Boulder to within 10 percent over most of the range. The Krueger-Minizner model is found to be a good representative ozone model for 45 deg N, agreeing with an annual average of measured profiles to better than 10 percent between 20 and 60 km...|$|E

During the SPE on July 13, 1982, the largest of this solar cycle, no depletion at all at 45 km is observed, {{but there is a}} 15 percent ozone depletion at 50 km increasing to 27 percent at 55 km, all at a solar zenith angle of 85 deg. A strong variation of the observed depletion with solar zenith angle is found, with maximum depletion occurring at the largest zenith angles (near 85 deg) decreasing to near zero for angles below about 70 deg. The observed depletion is short lived, disappearing within hours {{of the end of the}} SPE...|$|E
40|$|Lower stratospheric zonal mean O 3 {{distributions}} {{are compared}} in both hemispheres from the Nimbus 7 <b>Solar</b> <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) and Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) data sets. Generally {{there is very}} good agreement with regard to individual profile shape and magnitude and with their longitudinal variability about the zonal mean. When the data are considered in terms of Umkehr layer amounts, there are subtle but {{significant differences in the}} respective meridional O 3 gradients and their variations with time which are probably related to a changing O 3 optical depth and constants to an assumed profile climatology in the retrieval. Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) satellite O 3 results are presented which tend to split the differences between SBUV and LIMS. Additional comparisons with electrochemical concentration cell sonde and Mastsonde O 3 profiles are presented in order to sort out the more noticeable differences...|$|E

40|$|Following {{the solar}} proton event (SPE) of July 13, 1982, an {{increase}} in the strength of nitric oxide Gamma bands was observed in spectral scans of the atmospheric albedo made by the <b>solar</b> <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> instrument on Nimbus 7. Analysis of the (10), (01), and (02) Gamma band strengths allow an estimate to be made of the cumulative amount of nitric oxide above an altitude of 50 km. An increase in nitric oxide in southern hemisphere high latitudes following the SPE amounting to about 5 x 10 to the 14 th molecules per sq cm above an altitude of approximately 50 km is observed. The observed increase persists until the middle of September. A similar increase is not observed in the northern hemisphere, indicating that under summer conditions the mesospheric/thermospheric NO distribution returns to normal within {{a few days after the}} end of an SPE...|$|E
40|$|Significant in-band {{stray light}} (IBSL) error at solar zenith angle (SZA) values larger than 77 Â° near sunset in 4 SBUV/ 2 (<b>Solar</b> <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet)</b> instruments, {{on board the}} NOAA- 14, 17, 18 and 19 satellites, has been characterized. The IBSL error is caused by large surface {{reflection}} and scattering of the air-gapped depolarizer {{in front of the}} instrument's monochromator aperture. The source of the IBSL error is direct solar illumination of instrument components near the aperture rather than from earth shine. The IBSL contamination at 273 nm can reach 40 % of earth radiance near sunset, which results in as much as a 50 % error in the retrieved ozone from the upper stratosphere. We have analyzed SBUV/ 2 albedo measurements on both the dayside and nightside to develop an empirical model for the IBSL error. This error has been corrected in the V 8. 6 SBUV/ 2 ozone retrieval...|$|E

A maximum concentration of 15 matm-cm of SO 2 was observed west of Hawaii on April 15; the minimum detectable amount of SO 2 in a single scan is about 1 matm-cm. The disappearance of the band structure at wavelengths below 300 nm indicates that the SO 2 was between 20 km and 30 km altitude. An excess albedo was also observed near 300 nm which was attributed to increased scattering from volcanic aerosols; the wavelength of the scattering feature indicates that the aerosols also were near 25 km altitude...|$|E
