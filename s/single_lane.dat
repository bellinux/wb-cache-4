5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a <b>single</b> <b>lane</b> of traffic: they move forward at a constant speed if there is open space in front of them, and otherwise they stop. Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of open road when traffic is light, and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} {{over a three-year}} period from 1925. The project was not originally planned to take as long, but there were delays due to problems with a contractor, and industrial action. The bridge was designed to carry the Mildura railway line over the Murray River and into New South Wales, to service significant cross-border traffic arising from the fruit-growing industry, but the line was never extended beyond the terminus at Yelta. The bridge currently carries a <b>single</b> <b>lane</b> of road controlled by traffic lights.|$|E
5|$|The crossing's {{development}} {{started in}} the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a <b>single</b> <b>lane</b> of traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and this increased traffic {{put pressure on the}} tunnels' capacity. A Private Finance Initiative scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction.|$|E

5|$|Driving {{through the}} pass is challenging. Both {{approaches}} require 6% grades {{due to the}} height of the pass, and require navigating hairpin turns with advisory speeds of 10mph (15km/h). Rockfalls, particularly on the approach from Aspen, have narrowed some sections to a <b>single</b> <b>lane</b> 12 feet (4 m) wide with temporary traffic lights. On the Twin Lakes approach, they have resulted in temporary closures. Other vehicles frequently enter the road unexpectedly at the many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions, and bicyclists make frequent use of Highway 82 as well. Lastly, the weather at the pass can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either Aspen or Twin Lakes. There may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days, and snow can occur at any time of the year. CDOT advises anyone coming to the pass for outdoor recreation to take precautions against the effects of the high altitude and the changeable weather.|$|E
5|$|On July15, 2008, {{the town}} of Irondequoit let a $12.8 million {{contract}} for the Sea Breeze Drive project, a mark that was within the $14 million accumulated in funding by this time. Ground was officially broken on the project on July28 {{as part of a}} ceremony attended by several Rochester-area dignitaries. Among those present were Jim Walsh and David Schantz, both of whom played large roles in making the project a reality. The corridor was subsequently reduced to two lanes as the southbound lanes of NY590 were reconfigured to handle both directions of traffic while work ensued on permanently narrowing the northbound lanes to a <b>single</b> <b>lane.</b> Northbound traffic on NY590 was realigned to use the new northbound lane on August17, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a <b>single</b> <b>lane</b> of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a <b>single</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|E
