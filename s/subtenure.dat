In order to disentangle the above {{two types of}} demand, households, in this study, are separated into three <b>subtenure</b> groups i. e. renters, owners owning one house, and owners buying a second or more houses. Presumably, renting a house is for consumption only, while buying a second house is usually for investment purposes. Applying a two-period model and two data sets from DGBAS and from Land Bank of Taiwan, the estimated results are as follows: Firstly, the income elasticity of pure consumption demand for housing {{is very close to}} unity (1. 0413). Secondly, the income elasticity for a pure investment demand is greater than one (1. 2643). Finally, for a household owning only one house, the shares for consumption motive and for investment motive are 26 % and 74 %, respectively.
