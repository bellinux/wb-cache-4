Women often present a mixture of symptoms inconsistent with urodynamic diagnosis, especially regarding urgency. Treatment of stress incontinence often relieves urge symptoms indicating a common pathophysiology. Our aims were to investigate urodynamic characteristics in 59 incontinent and 28 continent middle aged women recruited from the WHILA study and to compare the findings to those of patients with established incontinence; to investigate the prevalence of LUTS including overactive bladder and potential risk factors for overactive bladder and stress incontinence. Incontinent women produced a higher maximum urinary flow and a faster flow acceleration at an unchanged detrusor pressure level than the continent women regardless of stress, urge or mixed symptomatology. They also showed a decreased ability to increase the urethral pressure during <b>short</b> <b>squeezes</b> expressed as pressure rise amplitude and in a semiquantitative classification based upon {{the configuration of the}} pressure response curve. Pelvic floor exercises increased pressure response to the same level as in continent women.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the urethral motor function in incontinent women. Materials and Methods: The intraurethral pressure was measured continuously in the high-pressure {{zone of the}} urethra at rest and during repeated <b>short</b> <b>squeezes</b> around the microtip transducer catheter {{in a group of}} 205 women with clinically manifest urinary incontinence (severe), and compared with the findings of investigations in 87 middle-aged women (53 - 63 years) with treatment naive incontinence (mild-to-mode rate) and healthy controls. Results: Women with established incontinence significantly (P < 0. 001) more often (66 %) had a pressure fall during or immediately following squeeze than women with treatment naive incontinence (35 %) or asymptomatic women (25 %). The acceleration of urinary flow and the maximal flow rate were significantly (P < 0. 01) increased in patients with incontinence: acceleration was 13 +/- 2. 2 (17. 8), 20 +/- 2. 8 (18. 9), and 32 +/- 4. 9 (24. 9) degrees (mean +/- SEM;SD) for incontinence, naive incontinence and no incontinence, respectively; maximum urinary flow rate was 23, 22, and 16 ml/sec. No statistical differences in any of these measures were seen when stress and urge incontinence were compared. Conclusion: Women with stress, urge, and mixed urinary incontinence seem to have a primary neuromuscular disorder in the urethra, which presents itself as an overactive opening mechanism with a urethral pressure fall instead of a pressure increase on provocation during the filling phase of the bladder, and during bladder emptying a more efficient opening of the bladder outlet than in normal women. We suggest that one and the same pathophysiological mechanism participates in female stress, urge, and mixed incontinence...|$|R
