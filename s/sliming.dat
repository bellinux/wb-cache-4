Every <b>slim</b> groupoid can be embedded into a subdirectly irreducible <b>slim</b> groupoid. The {{variety of}} <b>slim</b> groupoids has the finite embeddability property, {{so that the}} word problem is solvable. We introduce {{the notion of a}} strongly nonfinitely based <b>slim</b> groupoid (such groupoids are inherently nonfinitely based) and find all strongly nonfinitely based <b>slim</b> groupoids with at most four elements; up to isomorphism, there are just two such groupoids. We are going to investigate groupoids (algebras with one binary operation) satisfying the equation x(yz) ≈ xz. Since every term operation of such a groupoid can be represented by a <b>slim</b> term (a term that is a product of a finite sequence of variables with all parentheses grouped to the left), these groupoids are called <b>slim.</b> Similarly {{as in the case of}} semigroups, a free object in the variety of <b>slim</b> groupoids is the set of words over a give...|$|R
