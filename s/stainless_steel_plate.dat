While the role of sulfur during welding of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with the same sulfur content is well understood, welding of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> containing different concentrations of sulfur has not yet received proper attention.

Areas of thin copper on the cathode plates, which are caused by short circuits, are difficult to separate from the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> due to their lack of rigidity. Plates bearing such areas generally had to be rejected from the stripping machine and stripped manually. Similarly, sticky copper deposits (generally related to poor surface condition on the cathode plate, such as corroded surfaces or improper mechanical treatment), heavily nodulated cathode and laminated copper caused problems for stripping.|$|E

40|$|Eddy current test is a simple, versatile, {{fast and}} high {{sensitivity}} non-destructive evaluation technique widely used for detection and characterisation of surface and sub-surface defects in austentic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> Fracture mechanics based approaches for structural integrity assessment demand NDE data such as length, width, shape, orientation, {{and distribution of}} defects. In EC test situations, this data can only be obtained by raster-scan imaging of eddy current probe on the material surface. Three major problems noticed during EC imaging of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and welds are the influence of disturbing variables, the blurring of images due to convolution of point spread function of probe with defects, and the lager imaging times. In this contribution, a new imaging scheme is presented for automated eddy current nondestructive evaluation of austentic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and welds. This scheme uses artifical neural networks and imaging methods to identify all the defective regions quickly and then to automatically examine the defective regions in more detail to ultimately produce 3 -dimensional picture of defects. Experimental studies on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and welds confirm that the automated scheme is capable of detecting defects quickly and characterising them accurately besides reducing the memory requirements for storage of inspection data...|$|R
50|$|Melt {{filtration}} {{is typically}} used to remove contaminants from polymer melts during the extrusion process. There is a mechanical {{separation of the}} contaminants within a machine called a ‘screen changer’. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in moveable pistons or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> called a ‘breaker plate’ -- a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow {{the flow of the}} polymer melt. For the recycling of polyester it is typical to integrate a screen changer into the extrusion line. This can be in a pelletizing, sheet extrusion or strapping tape extrusion line.|$|E
5000|$|An {{accelerating}} electrode (accelerator) is placed {{directly in front}} of the emitter. This electrode consists of a metal (usually <b>stainless</b> <b>steel)</b> <b>plate</b> where two sharp blades are machined. When thrust is required, a strong electric field is generated by the application of a high voltage difference between the emitter and the accelerator. Under this condition, the free surface of the liquid metal enters a regime of local instability, due to the combined effects of the electrostatic force and the surface tension. A series of protruding cusps, or [...] "Taylor cones" [...] are thus created. When the electric field reaches a value in the order of 109 V/m, the atoms at the tip of the cusps spontaneously ionize and an ion jet is extracted by the electric field, while the electrons are rejected in the bulk of the liquid. An external source of electrons (neutralizer) provides negative charges to maintain global electrical neutrality of the thruster assembly.|$|E

One experiment conducted took both a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> - which is what most door handles are currently made from - and a copper plate coating them both with 10 million cells each of MRSA. What they found was that bacteria thrived on the stainless steel plates while the natural antibacterial properties of copper worked both directly and indirectly to destroy the bacteria. “The direct effect comes from the release of copper ions which degrade the DNA of a cell and inhibit its respiration. The indirect effect is even more rapid. On a dry surface, copper interacts with the bacteria's metabolism to generate very potent free radicals, which are even quicker than copper itself at destroying the DNA and inhibiting respiration.” Tests have shown that copper is not only effective against superbugs like MRSA C difficile, but also other dangerous germs like the flu virus and E. coli.|$|E

Disinfection of closed rooms experimentally contaminated with antibiotic-susceptible and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli was performed using AKACID Plus at concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 25, and 0. 5 % for 100 min. Bacterial suspensions were distributed on plastic and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and placed in a test room. Recovery of the test microorganisms was determined before nebulizing, 60 and 100 min after initiation, and 4 h after the end of room disinfection by a simple swab-rinse technique.
