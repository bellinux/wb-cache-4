50|$|The saisie-contrefaçon is {{generally}} decisive {{in the success}} or failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action for <b>infringement.</b> If it is correctly performed and cannot be challenged or remains unchallenged, it will provide evidence of an <b>infringement</b> for which <b>the</b> judge ruling on the merits in <b>the</b> <b>infringement</b> proceedings cannot but pronounce civil or criminal sanctions, thereby ensuring <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intellectual property right over the infringer. If it is incorrectly performed, challenged and declared void, it generally leads to <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infringement</b> action on <b>the</b> merits as it fails to produce evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infringement.</b> All other means of proof certainly remain effective in theory, but in practice, they are far from being as efficient as the saisie-contrefaçon, to the extent that <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saisie-contrefaçon often means that <b>the</b> <b>infringement</b> action will fail.|$|R

Article 3 of this Law stipulates that the bringing in and <b>the</b> taking out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, as well as the import and export of dangerous narcotics without a legal approval are punished with prison from 10 - 20 years and with <b>the</b> interdiction <b>of</b> certain rights. In paragraph 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same article it is mentioned that whether the deeds enumerated in paragraph 1 refer to narcotics of a very high risk, the prison penalty is from 15 - 25 years and <b>the</b> interdiction <b>of</b> certain rights. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infringement</b> referring to <b>the</b> international traffic <b>of</b> narcotics is made in conformity with the structure mentioned in the doctrine and includes: the object and <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infringement,</b> <b>the</b> constitutive content: the objective aspect including the material element, the immediate consequence and the casualty connection; <b>the</b> subjective aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>infringement,</b> as well as form and modalities <b>of</b> these <b>infringements</b> and <b>the</b> respective applicable sanctions...|$|R
