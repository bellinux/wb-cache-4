5000|$|In [...] "Equinoctial" [...] two {{factions of}} Symb Pairs {{are engaged in}} a Holy War. One faction is intent on {{coloring}} the second ("B") ring of <b>Saturn</b> <b>red</b> using genetically engineered bacteria, as a kind of cosmic statement. The other faction intend to prevent this and reverse any coloring they find. Both sides are deadly serious in this, the one considering the coloring of the rings a Holy Mission fully worth the devotion of one's life and justifying the killing of anyone interfering with this task; the other faction is equally sure that coloring the rings is a Sacrilege grave enough to kill those involved in it and to devote one's life to reversing it. The struggle is expected to last for millennia as each side tries to out-populate the other, often by kidnapping each other's children - and it seems the rest of the Eight Worlds are content to let them continue their war, no one trying to stop it and make peace. A third faction lives in the outer [...] "A" [...] ring and takes no part in the war, preferring to produce art to sell as needed. Although Saturn is a gas giant like Jupiter, the Invaders clearly have no interest in it, or any human activity in its vicinity.|$|E
40|$|This Diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{degradation}} of dyes <b>Saturn</b> <b>Red</b> L 4 B (Direct Red 79) and Saturn Blue LB (Direct Blue 106) by DC diaphragm discharge (DC-DD). Supplied power was between 160 and 180  W. Conductivity and pH were changing at each electrode area during the DC diaphragm discharge, therefore the effect of pH and conductivity changes on the dye solution itself were examined. All samples were measured by UV-VIS spectrometer in the wavelength range of  300 – 800  nm. No significant dependence of dye absorption spectra on conductivity was observed, while pH significantly affected the absorption curves of dyes. Ageing of dye spectra showed significant changes of <b>Saturn</b> <b>Red</b> L 4 B. Next task was the comparison of dyes destruction efficiency by DC-DD, audiofrequency diaphragm discharge (AF-DD) and electrolysis. Dye decomposition by AF-DD was not observed at set conditions (voltage of 80 – 120  V, current of 2. 2  A and frequency of 2  kHz). In the case of DC diaphragm discharge the electrolysis played an important role. Decomposition efficiency of the dyes by electrolysis was up to  15  %. The pumping effect in the DC diaphragm discharge was also investigated. Although the individual electrode areas were linked only by a small pinhole in a nonconductive barrier (the pinhole diameter of 0. 3  mm), solutions of the anode and cathode compartment interacted with each other up to 10  %. Finally, the degradation products of <b>Saturn</b> <b>Red</b> L 4 B treated by DC-DD in two electrodes parts are also described. Decomposition products were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with the mass spectrometer...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the single-scattering phase {{function}} of Saturn's aerosols is determined from the vertical structure of Saturn's atmosphere, derived {{in a previous}} analysis, and Pioneer's imaging photometry of bright and dark zones on <b>Saturn</b> in <b>red</b> and blue light. The single-scattering phase function is well represented {{by a combination of}} two Henyey-Greenstein functions. Moderately forward scattering functions fit well both in red and blue light, although a definite difference between the two colors is found...|$|R

40|$|Fodder yeast (Kluyveromyces fragilis) {{cells were}} magnetically {{modified}} by a contact with thewater-based magnetic fluid {{in order to}} prepare {{a new type of}} magnetically responsive biocomposite material. This procedure enabled a simple separation of modified cells by means of commercially available magnetic separators or strong permanent magnets. It allows using the prepared material as a new inexpensive magnetic affinity adsorbent for the removal of water-soluble dyes. Magnetically modified cells were characterized by means of magnetic and microscopy methods. Both isolated magnetic nanoparticles and aggregates of particles were present on the cell surface. The prepared material displayed a superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, with a transition to a blocked state at TB 180 K for the applied magnetic field H= 50 Oe. Seven dyes (crystal violet, amido black 10 B, congo <b>red,</b> <b>Saturn</b> blue LBRR, Bismarck brown, acridine orange and safranin O) were used to study the adsorption process. The dyes adsorption could be described with the Langmuir isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacities ranged between 29. 9 (amido black 10 B) and 138. 2 (safranin O) mg of dye per g of dried magnetically modified cells...|$|R
