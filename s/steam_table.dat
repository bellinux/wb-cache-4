Learning to use the <b>steam</b> <b>tables</b> has traditionally been {{an important component of}} success in entry level thermodynamics. Numerous alternatives have become available over the years and this study is an assessment of the continuing need for students to learn and use printed <b>steam</b> <b>tables.</b> Vapor tables are currently available in a web format and as stand alone programs for PCs and handheld devices such as the Palm Pilot. The number of vapor tables available in electronic format forces engineering professors to look at the usefulness of teaching students to use the printed tables. A substantial number of faculty still feel that learning to use the printed tables teaches a useful skill and continue to use it before or instead of electronic tables. A growing number of faculties have opted to use the time savings from using the tables for other aspects of the course. This paper is a survey of faculty, students, and engineers in related fields on how useful it is to teach students to use printed <b>steam</b> <b>tables.</b> Also included in the paper is a summary of the most popular delivery formats and programs...|$|R

2500|$|... and {{the energy}} is easier to recycle using heat exchangers. [...] The energy {{requirements}} can be calculated from <b>steam</b> <b>tables.</b> For example, to heat water from 25°C to steam at 250°C at 1atm requires 2869kJ/kg. To heat water at 25°C to liquid water at 250°C at 5MPa requires only 976kJ/kg. It is also possible to recover much of the heat (say 75%) from superheated water, and therefore energy use for superheated water extraction is less than one sixth that needed for steam distillation. This also means that the energy contained in superheated water is insufficient to vaporise the water on decompression. In the above example, only 30% of the water would be converted to vapour on decompression from 5MPa to atmospheric pressure.|$|R
2500|$|At {{temperatures}} below 300°C {{water is}} fairly incompressible, {{which means that}} pressure has {{little effect on the}} physical properties of water, provided it is sufficient to maintain a liquid state. This pressure is given by the saturated vapour pressure, and can be looked up in <b>steam</b> <b>tables,</b> or calculated. As a guide, the saturated vapour pressure at 121°C is 200kPa, 150°C is 470kPa, and 200°C is 1,550kPa. [...] The critical point is 21.7MPa at a temperature of 374°C, above which water is supercritical rather than superheated. Above about 300°C, water starts to behave as a near-critical liquid, and physical properties such as density start to change more significantly with pressure. However, higher pressures increase the rate of extractions using superheated water below 300°C. This could be due to effects on the substrate, particularly plant materials, rather than changing water properties.|$|R
