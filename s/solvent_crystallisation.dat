The structural features of the membranes can be well explained using the proposed membrane formation mechanism, where the effect of cooling rate is rationalised.

Different crystallised lactose particles were obtained from binary mixtures of butanol:acetone. The sieved fractions (63 - 90 μm) of crystallised lactose were characterised in terms of size, shape, flowability, true density and aerosolisation performance (using multiple twin stage impinger (MSLI), Aerolizer ® inhaler device, and salbutamol sulphate as a model drug). Compared to commercial lactose, crystallised lactose particles were less elongated, covered with fine lactose particles, and had a rougher surface morphology. The crystallised lactose powders had a considerably lower bulk and tap density and poorer flow when compared to commercial lactose. Engineered carrier with better flow showed improved drug content homogeneity, reduced amounts of drug " deposited" on the inhaler device and throat, and a smaller drug aerodynamic diameter upon inhalation. Aerodynamic diameter of salbutamol sulphate increased as lactose aerodynamic diameter decreased (linear, R 2 = 0. 9191) and/or as fine particle lactose content increased (linear, R 2 = 0. 8653). Improved drug aerosolisation performance in the case of crystallised lactose particles was attributed to lower drug-carrier adhesion forces due to a rougher surface and higher fine particle content.

40|$|Crystallisation, one of {{the oldest}} unit operations, is of major {{economic}} importance in the hydrometallurgical industry for the separation and/or production of inorganic metal compounds in the form of good quality crystals, both in terms of purity and size. However, industrial crystallisation techniques usually have high energy requirements (e. g. evaporative crystallisation) and the residual solutions are often extremely corrosive, resulting in elevated operating and maintenance costs. Additionally, the majority of industrial crystallisation methods do not render to the appropriate supersaturation control, therefore the produced salts are agglomerates of fine crystallites with heavy solution entrainment and contamination. In this work, the <b>Solvent</b> Displacement <b>Crystallisation</b> (SDC) technique is investigated as an attractive alternative to the conventional crystallisation methods. SDC involves the addition of low-boiling point, water-miscible organic solvents (MOS) to aqueous solutions to cause salt precipitation based on the salting out effect. The crystals are separated by filtration whereas the solvent is subsequently recovered for reuse by low-temperature distillation. The present work was initiated with the main objective to develop a solid scientific understanding of the SDC process and propose specific applications to hydrometallurgical systems of practical interest. Criteria for the selection of organic solvents with suitable physical and chemical properties have been established and various compounds screened to determine their amenability to SDC; 2 -propanol was selected as an effective salting out agent to cause precipitation of most metallic sulphates of practical interest from acidic solutions and opted for use in further studies. Differences in crystallisation behaviour among the various metal sulphates were attributed to differences in hydration energy (the energy required for a hydrated ion to be separated from its bound water). N{{one of the}} tested metal chlorides could be successfully separated from HCl-H 2 O system with 2 -propanol.

This thesis em- ploys computational models at atomistic and coarse-grained levels to investigate the crystallisation of diesel fuel and the effect of additives upon the crystallisation process. In the first results section, a model for diesel fuel is introduced and a strategy for investigating its crystallisation is developed. Crystallisation was observed from pure n-tricosane, binary and tertiary mixtures of paraffins of similar chain lengths. These systems were found to crystallise into hexagonally arranged lamellae. The presence of different length alkanes was found to create gauche disorders, leading to the formation of lamellar layers with softer edges. It was also found that crystal growth could be simulated more efficiently {{in the presence of a}} positionally restrained crystal, acting as a nucleation centre. Subsequently, crystallisation of paraffins, and the solvent effect upon it, was studied. This allowed to establish behavioural trends characteristic for aromatic and aliphatic <b>solvents.</b> Finally, paraffin <b>crystallisation</b> in the presence of four common additives was investigated. A common mode of action for these additives was identified, based upon partial co-crystallisation of additive alkyl chains and paraffin molecules. The main drawback of atomistic simulation is the computational cost, which limits both the time and length scales accessible on modern computers. In order to overcome these inherent limitations, a coarse grained model was developed for a range of n-alkanes.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemistry)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2015. Solvatomorphism of {{an active}} {{pharmaceutical}} ingredient (API) {{is one of the}} most studied areas in pharmaceutical science. Since APIs are exposed to solvents during many stages of their production, knowledge of the consequences from such exposure is essential. Salt formation has been known to improve some physicochemical properties of an API. Amongst these properties, API solubility {{is one of the most}} important characteristics as their use in the market is determined by this feature. Research presented here investigated the solvates and salts of mefenamic acid (MA) and tolfenamic acid (TFA); both representing fenamic acids belonging to a class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Solvates were obtained by reactions of TFA and MA with the solvents 2 -picoline, 3 -picoline, 4 -picoline, 3 -bromopyridine and 3 -chloropyridine. A solvate polymorph of MA and 2 -picoline was isolated. The salts were obtained by using diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, 1 -methylpiperazine, and triethylamine in combination with the fenamic acids. Morpholine formed a salt with TFA, but not with MA. Instead a zwitterionic form of MA was synthesised when the latter was mixed with morpholine. The resulting compounds were characterised and their crystal structures analysed. It was found that the conformation of the acids in the solvate and the salt compounds differed. Moreover, within the solvates, the conformation of the fenamate backbone varied depending on the acid and the <b>solvent</b> used for <b>crystallisation.</b> Although similar <b>solvents</b> were utilized, the structural packing arrangements of TFA solvates were very different from the arrangements associated with MA. The thermal analyses of the salts/solvates were determined by using both thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. The compounds were further investigated after manual grinding and the preparation of slurries. These preparation methods were successful for most compounds but not for MA• 2 PIC and (MA-) (EDM+). Instead, the recrystallization, grinding and slurry investigations of MA• 2 PIC yielded a polymorph of this particular solvate. In the case of (MA-) (EDM+), the PXRD results obtained from both the pulverised and slurry samples were completely different from one another and also from those determined for the starting materials.

40|$|Polymorphism in {{pharmaceutical}} drug crystals causes {{differences in}} their bioavailability, stability and processability. Hence, identifying different crystal polymorphs of an active ingredient {{during the early stages}} of drug development and controlling crystal polymorphism during the manufacturing process are important aspects of pharmaceutical crystallisation. Nucleation and growth of different polymorphs in a crystallising solution are regulated by a delicate balance between thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Crystal nucleation predominantly occurs via heterogeneous nucleation pathway as it is energetically favourable than homogeneous nucleation. Template-induced nucleation approach aims to utilise the advantage of heterogeneous nucleation to induce nucleation of specific crystal polymorphs through interfacial interactions between a preformed solid surface and solute molecules at the nucleation stage. In template-induced crystallisation, templates with specific surface properties that can act as heterogeneous nucleation sites are introduced in contact with the crystallising solution. Specific interactions between the template surface and solute molecules are known to influence nucleation and growth of crystal polymorphs. However, the effects of template surface chemistry and other operating conditions such as temperature and supersaturation on template-induced crystallisation is not clearly understood. Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} probe the combined effects of surface chemistry, crystallisation temperature, supersaturation, and <b>solvent</b> on template-induced <b>crystallisation</b> experimentally and consequent development of a molecular modelling approach to study template-induced nucleation. This could help in establishing template-induced nucleation as a method to achieve preferential nucleation of crystal polymorphs and to support template chemistry as a novel parameter for polymorph screenings. Carbamazepine (CBZ) was selected as the model drug compound and silanised glass vials were chosen as the template surfaces. CBZ crystallisation from ethanol solutions on templates with cyano functional surface groups led to selective nucleation of metastable form II crystals while the control surfaces resulted in concomitant nucleation of both form II and stable form III crystals. On mercapto and fluoro templates, CBZ crystallised preferentially as form III polymorph. These variations in the polymorphic outcome with template chemistry, temperature and supersaturation were mapped on to template-induced polymorphic domain (TiPoD) plots. The analysis of TiPoD plots showed that the template-induced nucleation mechanism was prominent within a narrow range of supersaturation across the temperature range studied. The influence of solvents on template-induced nucleation of CBZ polymorphs was also investigated by constructing TiPoD plots in five different solvents. These studies revealed that the templates were less effective in altering polymorphic outcome in highly polar solvent in comparison with the less polar solvents. Interfacial interactions between the template surface and CBZ crystal polymorphs were calculated through molecular modelling. The simulation results suggest that those templates exhibiting favourable interaction energies with the dominant crystal facets of a specific polymorph preferentially induce nucleation of that crystal form.
