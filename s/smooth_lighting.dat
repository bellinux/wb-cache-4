40|$|We are {{introducing}} new effective {{computer model}} for extracting nationality from frontal image candidate using face part color, size and distances based on deep research. Determining face part size, color, and distances is depending {{on a variety}} of factors including image quality, lighting condition, rotation angle, occlusion and facial emotion. Therefore, first we need to detect a face on the image then convert an image into the real input. After that, we can determine image candidate gender, face shape, key points and face parts. Finally, we will return the result, based on the comparison of sizes and distances with the sample measurement table database. While we were measuring samples, there were big differences between images by their gender and face shapes. Input images must be the frontal face image that has <b>smooth</b> <b>lighting</b> and does not have any rotation angle. The model can be used in military, police, defense, healthcare, and technology sectors. Finally, Computer can distinguish nationality from the face image.

40|$|Summary form only given. There is {{a strong}} {{worldwide}} drive to efficient general lighting using white light emitting diodes (LEDs) [1, 2]. White LEDs often consist of a semiconductor diode [3, 4, 5] combined with luminescent phosphors [5] to convert part of the blue light to green yellow, and red. In state-of-the art white-light LEDs one exploits multiple scattering of light [1, 2]. The transport of light then becomes diffusive, which serves to obtain a desirable <b>smooth</b> <b>lighting</b> without hot spots and without angular color distribution. Moreover, photons are recycled so that thin phosphor layers serve to improve cost efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Central challenges {{in the understanding of}} white LEDs arise from limitations in the physical understanding of the combined multiple light scattering and energy conversion in phosphors. LEDs are currently described by raytracing and Monte Carlo techniques [1, 2]. Unfortunately, LED spectra cannot be predicted quantitatively, as optical parameters must be adjusted to be inconsistent with other data. These limitations hamper the design and development of efficient white LEDs. An improved description of multiple light scattering could be obtained by analytical theories originating from nanophotonics, invoking detailed nanostructure of a sample. We have measured diffuse optical transmission and reflectivity through diffuser plates typical of a commercial white LED (Fortimo). Using photonic diffusion theory we derive the transport mean free path [6 - 8]. With increasing scatterer density the mean free path decreases. To interpret the results, we use an ab initio model without free parameters by combining Mie theory with known properties, such as the scatterer size distribution taken from SEM. Our model predicts mean free paths in dramatically improved agreement with our data, without adjustable parameters [9]. We will discuss consequences for light scattering in white lighting modules...|$|E
