40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{three most}} {{expensive}} wildland fire suppression seasons have occurred since 2000, each exceeding 1 billion. Many problems and {{issues have been}} highlighted including the grounding of the federal air tanker fleet, training problems with private contractors, overspending, poor management strategies, negative public pefceptions, and the inability to utilize the safest and most efficient suppression resources available. Technology used by today's loggers has revolutionized many aspects of forest operations. The equipment available can safely and efficiently move earth, cut trees, remove dangerous fuels, and reduce the hazardous exposure to people. Because many of these tasks overlap those of wildland fire suppression, it is logical to incorporate these machines into firefighting. Private landowners are already {{required by law to}} fight fires in the state of Oregon, and the suppression systems employed may be successfully applied on larger federal fires. The biggest factor for investigating the potentials of logging machinery is safety, especially the protection that machine cabs offer.

This is a challenge with respect to the long time <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the whole <b>equipment.</b> especially the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the electronic components which acquire the signals of the Ge- 71 decay events in proportional counters.

The background is minimized by low-level techniques. In addition, Ge- 71 decays are distinguished from background events by pulse shape analyses. The background rejection efficiency is directly correlated with the signal to noise ratio of the recorded events. A method is described which increases the signal to noise ratio or the acquired ionization events and allows to distinguish between detector signals and noise picked up from the detector environment. This method can be applied not only for proportional counters but also for many other detectors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Hydrodynamics is complex in essence, mainly because the possible volumes are depending on the operating conditions, {{which in turn has}} consequences on the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> in unsteady state conditions. In this work, we attempt to model the hydrodynamics in the zone of separation of the flows in a pilot plant equipment by using different flow configurations. Use is made of fluid Residence Time Distribution (RTD) experiments performed in the absence of solids. The moments method is used to discriminate between four different models before any attempt to compare the RTD curves. A first model comprising two dispersion‐convection zones, each in the upper and bottom part, is rejected for its poor physical meaning. The discussion analyzed the merits of the last three models representing the zone of separation of the inlet flow by various associations of perfectly mixed cells. The simplest configuration, a perfectly mixed zone plus a plug flow zone in each part of the apparatus, is also the more versatile. However, it is rivalled by models allowing ascending flows from the bottom part. The dependency of the internal volumes with flow rates and flow ratios is examined as well as the potentialities of application of such models in the presence of solids...|$|R

Although classification systems for other paralympic sports, including wheelchair basketball, Nordic skiing and athletics, examine trunk impairment, these systems are largely based on expert opinion, similar to the classification system for wheelchair rugby [7 - 9]. Previous research indicates trunk muscle strength, trunk coordination and trunk range of movement determine: a) trunk position which impacts on force application on the hand rims, b) trunk stability which decreases paradoxical movements, making arm movements and force application more effective and c) trunk movement which determines the range of the push rim {{that can be used in}} each push stroke. Therefore, trunk impairment may impact significantly on wheelchair propulsion, especially in high resistance wheeling such as accelerating from standstill [10, 11]. However, some significant activities determining wheelchair sport performance were not assessed (e.g. reach, turning and maintaining balance after perturbation). Furthermore, the impact of impairment on performance in wheelchair sports can be modified by equipment [12]. Athletes in wheelchair court sports always perform using equipment. The minimum equipment is a sports wheelchair that is usually custom made. In addition, many athletes use belts and straps to improve force generation. Athletes who have trunk impairment also use straps to increase <b>stability.</b> The use <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> is not considered in determining the sports class according to the IPC classification code [4].
