30|$|Recent {{interest}} to semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is conditioned by new physical properties of these zero-dimensional objects, which are conditioned by size-quantization (SQ) {{effect of the}} charge carriers (CCs) [1 – 3]. Such new structures were obtained by means of interrupted growth of QDs within <b>semiconductor</b> <b>media.</b> Development of new growth technologies, in particular such as Stranski-Krastanov epitaxial method, made possible development of QDs having various shapes and dimensions. It is known that energy spectrum of CCs of a QD is fully quantized and similar to the energy spectra of atoms, in view of that the QDs are often called “artificial atoms” [4]. Most of the {{research in this area}} is focused on studies of the spherical QDs. However during last years the ellipsoidal, pyramidal, cylindrical and lens-shaped QDs are also undergoing theoretical and experimental investigations [5 – 10]. Due to presence of strong SQ effect in the mentioned objects the physical characteristics of CCs in such systems strongly depend on the geometrical shapes of QDs. Even slight variation of the shapes significantly affects the CC spectrum [11, 12]. In other words, QD geometric shapes and dimensions may serve as useful tools for CC energy spectrum and other characteristic parameters variation inside a QD for various practical applications in systems comprised of QD ensembles. Monitored ‘shaping’ during the process of growth makes possible simulation and development of samples with desired physical parameters.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of semi-conducting organic materials has opened new possibilities for electronic devices and systems {{because of their}} solution processibility, lightweight and flexibility compared to inorganic semiconductors. The combination of semiconductors with electrolytes, and more especially organic semiconductors and solid electrolytes has {{attracted the attention of}} researchers because of the multiple phenomena originating from the simultaneous motion of electrons and ions. This thesis deals with organic-based devices whose working mechanism involves electrolytes. By measuring electrochromism induced by the field in isolated segments of conjugated polymer films, which is in contact with an electrolyte, the direction and the magnitude of the electric field along an electrolyte is quantified (paper I). In addition, using a polyanionic proton conductor in organic field-effect transistor (OFET) as gate dielectric results in low operation voltage and fast response thanks to the high capacitance of the electric double layer (EDLC) that is formed at organic semiconductor/ polyelectrolyte interface (paper III). Because an electrolyte is used as a gate insulator, the effect of the ionic currents on the performance of an EDLC-OFET has been investigated by varying the relative humidity of the device ambience (paper IV). Since the EDLC-OFET and the electrochromic display cell both are operated at low voltages, the transistor has been monolithically integrated with an electrochromic pixel, i. e. combining a solid state device and an electrochemical device (paper V). Further, a theoretical study of the electrostatic potential within a so called pen-heterojunction made up of two semi-infinite, doped <b>semiconductor</b> <b>media</b> separated by an electrolyte region is reported (paper II) ...|$|E

Radioisotope micro-power sources (RIMS) hold great promise for the development of small power sources for use in numerous applications, including micro electromechanical (MEMS) systems, due to the five orders of magnitude difference in the specific energy density available in radioactive decay versus chemical reactions. While a number of conversion schemes can be employed in RIMS, direct voltaic conversion technologies are compatible with the semiconductor manufacturing processes used in MEMS. A direct conversion solid-state betavoltaic RIMS device consists of a p-n semiconductor coupled with a beta-emitting radionuclide. Liquid semiconductor betavoltaic devices were investigated simultaneously with the solid-state designs as an alternative concept designed to minimize radiation induced lattice damage that occurs in solid-state devices formed through interaction with high-energy charged particles. A liquid semiconductor RIMS device operates similarly to a solid-state semiconductor; however, the device uses Schottky and ohmic contacts that encapsulate a radionuclide in its liquid state. Radioisotopes used for the fabrication of solidstate semiconductor sources include ₃₃P and ₁₄₇Pm.

30|$|The {{situation}} is radically changed when the effective {{mass of the}} impurity center (hole) {{is comparable to the}} mass of the electron. For example, in the narrow-gap semiconductors for which the CC standard (parabolic) dispersion law is violated, the effective masses of the electron and light hole are equal [11 – 14]. It is obvious {{that in the case of}} equal effective masses, adiabatic approximation is not applicable. A similar situation arises in considering the Coulomb interaction of the electron-positron pair. Antiparticle doping in semiconductor systems with reduced dimensionality greatly increases the possibilities of external manipulation of the physical properties of these nanostructures and widens the area of potential applications of devices based on them. On the other hand, such an approach makes real the study of the changes of the properties of antiparticles’ complexes formed in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>media</b> under the influence of SQ. Combinations of particle-antiparticle pairs may form exotic atomic states, the most well-known example being positronium (Ps), the bound state between an electron and positron [15, 16]. There are two types of Ps: orthopositronium (parallel orientation of the spins) and parapositronium (antiparallel orientation). Orthopositronium has a lifetime τ ~ 1.4 × 10 − 7 s and annihilates with the emission of three gamma quanta, which by three orders exceed the lifetime of parapositronium [17 – 19]. Ps lifetime is long enough that it has a well-defined atomic structure. Thus, in other studies [20 – 23], the authors experimentally detected the occurrence of a positronium and its molecules in the structure of porous silicon and also detected positron lines of light absorption. Wheeler supposed that two positronium atoms might combine to form the dipositronium molecule (Ps 2) [24]. Schrader theoretically studied this molecule [25]. Because Ps has a short lifetime and it is difficult to obtain low energy positrons in large numbers, dipositronium has not been observed unambiguously. Mills and Cassidy’s group showed that dipositronium was created on internal pore surfaces when intense positron bursts are implanted into a thin film of porous silica. Moreover, in another study [26], the authors report observations of transitions between the ground state of Ps 2 and the excited state. These results experimentally confirm the existence of the dipositronium molecule. As a purely leptonic, macroscopic quantum matter–antimatter system, this would be of interest in its own right, but it would also represent a milestone on the path to produce an annihilation gamma-ray laser [27]. Further, in another work [21], porous silica film contains interconnected pores with a diameter d < 4 nm. From abovementioned follows that it is logically necessary to discuss size quantization effects related with this topic. In [28], additional quantization effects on the Ps states conditioned by QD confinement have been revealed along with quantization conditioned by Coulomb interaction in the framework of the standard (parabolic) dispersion law of CCs.|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} four-wave mixing in <b>semiconductor</b> laser <b>media</b> is {{developed}} {{by considering the}} contributions of both the gain and index gratings created by the carrier-density modulation occurring at the beat frequency of the pump and the probe waves.

In contrast to the conventional interferometric switches, we will report on experimental results obtained with a novel all-optical Gain-Transparent (GT) SOA switch. The key element in the switch is a polarization insensitive 1. 3 mu m MQW-SOA into which a data signal (1. 55 mu m) and a control signal (1. 3 mu m) are injected...|$|R

The AIS is responsible for process technology and the IPA is responsible for production technology. At the IPA are 5 research and development groups: - Test center for semiconductor manufacturing equipment - Information processing for <b>semiconductor</b> manufacturing - <b>Media</b> supply and removal systems - Development of cleanroom handling systems - Systems for logistics and flexible production cleanrooms...|$|R
40|$|Optically pumped {{semiconductor}} disk lasers (SDLs) {{provide a}} unique combination of high output power, high beam quality and possible emission wavelengths spanning from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared spectral range. In essence, SDLs combine the wave-length versatility of <b>semiconductor</b> gain <b>media</b> {{with the power}} scaling principles of op-tically pumped solid state disk lasers. The emission wavelength of SDLs can be tailored to match the desired application simply by altering {{the composition of the}} gain material. High power operation, however, requires efficient thermal management, which can be realized using thin structures that are integrated with industrial diamond heat spreaders. The main objective of this thesis was to develop methods for increasing the output power of optically pumped SDLs, especially in challenging wavelength regions. The work included integrating SDL gain elements onto diamond heat spreaders using thin intermediate gold layers. This configuration enabled 45 – 50 % higher output powers than conventional bonding with indium solder. In addition, the reflectivity of the SDL gain mirror was enhanced using a semiconductor-dielectric-metal compound mirror. Thi...|$|R
40|$|An {{original}} {{approach is}} suggested to analysis of full quantum Liouville equation for single electron (quantum particle) interacting with ideal phonon gas (harmonic boson thermostat). It is shown {{that under the}} thermodynamic limit this equation can be exactly reduced {{to a system of}} evolution equations connecting density matrix of the electron and its simplest irreducible correlations with amplitudes of one, two, three and more phonon modes. Possible application of these new equations to explanation of the electron mobility 1 /f-type fluctuations in <b>semiconductors</b> and other <b>media</b> is discussed. The special case of electron in static disorder is also considered. Comment: 19 pages, no figures, LATEX 2 e iopar...|$|R
