40|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{international}} framework to regulate sovereign debt restructuring, investment arbitration has recently been seen as a potential forum for holdout creditors and vulture funds to seek to enforce sovereign debt instruments.

30|$|The RMB {{exchange}} rate {{is a key}} variable that can affect {{the internal and external}} equilibrium of the national economy in an open economic environment, and the stock market is capable of quickly reflecting subtle changes in the real economy. The information exchange mechanism between the two markets is dynamic and complicated. For the stability of the financial markets and the healthy and rapid development of national economy, the following policy recommendations are offered. First, the government should strengthen risk management in financial markets and improve the efficiency of financial supervision. The focus of our country’s financial efforts should proceed with {{exchange rate}} management and regulation in an orderly manner and ensure the security and stability of our country’s economy and financial markets. Under the expectation of RMB appreciation, relevant departments should strengthen the supervision of <b>speculative</b> <b>funds</b> to prevent large-scale hot money inflows from causing extensive shocks to the stock market. Second, the government should develop the RMB derivatives market and enrich risk aversion tools to secure the foreign exchange market. Presently, effective financial derivative hedging instruments are apparently insufficient in our country. Even worse, the government’s regulation of the RMB exchange rate floating range in the foreign exchange market resulted in domestic companies not pay attention to the volatility in exchange rates and the worse trend toward currency risk aversion. As the reform of the RMB exchange rate mechanism continues, foreign exchange risk faced by Chinese enterprises is increasing and the demand for exchange rate hedging instruments along with it. Therefore, it is extremely urgent for our country to improve the RMB derivatives market, offer various financial derivative hedging tools, and improve enterprise risk awareness and risk management capabilities. Third, the government should make good use of RMB appreciation, which is a double-edged sword, and provide guidance for a healthy market to development. Presently, China’s economy is running well. Further appreciation may {{have an impact on the}} export industry in short term. However, in the long term, this new round of exchange rate reform will be of great benefit to the restructuring of China’s economy and the curbing of inflation expectations. If use this double-edged sword of RMB appreciation well, it can contribute significantly to the healthy and transparent exchange of inter-market information and ultimately achieve the goal of safe and stable operations in all our financial markets.|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, many countries are hoping that massive increases in their money supplies will revive their economies. Evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy using traditional statistical methods would require the construction of an extremely complex economic model of the world that showed how each country’s situation affected all other countries. No matter how complex that model was, it would always be subject to the criticism that it had omitted important variables. Omitting important variables from traditional statistical methods ruins all estimates and statistics. This paper uses a relatively new statistical method that solves the omitted variables problem. This technique produces a separate slope estimate for each observation which makes it possible to see how the estimated relationship has changed over time due to omitted variables. I find that the effectiveness of monetary policy has fallen between the first quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2012 by 14 %, 36 %, 38 %, 32 %, 29 % and 69 % for Japan, the UK, the USA, the Euro area, Brazil, and the Russian Federation respectively.

40|$|The 1990 s {{have been}} a decade of {{upheaval}} in international financial markets. Much {{of the responsibility for}} financial instability has been placed on speculators, particularly hedge <b>funds.</b> <b>Speculative</b> capital has been characterized as "hot money", with capital flows driven by "herding" and "contagion" among players in foreign-exchange, stock, bond, and commodity markets. Policies to deal with financial instability by weakening, or even disabling speculation, have been based largely on anecdote, convenience (speculators have long served as scapegoats for various problems), and ideology, rather than careful analysis. Part of the problem arises from the secrecy with which speculators operate. Since speculative trading cannot easily be observed, it is difficult to assess speculators' contribution, if any, to financial volatility. This paper looks at speculative behavior in one of the largest, and most volatile, international financial markets, petroleum derivatives. It utilizes a large, detailed database on individual trader positions in crude-oil and heating-oil futures markets. The paper is exploratory, focusing on measuring and assessing the tendency of speculators to herd. Two theories behind rational herding behavior are examined - the asymmetric information view (poorly-informed traders make decisions based on observing well-informed traders, rather than market fundamentals) and the monitoring/incentive view (institutiona investors make decisions knowing that their incentives are based on performance relative to a benchmark such as mean returns for a group). These theories generate different predictions regarding the types of speculators most likely to herd. The evidence does not support the view that herding among speculators as a group is widespread in this market. In contrast, evidence in favor of a moderate degree of herding among one group of speculators, commodity-fund managers. The evidence is supportive of the monitoring/incentive theory, but not the asymmetric-information theory. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{discussing}} {{the causes and}} consequences of large capital inflows to developing countries, the author emphasizes two things. First, although there are legitimate grounds for an optimistic long-term outlook on private capital flows to developing countries, {{there is little to}} suggest that the volatility of capital flows will end. In designing policy strategies to accommodate this volatility, a premium should be put on credibility, resilience, and flexibility. Second, country differences notwithstanding, host countries need to respect the basics of adjustment and finance in designing their policy response to large inflows. Host countries that want to keep using the nominal exchange rate as their key nominal anchor and that do not want to accept much appreciation in their real exchange rate must be prepared to tighten fiscal policy. This is the most reliable way to reduce aggregate demand, keep inflation in check, and limit deterioration of the current account. Regarding sterilization policy, domestic interest rates will be higher {{and the size of the}} inflow will be larger with sterilization than without it. Not that sterilization necessarily need be avoided; in the early stages of inflow, it can help moderate or even offset the induced expansion of domestic credit. But with high capital mobility, sterilization becomes more expensive and less effective the longer it is used. Effective regulation and supervision are important in ensuring the best use of large inflows of foreign resources. It makes a big difference, for example, if banks use their higher reserves to lend for productive investment and human capital formation than if they use them to <b>fund</b> <b>speculative</b> activities that eventually translate into nonperforming loans (and perhaps a large public sector liability as well). Careful assessment of credit risk and of maturity mismatches are essential if banks are to help the private sector earn a rate of return greater than the cost of capital. Similarly, good disclosure and accounting standards are essential for accurate pricing of risk in both banking and securities markets. These and similar measures are worth implementing even without large capital inflows. Beyond dealing with surges in capital inflows, host countries must decide the optimal speed at which they wish to move toward full capital account liberalization.

Six main lessons are identified: (i) a commitment to achieving and maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, especially prudent fiscal policy, should underpin market development; (ii) a sound and transparent public debt management strategy supports secondary market activity; (iii) a deep and diverse investor base is required; (iv) poor market infrastructure leads to high transaction costs, slow order execution, and excessive operational risk, which all inhibit trading; (v) secondary market growth is facilitated by effective monetary policy implementation; and (vi) reforms should be sequenced to ensure even development of all the structures supporting the secondary market.

40|$|D. Comm. (Economic and Management Sciences) The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} dynamics of Mexico's external economic relations during the period 1968 - 1995. Since the early seventies, the workings of the international monetary system has been governed Illore by implicit rules and conventions based on sound market principles than rules as were the case under the fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods. These "rules of the game" dictated that if a country {{wanted to be part of}} the global village and reap the benefits thereof, such a country should adhere to market forces and administer its monetary-fiscal policy in such a way as to ensure that the delicate balance between the domestic and international economic environment is maintained. In the event of a deviation from these rules, a country, in this instance Mexico, would fmd itself in a. position where it is heavily penalised for not playing according to the rules of the game. Starting in 1976, the Mexican economy was characterised by ongoing exchange rate crises, which seemed to be a recurring phenomenon repeating itself more or less every six years. Time and again a misalignment in Mexico's monetary-fiscal policy led to a build-up of pressures and tensions in the external accounts of the country, especially the balance of payments and eventually disruption of the economic growth process and relations with the external world. The Mexican economy was time and again subject to a rapidly growing current account deficit, rising external foreign debt, a rising overall fiscal deficit fuelled by - xiii - expansionary government expenditure policies and the slavish adherence to a fixed exchange rate regime. The growing fiscal deficit was in all instances financed by either increased short-term, highly volatile portfolio capital, or a depletion of the country's gold and foreign reserve holdings. The discovery of large oil reserves in 1978 lessened the need for structural adjustment and the following of more prudent policy measures. Rising domestic inflation and the fixed exchange rate gave rise to an ongoing real appreciation of the peso, which undermined the competitiveness of the domestic economy and distorted the balance between domestic savings and consumption. The appreciation of the peso and the high import propensity of the domestic households led to sharp increases in imports and rather static export earnings. The vulnerability of the domestic economy was exacerbated by developments in the country's external environment. These exogenous shocks took the form of either a decline in the international oil-prices and/or a more hostile international financing environment characterised by higher. interest rates and stricter borrowing requirements. The combination of domestic financial tensions and negative developments in the country's external environment were often, especially in 1994, accompanied by domestic political upheavals.. Time and again the apparent unsustainable domestic and external disparities and the heavy reliance on <b>speculative</b> foreign <b>funding</b> led to a change in investor views of the future of the Mexican peso. Capital flights and continued speculation eventually led to a situation where the authorities could no longer manage to maintain the parity of the peso. The market subsequently forced a devaluation and/or depreciation of the peso. The exchange rate crises of 1976, 1982, 1986 - 87 and 1994 appear to have been the result of a monetary-fiscal policy stance in which the government played a relatively central role. The role of the government and its hold over the Bank of Mexico led to a situation where the Mexican economy was out of touch with developments in its external economic and financial environment. Interesting though, is the way in which the government, especially the Salinas administration, refused to follow a more marketoriented macroeconomic policy with reference to the exchange rate regime and monetary-fiscal policy in general. As the events that led to the collapse of the peso in - XIV - 1994 unfolded, it became evident that the overvalued peso was maintained solely for non-economic reasons. The manner in which the new Zedillo administration reacted to the sharp depreciation of the peso in 1994 and 1995 greatly influenced the further deterioration of the peso and Mexico's international position. The main {{objective of}} the international assistance provided to Mexico by the United States, the International Monetary Fun~ and other international institutions during the course of 1995 was to underpin the continued deterioration of the peso and the overall well-being of the Mexican economy. Although the Mexican authorities are bound by the conditions tied to the foreign fmancial assistance provided and are at this stage following a more market-oriented, less regulated economic policy, it remains to be seen whether the authorities will in future adhere more closely to the rules of the game of the international monetary system as embodied in the conventions dictated by the global village market...|$|R
