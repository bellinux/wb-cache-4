5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5|$|At a waterfall, {{another girl}} commits suicide by drowning. The girl, Carlin, looks {{identical}} to Lauren. Andrews performs an autopsy on Carlin as well, finding the same astrological symbol. It also {{becomes clear that}} the two girls are related—identical twins, born seven years apart. The girls are clones, produced using a technique {{similar to that used}} to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes theory, that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000.|$|E
5|$|If <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> {{found guilty}} of an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act.

5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E

Mason told TV Week that he thinks it is a shame Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or someone else is not clear. Mason added something big would happen and it may not end well for Chris.|$|E

Baron von Ghoul, the game's main antagonist, looks down from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and Amber. Amber is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the Ghouly Mansion, with Cooper in pursuit. Once inside the mansion, Cooper realises that Amber {{is nowhere to be}} seen in the Grand Hallway. Crivens, the mansion's butler, tells him to go to the archives where Amber is held. On the way, a huge group of boxing skeletons challenge Cooper to a boxing match, with Cooper emerging victorious. Upon reaching the archives, Cooper finds Amber being held hostage by a mad scientist named Dr. Krackpot. Krackpot then shoots Amber with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature.|$|E

However, she is {{approached}} by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before pulling into a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> hiding {{in the back seat}} of her car, and manages to bring her to the safety of his office. Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call.|$|E

5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
5|$|Liver AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} abnormal liver function {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. Liver biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful if <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, Logan {{is working}} as a logger in Canada, where {{he lives with his}} girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero {{approach}} Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.|$|E

5|$|The Resistance execute {{an attack}} on a Nazi {{research}} facility in London, bombing their base of operations, stealing secret documents and prototype stealth helicopters. The documents reveal the Nazis are relying on reverse-engineered technology derived from an ancient organization known as Da'at Yichud, which created such inventions as energy weapons, computer AI's, and super concrete; however, it is also revealed that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> tampering with the super concrete's formula, making it susceptible to mold deterioration. The Resistance discover a match with Da'at Yichud member Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), who is imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside the camp and meets Set, who tells him that the Nazis have been using technology made by him and other Jewish scientists to mass-produce and control robots, and offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the labor camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device that controls the camp robots, which he and Set then use to destroy the camp and rescue prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to {{what looks like a}} baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E
5|$|When <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> {{within range}} of a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them.

The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|E
