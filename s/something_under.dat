500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping <b>something</b> <b>under</b> the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by English street artist D*Face. Barker was a fan of his work, having bought many of his pieces at his {{galleries}} in the past. According to D*Face, the trio [...] "wanted the artwork to represent California, but with a subversive side to show that it's not always great and there's always <b>something</b> <b>under</b> the surface, in the underbelly." [...] The artist was particularly busy, and employed pre-existing but unfinished illustration for the album cover. He also offered two alternate pieces that were rejected, but later posted on NME website. Skiba and Barker were pleased, but Hoppus was not as immediately receptive, according to the artist. While he did not admit to being {{a fan of the}} group, D*Face was happy with the commission, commenting, [...] "To have a band with such a great legacy and talent like Blink ask to work with you is a great honour and privilege." ...|$|E
500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of [...] "not-so-straight" [...] girls. She replied [...] "Um, yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She {{went on to say that}} she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping <b>something</b> <b>under</b> the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “Those {{who read}} the Frankfurter Allgemeine {{all the way through}} to the culture section were able to read <b>something</b> <b>under</b> the title “The Past That Will Not Pass” that no German {{historian}} to date had noticed: that Auschwitz was only a copy of a Russian original – the Stalinist Gulag Archipelago.

2500|$|Botticelli {{continued}} {{to pay his}} dues to the Compagnia di San Luca (a confraternity rather than the artist's guild) until at least October 1505; the tentative date ranges assigned to his late paintings run no further than this. [...] By then he was aged sixty or more, in this period definitely into old age. Vasari, who lived in Florence from around 1527, says that Botticelli died [...] "ill and decrepit, {{at the age of}} seventy-eight", after a period when he was [...] "unable to stand upright and moving around with the help of crutches". [...] He died in May 1510, but is now thought to have been <b>something</b> <b>under</b> seventy at the time. [...] He was buried with his family outside the Ognissanti Church in a spot the church has now built over. [...] This had been his parish church since he was baptized there, and contained his Saint Augustine in His Study.|$|E
2500|$|Early-18th-century {{descriptions}} of the old town of Brighton (the present Lanes) concentrated on how small and low the houses were, and how the lower storeys were characteristically set slightly below ground level. [...] This, and {{the proximity of the}} houses to each other, may have offered protection against storms and flooding from the sea. (In one of the earliest {{descriptions of}} Brighton - a letter dated 1736 - the rector of Buxted claims that [...] "we live here underground almost ... the second storey is finished <b>something</b> <b>under</b> 12 feet.") [...] "Huddling together" [...] may have also helped the houses survive to the present day: they were poorly built and had little structural integrity. [...] Typical Lanes buildings are timber-framed and plastered with load-bearing walls of bungaroosh with some flint. Brick quoins and courses added strength, and façades were often studded with pebbles from the beach. [...] These would sometimes be coated with tar to keep water out, although this only became common in the early 19th century. [...] In The Lanes, such buildings can be seen at Bartholomews, Middle Street and Ship Street among others.|$|E
2500|$|A modular view of {{sentence}} processing {{assumes that}} the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modulates have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory, states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible {{in order to minimize}} effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence [...] "The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable," [...] by the time the reader gets to the word [...] "examined" [...] he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made {{despite the fact that it}} results in an implausible situation; we know from experience that evidence can rarely if ever examine <b>something.</b> <b>Under</b> this [...] "syntax first" [...] theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which [...] "the evidence" [...] is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach [...] "by the lawyer" [...] and must go back and re-parse the sentence. This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.|$|E
