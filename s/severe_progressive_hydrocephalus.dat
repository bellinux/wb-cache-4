We report on a case with <b>progressive</b> symptomatic <b>hydrocephalus</b> and BI complicating OI that was successfully treated by halo traction followed by posterior occipitocervical fusion. However, after a symptom free interval of 2 years the patient suffered from recurrence of symptomatic hydrocephalus needing additional ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Raised {{intracranial}} pressure (ICP) that {{is associated with}} hydrocephalus may lead to alterations in cerebral hemodynamics and ischemic changes in the brain. In infants with hydrocephalus, defining the right moment for surgical intervention based on clinical signs alone, can sometimes be a difficult task. Clinical signs of raised ICP are known to be unreliable and sometimes even misleading. Furthermore, when sutures are closed. ICP does not always correlate with the size of the ventricles nor with the clinical signs or symptoms. In this study we investigated whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be measured by quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in infants with <b>progressive</b> <b>hydrocephalus.</b> In addition, we investigated the relation between CBF and ICP, before and after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion. METHODS: Fifteen infants with <b>progressive</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> (aged between 1 day and 7 months) were investigated. All patients underwent anterior fontanelle pressure (AFP) measurement, MRA and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) measurement before and after CSF diversion. Brain volume was measured to compensate for the physiological increase of CBF during brain maturation in infants. RESULTS: The mean pre-operative ICP was 19. 1 cm H 20 (SD 8. 4). The mean post-operative ICP was 6. 7 cm H 20 (SD 4. 0) (...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Preoperative {{hydrocephalus}} {{is reported}} in about 80 % of posterior fossa tumor patients and in 15 - 40 % of cases postoperative treatment for persistent or <b>progressive</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> is required. There {{is no consensus}} on the way hydrocephalus should be managed before, during, and after PF surgery. Objective: To determine the presence of hidrocephalia in the tumors of the PF and the therapeutic focus in our means. Methods: We report a descriptive, retrospective study of 10 adult patients with posterior fossa mass lesions and obstructive hydrocephalus who were managed medically for compensate intracranial hypertension plus observation and were operated through posterior fossa craniectomy and tumor excision as unique method of surgical treatment. Results: In all 10 cases clinical improvement was obtained immediately after medical treatment. Circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was totally restored only by tumor excision in 9 patients. The other case had progression of hydrocephalus after surgery and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted. Radiological normal sized ventricles was obtained between one and two months of surgery Conclusions: Surgical elimination of CFS circulation obstacle helped by medical treatment for lower intracranial pressure {{should be considered as}} a safe option in adult patients, reserving endoscopic ventriculostomy and shunt insertion for cases with persistent or <b>progressive</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> after treatment.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{clinical}} features of 107 cases {{of children with}} hydrocephalus and measured raised intraventricular pressure were analysed retrospectively. Fifty one children had recently been diagnosed as having hydrocephalus, and the remainder had had shunts injected to direct the cerebrospinal fluid. The most common symptoms in the group were vomiting, behavioural changes, drowsiness, and headaches. The most common clinical signs were inappropriately increasing occipitofrontal head circumferences, tense anterior fontanelles, splayed sutures, and distension of the scalp veins. Half the infantile cases of hydrocephalus were without symptoms, and {{a quarter of the}} cases with cerebrospinal fluid shunts and measured raised intraventricular pressure were without signs. There were no fewer than 33 different clinical signs including several unusual ones, such as macular rash and sweating. We believe that the presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intraventricular pressure is sufficiently variable, unusual, or even absent to justify the direct measurement of intracranial pressure. The classical adult presentation of raised intracra-nial pressure (headache, vomiting, and papil-loedemal) is rare in children with <b>progressive</b> <b>hydrocephalus.</b> There are few studies of the clinical presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intracra-nial pressure either before or after an operation to divert the cerebrospinal fluid. There are certainly no studies in which raised intracranial pressure has been confirmed by direct measurement, and such reports that do exist in children frequently include those with causes of raised intracranial pressure other than hydrocepha-lus alone. The aim of this study therefore was to document the symptoms and signs of 107 cases of <b>progressive</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> (that is, hydrocephalus with raised intracranial pressure) in which the {{clinical features}} were documented and raised ven-tricular pressure had been confirmed on direct measurement.

The postoperative course was good, but about 3 weeks after the operation, the clinical symptoms aggravated gradually and computerized tomography scan showed expanding intraventricular air. At the reoperation, a small skin defect covered by crust was found at the shunt surgery wound, and the dura mater around the shunting tube remained as a defective space.

40|$|THE COURSE of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) can vary in form from a mildly disabling condition to a <b>severe,</b> <b>progressive</b> disease. There {{is evidence that}} the early stage of RA is a unique period, often characterized by profound inflammation, severe symptomatology and a high likelihood of radiological progression [1 - 3]. It is therefore vital to identify <b>severe,</b> <b>progressive</b> RA at an early stage, when intervention and reduction in functional deterioration with disease-modifying drugs can improve long-term outcome. Reliable, practical and universal prognostic markers are required, to enable decisions on treatment strategies to be taken before irreversible damage occurs. However, the impact of early intervention is dependent on the availability of effective and safe therapy.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Pleural {{effusion}} {{secondary to}} ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion {{is a rare}} and potentially life-threatening occurrence. Case presentation We describe a 14 -month-old Caucasian boy who had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted for <b>progressive</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> of unknown etiology. Two {{and a half months}} post-shunt insertion, the patient presented with mild respiratory distress. A chest radiograph revealed a large right pleural effusion and a shunt series demonstrated an appropriately placed distal catheter tip. A subsequent abdominal ultrasound revealed marked ascites. Fluid drained via tube thoracostomy was sent for beta- 2 -transferrin electrophoresis. A positive test was highly suggestive of cerebral spinal fluid hydrothorax. Post-externalization of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the ascites and pleural effusion resolved. Conclusion Testing for beta- 2 -transferrin protein in pleural fluid may serve as a useful technique for diagnosing cerebrospinal fluid hydrothorax in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. </p...|$|R

Mutations in PNKP have previously been associated with a syndrome of microcephaly, seizures and developmental delay (MIM 613402), but not with a neurodegenerative disorder. PNKP is a dual-function enzyme with a key role in different pathways of DNA damage repair. DNA repair disorders can result in accelerated cell death, leading to underdevelopment and neurodegeneration. In skin fibroblasts from both affected individuals, we show increased susceptibility to apoptosis under stress conditions and reduced PNKP expression.
