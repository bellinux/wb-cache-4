50|$|The ImageWriter II also {{supported}} an optional motorized <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder</b> that could feed cut sheet paper.|$|E
50|$|After the {{original}} version was released in 1985, it was localized to and sold in 11 European countries, although the character set originally included support for Spanish. About a dozen software engineers from the Magnavox Odyssey video game console group (which became PHIS) worked on the product; overall, PHIS at this time employed over 70. Not only were there follow-up models, but also a <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder</b> accessory was released for the VideoWRITER.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationship}} with Brother continued {{with several of}} the PrintStation models being produced from rebadged Brother products. Exclusive rights to market Trilog color matrix printers was acquired in 1984, and Trilog was purchased outright in 1985. Advanced Terminals (a manufacturer of <b>sheet</b> <b>feeders)</b> and BDS Computer Australia Pty Ltd were purchased in 1986.|$|R
25|$|Sheetfed presses {{print on}} <b>sheets,</b> have a <b>feeder</b> system {{consisting}} of drawers and/or a pallet of paper, and print {{on both sides}} of the paper (duplex print/perfecter), printed sheets are collected in a stacker mainly for paper printing. Examples of sheetfed presses include the HP Indigo 7900, the HP Indigo 10000 and the new HP Indigo 12000.|$|R
50|$|The ImageWriter II is {{a serial}} based {{dot matrix printer}} that was {{manufactured}} by Apple Computer, which supported its entire computer product line when it was released in September 1985. It had several optional add-ons available, including: a plug-in network card, buffer memory card, and motorized <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder.</b> It also supported color printing with an appropriate ribbon. ImageWriter II's were still in common use for forms printing a decade after they were produced.|$|E
50|$|HP {{began making}} inkjet {{printers}} with the HP Thinkjet (models HP 2225A and HP 2225B) in 1984. In 1988, HP introduced the first DeskJet. It included a built-in cut <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder,</b> 2 ppm, and 300 dpi. This {{was followed by}} the DeskJet Plus in 1989. It offered a landscape printing ability. The DeskJet 500 was introduced in 1990, offering a faster printing speed of 3 ppm. Meanwhile, HP introduced the DeskWriter for the Macintosh in 1989, based on the DeskJet 500.|$|E
50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers. While they support fanfold paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder</b> may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|E

40|$|Feeding the raw {{material}} accurately is essential in microsheet-forming, especially in multistage progressive forming operations and also when in particular, a certain feeding rate has to be maintained. Research into the microforming of thin sheet metals (< 100 mu m) led to investigations {{of the performance of}} existing <b>sheet</b> metal <b>feeders,</b> regarding their feeding accuracy and repeatability. The results indicated that the pursuance of greater feeding accuracy and repeatability, which was aimed at 5 - 15 % of the strip thickness, was difficult to achieve with commercially-available feeders. A new high-precision and high-speed feeder was, therefore, developed for microsheet-forming. The feeder design was supported by motion analysis and feeding simulations. The feeder was constructed in collaboration with industrial partners. The conducted feeding tests and forming experiments demonstrated that greater feeding accuracy and repeatability can be achieved, compared to those of existing commercial feeders. This suggests a promising solution for high-precision strip feeding in microsheet-forming where thin sheet metals are to be fed...|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{peripherals}} were available that worked on {{some or all of}} these models. The first line, introduced with the 4010, included the 4610 Hard Copy Unit, a graphics printer. This used a system in the monitor to scan the display line-by-line which was then sent to the printer where a second one-line tall CRT duplicated the image on thermal paper. Normally selling for $3,550, a $3,950 version allowed the printer to be shared among four terminals. The adaptor could be pre-installed in the 4010, making it the 4010-1, and it came pre-installed on both the 4012 and 4013 which do not appear to have used the -1 notation to indicate this. The 4631 was a version of the 4610 with a <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder</b> and higher speed. A properly equipped 4014 could also drive a plotter through an expansion card, including the GPIB-based 4662 Interactive Digital Plotter and 4663 C-sized version. Plotters offered colored pen selection, which could be embedded in the graphics data.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control and controllability approach for a copier paperpath. The paperpath transports <b>sheets</b> from the <b>feeder</b> {{to the image}} transfer section. At arrival time, every sheet must synchronize with the photoreceptor. The hybrid character of the system makes classical control approaches difficult. A control scheme that controls intersheet spacings is proposed. A controllability analysis illustrates the influence of system geometry and actuators on system controllability for simplified system dynamics. Combined with a disturbance model, {{this can lead to}} an optimal paperpath design strategy. An experimental setup was built for disturbance identification and control scheme evaluation. 1. System Overview The system considered in this paper is the paperpath of a cut sheet copier, as shown in figure 1. The <b>feeder</b> feeds <b>sheets</b> at regular intervals into the paperpath. The paperpath consists of several sections that drive and guide the sheets. At the image transfer section, the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sills are {{concordant}} sheet-like {{bodies of}} magma. Their mechanics of emplacement {{is an important}} but still not fully understood topic. The well-exposed basaltic Njardvik Sill in the extinct Tertiary Dyrfjöll Volcano in Northeast Iceland offers exceptionally clear insights into the mechanism of sill emplacement. The sill is multiple and consists of at least 7  units (sills) {{all of which were}} emplaced along a sharp contact between a rhyolitic intrusion and adjacent basaltic lava flows. Each sill unit was supplied with magma from an inclined sheet. The contacts between the sheets and the sill units are very clear and show that the sill units are much thicker than their <b>feeder</b> <b>sheets.</b> Since the Njardvik Sill consists of separate units, it obviously did not evolve into a homogeneous magma body. Nevertheless, the abrupt change in dip and thickness from inclined sheets to horizontal sills at this particular locality indicates that the earlier sills were influencing the stress field in their vicinity during the subsequent sheet injections. The local stresses around the newly formed sill units forced each of the subsequently injected sheets to change into sills. The Njardvik Sill can be followed laterally in a coastal section for 140  m until it ends abruptly at a fault that cuts the sill. Using these field observations as a basis, a numerical model shows how an inclined sheet opens up the contact between the felsic intrusion and the basaltic lava pile, along which the sill emplacement takes place. The results suggest that sill emplacement is primarily the result of stress rotation at contacts between layers of contrasting mechanical properties. There, the orientation of the maximum principal compressive stress σ 1 is horizontal. Hence, such contacts can represent interfaces along which sill emplacement is encouraged. Once a sill has been emplaced, it extends the stress field with a horizontal orientation of σ 1. Consequently, inclined sheets and dykes injected near the sill will be deflected into sills. The injection frequency of further sill units controls if the sill can grow into a larger magma body by mixing of the newly supplied with the initially injected magma. In case of the Njardvik Sill, the injection frequency was low, so subsequently emplaced sill units can be distinguished...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims at {{developing}} a {{decision support system}} for pallet utilisation in the <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder</b> industry. Furthermore, the research project has focused on providing an improvement to {{the current system of}} distribution of the customer order onto pallets. The overall research objectives are to: (i) Establish {{the state of the art}} in areas related to the project; (ii) Identify the key variables such as pallet sizes, truck sizes, material features and customers’ requirements for building the pallet utilisation model; (iii) Develop an analytical approach and a prototype system to improve the utilisation of the pallets and the truck volume; (iv) Validate the developed model and prototype system through real-life case studies and expert opinions. A combination of research methodology approaches has been employed in this research study. Firstly, a familiarisation stage has been conducted through comprehensive literature review and visits to the sponsoring company. The second phase was to conduct semi-structured interviews with the shop-floor operators and operations directors to have a better understanding of the business needs. This was combined with measurements of the trucks and the pallets and internal documentation from the company. In this stage, the researcher also distributed questionnaires to other <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder</b> companies to know if the system could be applied also to more companies. In the third phase, the data gathered were analysed for the subsequent development of the system. Then the system has been developed following the logic rules obtained by analysing the data. Finally, the developed model and system has been validated, through real-life case studies and expert opinions. The developed analytical model has been implemented in a prototype system. The developed system comprises a knowledge-based system, material handling modules, databases and user interface. The developed system for pallet utilisation encompasses pallet database, truck database and material features databases. The developed model and system has the capability to estimate the number of corrugated cardboard sheets that should be loaded per pallet. Additionally the system predicts the number of sheets per stack and the type of pallet that should be used. The system provides the shop-floor operators with an effective tool for pallet utilisation in order to reduce their decision time. Therefore, the developed system provides cost and time savings in terms of improvements of the pallet and vehicle volume utilisation for the preparation and delivery of the corrugated board product. This system has given to the sponsoring company an improvement of 5 % in the way of orders’ management...|$|E
40|$|A {{challenge}} for central banks {{is to decide}} whether used banknotes are still suitable for recirculation, or rather should be shredded and replaced by new ones. Obviously longer use of banknotes reduces the printing costs and environmental burden. Given the huge amounts of banknotes in circulation, determining the fitness of banknotes is not only of importance in cost control, but also poses a serious technical challenge in terms of processing speed and accuracy. With the current technology fit notes are often shredded along with unfit ones. In this paper DNB proposes a fitness detection method that may contribute to a reduction {{of the amount of}} unnecessary shreds. We suggest the use of the BRAIN 2 fitness detector. BRAIN 2 is the abbreviation of Banknote Recirculation Analysing & Instructing Neural Network fitness sensor. It is based on a machine learning method using a combination of intensity and contrast differences on colour images of the entire banknote. Studies done by DNB and the University of Amsterdam in 2010 have shown that this approach is successful in post-processing conditions. This study evaluates the performance of the BRAIN 2 algorithm using two on-line systems: the automatic sorting machine CPS 2000 and a double sided portable scanner with <b>sheet</b> <b>feeder...</b>|$|E
