This chapter examines the considerations annotation systems must take into account, such document structure and initial ontology, and provides an overview of current SAP implementations. The Semantic Web also results in new as well as extended applications, such as concept searching, custom web page generation, question-answering systems as well as visualization.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{an application}} of intelligent software agents and ontologies {{to solve the problem}} of semiautomatic porting of Java programs. We have designed a system for aiding users to adapt Java code in a type- and meaning-safe way, when an application has to migrate to new libraries which are not fully compatible with the legacy ones. To achieve this, we propose an approach based on an integration of the two type-theoretic notions of subtyping and type isomorphism with ontology matching. While the former notions are needed to ensure flexible adaptation in the presence of typesafety, the latter supports the user to preserve the meaning of names that appear in the program to be adapted. Intelligent agents control the different components of the system and interact with other agents in order to provide the final user with the <b>semi-automatic</b> porting <b>service</b> he/she required.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a <b>semi-automatic</b> Web <b>service</b> composition approach. This approach ranks all available candidate Web service operations based on semantic annotations and suggests service operations {{to a human}} designer {{during the process of}} Web service composition. The ranking scores are based on data mediation, functionality and formal service specifications. A formal graph model, an IODAG, is defined to formalize an input/output schema of a Web service operation. Three data mediation algorithms are developed to handle the data heterogeneities arising during Web service composition. The data mediation algorithms analyze the schemas of the inputs and outputs of service operations and consider the structures of the schemas. A typed representation for our data mediation approach, which formalizes the data mediation problem as a subtype-checking problem, is presented. An evaluation is performed to study the effectiveness of different data mediation and service suggestion algorithms used to assist designers composing Web services.

American gun designer John M. Browning wished to join contemporaries such as Hugo Borchardt and Georg Luger in designing a marketable semi-automatic pistol. Browning partnered with the Colt's Manufacturing Company which was hoping to capitalize on the interest in service pistol modernization by procuring large and profitable government military contracts. Their first collaboration produced the Model 1900; it interested the U.S. military enough to lead to the purchase of a few hundred Model 1900 pistols for testing, evaluation and limited field trial issue, however, the limitations of the design prevented its service-wide adoption. The Model of 1902 was basically the same pistol with some improvements meant to address these deficiencies.|$|E

This paper discusses the idea of semantic service requests for composite services, and presents a multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) based model of composite service requests. Service requests are modeled as user preferences and constraints. Two preference structures, additive independence and generalized additive independence, are utilized in calculating the expected utilities of service composition outcomes. The model is also based on an iterative and incremental scheme meant to better capture requirements in accordance with service consumers’ needs. OWL-S markup vocabularies and associated inference mechanism are used as a means to bring semantics to service requests. Ontology conceptualizations and language constructs are added to OWL-S as uniform representations of possible aspects of the requests.

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} an agent and ontology based approach {{that supports the}} semi-automatic composition of Web services. A Web service is an accessible application that other applications and humans can discover and invoke to satisfy multiple needs. To reduce the complexity featuring the composition of Web services, two concepts are put forward, namely, software agent and ontology. An agent is an entity that acts on behalf of others in an autonomous fashion, performs its actions in some level of pro-activity and reactivity and exhibits some levels of the key attributes of learning, cooperation, and mobility. Agent Based Systems (ABS) [11] may be divided, roughly, into individual agents, and multi-agent systems (MAS) [11]. Agent technology has been a hot topic, and most likely, this is mainly due to {{the popularity of the}} Java programming language, which re{{presents an}} ideal language for implementing software agents as it is the “Write Once Run Anywhere ” language. Ontology is a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to reason about the entities within that domain, and may be used to describe the domain. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies.

40|$|Abstract — Resource-sharing {{is one of}} the Grid {{intrinsic}} properties enabling efficient {{usage of}} services by clients from many Virtual Organizations. This is particularly true for network infrastructures, which are typically designed to serve a large number of heterogeneous users. In such an environment, the support of network Quality of Service requires the establishment of Service Level Agreements between users and network service providers, admission control as well as network control planes for automatic or <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>service</b> provisioning. The availability of guarantees allows flexible usage of the distributed infrastructure and enables application-controllable performance. Nevertheless, many network providers today only offer besteffort services and do not support Service Level Agreement signalling. In this paper we analyze requirements and introduce two bandwidth-oriented services for enhanced Grid data transfer: the Guaranteed Delivery File Transfer and Virtual Leased Line services. We propose a complete architecture – fully integrated with Grid middleware – for network Service Level Agreement management and inter-domain network service provisioning. This is based on the functional division into agreement and service provider layers proposed by the Grid Resource Allocation and Agreement Protocol working group of the Global Grid Forum. I...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{not only}} {{an overview of the}} current standard development in service composition, but also practical guidance on selecting and developing service composition tools. Service-oriented programming has come to be perceived as the key technology to leverage enterprise collaboration, moving from data and information sharing to business process integration.

It first identifies the desired properties at each stage of a composite service&# 039;s lifecyle, then apply the criteria on evaluating both semi-automatic and automatic service composition tools. Current work on <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>service</b> composition mostly focuses on usability and is often processoriented. The main task in this paradigm is connecting the input and output of available service components. On the other hand, automated service composition tools concentrate {{on the state of the}} world and the state transitions in the domain providing a list of actions or operators. Composition planners are used to automatically generate a list of applicable composition plans for flexible service composition. Consequently, tools supporting both usability and flexibility are scarce. Also, the integration with various verification and monitoring mechanisms to ensure failure recovery with secure and robust execution is not realised in any of the reviewed service composition tools...|$|E

50|$|Standard modern {{semi-automatic}} pistols {{are usually}} double action (DA), also sometimes known as double-action/single-action (DA/SA). In this design, the hammer or striker may be either thumb-cocked or activated by {{pulling the trigger}} when firing the first shot. The hammer or striker is recocked automatically during each firing cycle. In double-action pistols, the first pull of the trigger requires roughly twice as much pressure as subsequent firings, since the first pull of the trigger also cocks the hammer (if not already cocked by hand).
