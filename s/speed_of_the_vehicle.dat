25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E

40|$|In {{its most}} simple terms, traffic calming is about {{preserving}} <b>the</b> functions <b>of</b> local streets. As local streets {{are intended to}} provide primarily land-access services, hence, when traffic begins to use local streets for through movements, traffic volume and speed levels become incompatible with this primary function. To respond, a study on <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> traffic calming measures in reducing vehicles speed at Taman Setapak residential area was undertaken. Field observations and spot speed survey were conducted to collect primary data. The field observation was carried out {{to collect data on}} road geometrics and design characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road humps. The spot speed survey was administered to collect vehicles speed at different points near the road humps. The major findings include first, the road humps proved effective in reducing <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> and second <b>the</b> design characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road humps {{is an important factor in}} reducing <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles.</b> <b>The</b> average <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> before approaching <b>the</b> road humps was about 30 km/hr and at the road humps below 10 km/hr.

25|$|The {{reduction}} of drag in road vehicles {{has led to}} increases in the top <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the vehicle's fuel efficiency, {{as well as many}} other performance characteristics, such as handling and acceleration. The two main factors that impact drag are the frontal area of the vehicle and the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is a unit-less value that denotes how much an object resists movement through a fluid such as water or air. A potential complication of altering a vehicle's aerodynamics is that it may cause the vehicle to get too much lift. Lift is an aerodynamic force that flows perpendicular to the airflow around the body of the vehicle. Too much lift can cause the vehicle to lose road traction which can be very unsafe. Lowering the drag coefficient comes from streamlining the exterior body of the vehicle. Streamlining the body requires assumptions about the surrounding airspeed and characteristic use of the vehicle.|$|E

Another trial run from Christchurch to Timaru on 31 July 1936 demonstrated that the railcars could cover {{a distance of}} 164 km (102 miles) in 2 hours 8 minutes at an average speed of 77 km/h (48 mph).

2500|$|According to the {{equation}} listed above, increasing the trail and/or decreasing the head angle {{will increase the}} wheel flop factor on a bicycle or motorcycle, which will increase the torque required to bring the handlebars back to the straight ahead position and increase the vehicle's tendency to veer suddenly off the line of a curve. [...] Also, increasing the weight borne by the front wheel of the vehicle, either by increasing {{the mass of the}} vehicle, rider and cargo or by changing the weight ratio to shift the center of mass forward, will increase the severity of the wheel flop effect. [...] Increasing the rotational inertia of the front wheel by increasing the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the rotational speed of the wheel will tend to counter the wheel flop effect.|$|E
2500|$|In many countries, the law {{requires}} that tires must be specified, and fitted, to exceed the maximum <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> they are mounted on, with regards to their speed rating code (except for [...] "temporary-use" [...] spare tires). [...] In {{some parts of the}} European Union, tires that are not fit for a car's or motorcycle's particular maximum speed are illegal to mount. The sole exception are M+S tires, where a warning sticker stating the allowed maximum speed must be placed within clear sight of the driver inside the vehicle. [...] Some manufacturers will install a speed governor if a vehicle is ordered with tires rated below the vehicle's maximum speed. In some parts of the European Union, e.g. Germany, it is allowed to mount tires with a lower speed rating code if the car manufacturer specifies tires with a very high speed rating in the registration documents and the vehicle will not reach this speed based on insufficient power. In this case it is possible to calculate the appropriate speed rating with a formula.|$|E
