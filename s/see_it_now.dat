25|$|When a {{quiz show}} {{phenomenon}} began and took TV by storm in the mid-1950s, Murrow realized {{the days of}} <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> as a weekly show were numbered. (Biographer Joseph Persico notes that Murrow, watching an early episode of The $64,000 Question air just before his own <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> {{is said to have}} turned to Friendly and asked how long they expected to keep their time slot).|$|E

25|$|According to Friendly, Murrow asked Paley if he {{was going}} to destroy <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> into which the CBS chief {{executive}} had invested so much. Paley replied that he did not want a constant stomach ache every time Murrow covered a controversial subject.|$|E

25|$|Murrow's hard-hitting {{approach}} to the news, however, cost him influence {{in the world of}} television. <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> occasionally scored high ratings (usually when it was tackling a particularly controversial subject), but in general it did not score well on prime-time television.|$|E
25|$|Fred W. Friendly (October 30, 1915 – March 3, 1998) was a {{president}} of CBS News and the creator, along with Edward R. Murrow, of the documentary television program <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now.</b> He originated the concept of public-access television cable TV channels.|$|E
25|$|The first live coast-to-coast {{commercial}} television broadcast in the U.S. {{took place on}} November 18, 1951 during the premiere of CBS's <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> which showed a split-screen view of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Paley and his news staff {{was not always}} smooth. His friendship with Edward R. Murrow, {{one of the leading}} lights in the CBS news division (and by then a vice president of CBS), suffered during the 1950s over the hard-hitting tone of the Murrow-hosted <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> series. The implication was that the network's sponsors were uneasy about some of the controversial topics of the series, leading Paley to worry about lost revenue to the network as well as unwelcome scrutiny during the era of McCarthyism. In 1955, Alcoa withdrew its sponsorship of <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> and eventually the program's weekly broadcast on Tuesdays was stopped, though it continued as a series of special segments until 1958.|$|E
25|$|<b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> {{focused on}} a number of {{controversial}} issues in the 1950s, but it is best remembered as the show that criticized McCarthyism and the Red Scare, contributing, if not leading, to the political downfall of Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had previously commended Murrow for his fairness in reporting.|$|E
25|$|After <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> ended, in the Summer of 1958, Friendly and Morrow worked {{together}} on its successor, CBS Reports, although Friendly alone was executive producer and Murrow {{no more than an}} occasional reporter and narrator. Their most famous CBS Reports installment—the probe of migrant farm workers Harvest of Shame—aired in November 1960 and still is considered one of television's finest single programs.|$|E

Three months later, on October 15, 1958, in {{a speech}} before the Radio and Television News Directors Association in Chicago, Murrow blasted TV's {{emphasis}} on entertainment and commercialism {{at the expense of}} public interest in his [...] "wires and lights" [...] speech: ...|$|R

25|$|Murrow and Friendly {{broadcast}} a revealing <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> documentary analysis on Senator Joseph McCarthy (airing March 9, 1954) {{that has been}} credited with changing the public view of McCarthy and, being a key event leading to McCarthy's fall from power. It was {{an extension of the}} duo's continuing probe of the conflict between McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade and individual rights.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of The Quick and the Dead, Friendly was {{recruited}} to work full-time for CBS by news executive Sig Mickelson. That fall, Murrow and Friendly collaborated to produce a CBS Radio documentary series inspired by their record albums—a weekly show called Hear It Now that was hosted by Murrow. The show moved to television as <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> on Sunday, November 18, 1951.|$|E
25|$|The area now {{occupied}} by the Vanderbilt Tennis Club was once a CBS television studio that produced various live and recorded shows such as The CBS Evening News and <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> and live dramas, such as Mama. The first four episodes of What's My Line also originated from Grand Central before the show moved to various Manhattan theaters that could accommodate studio audiences. In 1964, CBS moved television operations to the CBS Broadcast Center.|$|E

25|$|Murrow's {{reporting}} {{brought him}} into repeated conflicts with CBS, especially its chairman William Paley, which Friendly summarized in his book Due to Circumstances Beyond our Control. <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> ended entirely {{in the summer of}} 1958 after a clash in Paley's office. Murrow had complained to Paley he could not continue doing the show if the network repeatedly provided (without consulting Murrow) equal time to subjects who felt wronged by the program.|$|E
25|$|<b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> {{was knocked}} out of its weekly slot in 1955 after sponsor Alcoa withdrew its advertising, but the show {{remained}} {{as a series of}} occasional TV special news reports that defined television documentary news coverage. Despite the show's prestige, CBS had difficulty finding a regular sponsor, since it aired intermittently in its new time slot (Sunday afternoons at 5 p.m. ET by the end of 1956) and could not develop a regular audience.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} fall, Murrow and Friendly {{had produced}} a notable <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> episode on the topic, {{when the show}} probed the case of Air Force Reserve Lieutenant Milo Radulovich, who had lost his security clearance because of the supposed leftist leanings of his sister and father—evidence the Air Force kept sealed. Five weeks later, Radulovich was reinstated {{by the secretary of}} the Air Force. Radulovich was granted leave of his duties that same year, however, when he was forced to move temporarily to Phoenix, Arizona (USA) to care for his nephew who had recently been involved in a dog mauling incident.|$|E

25|$|Several {{movies were}} filmed, either {{completely}} or partly about Murrow. 1986, HBO broadcast the made-for-cable biographical movie, Murrow, with Daniel J. Travanti {{in the title}} role, and Robert Vaughn in a supporting role. In the 1999 film The Insider, Lowell Bergman, a television producer for the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes, played by Al Pacino, is confronted by Mike Wallace, played by Christopher Plummer, after an exposé {{of the tobacco industry}} is edited down to suit CBS management and then, itself, gets exposed in the press for the self-censorship. Wallace passes Bergman an editorial printed in The New York Times, which accuses CBS of betraying the legacy of Edward R. Murrow. Good Night, and Good Luck is a 2005 Oscar-nominated film directed, co-starring and co-written by George Clooney about the conflict between Murrow and Joseph McCarthy on <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now.</b> Murrow is portrayed by actor David Strathairn, who received an Oscar nomination. In the film, Murrow's conflict with CBS boss William Paley occurs immediately after his skirmish with McCarthy.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} week, <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> ran another episode {{critical of}} McCarthy, this one {{focusing on the}} case of Annie Lee Moss, an African-American army clerk who was the target of one of McCarthy's investigations. The Murrow shows, together with the televised Army–McCarthy hearings of the same year, were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy, in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures. To counter the negative publicity, McCarthy appeared on <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now</b> on April 6, 1954, and made a number of charges against the popular Murrow, including the accusation that he colluded with VOKS, the [...] "Russian espionage and propaganda organization". This response did not go over well with viewers, and the result was a further decline in McCarthy's popularity.|$|E
