40|$|SummaryWhile {{the benefit}} of sleep after {{learning}} in offline consolidation is established [1], a role for sleep before learning in promoting initial memory formation remains largely uncharacterized. Existing theoretical frameworks speculate that accrued time awake, associated with ongoing experience, decreases learning capacity, while specific non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) oscillations support restoration of learning ability [1, 2]. Despite these model predictions, it remains untested whether episodic learning capacity remains stable across the day, or is progressively compromised by continued time awake. Furthermore, it is similarly unclear whether the presence, rather than the detrimental absence, of <b>sleep</b> <b>restores</b> efficient learning ability, and if so, what aspect(s) of sleep physiology support such reinstatement [3, 4]. We have tested these related hypotheses, and report here a learning interaction, such that episodic encoding capacity deteriorates across a daytime waking interval, but sleep and associated NREM spindle oscillations restore efficient learning ability...|$|E
40|$|Sleep {{encompasses}} {{approximately a}} third of our lifetime, yet its purpose and biological function are not well understood. Without sleep optimal brain functioning such as responsiveness to stimuli, information processing, or learning may be impaired. Such observations suggest that sleep {{plays a crucial role}} in organizing or reorganizing neuronal networks of the brain toward states where information processing is optimized. Increasing evidence suggests that cortical neuronal networks operate near a critical state characterized by balanced activity patterns, which supports optimal information processing. However, it remains unknown whether critical dynamics is affected in the course of wake and sleep, which would also impact information processing. Here, we show that signatures of criticality are progressively disturbed during wake and restored by sleep. We demonstrate that the precise power-laws governing the cascading activity of neuronal avalanches and the distribution of phase-lock intervals in human electroencephalographic recordings are increasingly disarranged during sustained wakefulness. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in variability of synchronization. Interpreted {{in the context of a}} critical branching process, these seemingly different findings indicate a decline of balanced activity and progressive distance from criticality toward states characterized by an imbalance toward excitation where larger events prevail dynamics. Conversely, <b>sleep</b> <b>restores</b> the critical state resulting in recovered power-law characteristics in activity and variability of synchronization. These findings support the intriguing hypothesis that sleep may be important to reorganize cortical network dynamics to a critical state thereby assuring optimal computational capabilities for the following time awake...|$|E

40|$|Impact of {{recovery}} sleep after sleep deprivation on cerebral A 1 adenosine receptor densityElmenhorst D 1, Elmenhorst EM 2, Kroll T 1, Matusch A 1 Aeschbach D 2 and Bauer A 1, 3 1 Forschungszentrum Jülich, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine 2, Jülich, Germany, 2 German Aerospace Center, Institute of aerospace medicine, Cologne Germany, 3 Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Medical Faculty, Neurological Department, Düsseldorf, Germany Objectives: Sleep loss triggers a {{reaction of the}} homeostatic sleep regulatory system in which adenosine is believed to play a key role. The brain adenosine concentration increases during wakefulness thereby inducing sleepiness [1]. If wakefulness is extended by sleep deprivation, this increase is accompanied by an up-regulation of adenosine receptor density [2]. Previously, we found in subjects deprived of sleep for 28 hours, an increase of the distribution volume (VT) of the highly selective A 1 adenosine receptor (A 1 AR) radioligand 18 F CPFPX in a region-specific pattern in several brain regions (maximum: orbitofrontal cortex 15. 3 %, p= 0. 014, n= 12). Whereas {{there were no significant}} changes (1. 5 %) in a control group (n= 10) with regular sleep between both scans [2]. The objective of the current study was to investigate if an extension of the wake period to 58 hours leads to a further increase of A 1 AR densities and if subsequent recovery <b>sleep</b> <b>restores</b> baseline levels of receptor densities. Methods: 15 healthy male volunteers participated in a dynamic 18 F CPFPX bolus/infusions-PET study with blood sampling and metabolite correction. Subjects were scanned after 58 hours of sustained wakefulness and after 14 hours {{of recovery}} sleep at the same time of day on consecutive days under identical conditions. Regional VT were determined by calculating the tissue to plasma ratio during the steady state phase. Results: The distribution volumes after sleep deprivation (e. g. VT= 0. 83, orbitofrontal cortex) were found to be significantly higher than after the recovery sleep condition in all (sub) cortical regions investigated (10 - 14 %, p= 0. 001 - 0. 008). Compared to the baseline group of the preceding experiment (VT= 0. 73, n= 22) the receptor density after recovery sleep (VT= 0. 72) was not significantly different. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a single night of recovery sleep returns the increased A 1 AR availability in the human brain after prolonged sleep deprivation back to the level of normal sleeping controls. These findings support the general hypothesis of an increase in synaptic strength during wakefulness and downscaling during normal sleep as a maintenance mechanism of synaptic functionality.

40|$|Objective: Subjects {{were exposed}} to {{cumulated}} partial sleep deprivation (psd), alcohol intake and hypoxia in a sequential design to examine the impact on neurobehavioral performance. Methods: Sixteen healthy male volunteers were enrolled {{in this study and}} were exposed in turn, after adaptation and baseline measurements, to one day of periods of hypoxia, one day of alcohol intake and one day for recovering (with 8 h time in bed TIB). Subsequently the exposition of those conditions is that the subjects spent 5 h night restriction daily for four consecutive days, followed by two recovery days. Performance was tested five (or six) times per day with reaction time task (SRT) and unstable tracking task (UTT). Results: The performance impairment showed to be cumulative in both tests over the four sleep deprivation days and differed significantly from baseline. Corresponding performance deficits {{under the influence of the}} stressors were for SRT: four days psd, 13 % O 2 concentration and a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of around 0. 4 – 0. 6 ‰ for UTT: four days psd, 13 % O 2 concentration and a BAC of around 0. 6 ‰. One night of 8 h <b>sleep</b> <b>restored</b> performance nearly to baseline level. Conclusions: A sleeping time of 5 h per night for four consecutive days impairs performance in such a way that traffic safety may be compromised...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that sleep can reverse cognitive impairment during Alzheimer's disease, we enhanced sleep in flies either co-expressing human amyloid precursor protein and Beta-secretase (APP:BACE), or in flies expressing human tau. The ubiquitous expression of APP:BACE or human tau disrupted sleep. The sleep deficits could be reversed and sleep could be enhanced when flies were administered the GABA-A agonist 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5, 4 -c]pyridine- 3 -ol (THIP). Expressing APP:BACE disrupted both Short-term memory (STM) and Long-term memory (LTM) as assessed using Aversive Phototaxic Suppression (APS) and courtship conditioning. Flies expressing APP:BACE also showed reduced levels of the synaptic protein discs large (DLG). Enhancing sleep in memory-impaired APP:BACE flies fully restored both STM and LTM and <b>restored</b> DLG levels. <b>Sleep</b> also <b>restored</b> STM to flies expressing human tau.

40|$|In {{understanding}} {{the mechanism of}} schizophrenia pathogenesis, a significant finding is that drug abuse of phencyclidine or its analog ketamine causes symptoms similar to schizophrenia. Such drug effects are triggered even by administration at post-adolescent stages. Both drugs are N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, leading to a major hypothesis that glutamate hypofunction underlies schizophrenia pathogenesis. The precise region that depends on NMDAR function, however, is unclear. Here, we developed a mouse strain in which NMDARs in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ILN) were selectively disrupted. The mutant mice exhibited various schizophrenia-like phenotypes, including deficits in working memory, long-term spatial memory, and attention, as well as impulsivity, impaired prepulse inhibition, hyperlocomotion and hyperarousal.
