40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the {{mechanism by which}} sodium arsenite induces brain injury {{and the role of}} L-ascorbate. Thirty adult (n= 5) Wistar rats weighing between 140 and 160 g were used. Group 1 neither received <b>sodium</b> arsenite nor <b>L-ascorbate</b> (control), group 2 was administered low dose of arsenite only, group 3 received high dose of arsenite only, group 4 was administered L-ascorbate only, group 5 was administered low dose of arsenite and L-ascorbate, and group 6 received high dose of arsenite and L-ascorbate. M 0 alon dialdehyde, MDA, levels were significantly increased in rats treated with high dose of arsenite when compared with those treated with low dose of arsenite. However, all treated groups except those treated with L-ascorbate only showed significant increase in MDA levels when compared with the control group. Rats treated with high dose of arsenite and L-ascorbate showed a significantly higher MDA level than those treated with low dose of arsenite and L-ascorbate. However, catalase activity, body weight gain, brain weight and mean food consumption were comparable across all groups. Brain tissue total protein was similar in all groups except in both groups treated with high dose of arsenite, where they were significantly reduced when compared with the control group. I 0 n conclusion, sodium arsenite treatment induces brain injury via a mechanism associated with lipid peroxidation, but not catalase-dependent. However, L-ascorbate ameliorates arsenite-induced oxidative injury in the brain.

40|$|A prologue to {{the field}} of noble metal {{nanoparticles}} is presented with a brief commentary on the basic synthesis techniques to manufacture these metal nanoparticles and to exploit the full use of their unique properties. In recent years scientific interest in embedding the metal nanoparticles in a host polymer has been increased significantly. A great advancement in the field of conductive polymers by embedding metal nanoparticles in them has been witnessed because {{they are likely to be}} an alternative to the conventional conductors. There are different available techniques in use these days to prepare these polymer-metal nanocomposites. However, photopolymerization is gaining a lot more attention mainly because of some extra ordinary advantages. This is one of the most effective ways to convert liquid monomers into polymer materials upon irradiation of UV light. Furthermore, embedding of nanoscopic metal particles in polymer matrices is with the help of free radical photopolymerization technique is one of the easiest and fastest ways. Photocured polymeric films are a promising candidate for the realization of flexible electronics, due to their easy processability, low cost, and availability. The objective of this thesis is to synthesize and stabilize two different kinds of noble metal nanoparticles i. e. silver and copper nanoparticles in an acrylic resin. In order to carry out this research, the quality of obtained nanoparticles was examined with respect to the nature of substrates, irradiation time, and monomer/salt ratio. In the first half of this research, electrically conductive UV-cured films have been prepared by irradiating an acrylic difunctional monomer in the presence of silver nitrate, pyrrole, and a photoinitiator. Homogeneously dispersed silver nanoparticles (size range 50 - 80 nm) embedded by polypyrrole formed throughout the acrylic matrix. Interestingly, the electrical conductivity of the acrylic films increased a hundred times after the formation of the Ag polypyrrole nanoparticles. Evaluation of the irradiation process was conducted by UV-Vis spectroscopy using model systems where the acrylic monomer was substituted by a solvent. It has been shown that as a function of composition and irradiation time there is a simultaneous reduction of silver nitrate and pyrrole polymerization forming silver nanoparticles covered by the conductive polymer. The effect of PVP concentration on the different properties of silver nanoparticles was investigated. It was ascertained that there is a significant influence on the morphology of silver nanoparticles. The second half of this research is to synthesize copper nanoparticles. Synthesis of the less stable copper nanoparticles is more difficult and challenging because copper nanopaticles are easily oxidized. Different stabilizing agents like poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), pyrrole, <b>sodium</b> <b>L-ascorbate</b> are used as capping agents to prevent the aggregation and to stabilize the obtained copper nanoparticles against oxidation. The copper nanoparticles obtained were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectra, dynamic light scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy and FESEM. It has been observed that the particle size and particle size distribution influenced significantly in the presence of PVP. However, there is no substantial effect observed by adding pyrrole as a stabilize...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor the {{presence}} of analytes is of great importance both in industrial applications and physiological systems. Since the crucial recognition events of chemistry, biology, and materials science occur in a much smaller world, {{it is very difficult}} to gather this kind of information. Therefore much effort has been devoted to the detection of chosen molecules selectively and signalling this presence. This thesis highlighted the uniqueness and utility of both fluorescent sensor and electrochemical sensor to investigate biologically important species. The determination of copper(II) ion is very crucial to both environment and human health. To utilise the fluorescent sensors for recognition has plenty of advantages, such as high sensitivity, “on-off” switch ability and submillisecond temporal resolution. Naphthalimide based probes has always been the key point of the chemosensors due to its excellent photophysical properties. Therefore, the aim of the project is to investigate boronic acid receptor linked to the naphthalimide fluorophore for copper(II) detection. And the utility of boronic acid as binding site is one of the rare examples of fluorescent chemosensors for Cu 2 + detection. Neutral molecules such as glutathione (GSH) play a crucial role in maintaining appropriate redox homeostasis in biological systems. We creatively use the chromophore of dicyanomethylene- 4 H-pyran(DCM) for the design of probe, due to its emission located at the red or near infra-red (NIR) region, which is particularly suitable for application in biological samples. GSH, the most abundant cellular thiol, is of great importance in cellular defence against toxins and free radicals. Therefore we developed a colorimetric and NIR fluorescence turn-on thiol probe containing DCM as the fluorophore and DNBS as the fluorescence quencher and recognition moiety. The interaction of ferrocene-boronic acid with fructose is investigated in aqueous 0. 1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7, 8, and 9. Two voltammetric methods, (i) based on a dual-plate generator-collector micro-trench electrode (steady state) and (ii) based on square-wave voltammetry (transient), are applied and compared in terms of mechanistic resolution. A combination of experimental data is employed to obtain new insights into the binding rates and the cumulative binding constants for both the reduced ferrocene-boronic acid (pH dependent and weakly binding) and for the oxidised ferrocene-boronic acid (pH independent and strongly binding). Finally, a redox-activated fluorescence switch based on a ferrocene - fluorophore - boronic ester conjugate was investigated. The development of multifunctional systems that can integrate individual basic logic gates into combinational circuits has drawn much attention to smart materials. A novel electrochemically and fluorescence active boronic ester sensor molecule has been developed containing ferrocence and naphthalimide as the redox and fluorophore units. The solid state electrochemical characterisation of the compound was investigated in aqueous media and it indicates a direct interaction with fluoride anions. The fluorescence can also be modulated through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by a redox process. An OFF-ON fluorescence response occurs when the ferrocene is oxidised by Fe 3 +. While in the presence of F-, the fluorescence enhancement was offset. Therefore, the combinations of iron (Fe 3 +) ions, <b>sodium</b> <b>L-ascorbate,</b> and fluoride (F-) ions can be used to produce a molecular system displaying INHIBIT logic gate, due to indirect fluorescence quenching...|$|E
