40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} was aimed to determine relationships between seed yield and some yield components of 20 sweet fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. var dulce) lines. The highest positive correlation (r= 0. 915) was recorded between biological yield and <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> yield. Plant height, number of branches, number of umbels and umbellets {{had a positive}} effect on <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> yield. One thousand seed weight was negatively correlated with essential oil percentage. The highest positive and direct effect on seed yield was shown by number of umbellets, while maximum negative and direct contribution to it was made by biological yield. In addition, <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> yield, plant height and one thousand seed weight affected seed yield positively. <b>Single</b> <b>plant</b> yield had maximum direct effect (32. 95 %) on essential oil percentage followed by plant height (24. 60 %) and number of branches (15. 11 %).

A saikei developed in Kawamoto's style will be complex in topography, rich with vegetation, and strongly evocative of a realistic location in nature. Trees will have natural shapes, without contortion. Trees and ground cover will have relative sizes that almost constitute a model of a landscape, free from exaggerated proportions. Plants will be selected to match the simulated location, so that a <b>single</b> <b>planting</b> will contain only species likely to be found together.

5000|$|... 'Radicchio' {{is easy to}} grow but {{performs}} best {{in spring}} (USDA Zone 8 and above) and fall (everywhere) gardens. It prefers more frequent but not deep watering, {{the amount of water}} varying based on soil type. Infrequent watering will lead to a more bitter tasting leaf. However, for fall crops the flavor is changed predominantly by the onset of cold weather (the colder, the mellower), which also initiates the heading and reddening process in traditional varieties. There are newer, self-heading varieties whose taste is not yet as good as a traditional variety which has matured through several frosts or freezes (e.g., Alouette). 'Radicchio' matures in approximately three months. However, it can be made to stand through a UK or West European winter, and the head will regenerate if cut off carefully above ground level, so long as the plant is protected against severe frost. A light-excluding cover, e.g. an inverted pot, may be used during the latter phases of growth to produce leaves with a more pronounced colour contrast, simultaneously protecting against frost and cold winds. Traditionally in the UK, the first cutting of all chicory heads was simply thrown away, and the tender, forced, second head was for the table. However, improved varieties of 'radicchio', e.g. Rosso di Verona, and generally milder winters allow the West European cultivator to harvest two or more crops from a <b>single</b> <b>planting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{sugarcane}} is planted from stalk cuttings {{and placed}} in furrows about five feet apart. After approximately 12 months, the mature sugarcane is ready for harvest. Growers average four harvests each season from a <b>single</b> <b>planting.</b> Harvesting season lasts from late October through mid-March, approximately 150 days.The {{first step in the}} harvesting process is the highly controlled pre-harvest burning of the cane fields. Each field burn is individually permitted by the State of Florida Division of Forestry. Farmers are allowed to burn only when climatic conditions permit. Burning causes excessive leaves to be removed, preparing the way for the mechanical harvesters and then the processing of the cane. An added benefit to this practice is that it reduces the need for applications of pesticides.The Cooperative harvests an average of 500 acres per day using combine-style mechanical harvesters. In a typical harvesting unit, three or four harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight tractors and strings of wagons. The harvesters contain rotating knives, which cut through the sugarcane {{at the base of the}} stalk. The cane tops are also cut off by rotating knives and excess foliage is removed by giant extraction fans.As the sugarcane passes through the harvester, it is cut into 12-inch lengths and put into field wagons. The sugarcane is then hauled to a nearby transfer station and loaded onto semi-trailers for delivery to Glades Sugar House for grinding.Each semi contains about 19-tons of sugarcane. A load arrives at the mill site about every 45 seconds during daylight hours. Approximately 1,200 loads are delivered daily to keep the processing facility at peak capacity during harvest season.More than 61,000 acres are harvested each season, producing more than 2.4 million tons of sugarcane.ProcessingThe Glades Sugar House operates 24-hours a day throughout the 150-day annual harvest. The mill grinds as much as 26,000 tons of sugarcane per day or three million tons each season. One ton of sugarcane produces approximately 220 pounds of raw sugar. Experienced operators use technology-based equipment to separate the harvested raw cane into sugar, water, molasses and bagasse (the pulp, rind and fiber of the sugarcane stalk). Every part of the sugarcane stalk is used.Within 24 hours of harvesting, each load of sugarcane is cut and processed into raw sugar. Along the way the high-tech mill uses all of the plant’s by-products. Even the fibrous wood pulp that remains after the sugar cane has been repeatedly pressed, crushed and shredded is not wasted. This pulp, called bagasse, fuels the mill’s boilers, creating steam-generated electricity to power the mill. By using bagasse as a fuel, the Cooperative saves the equivalent of 31 million gallons of fossil fuel each year. The water that makes up 80 percent of the cane stalk is also recycled and re-used within the process. Combined, all of the state’s sugar producers save 113 million gallons of fuel oil or 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year. Processing involves separating the natural sugar juice from the stalk then concentrating the juice to produce raw sugar crystals and blackstrap molasses, which is sold primarily as animal feed. During the 2010-11 harvest season, the Cooperative produced more than 260,000 tons of raw sugar and 16 million gallons of black strap molasses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPerennial crops have {{numerous}} {{ecological and}} agronomic advantages over their annual counterparts. We estimate discrete choice models to evaluate farmers' preferences for perennial attributes of pigeon pea intercropped with maize {{in central and}} southern Malawi. Pigeon pea is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous crop, which {{has the potential to}} ameliorate soil fertility problems related to continuous maize cultivation, which are common in Southern Africa. Adoption of annual pigeon pea is relatively low but perennial production of pigeon pea may be more appealing to farmers due to some of the ancillary benefits associated with perenniality. We model perennial production of pigeon pea {{as a function of the}} attributes that differ between annual and perennial production: lower labor and seed requirements resulting from a <b>single</b> <b>planting</b> with multiple harvests, enhanced soil fertility and higher levels of biomass production. The primary tradeoff associated with perennial pigeon pea intercropped with maize is competition with maize in subsequent years of production. While maize yield is approximately twice as valuable to farmers as pigeon pea yield, we find positive yet heterogeneous demand for perenniality driven by soil fertility improvements and pigeon pea grain yield...|$|E

By using these models, {{the effects of}} plant growth parameters on crop yields are simulated, hence, the experimental costs are reduced. In this paper, the model of MSM (Maize Simulation Model) was calibrated and validated for the prediction of maize forage production at Agricultural College, Shiraz University in 1382 and 1383 by using maize forage yield under furrow irrigation with four irrigation and three nitrogen treatments. Irrigation treatments were I 4, I 3, I 2, and I 1, with the depth of water 20 % greater than, equal to, 20 % and 40 % less than potential crop water requirements, respectively. Nitrogen treatments were N 3, N 2, and N 1, with the application of N as urea equal to 300, 150, and 0 kg N ha- 1, respectively.

40|$|In {{this work}} it was {{hypothesized}} that secondary succession on sites that have been managed by <b>single</b> <b>planting</b> of mangrove species is compromised by residual stressors, which could reduce the ecosystem's structural development and lower its functions. Forest structure and environmental characteristics of three planted mangrove stands are compared with reference sites. Structural attributes showed significant differences in the comparison of planted and reference stands. Avicennia schaueriana was the dominant species within both natural regeneration and old-growth stands in terms of basal area (99. 2 and 99. 4 %, 69. 6 and 84. 5 %, and 59. 0 and 87. 1 % for Itacorubi, Saco Grande, and Ratones, respectively). Restoration stands were dominated by Laguncularia racemosa (80. 6 and 94. 2 % for Saco Grande and Ratones, respectively), except at one site (Itacorubi), where A. schaueriana prevailed (99. 7 %). Even though restoration and regeneration stands at Itacorubi showed similar species composition and dominance, cohort sorting revealed an inferior regeneration potential in the restoration stand. Multiple correlation analysis indicated that variables related to elevation disruptions (p (w) = 0. 521) were the environmental drivers responsible for the differences observed in forest structure. At restoration sites an impaired pattern of secondary succession was observed, indicating that single species plantings may be ineffective if characteristics of the site, {{as well as of the}} area surrounding it, are not considered. The inadequate management of restoration sites can therefore have implications for both immediate and long-term large-scale ecosystem services.

40|$|Due {{to forest}} {{degradation}} and loss, {{the use of}} ecological restoration techniques has become of particular interest in recent years. One such method is the Framework Species Approach (FSA), which was developed in Queensland, Australia. The Framework Species Approach involves a <b>single</b> <b>planting</b> (approximately 30 species) of both early and late successional species. Species planted must survive in the harsh conditions of an open site as well as fulfilling the functions of; (a) fast growth of a broad dense canopy to shade out weeds and reduce the chance of forest fire, (b) early production of flowers or fleshy fruits to attract seed dispersers and kick start animal-mediated seed distribution to the degraded site. The Framework Species Approach has recently been used {{as part of a}} restoration project in Doi Suthep-Pui National Park in northern Thailand by the Forest Restoration Research Unit (FORRU) of Chiang Mai University. FORRU have undertaken a number of trials on species performance in the nursery and the field to select appropriate species. However, this has been time-consuming and labourintensive. It has been suggested that the need for such trials may be reduced by the pre-selection of species using their functional traits as predictors of future performance. Here, seed, leaf and wood functional traits were analysed against predictions from ecological models such as the CSR Triangle and the pioneer concept to assess the extent to which such models described the ecological strategies exhibited by woody species in the seasonally-dry tropical forests of northern Thailand. It was found that seed storage behaviour (orthodox and recalcitrant) was strongly linked to other functional traits and that this was the basis of observed differences in performance based on seed size. There was evidence for the existence of a leaf economic spectrum in these forests and for differing positions of deciduous and evergreen species on this spectrum. It was further found that wood hydraulic capacity and safety was more strongly linked to leaf traits than wood mechanical strength; reflecting the importance of the seasonal drought in this type of forest. Selected functional traits were then used to predict the performance of species within the FORRU project. It was found that a combination of wood and leaf traits that encompassed mechanical strength, hydraulic capacity and water storage best described species growth rates in most years and that survival may be linked to a combination of both drought and pathogen load that differs by year due to environmental conditions. In conclusion, functional traits were found to be valuable indicators of performance in forest restoration projects...|$|E
40|$|As {{human needs}} become diverse and complex, a {{creation}} of amenity-rich urban space is thought to bear more significance than ever expecially when relaxed life style and pleasant urban life are desired. Under that setting, street space of urban environment {{is considered to be}} a most important element to create amenity-rich urban space, which accompanies improvement of safety, landscape, and comfortability of the space concerned. Studies on amenity of city streets dated from 1970 's and started drawing increasing attention in 1980 's. Few studies, however, examined street space, noting various factors which interrelatedly create amenity of the city. Consequently, they seem to lack overall approaches. Further, few studies were yet to provide information helpful for space consolidation. This thesis aimed to examine issues and solutions related to research, planning, and design of amenity-rich pedestrian space. Conducting both behavioral analysis approach of pedestrian traffic and landscape analysis approach of streetscape, the thesis tried to explore the issues from total perspectives. Especially, in terms of landscape analysis approach which chiefly involved visual information, landscape simulation method was adopted, using image processing system. By means of that method, it became possible to handle various factors and study problems pertinent to the formation of streetscape. Major findings of this thesis are as follows. Using behavioral analysis approach which focused on pedestrian traffic, the thesis clarified the following points. (1) A pedestrian strip contains remnant space which tends to widen in proportion to the entire width of the pedestrian strip: approximately 1. 0 m in 3. 5 m pedestrian strip, 2. 0 m in 6. 0 m strip. Effective use of remnant space was discussed in regard to overall promotion of street greenery. (2) Street planting reduces evading behavior of pedestrians away from automobiles and improves effective use of pedestrian strip by 15 %, and creates safer and more comfortable environment. They altogether contribute to improve buffer effect. The foregoing condition is observed more frequently in combined planting formation consisting of trees, shrubs, and groundcovers than in <b>single</b> <b>planting</b> formation of either trees or shrubs only. (3) Trees provide summer shade for pedestrian space and improve space use by 10 %, resulting in more comfortable street environment. That is to say, they altogether contribute to improve shade-of-tree effect. Using landscape analysis approach which focused on streetscape, the thesis clarified the following points. (4) Of those which comprise pedestrian space in public space, street planting, pedestrian traffic, and road-side space are three key elements that work to shape the streetscape. Interrelating those three, the thesis examined effectivity of landscape simulation method. (5) One of the landscape effects of street planting is that its visual information promotes psychological comfortability. In order to achieve landscape effects, combined planting formation works effectively. In other words, trees play an important role due to their shape, canopy, and planting location. Pedestrian space increases comfortability and receives higher evaluation when the ratio of greenery in the field of vision is 30 % or over. (6) Greenery of road-side space helps to create pleasant landscape. Facade and hedges of adjacent buildings are also part of road-side space, and they are highly important to promote landscape effects. All those factors revealed the importance of road-side planting, design control/guide of both adjacent buildings and other structures. Greenery should be placed on pedestrian strip, favorably below 1. 5 m eye level. Using both behavioral analysis approach and landscape analysis approach, the thesis addressed the following point. (7) As behavioral analysis clarified buffer effect and shade-of-tree effect of street planting, and landscape analysis clarified landscape effect on people, it is very important to combine both approaches in order to study street space from total perspectives. It is believed that the foregoing results have been able to indicate directions for future planning and design of urban streets as well as help establish study method for consolidation of amenity-rich pedestrian space...|$|E
