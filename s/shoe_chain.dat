50|$|French Shoes was a <b>shoe</b> <b>chain</b> {{headquartered}} in Montreal, Quebec. It began in 1956 and its last location {{closed in the}} 1990s. French Shoes featured very stylish women shoes at an affordable price and grew to 30 locations located mostly in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The founder of French Shoes was Seymour (Sonny) Lubin (1932-2009). In the early years, he was joined by Gerard Gingras and the two were an excellent team in the Canadian ladies shoe fashion industry. The company was sold in 1979 to Bata Shoes which made the purchase to enter a higher grade of shoe market. However, the acquisition was not successful and the brand was sold again {{a few years to}} later to Calderone Shoes, a large Toronto shoe company. Calderone Shoes eventually fell into hard times, and the French Shoes legend and name died. However, French Shoes was an exciting place to be in Montreal from the early 1960s to late 1970s and will always be remembered fondly.|$|E
5000|$|The Reebok Princess is a {{simplified}} athletic/casual sneaker similar to its older stablemate, the Freestyle. In the late 1980s, Reebok had several smoothed out Freestylesque sneakers, {{such as the}} Rhapsody. Following the Rhapsody, the Princess, Empress and Dutchess came along. All are very similar, and differed mainly in color trim. The Princess is mainly available in white or black leather, but it can sometimes be found with blue, pink, or other colored trim and soles. It's also available in wide width sizes. Today, while the Freestyle might be less common, the Princess is available in most large department stores and <b>shoe</b> <b>chain</b> shops, and it is worn mostly as a comfortable shoe by waitresses, cashiers, and other such professionals. It is also used in the sport of competition aerobics. The Princess usually was made of garment leather which was very thin and very soft. This was one of its main qualities. But now Princess is made of man made material called [...] "synthetic leather", making this legendary and iconic sneaker a very ordinary shoe.|$|E

The ‘Put a better foot forward’ workshop was an interactive event designed to promote more conscientious consumption of fashion, focusing on people’s footprints!

These activities included: A creative thinking exercise where people thought of innovative ways to make more sustainable shoes. Two socio-dramas where people were invited to step into the shoes of people involved in the <b>shoe</b> supply <b>chain.</b> A life-cycle analysis where people were asked to think about the relative impacts of the different parts of the <b>shoe</b> supply <b>chain.</b> The workshop was designed and run with the help of Teo Greenstreet and Nick Nuttgens and was held at a former Woolworths store on The Moor in the centre of Sheffield.

5000|$|Hinchliffe's Facia group, {{with its}} {{headquarters}} at Parkhead Hall in Sheffield, rapidly became a retail empire with 850 British high street shops (more than Marks and Spencer at the time), over 6000 employees, and over £250m in turnover, {{second only to}} Littlewoods as a private retail group in the United Kingdom. Brands acquired at the pace of around one a month included clothing stores Sock Shop, Red or Dead, Contessa, and Oakland menswear, Torq jewellers, and the shoe shops Trueform, Saxone, Manfield, and Freeman Hardy and Willis, though only fashion chain Red or Dead was profitable. Facia expanded into continental Europe in March 1996 when they acquired the German Bata <b>Shoes</b> <b>chain</b> and renamed it Millennium. Hinchliffe's strategy {{was said to be}} buying well-known but apparently underperforming brand names, centralise warehouses and distribution, and upgrade stores, but also involved delaying payments to suppliers and channelling money to his private company. The group was partly sustained by shell companies that Hinchliffe used to borrow money. Facia bought the shoe shops from Sears, but only paid for the brand names, shelves and tills - in an unusual deal, Sears retained the leases, staff and stock. Murray Johnstone had sold Sock Shop to Hinchliffe and owned 50% of Facia. Rival companies and marketing analysts expressed scepticism over the rapid expansion, the merits of the business strategy in a difficult trading environment for high street brands versus out-of-town stores, the lack of coherence of the brands, and the lack of transparency over accounts and funding sources. Management Today said he was [...] "Like someone playing Monopoly and buying whichever property they land on". A new headquarters was being built in Chelsea in 1996 where Laura Ashley's design HQ used to be, including a [...] "high street" [...] of all the Facia branches.|$|R

5000|$|Arriving in York, Pennsylvania in 1905 - {{the year}} he turned 30 - Haines' bicycle broke down. He {{reportedly}} sold his engagement ring, bought ten pairs of shoes, and sold them at a farmers market. [...] Haines initially rented a 3rd-floor apartment at 473 W. Market Street. After borrowing money to begin a business, he was bankrupt within two years. He then obtained a consignment of shoes for $127 from the local D.S. Peterman & Co. warehouse. With a combination {{of hard work and}} gimmickry, Haines became very successful in the shoe business. A particular gimmick for which he was known was his use of a customized Ford as a mobile retail store, which he would drive to the outer edges of town to show his products. By December 1917, Haines had saved enough to buy 199 acre of what became a 211 acre farm east of York in Springettsbury Township.

5000|$|The dish of a wheel {{measures}} {{the amount of}} asymmetry between the rim and the hub flanges. To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side hub flange to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total dish of the wheel. Some modern tandems use a 160mm wide axle which allows a wheel that is completely [...] "dishless" [...] (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker's cranks and may also cause [...] "heel-strike" [...] of the stoker's <b>shoes</b> on the <b>chain</b> stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in {{the strength of the}} wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the axle spindle. Rear hubs may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.|$|R

50|$|In November 1866 Fox made a rich {{strike at}} Brighton (now Tiromoana), about 10 {{miles south of}} Charleston, and in May 1867 a strike near Charleston itself precipitated the last real 'rush' on the West Coast. Brighton was a much bigger town at the start, but Charleston lasted longer and the two have been {{confused}} in places. In 1867 Brighton and its environs had 53 hotels while Charleston had 37. However, in 1975-79 remains of around 99 hotels where found by old bottle collectors in the Charleston area which have been documented, with the European hotel the last surviving hotel which was pulled down after the 100 year festivities around 1968. Hannahs <b>shoe</b> shop <b>chain</b> had the very first shop in Charleston in 1867. Marys hotel {{at the south end}} of the nine mile beach to the north of Charleston being said to be gateway to Charleston which was also pulled down around 1970. Open cast Coal mines replaced gold mining in Charleston with the Mowarts mine and latter the McGlockland mine which supplied coal to nearby Westport, Gold was still mined on the south end of the nine mile beach up till the late 1970s.In 1990s the seals from Cape Foulwind near Westport moved south to the Charleston coast and made camp at the mouth of the Brimalaw creek about 2 km south of Constant bay. Three ship wrecks have been located around the mouths of both Constant bay and its neighbour Joyce bay which are believed to be from the gold rush times.Charleston was the site for the first cement buildings in New Zealand; a Butter factory and a small house which still stands around 3 km south of Charleston next to Cake hill. The Nile river still has the Cement walls on the river of the old swing bridge which was the main road through the coast in 1899. Charleston is littered with old gold workings and one should watch for old mining shafts which are hidden throughout the area. Charleston has got coal, clay, and sandstone deposits which all have been mined over the years. Wellington's post master got a promotion to the Charleston Post office in 1867 which was a big step up in his career at the time.The Charleston school was moved to the Westport south school and the old school teacher's house (which still stands) was also the Charleston Police station and Charleston jail beforehand. The population of Charleston during the goldrush is often exaggerated with 30,000 or even 100,000 being mentioned. At the peak of the gold rush, the population of the entire West Coast is believed to have been only 35,000. The early 1867 census, at the peak of the Charleston rush, showed 5,000 on the entire Charleston field and 6,000 on the Brighton field ten miles to the south.|$|R
