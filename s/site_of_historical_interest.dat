50|$|Oxwich's main <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>historical</b> <b>interest</b> is {{the castle}} which is thought by many {{academics}} {{to be the}} most historic castle on the Gower Peninsula. The earliest evidence of it being inhabited is in 1459, where Philip Mansel was recorded as holding it. The Mansel family were a minor gentry in South Wales, who grew in power and prestige under the Tudor monarchs. The parish church of St. Illtyd's overlooks Oxwich Bay. A place of worship has stood on this site since the 6th century, but the main tower of today was built in the 14th century. The chancel of this church is thought to be a 6th-century cell. The church bell in the tower also dates back to the 14th century, but was recast in 1892. In the churchyard there is a well, which locals believe is haunted by a ghost. Legend has it that a ghost was seen in the churchyard before vanishing into a well.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was buried}} {{on the slope}} of Marsland Hill in New Plymouth above the {{original}} St Mary's Church; the grave was marked by a slab of stone taken from the beach. However, it was obscured when {{the top of the}} hill was flattened to allow for the construction of a barracks during the New Zealand Wars. The centenary of Keats's death aroused interest in finding Brown's grave and it was successfully relocated in March 1921 and marked by a stone inscribed, [...] "Charles Armitage Brown. mentor of poet John Keats." [...] The grave, surrounded by vegetation, was painted as a <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>historical</b> <b>interest</b> by Taranaki artist Thelma de Lancy-Green. On 2 April 2011 leading Keats scholar Professor Nicholas Roe from the University of St Andrews, Scotland laid a wreath on Brown's grave and discussed the friendship between the pair. Professor Rowe also visited Puke Ariki museum and library to explore the books that accompanied Charles Brown when he emigrated in 1841, including numerous editions of Romantic-period plays and an edition of Tasso known to have been among Keats's books at his death. This volume, which once belonged to Keats, also contains the bookplate and annotations of Charles Cowden Clarke, an author and Shakespearean scholar who taught Keats and encouraged his poetic leanings.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{the last}} {{buildings}} of Cefn, {{parallel to the}} A470 Merthyr to Brecon road, lies another <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>historical</b> <b>interest.</b> This is the Jewish cemetery, {{one of the largest}} in Wales outside Cardiff. It was established and consecrated in the 1860s by the then thriving Merthyr Hebrew Congregation. The growth of the Jewish population in the area was mainly linked to the expansion of the mining and ironworks industry in the locality. Many were refugees from Russia, Poland and Romania, fleeing religious persecution. [...] The cost of the land for the cemetery was mainly paid for by the local community, but contributions were also made by Jewish communities and individuals across Britain, the largest amount being £10 from the politician and philanthropist, Baron Lionel de Rothschild. Initially the cemetery was simply a burial ground, with no building on the site. In the late 1890s a simple brick built prayer house (ohel) was constructed, again using funds raised by the local Jewish community. In 1935, the cemetery was extended, with the new section being formally consecrated in October 1935. [...] A map of the cemetery is held in the archives at Merthyr Tydfil Central Library.The map shows the location of approximately 570 graves, and gives the names and dates of death of many of the deceased. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the Jewish population declined. The community has now left the Merthyr area and responsibility for maintenance of the cemetery has been transferred to the Local Authority.|$|E
