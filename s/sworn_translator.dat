50|$|On 18 July 2005 at the Belgian federal parliament, Filip De Man {{directed}} {{a series of}} questions at the vice-prime minister and minister of Justice (Laurette Onkelinx), regarding the case Coucke and Goethals. His introduction stated that since 1861 there had been several attempts to officially restore the honour of Coucke and Goethals. In 2000, Johan Vande Lanotte, Siegfried Bracke and Geert Goedertier had still written (in België voor beginners. Wegwijs in het Belgisch labyrint, p. 27, die Keure, Brugge) that Coucke and Goethals were not the murderers of the widow, but were informed on the murder. In 1948, a study by the Flemish journalist Herman Bossier had concluded that there had not been a miscarriage of justice, as according to the journalist, the declaration by Rabet included errors and two other members of the Black Gang, after their trial, had talked about the Flemish as accomplices; the interpreter would not have been a gendarme from Luxembourg, but a <b>sworn</b> <b>translator</b> of Dutch origin (Nederlandse afkomst). On five occasions Goethals would have confessed and as chief railroad worker he had to know the French language, while Coucke sold vegetables to French-speaking customers and, having had money problems before the murder, thereafter had means of which he could not demonstrate the origin.|$|E

40|$|Telephone tapping or {{wiretapping}} is – {{or rather}} was - {{the practice of}} intercepting telephone conversations performed by authorities. Translators or interpreters are needed whenever these conversations are held in foreign languages; and even if tap interpreting, {{as a form of}} translation, is not yet explored in depth, it has given rise to fierce debates as it brings together two apparently contradictory notions, namely, privacy vs. security. Privacy is a worldwide recognized right; however, authorities are obliged to ensure security to their citizens. After this introductory discussion, we want to deal with terminology: “wiretap” and “interpreting” maybe is not the best terminological combination. Referring to “wire”-tap is rather obsolete in 2016 and “interpreting” is a too limited term to define what these professionals/experts do when interpreting/translating/transcribing/summarizing tapped materials. Next, we want to explore what is the situation in the Netherlands confronted to the situation in Belgium. In the Netherlands, research has been done, training and certification for LiTE (Linguistic Tap Experts) or FoTE (Forensic Tap experts) has been set up and further recent investigation has been published on the “Darknet” (these are different ways to avoid interception through technology and ICT). In Belgium we still have a long(er) way to go, starting from training and certification of LITs (Legal Interpreters and Translators) and a National Register of <b>Sworn</b> Interpreters and <b>Translators.</b> Fortunately, work is in progress and we want to show how we definitely can learn from our neighbours.
