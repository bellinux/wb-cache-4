Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along. ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs." [...] Danko told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, [...] "Bob and Robbie, they would come by every day, five to seven days a week, for seven to eight months." [...] Hudson added, [...] "It amazed me, Bob's writing ability. How he would come in, <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> typewriter, and write a song. And what was amazing was that {{almost every one of}} those songs was funny." ...|$|E

[...] An obituary in The Evening Standard reported: [...] "Every day {{for more than a}} year, until just recently, she was taken out in her wheelchair. [...] After a breath of sea air ... she would always go into her favourite hotel for a drink and would often <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano and entertain the company with some of her old Gilbert and Sullivan tunes. [...] She often used to go to a home for wounded ex-servicemen of the last war [...] would give an impromptu entertainment, playing and singing her old songs. [...] She liked to go to parties and would always play and sing." [...] The Worthing Gazette stated that Bond continued to be much loved in her later years, and people came to see her from all over Britain to pay homage in her old age. The Worthing Herald wrote: [...] "Despite her great age, Miss Bond preserved a quick and active mind, and hated to be fussed over." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpson family {{visits a}} home and garden show where they decide to {{purchase}} a hot tub. They spend hours soaking in the tub and become so relaxed that they forget to visit Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson at a family event. Grampa angrily unplugs and destroys the hot tub, scolding them for ignoring him. Homer decides {{to make up for}} their neglect and decides to do something Grampa wants to do. Grampa reminisces about a pub in Dunkilderry, Ireland called O'Flanagan's, where he claims to have had the best night of his life many years ago. Homer decides to take Grampa there for one last drink. When the family arrives they realize Ireland has become a commercialized, hi-tech country of consumers and workaholics. The pub itself has run out of business as many of the patrons are now yuppies who have no interest in drinking. The pub owner Tom O'Flanagan is happy to have customers again. Homer and Grampa <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pub and start drinking while Marge, Bart and Lisa visit various Irish landmarks. They visit the Giant's Causeway, Blarney Castle, the Guinness brewery and Dublin.|$|E

2500|$|Christmas {{dinner is}} the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. Аbout noon, or even earlier, the family members <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table. When the head of {{household}} gives a sign, all rise. He lights a candle, censes his family and house, and prays the Lord's Prayer. After that, the family members kiss {{each other on the}} cheek saying, [...] "The peace of God among us, Christ is Born." [...] The head and another man of the family hold the česnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The česnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his or her own share of the loaf. The family member whose share contains the coin hidden in the česnica, will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The main course of Christmas dinner is roast pork of the pečenica. During the dinner, the head of household proposes a toast to his family with a glass of wine, several times. A traditional toast from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina goes like this: ...|$|E
2500|$|Caroline {{was brought}} up with an extreme degree of {{seclusion}} from contact with the opposite sex even for her own time. She was reportedly constantly supervised by her governess and elder ladies, restricted to her room when the family was entertaining guests and ordered to keep away from the windows. She was normally refused permission to attend balls and court functions, and when allowed, she was forbidden to dance. Abbé Baron commented {{during the winter of}} 1789–90: [...] "She is supervised with the greatest severity, as they claim she is already aware of what she is missing. I doubt if the torches of hymen will illuminate for her. Although always attired with style and elegance, she is never allowed to dance", and that as soon as the first dance begun, she was forced to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> whist table with three old ladies. A rare occasion was the wedding of her elder brother Charles, when she was finally allowed to dance, though only with her brother, the groom, and her new brother-in-law, the Prince of Orange – she was, however, still forbidden to dine alone with her brother.|$|E
