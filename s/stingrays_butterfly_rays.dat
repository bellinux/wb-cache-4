25|$|Stingrays are a {{group of}} rays, which are {{cartilaginous}} fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river <b>stingrays),</b> Gymnuridae (<b>butterfly</b> <b>rays),</b> and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).|$|R
50|$|Further {{research}} is needed to determine whether the isolated longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> in French Polynesia are in fact the same species as those from the rest of its range. Phylogenetic studies based on morphology and mitochondrial DNA indicate that the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is closely related to the zonetail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (G. zonura), which shares much of its range in the Indo-Pacific. Another name for the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is variegated <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|R

25|$|Potential predators of spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> include larger fish such as {{the great}} hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), and marine mammals. In the {{northwest}} Atlantic, the depletion of seven large shark species by commercial fisheries {{has led to an}} increase in the population of the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> and other mid-level predators. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Anthobothrium altavelae and Pterobothrioides petterae, and the gill parasite Heteronchocotyle gymnurae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> are {{the rays}} forming the genus Gymnura {{and the family}} Gymnuridae. They are found in warm oceans worldwide, and {{occasionally}} in estuaries.|$|R
50|$|They are hunted by larger {{predator}}s, such as sharks. The {{great hammerhead}} specializes in feeding on <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> and is their main predator in some areas.|$|R

50|$|The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura poecilura) is {{a species}} of <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray,</b> family Gymnuridae, native to the Indo-Pacific from the Red Sea to {{southern}} Japan and western Indonesia. Growing up to 92 cm across, this ray has a lozenge-shaped pectoral fin disc about twice as wide as long, colored brown to gray above with many small, light spots. The spiracles behind its eyes have smooth rims. This species can be identified by its tail, which is {{about as long as}} the snout-to-vent distance, lacks fins, and bears nine to twelve each of alternating black and white bands.|$|R
25|$|In {{the western}} Atlantic, the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> feeds on fishes, {{including}} Leiognathus and small sharks, and squids. Off Tunisia, they feed on crustaceans, teleosts, cephalopods, lamellibranchs, and gastropods, {{in descending order}} of importance. Teleost fishes apparently become {{more important in the}} ray's diet with increasing size. An active predator, the ray typically approaches a prey item slowly before rapidly spinning around over it and striking the food with the leading edge of one of their pectoral fins. This behavior likely serves to stun the prey before capture, as the pectoral fins of <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> contain a high proportion of red muscle and can deliver blows of substantial force.|$|R
50|$|The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> {{is widely}} caught for meat and as bycatch in artisanal and {{commercial}} fisheries, including in India, Thailand, and Indonesia. It is taken using bottom trawls, bottom-set gillnets, {{and to a}} lesser degree trammel nets and other fishing gear. Though specific population and catch data are lacking, the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is thought to be susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate and the fact that pregnant females often abort their young when captured. Given the high intensity of fishing pressure across most of its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|R
50|$|The zonetail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura zonura) is {{a species}} of fish in the Gymnuridae family. It is found in India, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Its natural {{habitats}} are open seas, shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, and estuarine waters.|$|R
50|$|The body of <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> is {{flattened}} {{and surrounded}} by an extremely broad disc formed by the pectoral fins, which merge {{in front of the}} head. They have a very short, thread-like, tail. They are up to 4 m in width.|$|R
50|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> frequents sandy or muddy {{habitats}} {{in coastal}} waters shallower than 30 m. Its diet consists of bony fishes, molluscs, and crustaceans. This species {{gives birth to}} live young; the developing embryos are nourished first by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk") supplied by its mother. There is no defined breeding season, and females bear litters of up to seven pups. Used for its meat, the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is often caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, citing {{the high levels of}} fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate.|$|R
25|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters, {{found that the}} pale-edged stingray is sister to a clade containing the whitespotted whipray (Himantura gerrardi), the pearl stingray (D. margaritella), and the smooth <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura micrura). These results support the growing consensus that neither Dasyatis nor Himantura are monophyletic.|$|R
50|$|The thread-like tail lacks dorsal or caudal fins, {{though there}} are low ridges along its length above and below. Its length is about equal to the {{distance}} between the snout tip and the vent, distinguishing this species from other <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> that have shorter tails. Sometimes there is a small stinging spine (very rarely two) on the upper surface of the tail near the base. The skin is devoid of dermal denticles. This species is brown to greenish brown to gray above, with many small pale spots and sometimes also a smattering of dark dots. The tail has nine to twelve black bands alternating with white bands, which often have a small, dorsally positioned dark spot within. The underside is white, darkening {{at the edges of the}} fins. The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> attains a maximum width of 92 cm.|$|R
50|$|The California <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura marmorata) is {{a species}} of ray in the family Gymnuridae. It is found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and the United States. Its natural {{habitats}} are shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, coral reefs, estuarine waters, intertidal marshes, and coastal saline lagoons.|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{variety of}} {{abnormalities}} {{have been described}} for sharks, rays and skates across different ecoregions. Morphological and functional anomalies in these species, however, were not yet documented in distributions from the Canary Islands, the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> Gymnura altavela (Linnaeus, 1758) and from in situ observations. The aim {{of the present study}} is to fill these knowledge gaps. Results: A female spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> G. altavela with an unfused anterior part of the right pectoral fin to the neurocranium was observed in the port of Sardina del Norte (Gran Canaria Island) during a visual scuba diving census. Conclusion: The size and the observation of the activities swimming, burying and preying confirmed the adaption of the specimen for the anomaly and underdeveloped electrosensory system in its survival. The limited knowledge of teratogens and their triggering factors, and the striking similarity with an anomaly reported for G. poecilura (Shaw, 1804) from South India, suggest genetic expression aberrations or mechanical obstructions during gestation as origin for the disorder...|$|R
50|$|The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> {{feeds on}} bony fishes, in {{particular}} ponyfishes {{of the genus}} Leiognathus, as well as molluscs and crustaceans. It is not known to shoal in large numbers. Known parasites of this ray include the nematode Hysterothylacium poecilurai and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium micracantha. Like other <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays,</b> this species is viviparous with the young sustained initially by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses. Reproductive activity proceeds throughout the year, with a peak from April to October. The gestation period is unknown, though {{it is possible that}} females bear more than one litter per year. The litter size is at least seven pups and is not correlated with female size. The newborns measure 20 - 26 cm across and look like stingless miniatures of the adult; siblings may differ from each other in color. Males and females mature sexually at roughly 45 and 41 cm across respectively.|$|R

50|$|The smooth <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura micrura) is {{a species}} of {{cartilaginous}} fish in the Gymnuridae family. It {{is a member of}} the Order Myliobatiformes, which contains 10 total families. Its natural habitats are shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, estuarine waters, and coastal saline lagoons. Its common name is derived from its compressed body, pectoral fins that are wider than their length, and overall diamond shape.|$|R
50|$|Smooth <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> {{are found}} in the western and eastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean (Maryland to Brazil) and the Gulf of Mexico. They are most {{commonly}} found in neritic waters, but are also known to enter brackish estuaries and hypersaline lagoons. They have a range that extends from the continental shelf to 40 meters deep in tropical and warm waters. They prefer habitats that have either sandy or muddy bottoms.|$|R
40|$|The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray,</b> Gymnura poecilura, was {{originally}} described as Raja poecilura by Shaw 1804 without any type material, based on Russellâs (1803) illustration of BTenkee kunsul^ from Vizagapatam (present day Visakhapatnam), India. Because {{of the absence}} of detailed taxonomic accounts for G. poecilura, characters mentioned for its identification are often misleading and unreliable, lead- ing to frequent misidentification of the species with congeners in the region. In the absence of type specimens or detailed taxonomic work on the genus Gymnura from the Indian Ocean region, species G. poecilura is considered to be unde- fined. In an effort to clear up the taxonomic vagueness of the species, this article re-describes G. poecilura from fresh ma- terials, designates a neotype from Visakhapatnam, India (western Bay of Bengal) and also reports the presence of a distinct Gymnura species from the northern Arabian Sea with genetic support. Reports of two <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays,</b> G. japonica and G. micrura, from Indian waters are clarified as misidentifica- tions and so must be excluded from the Indian elasmobranch faunal list...|$|R
50|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} sister species of the longnose {{stingray}} is the sharpsnout stingray (D. geijskesi), and that two form a clade with the pale-edged stingray (D. zugei), the pearl stingray (D. margaritella), the sharpnose stingray (Himantura gerrardi), and the smooth <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura micrura, {{included in the study}} as an outgroup). These results support the growing consensus that neither Dasyatis nor Himantura are monophyletic.|$|R
25|$|Spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> are {{harmless}} to humans, {{though if}} stepped on its tail spine {{can cause a}} painful wound. It is listed as a game fish in some regions. The meat of this species is highly regarded and it is caught for human consumption, except for in the waters off the United States where it is not targeted by commercial fisheries and is rarely taken as bycatch. It is assessed as a vulnerable species by the World Conservation Union.|$|R
50|$|The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> was {{originally}} described as Raja poecilura by English zoologist George Shaw, in his 1804 General Zoology or Systematic Natural History. He did not designate a type specimen as his account {{was based on}} an illustration by Scottish naturalist Patrick Russell, published a year earlier in Descriptions and Figures of Two Hundred Fishes Collected at Vizagapatam on the Coast of Coromandel. The specific epithet poecilura is derived from the Greek poikilos ("of many colors") and oura ("tail"). Later authors moved this species to the genus Gymnura.|$|R
50|$|The most {{widespread}} {{member of}} its {{family in the}} Indo-Pacific, the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is found from the Red Sea and Somalia, westward across India and Sri Lanka, to China and southern Japan, the Philippines, and the western islands of Indonesia (including Borneo, Sumatra, and Java). It has also been reported from French Polynesia (see taxonomic note above). It is fairly common in some areas. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits coastal waters at depths of 10 - 30 m, preferring sandy or muddy bottoms. It {{does not appear to}} migrate seasonally.|$|R
