The study investigates different channels through which the SSEs work their effects through the intermediaries and estimates such effects using a large banking data panel. The study shows strongly supporting evidence in favor of SSEs.

40|$|The {{periodically}} returning {{debates and}} the disappointing bargaining {{on the financial}} perspectives for 2007 - 2013 {{have led to the}} proposal of a comprehensive review of the EU budget in 2008 / 2009. This provides an opportunity for initiating fundamental reforms of the revenue side of the EU budget. One course of reform relies on the principle that the 'own resources' should be collected through the introduction of a European tax. Several options for a European tax were discussed income taxes, taxes on real economy transactions and finally a tax on financial transactions (tax on <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions</b> in shares and bonds, tax on foreign exchange transactions and a tax on 'all' financial transactions), discussed in more detail in the paper. The first proposal, a tax on traditional <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions</b> in stocks and bonds, has the disadvantage that the potentially available resources would ensure only a rather small proportion of the revenues of the EU budget. Moreover, the UK and to some extent also Spain would be contributing to the community resources far above the proportionate level reflecting their relative economic strength in the EU. The second proposal, the tax on foreign exchange transactions (the 'Tobin tax'), involves transactions in traditional foreign exchange markets (without financial derivatives). In the absence of experience, predictions about the effect of and revenues from a taxation of foreign exchange transactions are highly arbitrary. Even the most optimistic estimate reckons with revenues covering only about half of those required for financing the EU budget. The criterion of fair contribution across member states is not fulfilled. It turns out that the UK would deliver up to two thirds of the revenues from an EU-wide foreign exchange tax. Other big member states such as Germany, France and Italy would contribute to the common budget with 5 %, 6 % and less than 2 % of the total, respectively. The third version of a financial transactions tax would be a charge on 'all' transactions, i. e. including transactions in financial derivatives. The potential tax base is enormous here by all standards. However, the problem of a fair sharing of burdens across member states would in this case be at least as severe {{as in the case of}} the tax on foreign exchange transactions. A financial transactions tax, in any of the three versions discussed in the paper, is thought to be introduced in the European Union only and not world-wide. In all cases the problem of relocation (from the EU generally, and from the leading market place, London, in particular) would emerge. The prospect of losing the benefits derived from London as one of the most eminent financial markets in the world would make any British government a strong opponent to an EU-wide financial transactions tax.

Furthermore, the initial endowment of participants has an impact on the price elasticity of the demand for transaction services.

40|$|Payment systems {{include all}} the paper (including cash) and {{electronic}} systems a country uses to exchange financial value to discharge obligations. Financial markets rely on promptness and certainty of payment and settlement for borrowing and investing. Consumers want convenience, choice (of payment options), privacy, and low cost. Inefficiencies in payment systems cause a drag on the national economy. The authors compare trends and areas for improvement in payment systems in Colombia and El Salvador, two countries that differ in size, volume of check-based transactions, and national issues. Check standards have developed slowly in both countries, which has retarded automation, particularly in Colombia, where the volume of checks handled makes manual processing unmanageable. Both countries need stronger leadership from central banks and bankers associations; incentives to adopt common check standards; streamlined check sorting and encoding, microfilming, and manual data processing; alternative (especially credit-based) payment mechanisms and private check-processing bureaus; and settlement of <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions</b> through several banks, rather than one bank. The countries differ in important ways: 1) {{it will be easier}} to reach economies of scale in check processing in Colombia (which has too many local clearinghouses) than in El Salvador (which has too few). Both countries need a more balanced approach; 2) same day payments are possible in Colombia; payments in El Salvador are next day, at best; 3) financial markets are less mature in El Salvador and may not need to be as sophisticated as markets in other countries; and 4) Colombia has yet to create effective disincentives for writing checks against insufficient funds. Both countries must take certain actions to develop a system for electronic payment and the settlement of payments at the central bank: 1) draft new laws and regulations; 2) provide more systematic data collection and analysis of payment flows; 3) undertake more risk analysis and prevention in the central banks and supervisory agencies, and draft contingency plans for major failures; 4) reexamine the dual roles of the central banks and other government agencies in operating and supervising payment systems; 5) review check-clearing pricing policies; and 6) analyze the economics of automating check processing.

40|$|In a {{commodity}} futures trading system, the clearing house {{is of great}} importance. This paper describes and analyses in detail its essence functions and numerous activities. The main goal and a major task of such activities is to preserve financial integrity and stability of the market place. Clearing houses accomplish this task {{by means of a}} financial safeguard system of the futures markets. In order to preserve financial integrity and stability of the commodity futures markets, the clearing house uses three mechanisms. First, the membership in a clearing corporation requires a certain business and professional profile of a firm or an individual member accompanied by a minimal amount of capital determined by special regulations of a clearing corporation and the stock exchange. Second, the clearing house provides a financial safeguard through self-insurance schemes: funded and unfounded ones. Third, the clearing house uses a developed system and mechanism of margins through which it most efficiently exerts permanent control and sustains financial stability of the trading system as a whole. The third system of preserving financial integrity and stability of commodity futures markets is undoubtedly of the greatest importance, as it simultaneously embodies the true nature and essence of commodity futures markets. The development of margin system in commodity futures market has been a long process through which the clearing house has become a general partner and a guarantee of all <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions.</b> As a general partner the clearing house embodies the total amount of capital on the stock exchange. In this way, the system of margins appears to be acting not only as an element of the commodity market financial safeguard, but also to have a completely new function, that of imposing capital as a homeostatic subject which maintains its total capital value. The preservation of the total capital value flowing into the commodity futures market is the first and the basic function of the system of margins. However, it has an additional function: to guarantee historical cost of the goods, thereby maintaining the value of individual capitals, the function which is accomplished through various hedging strategies of individual capital...|$|E

The modern trading facility {{is no longer a}} place.
