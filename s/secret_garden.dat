5|$|Charles Dickens is {{reputed to}} have set his novel Hard Times in the city, {{and while it}} is partly {{modelled}} on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Mrs Gaskell. Gaskell penned all her novels, with the exception of Mary Barton, at her residence on Plymouth Grove. On numerous occasions Gaskell's house played host to influential authors including Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton. It is now open as a literary museum. Also closely associated with the city is Victorian poet and novelist Isabella Banks, most famed for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man. Anglo-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett was born in the city's Cheetham Hill district in 1849, and wrote much of her classic children's novel The <b>Secret</b> <b>Garden</b> while visiting nearby Salford's Buile Hill Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrasting}} {{geography of}} Northern England is reflected its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: {{the poetry of}} William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters {{are perhaps the most}} famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The <b>Secret</b> <b>Garden</b> (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of the sounds and rhythms of Northern English dialects.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Secret</b> <b>Garden</b> {{was first}} used on Day 29, when Big Brother contestants Kinga Karolczak, Orlaith McAllister and Eugene Sully {{secretly}} entered the house, minutes after Roberto Conte was evicted.

25|$|Marketing to both {{adult and}} {{juvenile}} audiences {{may have had}} an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime. The <b>Secret</b> <b>Garden</b> paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted that the author's obituary notices all remarked on Little Lord Fauntleroy and passed over The <b>Secret</b> <b>Garden</b> in silence.|$|E

25|$|At first, Mary is as {{rude and}} sour as ever. She dislikes her new home, {{the people living}} in it, and most of all, the bleak moor on which it sits. However, a good-natured maid named Martha Sowerby tells Mary about the late Mrs Craven, who would spend hours in a private walled garden growing roses. Mrs Craven died after an {{accident}} in the garden, and the devastated Mr. Craven locked the garden and buried the key.

Soon she comes to enjoy the company of Martha, the gardener Ben Weatherstaff, and a friendly robin redbreast. Her health and attitude improve, and she grows stronger as she explores the moor and plays with a skipping rope that Mrs Sowerby buys for her. Mary wonders about both the <b>secret</b> <b>garden</b> and the mysterious cries that echo through the house at night.|$|E
