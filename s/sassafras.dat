5|$|The work to re-grade {{and install}} {{drainage}} on Peach and <b>Sassafras</b> Streets {{coincided with the}} building of the station from 1925 to 1927, and cost the city approximately $110,000. A temporary station was also erected at 14th and French Streets, and was used after the old Union Depot was demolished in 1925 until the completion of the new station. Union Station was dedicated on December3, 1927, in a ceremony presided over by the presidents of the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads, the mayor of Erie Joseph Williams, and former mayor William Stern who helped initiate the project. The Griswold Plaza Post Office, {{on the north side of}} 14th Street, opened in 1932 along with the tunnel connecting it to Union Station.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart <b>Sassafras,</b> originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E

5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began {{to lay out the}} city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored off the coast of New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, <b>Sassafras,</b> Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E

25|$|There are {{at least}} 29 tree species that Indiana bats use during the summer. The {{greatest}} number of tree species {{are found in the}} central portion of Indiana bats' range (primarily Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and Kentucky), but this is likely because the majority of research conducted on the species has occurred in this region. Roost trees from these central states, which are mainly in the oak-hickory cover type, include silver maple, red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), white oak (Q. alba), red oak (Q. rubra), pin oak (Q. palustris), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), post oak (Q. stellata), shingle oak (Q. imbricaria), eastern cottonwood, shagbark hickory, bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory (C. alba), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American elm, slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), white ash (F. americana), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and <b>sassafras</b> (<b>Sassafras</b> albidum).|$|E
25|$|The yellow-poplar weevil, {{scientific}} classification Odontopus calceatus, {{is a type}} of weevil {{which occurs}} in much of the eastern and southeastern United States. Its range is as far north as Massachusetts all the way south to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Atlantic westward to the Mississippi River. It is also known as the <b>sassafras</b> mining weevil, tuliptree leafminer, tulip tree weevil, or the magnolia leaf miner.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} short-petioled {{and so have}} little {{individual}} motion, but the branches sway as a whole. The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally so that the foliage arrangement is not unlike that of the beech (Fagus). Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is the most fiery and brilliant of the 'brilliant group' that includes maple, dogwood, <b>sassafras,</b> and sweet gum, as well as various species of tupelo.|$|E

25|$|The term {{heartwood}} derives {{solely from}} its position {{and not from}} any vital importance to the tree. This {{is evidenced by the}} fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and <b>sassafras,</b> while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.|$|E
25|$|It {{usually is}} found in yellow-poplar, <b>sassafras,</b> and {{magnolia}} trees. Its distribution is east of the Mississippi River in all areas where its native hosts exist. It has been noted that its preferred host is Yellow-poplar. Historically, infestations are localized within natural hardwood forests and have rarely been considered a major threat. However, during the 1960s, several outbreaks caused serious loss of foliage on Yellow-poplar populations in the Ohio River Valley and Appalachian Mountain regions. Recent concerns focus on young Yellow-poplar transplants that are placed in urban and suburban landscapes. Severe infestations in saplings could damage tree foliage, reduce their ornamental value, and possibly cause low survival rates.|$|E
25|$|The bluff's {{nature as}} a solitary outlier of the range gives it a greater range, in one place, of {{habitats}} and flora than elsewhere in the Great Western Tiers. The plants and trees found on the bluff are common {{to the rest of}} the range however, unlike the rest of the range, Quamby Bluff's summit does not show evidence of burning or grazing damage. The mountain has a mixture of habitats including eucalypt forest, rainforest and subalpine vegetation. On the mountain's southern half there are some patches of callidendrous rainforest which are dominated by myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii) and <b>sassafras</b> (Atherosperma moschatum) trees with mother shield ferns (Polystichum proliferum), and tree ferns in the gullies. There are scattered king billy pines (Athrotaxis selaginoides) on southern slopes, indicating long periods between bushfires. Other rainforest sections contain some Stringybark trees (Eucalyptus delegatensis). These forests on the mountain were formerly of mixed eucalyptus. High altitude and loggingevidenced by remaining stumpshave changed its character. Other sections contain mixed forest containing stringybark, myrtle, <b>sassafras</b> and dogwood (Pomaderris apetala), with a silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) understorey. Sections have some treeferns, mother shield fern, bat's wing fern (Histiopteris incisa) and kangaroo fern (Microsorum pustulatum). In other areas there is a dryer forest dominated by eucalypts. Messmate Stringybark (eucalyptus obliqua) and stringybark grow over an understorey of silver wattle, dogwood, bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and fireweed. In these sections there is evidence in the flora's pattern of repeated burnings. Eucalyptus dalrympleana and some Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) occur higher up, with a mixed understorey. The summit is exposed and wind-swept. Here there are mostly low and wind-pruned shrubs including: Narrow-Leaf Orites (Orites revolutus), Baeckea gunniana, Common Shaggy-pea (Oxylobium ellipticum, Leptospermum rupestre, Richea sprengelioides, Richea scoparia and Kerosine Bush (Ozothamnus hookeri).|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{years went}} by before Raleigh {{decided to find out}} what {{happened}} to his colony. Led by Samuel Mace, this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering. However, Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip, and Mace's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as <b>sassafras</b> that would generate a decent profit back in England. By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists, the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island.

25|$|In {{part due}} to the global supply {{shortage}} of <b>sassafras</b> oil, substances that are sold as molly frequently contain no MDMA and instead contain methylone, ethylone, MDPV, mephedrone, or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as bath salts. Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity. MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (e.g., lactose) and binding agents. Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers. Some tablets contain little or no MDMA. The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country.

25|$|Impressive {{groves of}} {{turpentine}} (Syncarpia glomulifera) and blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) trees {{may be seen}} growing straight {{up into the sky}} forming an open canopy with widely spaced trunks. In these characteristic areas they are generally considered open forest, they may have a grassy understory, a sclerophyll shrubbery or alternatively they may have a rainforest subcanopy or a rainforest understory with growth being densest nearest to the valley floor or permanent watercourses. In these turpentine forests often hundreds of cabbage palms (Livistona australis) may be seen growing in dense tall thickets which are rarely touched by fire or they may exist as young plants in open grassy spaces which are burnt regularly enough not to form visible trunks. Rainforest pockets are dominated by jackwood and <b>sassafras.</b> The lilli pilli (Acmena smithii) produces a fruit edible raw. Another common species is the coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum) which were used extensively from Australian rainforests to manufacture horse-drawn coaches.|$|E

25|$|The Indian {{trade was}} {{generally}} an exchange between the colonies and Native Americans of the commodities each party desired {{but did not}} produce. The company was a major buyer from the Indians of hogs and cattle: either live on the hoof, as smoked or salted meat, or as skins.

Packhorse trains were outfitted with European-made goods—primarily guns, powder, flint, rum, and various dry goods—at Pensacola and the company's other warehouses, then sent to Indian villages in the interior, from which they returned with deerskins, furs, bear oil, honey, and foodstuffs. The company's agents ran stores in Indian villages scattered from the St. Johns River in East Florida to the Mississippi, and from the Gulf coast to Tennessee. The depot at Pensacola comprised a store and warehouses where the furs and skins were sorted and packed for shipment to foreign markets in schooners or brigantines belonging to the firm's fleet of fifteen vessels.|$|E
25|$|The weevil {{goes through}} a single {{life-cycle}} each year. Adults pass the winter months in surrounding leaf litter and become active throughout late April and early May. Before leaf buds on Yellow-poplar, <b>Sassafras,</b> or Magnolia trees open, weevils attack the buds and leave their distinctive feeding marks. Mating takes place throughout May and early June. The eggs are laid in the midrib {{on the underside of}} leaves, about one to three eggs per site. There are generally four or five punctures at each oviposition site, resulting in 12 to 15 eggs per leaf. The eggs hatch in a few days to reveal legless, C-shaped grubs. Newly hatched larvae move from the midrib into the leaf where they feed as leaf miners for three to four weeks. Once they are ready to pupate, the grubs spin reddish-brown cocoons in one of the main mining halls they created as larvae. They remain in these cocoons until the second week of June where they then emerge as adults. The new adults then continue on their journey to eat yet more leaves until mid or late July. From this time onward, they generally disappear into new leaf litter to await the coming spring months.|$|E
25|$|The Allegheny and Cumberland Plateaus of West Virginia are {{predominantly}} covered by hardwood forests, but along the Ohio River and its principal tributaries, the valuable timber {{has been removed}} and considerable areas have been wholly cleared over the centuries for farming and pasture lands. Among the most prevalent trees of this region are the chestnut oaks, the walnut, the yellow poplar, and the cherry. Southern West Virginia contains the largest reserve supply of timber. In the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian Mountains, the Eastern Panhandle and Potomac Highlands have a forest covering {{similar to that of}} the plateau region, however between these two areas of hardwood there is a long belt where spruce and white pine cover the mountain ridges. Other trees common in the state are the persimmon, <b>sassafras,</b> and, in the Ohio and Potomac Valley regions, the American sycamore. Hickory, chestnut, locust, maple, beech, dogwood, and pawpaw are widely distributed throughout the state as well. Among the state's common shrubs and vines are the blackberry, black and red raspberry, gooseberry, huckleberry, hazel, and wild grape. Ginseng is an important medicinal plant that is harvested primarily in West Virginia's southern regions. Wild ginger, elder, and sumach are common, and deep in the mountainous areas, rhododendrons, mountain laurel, and azaleas grow in abundance.|$|E
