40|$|A grazing {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if providing Bovatec® in a trace mineralized <b>salt</b> <b>block</b> would improve cattle performance over cattle provided a trace mineralized <b>salt</b> <b>block</b> without an ionophore while maintaining block consumption below 2 oz/head/day. Average daily block intake was 1. 40 and 1. 25 oz/day for the Bovatec and control cattle, respectively. Lasalocid consumption was 193 mg/head/day. Although cattle consuming the Bovatec block gained 5 % more than the control cattle, this was not significant (1. 75 vs 1. 67 lb/day, respectively). Supplying an ionophore through a self-feeding block may not improve gain compared to supplying mineral alone in a self-feeding block...|$|E
40|$|Bi 1. 7 Pb 0. 3 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +y {{was used}} as an example of Cuprates for our study. The subtle thermal {{transitions}} and the jumps of the parameters appear in the sample at about 300 and 700 oC, respectively. The unit cell of the sample is composed of two structural blocks: perovskite and rock salt. The size of every block along c direction is about a nanometer. What should be made clear is whether the two thermal and structural changes take place in the whole cell or from different blocks. The bond lengths in the unit cell are analyzed carefully before and after two thermal and structural changes {{based on the results of}} X-ray diffraction. Careful analysis of the bond length in the samples demonstrates that the two jumps of the parameters are correlated with the two blocks. After the jump at about 300 oC, the bond lengths in the rock <b>salt</b> <b>block</b> change more significant than in the perovskite block. After the jump at about 700 oC, the bond lengths in the perovskite block change more significant than in the rock <b>salt</b> <b>block.</b> The change of the bond lengths clearly shows that the different thermal transitions and the jumps of the parameters take place in different blocks...|$|E

40|$|The non-monotonic {{relationship}} of Tc {{with the number}} of Cu-O planes (n) per unit cell for compounds of Tl 2 Ba 2 Can- 1 CunO 2 n+ 4 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) is investigated from the perspective of cohesive energy. The unit cell of the Tl superconductors is treated as two blocks: the perovskite block where the Cu-O planes are located and the rock <b>salt</b> <b>block,</b> which is considered as a charge-reservoir. We proposed a model to calculate the combinative energy of the two blocks. It is found that the combinative energy between the two blocks is closely related to the value of Tc. The relation demonstrates an interesting way to understand the nonlinear change of Tc {{with the number of}} Cu-O planes in the layered superconductors. This means that the interaction between the two blocks {{plays an important role in}} superconductivity...|$|E
30|$|There {{were four}} {{treatments}} in this experiment. Treatments were supplementation of Millettia ferruginea foliage hay to each sheep at levels of 0 (T 1), 150 (T 2), 300 (T 3) and 450  g DM/day (T 4) to experimental sheep fed natural pasture grass hay basal diet. The natural pasture grass hay basal diet consisted of mainly {{a mixture of}} Cynodon and Digitaria species. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The experimental animals were grouped into six blocks of four animals each based on their initial body weight (IBW) that was determined by taking the averages of two consecutive weights after overnight fasting {{at the end of}} the quarantine period. Animals in a block were then randomly assigned to one of the four experimental treatments making six animals per treatment. The daily Millettia ferruginea foliage supplement was offered in two equal halves at 0800 and 1600 hours. Natural pasture grass hay was provided to all animals ad libitum by adding a 20 % allowance of the previous day’s intake. All sheep had free access to water and mineralized <b>salt</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
40|$|Bicuculline and its methochloride <b>salt</b> <b>block</b> {{inhibitory}} postsynaptic potentials recorded from giant interneurone 2 (GI 2) of the cockroach Periplaneta americana following {{stimulation of}} cercal nerve X, but fail {{to block the}} response to g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) when this neurotransmitter is ionophoresed or pressure-injected onto the fine branches of GI 2 within the neuropile of the terminal abdominal ganglion. Bicuculline is similarly ineffective in blocking the response recorded when GABA is ionophoresed onto the cell body membrane of GI 2. The cell body membranes of cockroach GI 2 and fast coxal depressor motor neurones {{have been used to}} show that bicuculline blocks cell body (extrasynaptic) neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Pressure-injection of acetylcholine into the neuropile results in a depolarization of GI 2 that is blocked by bicuculline. Therefore, the block by bicuculline of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials recorded from GI 2 may result in part from actions at sites other than synaptic GABA receptors. Alternatively, there may exist a population of synaptic GABA receptors on GI 2 that, unlike GI 2 cell body GABA receptors, are sensitive to bicuculline...|$|E
