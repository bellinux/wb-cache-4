5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While the <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed the moat and also started to come inside Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down.
