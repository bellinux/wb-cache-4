5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This <b>starting</b> <b>method</b> typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractJackiewicz and Tracogna [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 32 (1995) 1390 – 1427] {{proposed}} a general formulation of two step Runge–Kutta (TSRK) methods.

In this paper, the more general challenge to provide correct <b>starting</b> values for <b>methods</b> of low stage-order is met by showing how perturbed starting values should be selected for methods of order 6 and stage-order 3.

40|$|The {{starting}} of an {{induction machine}} {{is a highly}} dynamic process, which on weak systems may result in voltage fluctuations within the network, potentially leading to load damage. The voltage fluctuations {{that may lead to}} this load damage can result from the high starting current in the induction machine.

Twenty power-trained males (24. 6 ± 4. 5 years; 25. 4 ± 2. 5 BMI) with the same exercise routine for the past 4 months performed, in a randomized order, four WAnT with different combinations of <b>start</b> <b>method,</b> flying (FLY) or stationary (STA), and front sprocket size, 62 -tooth sprocket (S- 62) or 85 -tooth sprocket (S- 85), using the Velotron Racermate®.

Pearson correlation (r) revealed no significant relationship between same <b>start</b> <b>methods,</b> FLY (p 3 ̆e 0. 05; r = 0. 227) or STA (p 3 ̆e 0. 05; r = - 0. 132), and same sprocket size, S- 62 (p 3 ̆e 0. 05; r = - 0. 179), or S- 85 (p 3 ̆e 0. 05; r = 0. 240).

5000|$|Electric {{starting}} {{is available}} for small engines and is found primarily on high-feature garden machinery and larger generators particularly where {{there is already a}} complex electrical system and there may be a need for auto-starting on demand. However, a self-retracting rope-pull mechanism called a recoil starter is the predominant method of starting small engines; it does not require a battery to power a starter motor, nor an alternator to keep a battery charged. Before the invention of the recoil starter, a notched pulley was attached to the engine's flywheel; the operator would manually wind a rope around the pulley then jerk the rope to rotate the engine so that it would start. Another <b>starting</b> <b>method</b> briefly popular in the 1960s was the [...] "impulse" [...] or [...] "wind-up" [...] starter. These were operated by winding a heavy spring by means of a rotating crank handle equipped with a sprag clutch, then releasing the spring's tension by means of a lever or knob so that it would spin the engine. These were discontinued when safety problems became apparent: it was possible to leave the starter wound up and ready to start the engine unintentionally, even long after the crank was wound up, if the release were jarred.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is well {{understood}} that induction motors draw higher currents during their starting operations {{than is the}} case under full load running conditions. Since {{the early days of}} induction motor availability, <b>starting</b> <b>methods</b> other than Direct-on-Line have been used, and in some cases mandated by Utilities, to reduce the effect of these high starting currents on the electrical distribution network. What is generally not recognized is the existence of short duration inrush currents, which greatly exceed these starting currents. Furthermore, the introduction of complex <b>starting</b> <b>methods</b> to reduce <b>starting</b> currents is often compromised by other unanticipated inrush currents introduced by the starting system itself, unless special precautions are taken.
