5000|$|A {{different}} perspective on Driekops Eiland [...] does not discount this possibility, that different identity groups {{have given rise to}} some of the variability between sites, but questions whether assigning variability in terms of ethnic or cultural differences in the first instance does not perhaps overlook degrees of complexity and other possible factors. This approach draws on archaeological sources, ethnographic clues, and palaeoenvironmental data to suggest that the environmental setting of the site was a locus of particular cultural and social significance. Ethnographic accounts, including those with reference to the social significance of water, show how features in the landscape could be imbued with meaning. Places and rock faces could become meaningful supports, mediating spirit worlds, the <b>surfaces</b> <b>bearing</b> the rock art images being a “most fundamental part of the context”.|$|E
50|$|Factory {{machines}} today {{usually have}} lube systems, {{in which a}} central pump serves periodic charges of oil or grease from a reservoir through lube lines to the various lube points in the machine's bearing <b>surfaces,</b> <b>bearing</b> journals, pillow blocks, and so on. The timing and number of such lube cycles {{is controlled by the}} machine's computerized control, such as PLC or CNC, as well as by manual override functions when occasionally needed. This automated process is how all modern CNC machine tools and many other modern factory machines are lubricated. Similar lube systems are also used on nonautomated machines, in which case there is a hand pump that a machine operator is supposed to pump once daily (for machines in constant use) or once weekly. These are called one-shot systems from their chief selling point: one pull on one handle to lube the whole machine, instead of a dozen pumps of an alemite gun or oil can in a dozen different positions around the machine.|$|E

By February, 1918, he had transferred to another Bavarian squadron, Jagdstaffel 79.

40|$|Innovative Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) using adapted {{commercial}} CPT {{equipment was}} conducted in Antarctica in early 2010 {{in an attempt to}} assess the strength of polar snow; additionally, application of CPT data was considered, particularly in estimating <b>surface</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. Almost 100 CPT tests were carried out and both qualitative and quantitative analysis of data was undertaken. Additional supporting testing in- cluded snow density assessment, snow strength assessment, extrapolation of CPT data via Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and preliminary mini-cone penetrometer testing in Greenland. Analysis of results revealed that assessing the strength of polar snow via CPT is affected by numerous factors including penetration rate, cone size/shape and snow material properties, particularly compaction of the snow undergoing penetration. A density-dependant relationship between CPT resistance and snow shear strength was established, and methods for estimating <b>surface</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity directly from CPT in homogeneous and layered polar snow were proposed. This work applied existing technology in a new material and shows that CPT can be used efficiently in polar environs to provide estimates of snow shear strength and <b>surface</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity, to depths of 10 m or more.
