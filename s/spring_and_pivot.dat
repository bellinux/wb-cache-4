50|$|The {{lower link}} {{itself is not}} {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each radius arm attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom <b>spring</b> mountings <b>and</b> <b>pivots</b> vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|R
5000|$|The three-box four-door saloon was in {{many ways}} conventional, using a unitary {{structure}} and MacPherson strut front suspension which were becoming mainstream {{by the time of the}} 1500s introduction. Less conventional was the independent rear suspension, which featured coil <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> semi-trailing wishbones <b>pivoted</b> from a stout cross beam that also supported the differential housing. [...] While BMW was using MacPherson struts for their first time on the New Class, they had used unit body construction on the 700 and semi-trailing arm rear suspension on the 600 and the 700. All New Class cars had front disc brakes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} stock {{found on}} the Galil is a rough-copy of the FN-FAL Paratrooper stock, with modifications for simpler production and ease of use. Unlike the FAL folding stock, the Galil uses no locking button and is operated entirely by a pin <b>and</b> <b>spring</b> <b>pivoting</b> mechanism; to fold the stock, the [...] "L" [...] bracket on the stock portion is pressed down to where the spring is fully compressed and the entire stock is allowed to pivot on the buttstock hinge. The same operation is done for unfolding to the stock to the open-position.|$|R
50|$|The {{escapement}} serves two purposes. First, {{it allows}} the train to advance fractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it supplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus maintaining {{the momentum of the}} oscillating balance. The escapement is the part that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves as the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to interfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the <b>spring</b> detent <b>and</b> <b>pivoted</b> detent. In both of these, a small detent locks the escape wheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except for a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible to outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the balance staff momentarily displaces the detent, allowing one tooth of the escape wheel to pass. The escape wheel tooth then imparts its energy on a second roller on the balance staff. Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the balance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the detent. The weakest link of any mechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the oil thickens through age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the rate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases through higher friction in the escapement. A detent escapement has a strong advantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from the escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little sliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels <b>and</b> passing <b>springs</b> are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass and steel.|$|R

40|$|Fluid dynamic bearing (FDB) oil <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> grease {{are used}} as {{lubricant}} in the spindle motor and in the actuator pivot bearing cartridge in the hard disk drive (HDD). The presence of high amount of both FDB oil <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> grease in hard disk drive {{may lead to the}} drive failure. Determination of FDB oil <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> grease presence in the HDD after 300 hours, 600 hours and 900 hours of testing in reliability chamber was done by extracting the recirculation filter and adsorbent breather filter in the HDD using hexane as the solvent. The presence of FDB oil <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> grease in the extracted solvent from the recirculation filter and adsorbent breather filter was determined via gas chromatography (GC) and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). The amount for both FDB oil <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> grease were found to increase with the HDD test time. At the point of saturation, the internal HDD environment contains 116 ng/sample of FDB oil and 1120 ng/sample of pivot grease based on the recirculation filter extraction. However, this amount of vapors were able to be removed by the adsorbent breather filter as it has yet to reach the maximum amount that it can absorb...|$|R

Lelli et al. evaluated the lever sign, Lachman, anterior drawer <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> shift tests. Sensitivity rates {{were found to be}} 1.00, 0.62, 0.72 and 0.47 respectively. Sensitivity of the Lachman test was seen to be lower than rates in literature and in the current study (Lelli et al. 2014). Pre-anaesthesia sensitivity in the current study was determined as lever sign 0.94, Lachman 0.80, anterior drawer 0.60 <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> shift test 0.62. Under anaesthesia, these values were determined as lever sign 0.98, Lachman 0.94, anterior drawer 0.84 <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> shift test 0.78. The sensitivity of the lever sign test was extremely high when applied both before and under anaesthesia and the results were seen to be consistent with those of the study by Lelli.|$|R

50|$|Davis {{continued}} {{to develop the}} design, switching the <b>pivot</b> <b>and</b> the <b>springing</b> points around so that the <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> shock absorber were under the frame <b>and</b> the <b>pivot</b> point {{was at the top}} of the triangular swingarm. This allowed the traditional Harley-Davidson oil tank to be placed under the seat. Davis attempted to produce the new design independently as the Road Worx Sub-Shock, but the partnership he had put together for this purpose collapsed. Harley-Davidson executive Jeffrey Bleustein contacted Davis shortly afterward and began negotiations to buy Davis's design. Davis sold his patents, prototype, and tooling to Harley-Davidson in January 1982. After further testing and development, Davis's design was introduced in June 1983 as the 1984 Harley-Davidson FXST Softail.|$|R
