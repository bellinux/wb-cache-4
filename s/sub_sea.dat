40|$|The Vestnesa Ridge is a 100 km {{long and}} ≈ 3 km wide {{sediment}} drift NW of the Svalbard Margin deposited on young oceanic crust. The {{crest of the}} Vestnesa Ridge is pierced by 133 pockmarks, where the orientation and elongation is controlled mainly by processes such as positioning of faulting, creeping of sediments or similar down-slope processes. High resolution single seismic reflection data together with chirp data across these pock-marks allowed connecting the potential fluid flow pathways in the <b>sub</b> <b>seabed</b> such as acoustic chimneys and faults to the pockmarks at the seabed. The acoustic datasets encompass very high resolution swath bathymetry data gridded to 15 m together with very resolution chirp data. A cross cutting BSR (bottom- simulating reflection) exists {{in the study area}} defining the base of the GHSZ (Gas hydrate stability zone), that becomes shallower towards the spreading zone due to increases in heat flow. The GHSZ overlays an approx. 150 m thick layer with en-hanced amplitude reflections suggesting considerable amounts of free gas beneath the GHSZ. Due to reduced permeability in hydrated sediments, gas apparently migrates below the GHSZ along the flanks of Vestnesa Ridge upwards towards the crest. Here the pressure builds up as it get trapped below the GHSZ. Acoustic chimneys connects to the seabed pockmarks and pierce through the GHSZ providing a pressure valve for the free gas zone directly beneath the BSR and possibly for the deep acoustic turbidity zone, where gas may accumulate. Suggested source regions of fluid flow encompass both a depth window for thermogenic gas and a shallow temperature window for biogenic gas...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLNG FPSO&# 146;s {{are getting}} more {{interest}} as the new oil and gas reserves are found in <b>sub</b> <b>seas.</b> But a main technical challenge {{has been identified as}} the liquefaction systems since its considered as the bottle in natural gas processing. The LNG FPSO&# 146;s are subjected to motion in the sea and it&# 146;s been observed that it can affect the flows inside the heat exchangers. Previous research conducted by NTNU and SINTEF research showed that flow patterns are getting changed and disturbed during the motion. Also the phenomenon of multi phase flows and its heat transfer mechanism is studied during the work. The main motivation of this work is to conduct the experiment in the laboratory to observe the changes in flow patterns when motion is induced. For the current study only horizontal motion has been considered due to the technical difficulties that are involved in setting up the experiment. A simple electric motor with eccentric extended arm is used to induce the motion to the platform. The platform was hinged {{in such a way that}} it will allow to move in the horizontal plane with a pivoted axis. The reading has been recorded during the flow when the experiment is in steady state and also when the motion is induced in the setup. Later these results are analyzed using the Matlab coding. Also visual aids have been used to record the flow during the experiment. The results are described in the work by the aid of photographs and also by using the graphs. It should be mentioned here that when motion is induced in test section the signals that has been obtained showed very large disturbance and it was very difficult to be analyzed using Matlab. The code was modified but still the results are non recognizable since the Matlab wasn&# 146;t able to recognize steady state of the flows. Due to this the visual observations by the student and the visual aids in the form of photographs and video has been used to analyze the results. The flow patterns where changing abruptly and the bigger slug flow was observed to be breaking in to smaller ones. Also the velocity of the flow was observed to be changed by the motion. The results are discussed in this report. </p...|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} that {{the wreck of the}} Port Nicholson was discovered in 2008 by Greg Brooks, of the American company <b>Sub</b> <b>Sea</b> Research, but the discovery was kept secret until February 2012. Brooks initially claimed to be investigating an unidentified vessel, codenamed Blue Baron, that lay off the coast of Guyana in South America. This was an attempt to throw fellow treasure seekers off the trail, as Brooks believed that Port Nicholson was carrying a valuable cargo of platinum, gold, and industrial diamonds {{at the time of her}} sinking, payment from the Soviet Union for material delivered under lend-lease, which would now be worth around £2 billion. He reported that two Soviet envoys accompanied the ship, and that the Soviet government reimbursed the US government for the lost payment. The salvors have claimed that underwater exploration of the wreck has revealed boxes too heavy to lift, that are supposed to contain the platinum ingots. The British, US and Russian governments may make claims over the cargo should anything of serious value be discovered. Several maritime and Second World War historians have cast doubts over whether the ship was carrying such a precious cargo, citing the lack of documentation, and that if the Port Nicholson had been carrying such a cargo, she may have been partially salvaged already.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{difference}} between effective reflectance from <b>sub</b> <b>sea</b> objects and water suspended materials {{is a function}} of attenuation coefficient (k) of light intensity in bodies of water. The amount of C-Cmin (here C is digital number) identifies the effective reflectance and it is possible to differentiate the effective reflectance from <b>sub</b> <b>sea</b> objects and water suspended loads using a specific display image of band ratios. In a ratio display image of Landsat TM band pairs, this difference {{is a function of}} (1 - e ki) /(1 – ekj). This value for Khark and Kharkoo <b>sub</b> <b>sea</b> objects (Coral reefs and sandy beds) in the Landsat TM image of 1998 is always positive and less than one. Thus a RGB false color of the atmospherically corrected ratio image of effective reflectance (C-Cmin) display image as (C – Cmin) b 2 /(C – Cmin) b 1; (C – Cmin) b 3 /(C – Cmin) b 2; (C – Cmin) b 4 /(C – Cmin) b 3 : (RGB) shows the best separation of the <b>sub</b> <b>sea</b> objects.

40|$|AbstractThe wave–seabed {{interaction}} {{issue is}} of great importance {{for the design of}} foundation around marine infrastructures. Most previous investigations for such a problem have been limited to uncoupled or one-way coupled methods connecting two separated wave and <b>seabed</b> <b>sub</b> models with the continuity of pressures at the seabed surface. In this study, a strongly coupled model was proposed to realize both wave and seabed processes in a same program and to calculate the wave fields and seabed response simultaneously. The information between wave fields and seabed fields were strongly shared and thus results in a more profound investigation of the mechanism of the wave–seabed interaction. In this letter, the wave and seabed models were validated with previous experimental tests. Then, a set of application of present model were discussed in prediction of the wave-induced seabed response. Numerical results show the wave-induced liquefaction area of coupled model is smaller than that of uncoupled model...|$|R
40|$|Aquarius is a {{combined}} passive/active L-band microwave instrument developed {{to map the}} salinity field at {{the surface of the}} ocean from space. The data will support studies of the coupling between ocean circulation, the global water cycle, and climate. The primary science objective of this mission is to monitor the seasonal and interannual variation of the large scale features of the surface salinity field in the open ocean with a spatial resolution of 150 kilometers and a retrieval accuracy of 0. 2 practical salinity units globally on a monthly basis. The measurement principle is based on the response of the L-band (1. 413 gigahertz) sea surface brightness temperatures (T (<b>sub</b> B)) to <b>sea</b> surface salinity. To achieve the required 0. 2 practical salinity units accuracy, the impact of sea surface roughness (e. g. wind-generated ripples and waves) along with several factors on the observed brightness temperature has to be corrected to better than a few tenths of a degree Kelvin. To the end, Aquarius includes a scatterometer to help correct for this surface roughness effect...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePrimary marine aerosol fluxes were {{measured}} using eddy covariance (EC), a condensation particle counter (CPC) and an optical particle counter (OPC) with a heated inlet. The later {{was used to}} discriminate between sea salt and total aerosol. Measurements were made from the 25 m tower at the research station Mace Head at the Irish west coast, May to September 2002. The aerosol fluxes were dominated by upward fluxes, sea spray from bubble bursting at the ocean surface. The sea salt aerosol number emissions increased two orders of magnitude with declining diameter from 1 to 0. 1 ?m where it peaked at values of 10 5 to 10 7 particles m ? 2 s ? 1. The sea salt emissions increased at all sizes in the wind range 4 to 22 ms ? 1, in consistency with a power function of the wind speed. The sea salt emission data were compared to three recent <b>sub</b> micrometer <b>sea</b> salt source parameterisations. The best agreement was with Mårtensson et al. (2003), which appear to apply from 0. 1 to 1. 1 ?m diameters in temperate water (12 °C) as well as tropical water (25 °C). The total aerosol emissions were independent of the wind speed below 10 ms ? 1, but increased with the wind above 10 ms ? 1. The aerosol volume emissions were larger for the total aerosol than for the sea salt at all wind speeds, while the sea salt number emissions approached the total number emissions at 15 ms ? 1. It is speculated that this is caused by organic carbon in the surface water that is depleted at high wind speeds. The data are consistent with an internal aerosol mixture of sea salt, organic carbon and water. Using the aerosol model by Ellison et al. (1999) (a mono-layer of organic carbon surrounding a water-sea-salt brine) we show that the total and sea salt aerosol emissions are consistent. This predict that the organic carbon fraction increase with decreasing diameter from a few % at 1 ?m over 50 % at about 0. 5 ?m to about 90 % at 0. 1 ?m, in consistency with simultaneous chemical data by Cavalli et al. (2004). The combined models of Mårtensson et al. (2003) and Ellison et al. (1999) reproduce the observed total aerosol emissions and offer an approach to model the organic sea spray fraction...|$|R
