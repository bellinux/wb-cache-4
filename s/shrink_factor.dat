The North China Plain (NCP) is known for the large scale biomass burning (BB) of field residues, which often results in heavy haze pollution episodes across the region. We {{have been able to}} capture a unique BB episode during the international CAREBeijing-NCP intensive field campaign in Wangdu in the NCP (38. 6 °N, 115. 2 °E) from June to July 2014. It was found that aerosol particles originating from this BB event showed a significantly different mixing state compared with clean and non-BB pollution episodes. BB originated particles showed a narrower probability density function (PDF) of <b>shrink</b> <b>factor</b> (SF). And the maximum was found at <b>shrink</b> <b>factor</b> of 0. 6, which is higher than in other episodes. The non-volatile particle number fraction during the BB episode decreased to 3 % and was the lowest measured value compared to all other predefined episodes. To evaluate the influence of particle mixing state on aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA), SSA at different RHs was simulated using the measured aerosol physical-chemical properties. The differences between the calculated SSA for biomass burning, clean and pollution episodes are significant, meaning that the variation of SSA in different pollution conditions needs to be considered in the evaluation of aerosol direct radiative effects in the NCP. And the calculated SSA was found to be quite sensitive on the mixing state of BC, especially at low-RH condition. The simulated SSA was also compared with the measured values. For all the three predefined episodes, the measured SSA are very close to the calculated ones with assumed mixing states of homogeneously internal and core-shell internal mixing, indicating that both of the conception models are appropriate for the calculation of ambient SSA in the NCP...|$|E

Graduated Optimization Algorithm (GOA) {{is a popular}} heuristic method to obtain global optimums of nonconvex problems through progressively minimizing a series of convex approximations to the nonconvex problems more and more accurate. Recently, such an algorithm GradOpt based on GOA is proposed with amazing theoretical and experimental results, but it mainly studies the problem which consists of one nonconvex part. This paper aims to find the global solution of a nonconvex objective with a convex part plus a nonconvex part based on GOA. By graduating approximating non-convex {{part of the problem}} and minimizing them with the Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) or proximal SVRG, two new algorithms, SVRG-GOA and PSVRG-GOA, are proposed.

Some tricks, such as enlarging <b>shrink</b> <b>factor,</b> using project step, stochastic gradient, and mini-batch skills, are also given to accelerate the convergence speed of the proposed algorithms.

Submicron aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility were measured during and after the control period using a hygroscopic and volatile tandem differential mobility analyzer (H/V-TDMA) system. Three periods, namely the control clean period (Clean 1), the non-control clean period (Clean 2), and the non-control pollution period (Pollution), were selected to study the effect of the emission control measures on aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility. Aerosol particles became more hydrophobic and volatile due to the emission control measures. The hygroscopicity parameter (κ) of 40 – 200  nm particles decreased by 32. 0 – 8. 5  % during the Clean 1 period relative to the Clean 2 period, while the volatile <b>shrink</b> <b>factor</b> (SF) of 40 – 300  nm particles decreased by 7. 5 – 10. 5  %. The emission controls also changed the diurnal variation patterns of both the probability density function of κ (κ -PDF) and the probability density function of SF (SF-PDF). During Clean 1 the κ -PDF showed one nearly hydrophobic (NH) mode for particles in the nucleation mode, which was likely due to the dramatic reduction in industrial emissions of inorganic trace gases. Compared to the Pollution period, particles observed during the Clean 1 and Clean 2 periods exhibited a more significant nonvolatile (NV) mode throughout the day, suggesting a more externally mixed state particularly for the 150  nm particles. Aerosol hygroscopicities increased as particle sizes increased, with the greatest increases seen during the Pollution period. Accordingly, the aerosol volatility became weaker (i. e., SF increased) as particle sizes increased during the Clean 1 and Clean 2 periods, but no apparent trend was observed during the Pollution period. Based on a correlation analysis of the number fractions of NH and NV particles, we found that a higher number fraction of hydrophobic and volatile particles during the emission control period...|$|E

Low volatility (LV) particles, with a volatility <b>shrink</b> <b>factor</b> (VSF) at 300  °C exceeding 0. 9, contributed 5  % of number concentrations of the 40  nm particles and 11 – 15  % of the 80 – 300  nm particles. They were composed of non-volatile material externally mixed with volatile material, and therefore did not evaporate significantly at 300  °C. Non-volatile material mixed internally with the volatile material {{was referred to}} as medium volatility (MV, 0. 4  [*]<[*] VSF [*]<[*]  0. 9) and high volatility (HV, VSF [*]<[*]  0. 4) particles. The MV and HV particles contributed 57 – 71  % of number concentration for the particles between 40 and 300  nm in size. The average EC and OC concentrations measured by the OC ∕ EC analyzer were 3. 4  ±  3. 0 and 9. 0  ±  6. 0  µg m − 3, respectively. Non-volatile OC evaporating at 475  °C or above, together with EC, contributed 67  % of the total carbon mass. In spite of the daily maximum and minimum, the diurnal variations in the volume fractions of the volatile material, HV, MV and LV residuals were less than 15  % for the 80 – 300  nm particles. Back trajectory analysis also suggests that over 90  % of the air masses influencing the sampling site were well aged as they were transported at low altitudes (below 1500  m) for over 40  h before arrival. Further comparison with the diurnal variations in the mass fractions of EC and the non-volatile OC in PM 2. 5 suggests that the non-volatile residuals may be related to both EC and non-volatile OC in the afternoon, during which the concentration of aged organics increased. A closure analysis of the total mass of LV and MV residuals and the mass of EC or the sum of EC and non-volatile OC was conducted.
