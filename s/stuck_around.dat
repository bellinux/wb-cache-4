25|$|Having {{played for}} the Nottinghamshire Second XI since 1981, Evans made his {{first-class}} debut for Nottinghamshire against Cambridge University in 1984 at Trent Bridge. He played two further first-class matches in his debut season against the touring Sri Lankans and West Indians, as well as making his List A debut against Middlesex in the 1984 John Player Special League. First-class and List A appearances were {{few and far between}} for Evans between 1984 and 1987, but he eventually broke into the Nottinghamshire side on a regular basis in the 1988 season. An all-rounder, Evans was able to provide valuable runs down the batting order, though he had mixed seasons and struggles with consistency. His most successful season with the bat in first-class cricket came in 1990 when he scored 738 runs at an average of 46.12, including making his maiden century against Somerset, which followed on from a duck he had made earlier in the match. His batting average mostly <b>stuck</b> <b>around</b> in the twenties and he only had an average higher than thirty in three seasons. It was a similar story with the ball for Evans in his first-class career, with him not taking a five wicket haul until the 1991 season. Typically, his bowling average season-to-season fluctuated in the late twenties to mid-thirties. He took 40 wickets or more in a season on three occasions, with the 1997 season being his most successful with 45 wickets at an average of 28.37 (though he did take 48 wickets in 1992, but at a higher average), which included his career best figures of 6/40 which came against Lancashire. Evans played a total of 161 first-class matches for Nottinghamshire between 1984 and 1999, scoring 4,198 runs at an average of 23.85, with a high score of 104, one of three centuries along with 21 half centuries he made. An able fielder, he also took 111 catches. Evans along with West Indian Jimmy Adams holds the record for the 9th wicket for Nottinghamshire with a partnership of 170. With the ball, he took 364 wickets at an average of 33.23, with best figures of 6/40, one of ten five wicket hauls he took.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Recently, {{employment}} of rotary tillers has been expanded in gardens and small farms, {{especially in the}} northern of Iran. However using the L-shaped blades in the conventional rotary tillers have some problems such as severe vibration problems, weeds <b>stucking</b> <b>around</b> the blades, forming the plow pan and lower performance due to the less powers of such small rototillers. Therefore in order to overcome the above mentioned problems, a rototiller with new ridged blades was designed, fabricated and tested in this research. Materials and Methods Experiments were carried out {{in one of the}} citrus orchards in Mazandaran, Sari. The experimental design was split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replications. The soil moisture as main plot varied in two levels of 13. 5 - 21. 9 and 21. 9 - 30. 3 percent based on dry weight and the rotational speed of blades as subplots varied in three levels of 140 - 170, 170 - 200 and 200 - 230 rpm. The measured parameters consist of soil particle mean weight diameter, soil bulk density, soil crumbling percentage, specific fuel consumption and machine efficiency. The diameter of soil particles was measured using a set of standard sieves with diameter ranging from 0. 5 to 8 mm. Then a laboratory shaker was used to sift the samples. Each sample was shaken in 30 sec. The fuel consumption during the experiments was determined by the filled fuel tank method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean comparisons and interaction between the parameters were performed using the SPSS 16 software. Results and Discussion The results indicated that the soil particle mean weight diameter reduced by increasing blades rotational speed in both examined soil moisture contents. Results indicated that the soil crumbling percent increases with increasing the rotational speed. The main reason for this effect could be due to the more energy transferring to the soil at higher rotational speeds, which result in further crumbling of the soil slices. Regarding the results obtained in this study, the specific fuel consumption increased at first in a light slope, then in a steep rise with increasing the blades rotational speed. The reason can be the higher crumbling percent of the soil at higher rotational speeds and higher soil moisture contents (at the range of 21. 9 - 30. 3...|$|R

By the late 1960s, major development efforts were underway in France, the UK and the USA.

This led to a series of new high-speed train designs in the 1970s, starting with their own APT. Although the hovertrains still had reduced infrastructure costs compared to the APT and similar designs like the TGV, in practice this was offset by their need for entirely new lines. Conventional wheeled trains could run at low speed on existing lines, greatly reducing capital expenditures in dense areas. Interest in hovertrains waned, and major development had ended by the mid-1970s.|$|R
