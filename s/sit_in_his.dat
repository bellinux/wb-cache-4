5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E

He also began to grow a mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would continue to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E
5|$|Glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) sets up his widower father Burt (Mike O'Malley) with Finn Hudson's (Cory Monteith) widowed mother Carole (Romy Rosemont). He {{believes}} that it will help him become closer to Finn, for whom he has feelings. Finn is upset when Carole sells their old furniture, and stops his late father's recliner from being sold. He is initially hostile to her dating someone new, but begins to bond with Burt over sports at a group dinner. Kurt feels left out, and later asks Finn to help him break up their parents. Finn initially agrees, but relents after Burt tells him that he loves Carole and would never hurt her. They watch a basketball game together and Finn allows Burt to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> father's recliner, while Kurt watches on sadly through the window.|$|E

5|$|Most pre-race {{analyses}} identified Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans, and Carlos Sastre as {{the major}} favorites to win the overall classification, with Evans perhaps the consensus pick. Basso and Sastre had both ridden the Giro in 2009 and come away finishing in the top five. Sastre also won two difficult mountain stages in the race's final week, and was noted as a rider who gets stronger as a race goes along, making the Giro's very climbing-intensive third week possibly <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favor. Evans had finished on a Grand Tour podium {{in each of the}} past three seasons, including in the most recent three-week event, the 2009 Vuelta a España. He also entered the race as the reigning world cycling champion and had had a successful 2010 season to date, with a win in La Flèche Wallonne and a podium finish in the Tirreno–Adriatico. Neither Basso nor Sastre had raced much in the 2010 season prior to the Giro. Other riders named as contenders included Bradley Wiggins, former Giro winners Damiano Cunego and Stefano Garzelli, Alexander Vinokourov, Marzio Bruseghin, Christian Vande Velde, Domenico Pozzovivo, David Moncoutié, and Michele Scarponi. Race director Angelo Zomegnan also named Basso, Evans, and Sastre as his three favorites, and included Wiggins and Linus Gerdemann as possible darkhorses.|$|E

25|$|Holland {{meanwhile}} encouraged other provinces {{to follow}} its example. In Zeeland {{a majority of}} the States voted to also leave the office of stadtholder vacant, and assume its powers. For good measure, the vote of the First Noble in the States of Zeeland (which was usually exercised by the Prince of Orange as Marquess of Veere and Flushing) was abolished, and the request of the Zeeland ridderschap to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> place was denied. In other provinces, the results were mixed. Holland sent a delegation to Gelderland (where the divided States voted to postpone a decision). Willem Frederik, meanwhile, {{with the help of the}} States of Friesland, Groningen, and Drenthe (where he was stadtholder) exhorted the States of Overijssel and Utrecht to appoint baby William (with him as lieutenant), but to no avail. These provinces decided to await the Great Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Saṅkalpa (Hindi: सङ्कल्प, meaning Resolution): The canto {{begins with}} the concept of {{resolution}} – the poet states that a noble resolution is the true and pure resolution. Aṣṭāvakra is born handicapped, and a son Śvetaketu is born to Uddālaka at the same time. Both uncle and nephew grow up together in Uddālaka's Āśrama. Uddālaka is more fond of Aṣṭāvakra, his disabled grandson, than Śvetaketu. Aṣṭāvakra excels in learning from Uddālaka, outclassing all other disciples including Śvetaketu. On Aṣṭāvakra's tenth birthday, Uddālaka organises a celebration. Uddālaka makes Aṣṭāvakra <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lap and starts embracing him. Seeing this, Śvetaketu is possessed by jealousy, and asks Aṣṭāvakra to get down from his father's lap. Śvetaketu tells him that Uddālaka is actually his grandfather, and that he does not know about his real father. Śvetaketu further humiliates Aṣṭāvakra by mocking his disability. On hearing about his real father Kahola from Sujātā, Aṣṭāvakra thanks Śvetaketu for awakening him. Aṣṭāvakra makes a firm resolution of not returning to Uddālaka's Āśrama without his father. The resolution will show the world that the disabled can achieve anything they dream of.|$|E

500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E
2500|$|From 1970 to 1973, Cleese {{served as}} rector of the University of St Andrews. His {{election}} proved a milestone for the university, revolutionising and modernising the post. For instance, the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an [...] "Assessor", a deputy to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> place at important meetings in his absence. Cleese changed {{this into a}} position for a student, elected across campus by the student body, resulting in direct access and representation for the student body.|$|E

[...] His father, Galen Fogerty, was a native of South Dakota and worked as a Linotype {{operator}} for the Berkeley Gazette. Lucile Fogerty was from Great Falls, Montana. When John was two years old his parents both converted to Catholicism. He first attended a Catholic school in Berkeley named the [...] "School of the Madeleine". In his memoir, Fortunate Son, Fogerty was critical of the school, saying [...] he was not permitted {{to go to the bathroom}} when he asked and frequently wet himself in the classroom and was forced to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> wet clothing.|$|E
2500|$|After {{retiring}} in 1968, Crisler {{continued to live}} in Ann Arbor. When Bo Schembechler took over as Michigan's football coach in 1969, he recalled that he {{went out of his}} way to get to know Crisler. [...] Schembechler considered Crisler [...] "a giant" [...] and made time to go over to Crisler's house and <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> basement, listening to Crisler's theories and stories. [...] In 1978, Crisler and Fielding H. Yost became the first coaches inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor; the only persons inducted ahead of Crisler and Yost were athletes, Gerald R. Ford, Bill Freehan, Tom Harmon, Ron Kramer, Bennie Oosterbaan, Cazzie Russell, and Bob Ufer. [...] He died in Ann Arbor in 1982 at age 83. [...] He had been hospitalized twice in his final months, once for pneumonia.|$|E

Three months later on October 7, silent-screen cowboy star William S. Hart (1864-1946) visited Masterson. They were photographed standing together {{on the roof of the}} New York Morning Telegraph building and went back to Masterson's office where he asked Hart to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and pose for a second photo with him. According to Hart: [...] "I did so, and he stood beside me. Mr. Masterson was sitting in that same chair eighteen days later when he heard the last call." [...] Hart subsequently cast a Masterson lookalike as Masterson in his biographical film Wild Bill Hickok, which was released in 1923.|$|E

Shortly after Bethell's group had cleared the tunnel into the woods there was a shot signalling that the escape had been discovered. They broke into twos and Bethell joined Les Long known to all as [...] "Cookie", hoping to cross the Czech border about 40 miles distant. Snow and flooding forced them to alter their route toward Frankfurt an der Oder where they hoped to hop on a freight train and escape to Sweden. They walked along a railway line, slept in a barn at night then started to travel in daylight but were captured at Bernau. Long and Bethell were held in the Gestapo prison at Görlitz until Long was taken away and shot. Bethell was returned to the prison camp.|$|E
2500|$|In 1848 Meucci {{developed}} a popular method of using electric shocks to treat rheumatism. He {{used to give}} his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the [...] "tongue" [...] of copper wire was vibrating just like a leaf of an electroscope; which means {{that there was an}} electrostatic effect. In order to continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he heard inarticulated human voice. He called this device [...] "telegrafo parlante" [...] (litt. [...] "talking telegraph").|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the late}} modern era, the abbot {{was treated with}} the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house. [...] When he {{appeared}} either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed. [...] His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king. [...] No monk might <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society. [...] The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table. [...] In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks. [...] In the West the Rule of St Benedict appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers. [...] Because this permission {{opened the door to}} luxurious living, Synods of Aachen (816–819), decreed that the abbot should dine in the refectory, and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots. [...] When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his chaplains waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.|$|E
