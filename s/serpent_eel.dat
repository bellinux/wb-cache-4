5000|$|The <b>serpent</b> <b>eel</b> or sand snake-eel, Ophisurus serpens is an eel of {{the genus}} Ophisurus found in the eastern Atlantic, western Mediterranean, western Indian Ocean, western Pacific and the {{north-east}} and west coast of North Island in New Zealand. Its length is between 150 and 250 centimetres.|$|E
50|$|The Fintail <b>serpent</b> <b>eel</b> (Neenchelys buitendijki, {{also known}} {{commonly}} as the Spotted worm-eel in India) is an eel {{in the family}} Ophichthidae (worm/snake eels). It was described by Max Carl Wilhelm Weber and Lieven Ferdinand de Beaufort in 1916. It is a marine, tropical eel which is known from the Indian Ocean, including Pakistan, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. It inhabits burrows in soft sediments, and leads a nocturnal lifestyle. Males can reach a maximum total length of 30 centimetres.|$|E
50|$|The Egyptian pantheon was {{especially}} fond of zoomorphism, with many animals sacred to particular deities—cats to Bastet, ibises and baboons to Thoth, crocodiles to Sebek and Ra, fish to Set, mongoose, shrew and birds to Horus, dogs and jackals to Anubis, <b>serpents</b> and <b>eels</b> to Atum, beetles to Khepera, bulls to Apis. Animals were often mummified {{as a result}} of these beliefs.|$|R
2500|$|Offa’s coinage {{represents}} one of the high-points of Anglo-Saxon art, and indeed they were probably the most artistically accomplished coins produced anywhere in Europe at that time: they stand in sharp contrast with the aniconic coins of contemporary Frankia. Portraits were introduced at an early stage, and were executed {{in a number of different}} styles betraying a range of artistic influences drawing on contemporary and Roman sources. Reverse designs included intricate crosses of various types, but the range of Offa's die-cutters encompassed other reverse designs including intertwining <b>serpents,</b> <b>eels</b> and the wolf and twins. Uniquely in Anglo-Saxon England, coins were also struck at Canterbury in the name of the queen, Cynethryth, from dies produced by the same talented individual responsible for the best of Offa’s portrait dies. This practice could have been inspired by encounters with Roman coins in the names of empresses. It is also possible, though less likely, that the appearance of Irene on Byzantine coinage led Offa’s queen to place her image on coins as well. Certainly Cynethryth emerges from surviving evidence as a formidable individual, who regularly witnessed contemporary charters immediately after her husband, was responsible for the running of his household and survived him to become a powerful abbess.|$|R
25|$|Among <b>serpents</b> and <b>eels,</b> {{snakes and}} lizards were also popular {{depictions of the}} god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, {{involved}} in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians were well aware of both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin and the dangers posed by its poison. Texts like the Brooklyn Papyrus include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture.|$|R
40|$|The {{hemoglobin}} {{system of}} the <b>serpent</b> <b>eel</b> Ophisurus serpens was structurally and functionally characterized {{with the aim of}} comparing it to the hemoglobin system of other fish species, as oxygen loading under the severe habitat conditions experienced by O. serpens could have necessitated specific adaptation mechanisms during evolution. The hemoglobin system of O. serpens includes one cathodic and four anodic components. The molecular mass of the α and β chains of the cathodic component as well as the 2 α and 4 β of the anodic components were determined. Analysis of the intact α and β chains from cathodic hemoglobin and their proteolytic digestion products by high-resolution MS and MS/MS experiments resulted in 92 and 95 % sequence coverage of the α and β globins, respectively. The oxygen binding properties of both hemoglobin components were analyzed with respect to their interactions with their physiological effectors. Stripped cathodic hemoglobin displayed the highest oxygen affinity among Anguilliformes with no significant effect of pH on O 2 -affinity. In the presence of both chloride and organic phosphates, O 2 -affinity was strongly reduced, and cooperativity was enhanced; moreover, cathodic hemoglobin contains two indistinguishable GTP-binding sites. Stripped anodic hemoglobins exhibited both low O 2 -affinity and low cooperativity and a larger Bohr effect than cathodic hemoglobin. The cathodic hemoglobin of O. serpens and the corresponding component of Conger conger share the greatest structural and functional similarity among hemoglobin systems of Anguilliformes studied to date, consistent with their phylogenetic relationship...|$|E
5000|$|By {{the middle}} of the 8th century, {{production}} of sceattas had, as with the thrymsas before them, declined considerably: the last coins of the secondary period are scarce and often debased, and a dearth of coinage is indicated in the record of several archaeological and metal-detecting sites that had been productive for the previous period. Similar problems afflicted the Frankish kingdom too, and around 754/5 King Pippin III (751-68) took the initiative and reformed the Frankish coinage, introducing a new, thinner, broader format (at least 15mm in diameter) struck in much finer silver. Importantly, these new coins all bore the king’s name and (usually) the name of the issuing mint. English rulers followed suit around the same time, and the earliest signs of reform outside Northumbria (where a substantial and relatively high quality silver coinage remained in production, albeit sporadically, over the 8th century) came in East Anglia, where the obscure ruler Beonna reformed the local coinage sometime after he came to the throne in 749. His coins bear the royal name and that of the moneyer, and in fabric are midway between the sceattas and the new Frankish pennies. Initially struck in fine silver, Beonna’s coinage later declined in standard, though one of his moneyers survived to strike some of the earliest coins known for Offa of Mercia. It was Offa who introduced the broad penny to southumbrian England on a substantial scale, and made the employment of king’s and moneyer’s names standard at least three mints: Canterbury, London and somewhere in East Anglia. His earliest coins bear an abbreviated version of the royal title influenced by that on the coinage of Pippin III, and on the reverse the moneyer’s name. Early {{in the course of his}} coinage (probably in the 760s or 770s) there were also smaller issues at Canterbury in the names of two local Kentish kings, Heaberht (of whom only one coin survives) and Ecgberht II. Production of broad silver pennies also persisted in East Anglia, commencing in Offa's name but later interrupted by a small coinage struck in the name of King Æthelberht II of East Anglia, who was executed by Offa in 794: only three specimens of his coinage survive today, probably produced in the 780s or 90s. Offa’s coinage represents one of the high-points of Anglo-Saxon art, and indeed they were probably the most artistically accomplished coins produced anywhere in Europe at that time: they stand in sharp contrast with the aniconic coins of contemporary Frankia. Portraits were introduced at an early stage, and were executed in a number of different styles betraying a range of artistic influences drawing on contemporary and Roman sources.

5000|$|Anderson's {{appointment}} {{must give}} general satisfaction. I remember when I went to Edinburgh first in November 1818 Anderson was newly {{come out to}} the bar that same year, and McNeill two years before...Anderson is a son of the late Mr Anderson of Moredun. He is connected with the Forbeses and Hays, and his brother {{is now one of the}} Partners of Sir William Forbes & Company's Bank. There is a Colony of the Andersons in and about Edinburgh such as the Andersons of St Germains, Moredun, &c &c - all cousins, and all descended from decent East Lothian farmers as I believe and elevated into gentry some Century back. If I remember right their ancestor acted as Guide to Charles Edward's Army in their attack upon Cope through the Marshes of Preston to which neighbourhood he belonged...He is a thin pale man, six feet five or six inches high, with a delicate complexion, gentlemanlike look, mild, modest and respectable. His gait in walking has a peculiar twist that reminds one of a bent willow, or a <b>serpent</b> or <b>Eel.</b> His voice is weak and squeaking, but Clear, and his mind like his person is respectable. He is a good lawyer, is acute, fluent in speech, but neither eloquent nor forcible - and is apt to be somewhat diffuse and prolix in his pleadings. His fluency too is more acquired than natural. - In the Teind Court the whole Judges sit together, and I remember Adam Anderson, then a boyish looking lad in the summer of 1819 or 1820, rising up in the middle of a very thronged bar and crowded Court, to make a motion. His length appeared awkward and preposterous - he mistook his motion, stammered out something in great trepidation, and when the Lord President Hope with a look of surprise and good humour corrected his mistake poor Adam sat down amidst a general titter from the bench, bar and miscellaneous crowd of agents and clerks behind the bar. Now he sits in a silk gown from within the bar and enjoys a first rate practice, with the general estimation and respect of the profession.When the Conservatives came in sic December 1834 Duncan McNeill was appointed Solicitor-General and Anderson succeeded him as Sheriff of Perth. He resigned this office about a twelve month ago amidst the general regret of all classes and parties in the county in favour of Whigham, his senior by two years at the bar. He is a batchelor. So much for Anderson.|$|R
