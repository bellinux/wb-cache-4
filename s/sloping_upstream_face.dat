40|$|Installation of baffles {{intended}} to improve fish passage through culverts can reduce discharge capacity and trap debris, increasing flood risk. A <b>sloping</b> <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> may reduce this risk, but new designs must {{be tested for}} fish passage efficiency. The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a critically endangered species, yet the suitability of even common baffle types to aid upstream movement has not been tested. This study compared the water depth, velocity, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and upstream passage performance of adult yellow-phase eels, between three 6 m long culvert models: smooth and unmodified (control); containing corner baffles (treatment 1); and with prototype sloped baffles installed (treatment 2). Passage of individual fish was assessed during 25 one-hour trials per model. Performance was quantified as entrance efficiency, number of entries per fish, passage efficiency, and overall efficiency. Total and passage delay, and successful passage time were also evaluated. Despite some individuals being able to swim against unexpectedly high water velocities (> 1. 5 m s? 1 for 4 m), passage performance in the control was poor, with an overall efficiency of 28 %. Compared to the control, both treatments increased the mean centreline water depth by approximately 0. 11 m, created heterogeneous flow conditions with low velocity resting areas, and reduced maximum velocities. As a result, entrance rate and all efficiency parameters were higher for the treatments than for the control (overall efficiency = 84 %), despite longer passage delay. The TKE was slightly higher in treatment 2 than 1, {{but there was no}} difference in water depth or overall efficiency. The findings show that both corner and sloped baffles can mitigate for impeded upstream adult eel movement. The extent to which the <b>sloping</b> <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> will improve debris transport should be explored further...|$|E

The reservoir is modelled with 8 -noded isoparametric displacement based solid finite elements. The study includes both stiff and flexible dams with vertical and <b>sloped</b> <b>upstream</b> <b>faces</b> under ramp, harmonic and random acceleration loads.

40|$|Most dams have a {{low-level}} outlet {{that consists of}} a closed conduit through the dam with a slide gate or valve to regulate flow. These outlets are used mainly for irrigational purposes but also for flushing the reservoir and controlling the reservoir elevation. When discharging through the low-level outlet works, negative pressures can develop on the downstream side of the gate creating a potential for cavitation damage and vibration. To minimize these effects, air vents (vented to the atmosphere) are installed on the downstream side of the gate to limit downstream pressure to something above vapor pressure (i. e., near atmospheric pressure). Previous air venting studies have been mostly limited to large dam outlet geometries, which typically feature a vertical gate in a flat-bottomed discharge tunnel. The large-dam air demand analysis {{has been based on}} the Froude number of the supercritical flow at the vena contract (located between the gate and the hydraulic jump) and the water flow rate. Small to medium-sized embankment dams typically utilize a slide gate installed on the <b>sloped</b> <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> for flow control, followed by a vertical elbow connected to a sloping pipe. With this outlet geometry, there is no 1 -D vena contracta flow, no classical hydraulic jump, and no representative Froude number. Additionally, no head-discharge characteristic data have been found for inclined slide gates (vented or non-vented) for small to medium-sized dams. Consequently, unless a flow measurement structure is installed in the discharge channel downstream of the dam, determining the water discharge rate based on gate opening and head on the gate, and consequently the air demand is problematic. This study focuses on quantifying air demand and air vent sizing for the small to medium-sized embankment dam low-level outlet geometries by providing: 1. Cd values as a function of gate openings and air demand; to better estimate flow rates from outlet works of similar geometries. 2. Flow conditions for varying operating conditions. 3. A new relationship for sizing air vents as a function of driving head and gate opening. 4. The magnitude of negative pressures for non-vented conduits. 5. A foundation for future studies and development of air demand research. This thesis presents the findings of this study...|$|R
40|$|Shock waves {{arriving}} at a dam site are close to plane waves when {{the center of an}} underwater explosion is far from the dam site. In general, the wave pressure is calculated with COLE empirical formula. The COLE formula is a negative exponential function with respect to time. In this paper, a new analytical solution algorithm is proposed, which does not require the use of step-by-step time integration. In Comparison with the step-by-step time integration, the proposed algorithm requires relatively less calculation and avoids high-frequency oscillation. Furthermore, the vertical upstream surface and the <b>sloping</b> <b>upstream</b> surface in two types of the dams are analyzed in this paper. The research results indicate that the analytical solution can be applied for a dam with a vertical upstream surface. However, because the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of a dam is inclined, the analytical solution can be obtained only for dams that are at lower height. Whenever the height of a dam is higher, then no analytical solution can be obtained, and only the use of step-by-step time integration can obtain a solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} effect of a strong {{underwater}} shock wave on a concrete dam, in this research the hammers impact were applied to simulate the underwater shock in a model test. The model scale Lλ was 200 according to the gravity-elasticity similitude law. Five acceleration sensors were imbedded along the downstream surface of the dam. The maximum input pressure was evaluated based on the recorded accelerations. The explosive charge and the distance between the explosion center and the dam were determined corresponding to the maximum impact pressure. After the hammers impacted, the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam was fractured and downstream was scabbed; some cracks extended from the <b>upstream</b> <b>face</b> to the downstream face; the head of dam was projected; and the dam appeared entirely displacement. Although the damage similarity of the model and prototype is not verified, this method may be used to verify the quality of a protection project and offered evidence to define a protection project...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of earth dam {{was carried out}} in a drainage and seepage tank to analyze the seepage resulting from water level fluctuation in the upstream of the dam. The dam models were made of the mixture of Mt. Merapi sand deposit with the soil of sandy-silt from Wonosari area. The variations of sand content in the mixture were 100 %; 90 % and 80 % and the <b>upstream</b> <b>slope</b> inclinations were 1 : 1; 1 : 1. 5 and 1 : 2. The result showed that the dams with more sandy-silt in the mixture have smaller seepage and the dams with steeper <b>upstream</b> <b>slope</b> have greater seepage. During rapid rising of water level, the dams with steeper <b>upstream</b> <b>slope</b> have a high rising rate of upstream water level and higher height of downstream slope failure. Moreover, during rapid drawdown, the dams with gentler <b>upstream</b> <b>slope</b> have a smaller rate of upstream drawdown and lower height of <b>upstream</b> <b>slope</b> failure. The dams with more sandy-silt in the mixture have a higher value of rising rate and drawdown of upstream water level but lower height of downstream and <b>upstream</b> <b>slope</b> failure. In the dam management, continuous monitoring of the seepage resulting from reservoir water level fluctuation is required to avoid dam failure.
