40|$|Abstract. Tool damages {{including}} {{plastic deformation}} and wear {{are affected by}} forging load, thermal load and frictional slide applied to tool surface. Plastic deformation of forging tools proceeds in the tool corer owing to elevated temperature, high contact pressure and severe frictional slide. Hard layers on the tool surface increase plastic deformation resistance and thermal resistance. The optimal design of hard layer structure reduces the tool damage and improves tool life. Temperature and equivalent strain of forging tools are influenced by friction <b>shear</b> <b>factor,</b> contact thermal conductance and contact time between the tool and the workpiece. At the friction <b>shear</b> <b>factor</b> of less than 0. 4, equivalent strain of the tool is reduced. At the friction <b>shear</b> <b>factor</b> of approximately 0. 4 or greater, equivalent strain increases sharply and concentrates {{in the vicinity of}} the surface hard layer.

40|$|Abstract. In {{a packed}} bed {{catalytic}} reactor, the fluid flow phenomena are very complicated because the fluid and solid particle interactions dissipate the energy.

The <b>shear</b> <b>factor</b> model {{was introduced in the}} momentum equation for covering the effect of flow and solid interactions in porous media. A two dimensional numerical solution for this kind of flow has been constructed using the finite volume method. The porous media porosity was treated as non-uniform distribution in the radial direction. Experimentally, the axial velocity profiles produce the trend of having global maximum and minimum peaks at distance very close to the wall. This trend is also accurately picked up by the numerical result. A more comprehensive <b>shear</b> <b>factor</b> formulation results a better velocity prediction than other correlations do. Our derivation on the presence of porous media leads to an additional viscosity term. The effect of this additional viscosity term was investigated numerically. It is found that the additional viscosity term improves the velocity prediction for the case of higher ratio between tube and particle diameters...|$|E

Therefore, the present analysis also supports the conclusion in [8] {{that the concept of}} a constant interfacial friction factor can be used to characterize interfacial friction conditions during a fiat ring forging operation, only if proper precautions are taken in its application and the subsequent interpretation of results. The percentage change of diameter at the inner equator in upsetting rings of standard geometry 6 : 3 : 2 {{as a function of the}} percentage deformation for different values of the <b>shear</b> <b>factor</b> is plotted in Fig. 10. Since the ring compression test is considered the best currently available technique for the evaluation of Motional phenomena under metalworking conditions [3, 8], it is hoped that the im-provement made by considering the bulging effect may be of practical value in engineering applications. Conclusion The foregoing analysis presents an approximate procedure to predict the stress and strain histories at the outer equatorial surface in the compression of a flat ring. This information is necessary in setting up any successful criterion of ductile frac-ture. The change of the ring inner diameter in the process of axial compression is believed to reflect the interfacial friction conditions between the tool and workpiece contacts. Numerical results for the strain histories at the ring outer equa-tor based on the present analysis show reasonably close agree-ment with corresponding experimental data in the literature. By taking into consideration the bulging of the free surfaces during compression, the present analysis also improves over existing analytical methods in predicting the <b>shear</b> <b>factor</b> values in ring compression tests.

While rational bases for them have been offered, there continues to be some reluctance to their full acceptance because the explanations are not totally convincing and their efficacies have not been comprehensively evaluated over a range of application. Herein, three-dimensional static and dynamic information and results for a beam of general (both symmetric and non-symmetric) cross-section are brought to bear on these issues. Only homogeneous, isotropic beams are considered. Semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) computer codes provide static and dynamic response data for our purposes. Greater clarification of issues relating to the bases for <b>shear</b> correction <b>factors</b> can be seen. Also, comparisons of numerical results with Timoshenko beam data will show the effectiveness of these factors beyond the range of application of elementary (Bernoulli–Euler) theory. An issue concerning principal shear axes arose in the definition of <b>shear</b> correction <b>factors</b> for non-symmetric cross-sections. In this method, expressions for the shear energies of two transverse forces applied on the cross-section by beam and three-dimensional elasticity theories are equated to determine the <b>shear</b> correction <b>factors.</b> This led to the necessity for principal shear axes. We will argue against this concept and show that when two forces are applied simultaneously to a cross-section, it leads to an inconsistency.
