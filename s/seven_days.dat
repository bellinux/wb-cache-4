5|$|On June 25, 1862, McClellan {{ordered an}} {{ineffective}} offensive triggering the <b>Seven</b> <b>Days</b> Battles. On June 26, General Robert E. Lee, {{who had recently}} taken command of the Army of Northern Virginia, launched a daring counter-offensive intended to drive McClellan's army away from Richmond. For the 22nd, {{the third day of}} the <b>Seven</b> <b>Days</b> Battles, the Battle of Gaines' Mill, proved to be devastating as they suffered their worst casualties of the war.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Seven</b> <b>Days</b> Battles {{were the}} climax of the Peninsula Campaign, during which McClellan's Army of the Potomac sailed around the Confederate lines, landed {{at the tip of the}} Virginia Peninsula, {{southeast}} of Richmond, and struck inland towards the Confederate capital. Confederate commander-in-chief Joseph E. Johnston fended off McClellan's repeated attempts to take the city, slowing Union progress on the peninsula to a crawl. When Johnston was wounded, Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks, collectively called the <b>Seven</b> <b>Days</b> Battles. These attacks culminated in the action on Malvern Hill.|$|E

5|$|The human toll of the Battle of Malvern Hill and the <b>Seven</b> <b>Days</b> Battles {{was shown}} clearly as both capitals, Washington and Richmond, set up {{numerous}} provisional hospitals {{to care for}} the dead, wounded and missing. Ships sailed from the Peninsula to Washington carrying the wounded. Richmond was nearest to the battlefields of the <b>Seven</b> <b>Days,</b> and the immense number of casualties overwhelmed hospitals and doctors. People from about the Confederacy descended upon Richmond {{to care for the}} conflict's casualties. Graves could not be dug quickly enough.|$|E
5|$|After seizing Ticonderoga, a small {{detachment}} {{captured the}} nearby Fort Crown Point on May 11. <b>Seven</b> <b>days</b> later, Arnold and 50 men boldly raided Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River in southern Quebec, seizing military supplies, cannons, {{and the largest}} military vessel on Lake Champlain.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 1,070,400km, third among the Galilean satellites, and completes a revolution every <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> and three hours. Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> and three hours. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009–0.0022 and 0.05–0.32°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33°.|$|E

Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed.

Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.|$|E

40|$|A {{new species}} of {{spirochete}} which we have called Spirochæta hebdomadis {{has been described as}} the specific etiological agent of <b>seven</b> <b>day</b> fever, a disease prevailing in the autumn in Fukuoka and other parts of Japan. This spirochete is distinguishable from Spirochæta icterohæmorrhagiæ to which it presents certain similarities. Young guinea pigs are susceptible to inoculation with the blood of patients and to pure cultures of the spirochete, and those developing infection exhibit definite symptoms suggestive of those of <b>seven</b> <b>day</b> fever in man. The blood serum of convalescents from <b>seven</b> <b>day</b> fever contains specific immune bodies acting spirochetolytically and spirocheticidally against the specific spirochetes, but not against Spirochæta icterohæmorrhagiæ. The field mouse (Microtus montebelli) is the normal host of the spirochetes, which have been detected in the kidneys and urine of 3. 3 per cent of the animals examined. The endemic area of prevalence of <b>seven</b> <b>day</b> fever corresponds with the region in which field mice abound...|$|R

5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for <b>seven</b> <b>days,</b> at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for <b>seven</b> <b>days.</b> On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
