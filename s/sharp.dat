5|$|Cooke {{resolved}} to kill <b>Sharp</b> herself. The next time <b>Sharp</b> was in Bowling Green on business, she {{sent a letter}} to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken off all contact with him. She asked <b>Sharp</b> to visit her at her plantation before he left town. <b>Sharp</b> questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but <b>Sharp</b> never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that <b>Sharp</b> had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that <b>Sharp</b> would eventually have to return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for <b>Sharp</b> to return. He never did.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused <b>Sharp</b> of fathering Cooke's child, but said that <b>Sharp</b> had denied paternity of the child {{on the grounds that it}} was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether <b>Sharp</b> made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, <b>Sharp</b> won the election.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy (sometimes {{called the}} Kentucky Tragedy) was {{the murder of}} Kentucky {{legislator}} Solomon P. <b>Sharp</b> by Jereboam O. Beauchamp (bee-chum). As a young lawyer, Beauchamp had been an admirer of <b>Sharp</b> until <b>Sharp</b> allegedly fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. <b>Sharp</b> denied paternity of the stillborn child. Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him {{on the condition that}} he kill <b>Sharp</b> to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered <b>Sharp</b> at Sharp's home in Frankfort.|$|E

The <b>Sharps</b> and Hankins partnership ended in 1866, and <b>Sharps</b> resumed the manufacturing of firearms under the C. <b>Sharps</b> and Company name.

5|$|The {{following}} year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander <b>Sharp,</b> wrote Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. <b>Sharp</b> {{to defend}} him from the charges contained in Beauchamp's confession. In Vindication, Dr. <b>Sharp</b> portrayed the killing as a political assassination: he named Patrick Darby, a partisan of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart. Darby threatened to sue <b>Sharp</b> if he published his Vindication; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, <b>Sharp</b> did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} honor killing {{in that day}} was a duel. Despite Cooke's admonition that <b>Sharp</b> would not accept a challenge to duel, Beauchamp traveled to Frankfort to gain an audience with him. He had recently been named the state's attorney general by Governor John Adair. Beauchamp's account of the interview states that he bullied and humiliated <b>Sharp,</b> that <b>Sharp</b> begged for his life, and that Beauchamp promised to horsewhip <b>Sharp</b> every day until he consented to the duel. For two days, Beauchamp remained in Frankfort, awaiting the duel. He discovered that <b>Sharp</b> had left town, allegedly destined for Bowling Green. Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green, {{only to find that}} <b>Sharp</b> was not there and was not expected. <b>Sharp</b> was saved from Beauchamp's first attempt on his life.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp was {{admitted}} to the bar in April 1823. He and Anna Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure <b>Sharp</b> to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to <b>Sharp</b> under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help in some sort of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When <b>Sharp</b> failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E

5|$|Following Beauchamp's failed attempt, Cooke {{decided to}} lure <b>Sharp</b> {{to her house}} and kill him herself.

Hoping to kill <b>Sharp</b> before the meeting, Beauchamp traveled to Bowling Green, but found his target had already left for Frankfort. He had eluded the trap.

5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that <b>Sharp</b> had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. <b>Sharp</b> denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation {{that the child was}} a mulatto. Whether <b>Sharp</b> made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing <b>Sharp</b> at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|In 1825, <b>Sharp</b> {{resigned}} {{to run for}} {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. During the heated campaign, opponents raised the issue of his alleged seduction of Anna Cooke. Old Court partisan John U.

5|$|In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an {{unmarried}} planter's daughter {{in her early}} 30s, claimed that <b>Sharp</b> {{was the father of}} her illegitimate child; <b>Sharp</b> denied her claim. The stillborn child was rumored to have dark skin, and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met <b>Sharp.</b> In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.|$|E

Similarly, the mail-back <b>sharps</b> disposal method allows generators to ship <b>sharps</b> waste to the disposal facility directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers.

There were to be no winners or losers, and anyone who participated could run, walk or ride. <b>Sharp</b> faced opposition to the project. The Cancer Society feared that a fall run would detract from its traditional April campaigns, while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less money for their causes. <b>Sharp</b> persisted, and he, the Four Seasons Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run on September 13, 1981.|$|E
5|$|Several {{witnesses}} {{testified against}} him. The widow Eliza <b>Sharp</b> {{testified that the}} voice of the killer was distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. <b>Sharp</b> to hear Beauchamp's voice; she immediately identified it as that of the killer. (Beauchamp claimed he had disguised his voice {{on the night of the}} murder and thought Mrs. <b>Sharp</b> would not recognize it). Patrick Henry Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now knew as Beauchamp. Darby said the man – a stranger to him at the time – had asked for Darby's help in prosecuting an unspecified claim against <b>Sharp.</b> The man then identified himself as the husband of Anna Cooke and said he intended to kill <b>Sharp.</b> Based on the circumstantial evidence, Beauchamp was held for trial at the next term of the circuit court in March 1826.|$|E
