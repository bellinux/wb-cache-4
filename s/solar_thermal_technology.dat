40|$|The use {{of solar}} energy {{in recent years}} has reached a {{remarkable}} edge. The continuous research for an alternative power source due to the perceived scarcity of fuel fossils is its driving force. It has become even more popular as the cost of fossil fuel continues to rise. The earth receives in just 1 Â h, more energy from the sun than what we consume in the whole world for 1 year. Its application was proven to be most economical, as most systems in individual uses requires but a few kilowatt of power.

40|$|To {{build an}} {{electric}} car plus renewable energy system for Singapore, <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>technologies</b> were investigated {{in this report}} in the hope to find a suitable "green" energy source for this small island country. Among all existing <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>technologies,</b> parabolic trough power plants represent a well established technology with {{more than twenty years}} of operation experiences. This report reviewed recent progress of research in this field. It was found that significant progresses have been made in solar collector, heat transfer fluid and thermal storage. An economic assessment of the parabolic trough power plant technology was also carried out. By comparing a parabolic trough power plant and a concentrating photovoltaic solar farm, both advantages and limitations of these plants were indentified. Based on these findings, the niche market for parabolic trough power plants was analyzed. It was found that in the next few years, the deployment of parabolic trough plants would mainly occur in south-western U. S. and Mediterranean countries. However, it was found that concentrating <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>technologies</b> were not suitable for Singapore, due to this country's limited land and high fraction of diffuse solar radiation. Therefore, PV technology was selected as a "clean" energy source. Based on PV electricity, a few electric vehicle (XEV) models were developed and evaluated. by Xiaogang Liu. Thesis (M. Eng.)
