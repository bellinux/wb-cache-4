40|$|AbstractRoller skis {{are used}} by {{cross-country}} skiers, biathletes and ski-orienteers for their snow-free training and in roller ski competitions. Additionally, much of the current sports research into the physiology and biomechanics of cross- country skiing is conducted indoors on treadmills using roller skis. For elite athletes, the differences in performance are quite small, thus emphasising the importance of knowing the roller skis’ rolling resistance coefficient, especially in connection to research and roller ski competitions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a roller ski rolling resistance measurement system (P-RRMS) that is portable and therefore useful in different contexts and locations. The P-RRMS was designed as a small treadmill, equipped with roller ski stabilizing lateral supports and a <b>screwed</b> <b>bar</b> for applying different vertical loads on the roller ski.

Background: Enterococcus faecium is an emerging pathogen responsible for post procedural infections {{in patients who}} have undergone spinal decompression surgery. In this case report, the authors discuss and review recent literature on approaches to post-operative spinal infection. Case report: We herein report {{the case of a}} 55 -year-old HIV-negative Caucasian Italian woman who showed vertebral osteomyelitis with abscesses around the interbody cage caused by an Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistant gen-Van A, following a Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF). The same strain was detected in disc biopsy, urine culture and rectal swab. After the implant (<b>screws,</b> <b>bars</b> and cage) was removed and a suitable medical therapy administered, the infection resolved completely. The strain was identified and its susceptibility profile was characterized; biofilm-associated genes and biofilm-induced antimicrobial resistance is highlighted. Conclusions: In any case, the management of infections complicating spinal surgery is controversial, and various mono or combined surgical and/or anti-infective timing approaches to remove infected implants have been proposed. The authors suggest a multidisciplinary approach taking into account virulence, microbiological features of causative pathogens and patient's risk factors. More efforts should be directed towards the early identification of pathogens in surgical specimens...|$|R

This study evaluates {{the results of a}} consecutive cohort of 20 patients (mean age 56 years) with extremely resorbed maxillas provided with four zygomatic implants. The first 10 patients had a two-stage procedure, the next 10 next patients benefited from a one-stage surgical procedure and one of them had flapless guided surgery with Nobelguide® in development and immediate function. The same surgical drilling protocol, according to Branemark's procedure, was applied to all the patients. Except for one patient who lost three implants, 18 patients received a fixed Procera® implant bridge and another an overdenture retained by a <b>screwed</b> <b>bar</b> fixed on the four zygomatic implants. The cumulative survival rate after 40 months is 96 %. Although bone augmenting procedures such as onlay grafts and sinus grafts are popular and well-documented, the four zygomatic implants procedure results in less morbidity, shorter delays between anatomical reconstruction and functional rehabilitation and can provide immediate or early loading with immediate function. Four zygomatic implants and a fixed bridge seem to be a valuable technique for the rehabilitation of extremely resorbed maxillas. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

The main advantage is its non-invasive and non-destructive character. Currently, CT is the only measurement technique that allows full 3 D visualization of both inner and outer features of an object through a contactless probing system. Using hundreds of radiographs, acquired while rotating the object, a 3 D representation is generated and dimensions can be verified.

40|$|In general, the {{rational}} application of construction materials requires the development or improvement of building techniques. Thus, {{the use of}} concrete and timber, traditional materials largely accepted in rural buildings, making composite structures, constitutes a possible solution for presenting adequate structural and economical performances and durability too. In particular, {{the effectiveness of this}} structural system must be assured by a connection at the interface of the materials, and it can be of discrete (metallic elements: <b>screws,</b> steel <b>bars,</b> nails etc) or continuous types (epoxy adhesive). Several kinds of civil construction applications can be contemplated by this structural system, as in restorations or construction of new bridges. In fact, along the vicinal roads, there is a large number of timber bridges that need restorations and {{there is a need to}} construct new bridges as well. General speaking, bridges are exposed to severe weather and loading conditions, and, thus, they must be carefully studied, so that the connection mechanisms can be more precisely evaluated, as well as the composite structure behavior during its entire life. In this context, by analyzing the several aspects that involve the performance of the timber-concrete composite structures and, also the mechanical behavior of the connections in these structures, we conclude, in this article, that this construction technique is feasible for bridges in vicinal roads. Further, additional research on the long-term loading effects, temperature and moisture variations, is necessary to improve the simulation models...|$|R

40|$|Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or the {{automatic}} recognition of characters {{is being done}} for quite some years now. In general, very good results have been achieved here.

Because of this, the characters become occluded, which means part of their top is cut off. In most cases this results in not recognizing the characters. By building a modular neural network, which includes networks that are especially trained with occluded characters, we can increase the recognition rate drastically. It proves that by using a classifier after the first ttempt to recognize these characters with the traditional network, we can improve our results on recognizing occluded characters without a loss in normal recognition. ...|$|R
30|$|We {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} reducing the costs of all-wood timber check dams, which had the highest costs among the five types of check dam addressed in this study. When considering measures for keeping down the costs of all-wood timber check dams, {{reducing the amount of}} timber used is undesirable from the perspective of timber use, and it would be preferable to investigate cost-cutting in areas other than timber. We therefore calculated the direct construction costs for three different cases: (a) using steel bars for all connectors, (b) not taking into account front apron construction, and (c) not taking into account front apron construction and also using only steel bars for all connectors. The assumption that steel bars could be used for all connectors was based on initiatives currently underway to replace lag <b>screws</b> with steel <b>bars,</b> as their material procurement costs are less than 10  % of those of lag screws [2, 3, 4]. We also considered not taking into account front apron construction, because although this is mandatory for the design of all-wood timber check dams in Akita Prefecture, it is not required for other types of check dams.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the efficacy of hybrid constructs in comparison to bone grafts (autograft and allograft) for posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) in sheep, instrumented with transpedicular <b>screws</b> and <b>bars.</b> Hybrid constructs using cultured bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results in several bone healing models. In particular, hybrid constructs made by calcium phosphate-enriched cells have had similar fusion rates to bone autografts in posterolateral lumbar fusion in sheep. In our study, four experimental spinal fusions in two animal groups were compared in sheep: autograft and allograft (reference group), hydroxyapatite scaffold, and hydroxyapatite scaffold seeded with cultured and osteoinduced bone marrow MSCs (hybrid construct). During the last three days of culture, dexamethasone (dex) and beta-glycerophosphate (β-GP) were added to potentiate osteoinduction. The two experimental situations of each group were tested in the same spinal segment (L 4 –L 5). Spinal fusion and bone formation were studied by clinical observation, X-ray, computed tomography (CT), histology, and histomorphometry. Lumbar fusion rates assessed by CT scan and histology were higher for autograft and allograft (70 %) than for mineral scaffold alone (22 %) and hybrid constructs (35 %). The quantity of new bone formation was also higher for the reference group, quite similar in both (autograft and allograft). Although the hybrid scaffold group had a better fusion rate than the non-hybrid scaffold group, the histological analysis revealed no significant differences between them in terms of quantity of bone formation. The histology results suggested that mineral scaffolds were partly resorbed in an early phase, and included in callus tissues. Far from the callus area the hydroxyapatite alone did not generate bone around it, but the hybrid scaffold did. In nude mice, labeled cells were induced to differentiate in vivo and monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Although the cultured MSCs had osteogenic potential, their contribution to spinal fusion when seeded in mineral scaffolds, in the conditions disclosed here, remains uncertain probably due to callus interference with the scaffolds. At present, bone autografts are better than hybrid constructs for posterolateral lumbar fusion, but we should continue to seek better conditions for efficient tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the planning and}} guidance systems of a novel cooperative robot designed for spinal surgery. The latter has been developed for transpedicular fixation, a particular intervention consisting in the immobilisation {{of two or more}} vertebrae by means of <b>screws</b> and metal <b>bars.</b> Its conventional clinical protocols have high levels of invasiveness, increased radiation exposure, difficult visualisation of the surgical field and considerable probabilities of screw misplacement. All these problems could be solved by means of a surgical robotic assistant, which would work cooperatively with the surgeon providing stable and accurate instrument placement. A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in surgical robotics for spinal interventions is given in this thesis, focusing on the research done in the last ten years. This study shows that spinal surgical robotics is still in an early stage of development and faces considerable challenges, in particular reaching the theoretical accuracy level demanded by clinical studies. A novel surgical planning application is also presented in this thesis along with a new software library for 2 D- 3 D registration. The latter is a key problem of the proposed robotic system, as it permits accurate localisation of the patient by matching his pre-operative (3 D) data and intra-operative (2 D) x-ray images. Despite that 2 D- 3 D registration has been studied for many years, researchers were faced with a lack of appropriate software, which was effectively solved with the library presented in this work. 2 D- 3 D registration involves the additional sub-problems of calibration and distortion correction of x-ray imaging devices. These were addressed in this thesis proposing a novel algorithm able to solve both, also providing precise reconstruction of 3 D points from their 2 D projections. The proposed method is simultaneously accurate, robust and fast, fitting well into the requirements of surgical applications. Finally, integration of the robotic system's components was studied in this thesis, reporting the first experimental results on phantoms. Despite that full integration with the presented 2 D- 3 D registration methods has not been carried out, the robotic system was found to be accurate enough for surgical practice. Full integration and tests with cadavers or animals should be the subject of future works...|$|R
