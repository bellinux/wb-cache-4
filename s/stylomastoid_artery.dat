40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} {{of the facial nerve}} can be difficult in a bloody operative field or by an incision that limits exposure; hence anatomical landmarks and adequate operative exposure can aid such identification and preservation. In this clinico-anatomic study, we examined the <b>stylomastoid</b> <b>artery</b> (SMA) and its relation to the facial nerve trunk; the origin of the artery was identified on cadavers and its nature was confirmed histologically. Methods The clinical component of the study included prospective reviewing of 100 consecutive routine parotidectomies; while, the anatomical component of the study involved dissecting 50 cadaveric hemifaces. Results We could consistently identify a supplying vessel, <b>stylomastoid</b> <b>artery,</b> which tends to vary less in position than the facial nerve. Following this vessel, a few millimetres inferiorly and medially, we have gone on to identify the facial nerve trunk, which it supplies, with relative ease. The origin of the <b>stylomastoid</b> <b>artery,</b> in our study, was either from the occipital artery or the posterior auricular artery. Conclusion This anatomical aid, the <b>stylomastoid</b> <b>artery,</b> when supplemented by the other more commonly known anatomical landmarks and intra-operative facial nerve monitoring further reduces the risk of iatrogenic facial nerve damage and operative time. </p...|$|E
