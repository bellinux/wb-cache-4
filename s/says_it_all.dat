In The Futon Critic's ranking of the fifty best episodes of 2002, it was placed 32nd, with Brian Ford Sullivan stating, [...] "The {{title of the}} episode <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for us." [...] New York Daily Newss David Bianculli declared [...] "It seems that {{lots of people are}} getting on board with Monk, which is as it should be", referring to the guest stars of the episode. The guests were said {{to be one of the}} [...] "many subtle and silly pleasures" [...] of the episode by Kevin McDonough, a critic for the United Feature Syndicate, while a TelevisionWeek reviewer praised Marshall performance as a [...] " [...] guest shot". Austin Smith of the New York Post deemed it [...] "a true classic" [...] and said it put [...] "Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan" [...] "to shame". Chris Hicks from Deseret News qualified it as [...] "perfection," [...] and Bianculli stressed [...] "the writing team for Monk made the most" [...] of it. On the other hand, Joy Press of The Village Voice called it [...] "a Seinfeld-like device" [...] in which Monk's fear of flying was explored [...] "to the point of exhaustion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although it bore an {{unlikely}} title (picked {{up from a}} radio talk show), the jaunty single [...] "Life Is a Minestrone" [...] (1975) was another UK Top 10 placing, peaking at No.7. Their biggest success came with the dreamy [...] "I'm Not in Love", which gave the band their second UK No.1 in June 1975. The song also provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No.2. A collaborative effort built around a title by Stewart, [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] is notable for its innovative production, especially its richly overdubbed choral backing. Godley stated:If I was to pick one track from everything we've done, [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] would be my favourite. It's got something that none of our other tracks have at all.

Ah, she's a foolish woman, that wife of mine! But she means well--a good soul at bottom. She would have traveled all the way here along with me if I would have let her. I said, 'No; you stop at home, and look after the house and the parish, and I'll bring the child back.'

[...] "None," [...] responded Maruja, didactically, [...] "but the simplest, which I shall buy myself. Truly, it is time to set one's self against this extravagance.
