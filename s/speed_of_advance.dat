50|$|A {{waterjet}} thruster is {{a special}} type of bow thruster that utilizes a pumping device instead of a conventional propeller. The water is discharged through specially designed nozzles which increase the velocity of the exiting jet. Waterjets generally {{have the advantage of}} smaller hull penetrations for an equivalent size thruster. Additionally, the higher exit velocity of the discharged water increases the relative efficiency as <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance,</b> or currents, increase, as compared to standard tunnel thrusters. Some waterjet bow thrusters can be configured to provide forward and aft auxiliary propulsion, or even full 360 degree thrust.|$|R

50|$|In the {{firearms}} age, {{the basic}} parameters are <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> against rate (or effectiveness) of fire. If the attackers advance {{at a more}} rapid rate than the defenders can kill or disable them then the attackers will reach the defenders (though not necessarily without being greatly weakened in numbers). There are many modifiers to this simple comparison - timing, covering fire, organization, formation and terrain, among others. A failed charge may leave the would-be attackers vulnerable to a counter-charge.|$|E

During the reign of the Safavid dynasty gunpowder weapons were used to a relatively limited extent and were certainly not to be considered central to the Safavid military machine.

25|$|Because <b>of</b> {{the high}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> Konev's forces, the Ninth Army was now {{threatened}} with envelopment {{by the two}} Soviet pincers that were heading for Berlin {{from the south and}} east.

50|$|Progress {{was slow}} as {{demolished}} bridges, roadblocks and mines delayed the Eighth Army. The {{nature of the}} countryside in the toe of Italy {{made it impossible to}} by-pass obstacles and so the Allies' <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> was entirely dependent on the rate at which their engineers could clear obstructions. Thus, Montgomery's objections to the operation were proved correct: the Eighth Army could not tie down German units that refused battle and the main obstacle to their advance was the terrain and German demolitions of roads and bridges.|$|E

50|$|Dominated by the {{philosophy}} that the fastest and most economical way to an opponent is a straight line, arts that use linear movement as their focus adopt mostly rigid stances and behaviors, and focus primarily on the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> and retreat to overcome an adversary.

Numerical simulations have been carried out by means of the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations solver &# 967;navis, developed at CNR-INSEAN.

50|$|After {{the initial}} success of D-Day and the {{breakout}} from the Normandy beachhead which followed, the advance began to slow {{due to the}} constant difficulties of keeping the vast armies supplied. The problem was not getting supplies to the continent, but getting them to forward troops, which might be 500 mi from supply depots. Each division required 600-700 tons of supplies per day while artillery and mortars used 8 million rounds per month. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> often meant {{there was no time}} to build up an orderly logistical structure and, despite the use of a truck system called the Red Ball Express, for 5 days at the end of August virtually the entire American and British advance came to a complete halt due to a lack of fuel.|$|E
50|$|In the east, {{only one}} Field Army defended East Prussia and when Russia {{attacked}} {{in this region}} it diverted German forces intended for the Western Front.

The Central Powers were thereby denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of obtaining an early victory.|$|E

50|$|A lay-off can be exacted {{by placing}} a soft pass to an area {{in front of a}} team mate such that he can run towards it and collect it or shoot first time. Care must be taken to weight the pass such that it stops before running out of play or is not over hit to an opponent. A lay-off can be {{combined}} with a one-touch shot to surprise a goalkeeper. Lay-offs are seldom used in Tehkan World Cup; the running <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> CPU opponents renders them impractical in a race to the ball. In Two-Player games, lay-offs can be used to exact a shot that reaches the net before the CPU releases control of the goalkeeper to the defending human player. In some cases this is impossible to defend and may therefore be considered unsporting.|$|R
50|$|The Blues {{were located}} on the Sambre-Oise Canal and, on 4 November the last major British {{offensive}} took place. It was foggy weather enabling the men to get across the canal unseen along high hedged lanes. With no Germans to hold them back, all the reserves being committed, the attack advanced without further resistance. On 5 November, Haig offered Julian Byng and Henry Rawlinson Cavalry Corps {{to be used in}} an advance in the direction of Maubeuge, but they both refused. The French however, the following day were much more positive about using Cavalry to force the River Scheldt. On 9 November, William Birdwood's Fifth Army cavalry received orders to cross the Scheldt, as the enemy was in full retreat. As the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> accelerated more cavalry was required to join battle. On 11 November at 11 am Haig had a meeting with all commanders at Cambrai, including General Kavanagh, when the Armistice already signed at 5 am, actually came into force. One Blues officer spoke of their emotional sentiments when finally the Armistice was called - and the silence.|$|E

5000|$|Yamato {{opened fire}} at 0659 at an {{estimated}} range of 34,544 yards, targeting White Plains with her first four salvos. Yamatos third salvo was a close straddle landing at 0704. One shell from this salvo exploded beneath the turn of White Plains port bilge near frame 142, near her aft (starboard) engine room. While the ship was not struck directly the mining effect of the under-keel explosion severely damaged her hull, deranged her starboard machinery and tripped all of the circuit breakers in her electrical network. Prompt and effective damage control restored power and communications within three minutes {{and she was able}} to remain in formation by overspeeding her port engine to compensate. Fortunately the black smoke resulting from the sudden loss of boiler intake air pressure convinced Yamato (and Nagato, which was also firing her main battery at White Plains at the time) that they had scored a direct hit and they shifted fire to other targets. [...] For the next two and one-half hours, the Japanese force chased [...] "Taffy 3" [...] southward and subjected the escort carriers and their counterattacking screen to a heavy-caliber cannonade.
