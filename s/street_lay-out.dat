50|$|The City of Londonderry was {{the jewel}} in {{the crown of}} the Ulster Plantation. It was laid out {{according}} to the best contemporary principles of town planning, imported from the continent (the original <b>street</b> <b>lay-out</b> has survived to the present almost intact). More importantly, the city was enclosed by massive stone and earthen fortifications. It was the last walled city built in Ireland and the only city on the island whose ancient walls survive complete. Among the city's new buildings was St. Columb's Cathedral (1633). This {{is one of the}} most important 17th century buildings in the country and was the first specifically Protestant cathedral erected anywhere in the world following the Reformation.|$|E
40|$|Placemaking in Pretoria is {{considered}} under universal, cultural and contextual aspects. The cross of Church and Paul Kruger Streets with the Central Church {{surrounded by the}} 'mandala' are universal aspects which are repeated on Church Square. The enclosure inside the rivers and mountain ranges, filled in by the gridiron <b>street</b> <b>lay-out,</b> was also the cultural preference at Graaff-Reinet, generally accepted to be the city model for Pretoria. Contextually the city form {{is a result of}} the interpretation of a classical landscape, its mountains, valleys, fountains, rivers and 'poorte'. However, recent official plans ride roughshod over these established placemaking aspects. The daydreams of a few city planners may turn out to be the nightmare of a whole city. ...|$|E

Starting with the destruction of gated alleyways during the French occupation, the thesis traces the gradual modernization of the city, looking initially at changes in <b>street</b> <b>lay-out,</b> domestic habitat, and the design of mosques, palaces, kiosks, pavilions, hotels, parks and gardens which bear some imprint of the new contacts and exchanges with Europe. It also looks at major engineering projects, such as the national railway system and the Suez Canal, which were undertaken with the help of new technological knowledge and advice from Europe. While many of these changes were clearly attributable to European imperial ambition, the thesis argues that the processes of modernization in Egypt were altogether more complex in their origin and effects, reflecting not only the competitive interests of the French and British powers, but those of the Ottoman rulers both in Constantinople and locally in Cairo. The thesis goes on to trace the emergence in Cairo prior to the British occupation of a new ‘national’ or ‘Neo-Mamluk’ architectural style, introduced by local and foreign architects who, though trained in Europe, were deeply attracted to local, and in particular Mamluk architectural tradition. This new style is encouraged and implemented by a later generation of Viceroys who were less dominated than their predecessors by any wish merely to emulate features of Ottoman or European design. The thesis proceeds through a series of case studies which focus on the work of particular figures who serve as exemplars of intercultural learning and exchange. They include the British engineer, Robert Stephenson; the French architect, Pascal-Xavier Coste; the Welsh architect, Owen Jones; the Egyptian architect, Hussein Fahmi; and Yusuf Hekekyan, a Catholic, Armenian, Ottoman subject from Constantinople who was sent to Britain by the Viceroy, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to learn European technological skills of potential importance to the development of Egypt as a modern industrial power. The factors that led to the modernization of Egypt were many and various: international rivalries, national aspirations, civilizing zeal, local attachments, cross-cultural sympathies all playing, at different moments, a vital role. The diverse architectural styles of nineteenth-century Cairo reflect a similar diversity of social and political pressure and purpose in Egypt throughout this long period. This thesis resists any simple explanatory model, seeking instead to illuminate through particular examples the complex interplay of these sometimes converging and sometimes conflicting forces...|$|E
40|$|Subject of my {{graduation}} theses was {{to define}} an isolated {{room of the}} Práce square, to create a central assembly room, which is isolated from the traffic of the adjacent Tomáš Baťa avenue, to complete dominant buildings of the Bata’s period, to stimulate and to make attractive it for the pedestrians and to design a traffic, street’s and new <b>street’s</b> <b>lay-out,</b> to draw a scientific and technical park and {{living in the city}} centre, parking places pro the new designed objects. The architectural - urban project is solving a new function of the square, which originally used as ascending area for then expanding Bata’s plants. After failure of the plants has the square lost his function. The designed solution removes the cars, respects viewed axes, and creates a new raster due to straighten of Březnicka Street, which is parallel to the “green axe”, which separates {{the old and the new}} part of Zlín, vertical to Tomáš Baťa avenue. It is bringing new restaurants, coffee-bars, shops, housings and jobs. Scientific and Technical Park concludes the square from the north site. It is designed at the place, where formally a hospital building were - in front of he building 21. It is continuing towards the street and joins the faculty of management and economies with the new university centre. The building height is similar as the surrounding buildings. It is parted in two parts; between them is the viewed axe through the district of SVIT. Block of flats concludes the square form the west. Orientation of the flats is also to the east – west. The flats can serve for the employees, too, for the neighbouring Scientific and Technical Park. Kce is from skeleton and is brick-faces KLINKER, which corresponds to the surrounding building-up area. It contains smaller flats to 100 m 2, category 2 +eating nook, and 1 +eating nook...|$|R
