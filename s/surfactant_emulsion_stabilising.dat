40|$|Water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double {{emulsion}} systems {{provide an}} innovative approach {{for the development}} of low-fat healthier foods. By replacing a proportion of the oil phase of a simple oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion with an internal water phase, the overall oil volume within the emulsion system can be decreased, with potentially negligible changes to its organoleptic properties. However, double emulsions are notoriously unstable for adequate periods of time, largely due to the existence of two oppositely curved water-oil (W/O) and oil-water (O/W) interfaces in close proximity. The present study investigates the use of Pickering stabilisation in order to enhance the stability of double emulsions. Pickering stabilisation mechanisms are reputed for superior, longer term stabilisation capacities when compared to conventional <b>surfactant</b> <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions,</b> but edible particles with Pickering functionality are scarce. The work in this thesis explores the impact of introducing Pickering stabilisation to a double emulsion structure, initially at only one of the two water/oil interfaces (either W/O or O/W) and ultimately across the entire interfacial areas. Initial work conducted centred on investigating the role of a range of edible particulates as potential Pickering stabilisers in simple emulsions (both W/O and O/W emulsion types). Based on the knowledge gained from these studies, a range of Pickering-Surfactant <b>stabilised</b> double <b>emulsions</b> (with particles or surfactant stabilising alternate interfaces), using a range of surfactants, and Pickering only <b>stabilised</b> double <b>emulsion</b> systems were prepared and analysed in terms of their microstructure, stability and encapsulation efficiencies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{utilization}} of physico-chemical interactions between natural polyphenols and biocompatible polymers to design novel materials and complex colloidal dispersions and emulsions. These usually unwanted interactions and the resulting insoluble complexes are important {{in the creation of}} structures that could potentially be used in the design of novel foodstuffs. The theme of this thesis is therefore the interactions of polyphenols with polymers and emulsion stability and properties. The results are as follows. Chapter 3 presents a study on the interaction of polymer-polyphenol and the fabrication of new colloidal particles using the self-association of polymer-polyphenol complexes. The phase diagram of the physical appearance of mixtures of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with catechins and tannic acid has been explored and we have characterized the different structures by using a combination of light microscopy, UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering techniques. The molar ratio between polymers and polyphenols has been found {{to play an important role}} in defining the structure of the complexes and their stability. By further optimizing the reaction conditions it is possible to obtain various structures resulting in colloids, microgels, and macroscopically gelled interfaces, which find applications in emulsion stabilization as explored in the following chapters. In Chapter 4 emulsification techniques and consideration on emulsion stability and formulation are investigated. Novel biodegradable <b>surfactant</b> free <b>emulsions</b> stabilized by non-covalently associated micro-gel particles made from PVP and TA have been successfully prepared. The strong interaction between PVP and TA, driven by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between phenolic and pyrrolidinone rings, leads to formation of microgels during the emulsification process. The molar ratio between TA and PVP was found to play an important role in determining the mechanism of emulsion stabilisation. At low molar ratio a shell of PVP-TA microgels is formed and over time wrinkles have been observed on these shells, while at high molar ratio [TA]/[PVP] we observe Pickering <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by microgel particles and the continuous phase is a dispersion of microgel particles. The structure and stability of the systems have been investigated by light scattering, confocal and light transmission microscopy. The presence of TA leads to halochromism of the emulsions at high pH and the absence of <b>surfactants</b> makes these <b>emulsions</b> particularly desirable in terms of biodegradability. Chapter 5 focuses on the rheological properties of <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by gel particles and on the relationship between oil volume fraction and rheological behaviour. The rheological properties of emulsions and complex fluids are of pivotal importance in relation to their technical applications. These properties depend strongly on the emulsions composition, oil-phase volume fraction, microscopic droplet structure, and interfacial interactions. Our rheological tests showed that PVP-TA particles <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions</b> behave like flocculated dispersions and polymeric gels confirming the qualitative observation on emulsion gelation observed in the experiments carried out in the previous chapter. Chapter 6 introduces a new technique, microfluidics. Microfluidics devices were designed and built with the purpose of making monodisperse emulsions stabilized by PVP-TA complexes. The emulsions produced with microfluidics devices were found to be monodisperse rather than the polydisperse ones resulting from bulk emulsification processes. The basic theory behind the effect of microfluidic scaling affects the hydrodynamics is outlined. Experimental details on the design process and on how to use photo-lithography and soft-lithography to build microfluidics devices are given. Finally we have demonstrated how our microfluidics devices can be successfully used to make monodisperse <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by PVP-TA and double emulsions (oil in water in oil emulsions). </p...|$|R
40|$|Oilseeds store {{energy as}} triacylglycerides {{during periods of}} {{dormancy}} in preparation for germination and {{the early stages of}} development. The triacylglyceride is stored in discrete organelles termed oil bodies. Oil bodies are formed during the synthesis of neutral lipids within the bilayer of cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER); as lipid is synthesised it forms droplets of oil that swell distending the ER membrane and at a critical diameter separate from the ER by vesiculation forming independent organelles. These organelles are structurally stabilised by a phospholipid monolayer originating from the ER and the addition of highly amphiphilic oleosin proteins. Oil bodies have been shown previously to be extremely stable organelles that can be easily extracted and purified from oilseeds; our aim was to develop an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of sunflower oil bodies ex-vivo prior to their subsequent use in commercial products. Several novel findings were elucidated through this work: oil body phytochemical composition, their physical and oxidative stability and their ability to store and deliver flavour compounds. It was hypothesised that tocopherol is tightly associated with sunflower oil bodies. This was tested by recovering oil bodies from sunflower seed and washing them to remove extraneous proteins and associated phenolic compounds. Tocopherol remained with washed oil bodies (392 mg tocopherol. kg- 1 oil body oil) and this population of tocopherol represented 38 % of the total seed tocopherol. It was hypothesised that this high tocopherol concentration and its intrinsic association to oil body structures would contribute to an increased level of oxidative stability. Sunflower seed lipids were significantly more resistant to thermally induced oxidation when stabilised in oil body suspensions compared to sunflower oil <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by a range of commercial emulsifiers (sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (tween 20) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide). Oxidative stability was assessed through lipid hydroperoxide concentration and the concentration of headspace hexanal. Maximum lipid hydroperoxide concentration in <b>surfactant</b> <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions</b> after 8 days at 45 oC ranged between 26 and 333 mmol lipid hydroperoxide. kg- 1 oil whereas lipid hydroperoxide concentrations in oil body suspensions did not exceed 12 mmol lipid hydroperoxide. kg- 1 oil. In addition there was no development in oxidative rancidity over the 8 day storage trial of oil bodies stored at 5 oC. The composition of phospholipids in a range of oil body preparations was assessed; purified oil bodies contained principally phosphatidylcholine (91 %) and a smaller fraction of phosphatidylethanolamine (9 %). Less purified preparations contained other phospholipid species; the presence of which was explained by contamination with either non-intrinsic cellular phospholipids or phospholipase D that catalysed the breakdown of phospholipids to phosphatidic acid. Mechanisms and the extent of oil body physical stability were assessed using charge analysis and resistance of oil body preparations to changes in temperature and pH. Oil bodies are stabilised by a combination of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion provided by the surface proteins and phospholipids. Oil bodies had a zeta potential of - 30 mV at neutral pH and the surface charge was pH dependant with an apparent isoelectric point of between pH 3 and pH 6 was calculated from electrophoretic mobility, streaming potential and creaming stability measurements. Purified oil bodies were physically stable to thermal stresses up to 45 oC for 2 days, although less purified preparations lost structural integrity at temperatures above 25 oC. When assessed for their ability to delivery flavour molecules, oil bodies had comparable bulk phase properties to artificial <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by tween 20. Oil bodies did show a greater rate of flavour delivery during headspace dilution, when compared with the model artificial emulsions, suggesting commercial benefits may be gained through the incorporation of oil bodies into commercial emulsions. The key findings of this work are that oil bodies are extremely stable organelles that are resistant to thermal stress and physical processing. When lipid is stored within oil bodies it has greater resistance to the onset of lipid oxidation which may be explained by the intrinsic association of phospholipids, proteins and phytochemicals (vitamin E) ...|$|R

The have been investigated for use in many diverse applications including chromatography, membranes, sorbtion, electrodes, bioengineering and filters amongst others. However this work investigates the use of their intricate internal pore structure for the mixing of fluids passing through polyHIPEs. When producing polyHIPEs (also polyMIPEs) by polymerisation of HIPE and MIPE templates {{it was found that the}} pore size could be controlled effectively by varying the energy used to agitate the emulsion template. The gas permeability of polyM/HIPEs increased linearly with increasing mean pore throat diameter for a given porosity. Through both residence time distribution experiments and examination of homogenous micromixing it was shown that the mixing in single-phase liquids increased when passed through a polyHIPE as the mean pore throat diameter decreases. There was no difference in mixing performance observed between polyHIPEs produced from Pickering emulsions compared to those produced from <b>surfactant</b> <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions.</b> By performing the liquid-liquid extraction of caffeine from aqueous solution with ethyl acetate within a polyHIPE flow cell it was shown that the overall mass transfer coefficient decreased with smaller mean pore throat diameters suggesting more effective mixing.

It was possible to produce interfacial areas, up to 17, 600 m 2 m- 3, between the two immiscible liquid phases within polyHIPEs, comparable to industrial extraction methods such as mixer settlers. Impregnating the polyHIPE flow cells with palladium allowed examining whether it is possible to use them as three phase catalytic reactor for nitroreduction.

40|$|The preparation, {{type and}} {{stability}} of <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> solely by solid silica particles has been investigated in detail {{using a combination of}} conductivity, stability, light diffraction, optical microscopy and contact angle measurements. The wettability of the particles in situ at the oil-water interface {{plays a major role in}} such systems. The stability of aqueous colloidal dispersions in the presence of various electrolytes and over a range of pH is shown to be important in determining the stability of toluene-in-water emulsions formed from them. Partial flocculation of the silica dispersions enhances the emulsion stability whereas strong flocculation results in unstable emulsions. Inversion of emulsion type occurs via two mechanisms. Catastrophic inversion of water-in-oil <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by hydrophobic silica particles occurs upon increasing the volume fraction of water in the system. Transitional inversion of emulsions at fixed volume fraction of water has been achieved by varying the mass fraction of hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) particles in systems containing particle mixtures. Neither inversion mechanism exhibits hysteresis, in contrast to surfactant-stabilised systems. The energy of attachment of a particle to the oil-water interface is shown to be dependent on the contact angle and the interfacial tension. The contact angle was varied by changing the hydrophobicity of the silica particles. Particles of intermediate hydrophobicity were most effective at <b>stabilising</b> <b>emulsions</b> which is thought to be due to the contact angle at the oil-water interface being close to 90 °. The interfacial tension was affected by changing the nature of the oil phase or by'replacing water with various polar liquids. Undecanol-water <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by silica particles of intermediate hydrophobicity break down via gel formation followed by coalescence. The wettability of the silica surface was varied in situ by varying the pH of the aqueous phase. Increasing the pH causes dissociation of silanol groups, which increases the affinity of the particles for the aqueous phase. The type {{and stability of}} emulsions and the contact angle of an aqueous drop under toluene on hydrophobically modified glass slides were measured as a function of pH. The results are modelled using simple theory. The wettability of hydrophobic pigment surfaces is dependent on the type and concentration of added surfactant.

40|$|Colloidal {{particles}} and surfactants are commonly used, either individually or combined, as stabilisers of emulsions and foams. While {{the properties of}} surfactants and particles under a range of conditions and concentrations are relatively well known, there are some areas that require further investigation. The wettability of colloidal particles {{is one of the}} main factors that determine how they behave in a given system but determining the wettability is difficult due to the small size of the particles. The Film Calliper Method (FCM) has been proposed as a simple technique for the direct measurement of the contact angles of micrometer and submicrometer particles in their natural environment. One of the main aims of this work was to develop the Film Calliper Method for measuring contact angles at oil -water interfaces. The FCM was therefore used to measure the contact angles at oil - water interfaces for a range of particles, such as latex and silica particles, in different systems. For the first time directly measured contact angles are linked to the types of <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by the particles. The FCM was also used to directly measure the contact angles of silica particles in cationic surfactant solutions at air and oil interfaces for the first time. The stability of foams and emulsions made with particle - surfactant mixtures were investigated and related to the particle contact angles. Janus particles are a special category of particles which have different properties on each hemisphere. A method for making Janus particles was developed using template silica particles masked with a polymerised Pickering emulsion. The portion of surface exposed for treating can be tuned by controlling the inherent wettability of the template particles as proven with fluorescence microscopy. <b>Emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by amphiphilic Janus particles made with the method are compared with <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by homogeneous particles with similar wettability.

In recent years, the food industry has been facing a tremendous pressure from consumers for using chemical agents to prevent lipid oxidation. In this study a novel approach to reduce lipid oxidation in oil-in-water emulsions has been taken and involves the manipulation of the emulsions' interfacial microstructure. Initially, oil-in-water emulsions were prepared with silica particles. The lipid oxidative stability was improved by up to 50 %, compared with the <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by <b>surfactant.</b> However, silica particles are not “label friendly” hence; Modified Starch and colloidal Microcrystalline Cellulose were used as the “food-grade” Pickering particles.

An efficient and facile approach to approach to introducing multiple masked thiols at the surface of polyester dendritic materials is presented, avoiding these difficulties, by utilising a xanthate protecting group. One-pot xanthate deprotection and thiol-acrylate Michael additions from the xanthate-functional dendrimers (generation zero to two) has been accomplished for the first time, using three different acrylate substrates of varying chemistry. The dendrimers were fully characterised by 1 H and 13 C NMR, SEC and either electrospray or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, depending upon the generation {{and nature of the}} end groups. In a similar fashion, this one-pot methodology was extended to prepare twenty different surface functional LDHs via the use of xanthate functional ATRP dendritic macroinitiators (generation one to four) and six different acrylate monomers. Model reactions and kinetics studies showed that the presence of xanthates within the initiator structure did not complicate the ATRP of tBuMA. The LDHs were fully characterised by 1 H NMR and SEC. In the final study, employing one-pot xanthate deprotection and thiol-acrylate Michael addition, four dendritic ATRP macroinitiators with hydrophobic and pH responsive peripheral functionalities were prepared.

Different microfluidic designs were used to vary the protein adsorption time prior to droplet collision. Coalescence stability depended on protein concentration (0. 0002 – 0. 02 wt %) and adsorption time (11 – 173 ms) : emulsion droplets were stable at low protein concentrations (as low as 0. 005 wt % β-lactoglobulin), as long as the time allocated for protein adsorption was sufficient (in this case 31 ms). Protein type was also important for coalescence stability: <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> with whey protein isolate were less stable than those with β-lactoglobulin, and coalescence stability further decreased upon protein oxidation. Regarding the effect of pH (3. 0 – 8. 0), coalescence stability was lowest around the protein's isoelectric point. With the coalescence channel we demonstrated the importance of adsorption time and interface composition for coalescence stability at low protein concentrations. Coalescence can be measured at small time-scales and in high detail since coalescence measurements are decoupled from droplet formation.

40|$|The phase {{behaviour}} {{and mechanical}} properties of 10 wt% oil-in-water <b>emulsions,</b> <b>stabilised</b> by ß-lactoglobulin (ß-lg) and flocculated by the polysaccharide dextran were studied {{as a function}} of sucrose concentration. The sucrose concentration affected neither the polysaccharide concentration above which depletion flocculation occurred, nor the elastic modulus and maximum linear strain of the emulsion gels formed. Furthermore, only a minor change in size of dextran molecules was measured over the range of sucrose concentrations studied. From this we deduce that the depletion potential between the oil droplets was not significantly affected by addition of sucrose. However, the sucrose concentration did affect the rate of macroscopic phase separation, which could be attributed to a larger viscosity and density of the aqueous phase. Thus, in unheated systems sucrose has a kinetic effect on serum separation in depletion-flocculated emulsions but no significant effect on droplet–droplet interactions...|$|R
40|$|Since both whey {{protein isolate}} and sodium {{caseinate}} are frequently used O/W emulsifiers of dairy origin, their emulsifying and <b>emulsion</b> <b>stabilising</b> properties have been determined at pH conditions that ressemble practical circumstances. In order to enable a quantitative evaluation, two 3 -level experimental designs were set-up considering {{the effect of}} homogenisation pressure and protein concentration on average droplet size, residual serum protein concentration as well as serum separation of 20 % O/W emulsions. Although both proteins were characterised by a similar surface load, still the residual protein content indicated that sodium caseinate was much more surface active. The results revealed that either 0. 25 % sodium caseinate or 0. 50 % of whey protein isolate at a homogenisation pressure of 200 bar not only yielded stable emulsions, but also limited the amount of unadsorbed protein in the continuous phase...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the mild}} {{isolation}} of an algae soluble protein isolate (ASPI) and the characterisation of its techno-functional properties are described. The ASPI was {{isolated from the}} green microalgae Tetraselmis sp. by beadmilling and subsequent anion exchange adsorption. The isolate obtained contained 59 ± 7 % (w/w) protein and 20 ± 6 % (w/w) carbohydrates, the latter composed for approximately one fourth of uronic acids (4. 8 ± 0. 4 % [w/w]). In the pH range 5. 5 – 6. 5, in which currently used legumin seed protein isolates (e. g. soy) show low solubility, ASPI retained high solubility independent of ionic strength. In the soluble pH range, the foam stability of ASPI is superior to the foam stabilities of whey protein isolate (WPI) and egg white albumin (EWA). At pH 7, ASPI stabilized foams are 1. 7 times more stable than WPI stabilized foams. Further fractionation of APSI results in foams even 3 times more stable than WPI stabilized foams. In addition, <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> with ASPI are stable against droplet aggregation around pH 5 at low ionic strength, while <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by WPI are not stable at this pH. The stability of ASPI emulsions at this pH is attributed to the co-adsorption of the charged polysaccharide fraction present in ASPI. The role of the charged polysaccharides on stabilisation of the emulsions was confirmed by fractionating ASPI into protein-rich and charged polysaccharide-rich fractions. The combination of charged polysaccharides and proteins in ASPI results in good techno-functional properties that are between that of pure proteins {{and that of the}} naturally occurring protein-polysaccharide hybrid gum arabic (GA). It is concluded that ASPI represents an attractive substitute for currently used high-value food protein isolates. Due to the combination of the positive interfacial properties of its protein fraction with the broad pH stability of its charged polysaccharide fraction, ASPI possesses the positive attributes of two types of techno-functional ingredients...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{required}} to detach a single particle from a fluid-fluid interface {{is an important}} parameter for designing certain soft materials, for example, <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by colloidal particles, colloidosomes designed for targeted drug delivery, and bio-sensors composed of magnetic particles adsorbed at interfaces. For a fixed particle volume, prolate and oblate spheroids attach more strongly to interfaces because they have larger particle-interface areas. Calculating the detachment energy of spheroids necessitates the difficult measurement of particle-liquid surface tensions, in contrast with spheres, where the contact angle suffices. We develop a simplified detachment energy model for spheroids which depends only on the particle aspect ratio and {{the height of the}} particle centre of mass above the fluid-fluid interface. We use lattice Boltzmann simulations to validate the model and provide quantitative evidence that the approach can be applied to simulate particle-stabilized emulsions, and highlight the experimental implications of this validation.

40|$|Antioxidative {{activity}} and emulsifying properties of cuttlefish skin gelatin modified by different oxidised phenolic compounds including caffeic acid, ferulic acid and tannic acid at different concentrations were investigated. Oxidised phenolic compounds were covalently attached to gelatin {{as indicated by}} the decrease in amino groups. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies indicated the presence of an aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group in gelatin after modification. Modified gelatin had the increased antioxidative activity but the decreased surface hydrophobicity. Gelatin modified with 5 % oxidised tannic acid had no change in emulsifying properties. Emulsion stability and oxidative stability of menhaden oil-in-water <b>emulsion</b> <b>stabilised</b> by 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % gelatin without and with modification by 5 % oxidised tannic acid were studied. Both gelatins at a higher concentration (1. 0 %) yielded an emulsion with a smaller particle size. Modified gelatin inhibited the formation of TBARS in the emulsion more effectively than the control gelatin throughout the 12 days of storage...|$|R
40|$|Echium plantagineum seed {{contains}} a highly polyunsaturated oil (approximately 14 % linoleic acid, 10 % γ-linolenic acid, 33 % α-linolenic acid and 14 % stearidonic acid); {{almost half of}} the fatty acids are omega- 3 fatty acids, so there is an interest in the possible health benefits of this oil, which, once extracted, is prone to oxidation. For the first time in reported literature, oil bodies (OBs), the organelles that store the oil in mature seed, were recovered from E. plantagineum seeds. The oxidative stability of these organelles ex vivo, dispersed in an aqueous continuous phase, was tested against processed E. plantagineum oil <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> with either SDS or Tween 20. For both primary and secondary oxidation products the OBs were the most stable form of dispersed oil, and the dispersed systems were all more stable than bulk E. plantagineum oil after incubating at 40 °C for 7 days. The possible reasons for the enhanced chemical stability of E. plantagineum OBs are explored in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This review {{presents}} {{recent research}} {{conducted on the}} development of various protein-polysaccharide conjugates, their functional properties and industrial applications. These conjugates are formed by the glycosylation of food proteins with carbohydrates via the Maillard reaction and are capable of improving the functional properties of proteins. The Maillard reaction facilitates covalent bonding between a reducing group of a carbohydrate and an amino group of a protein under controlled conditions of temperature, time, pH, and relative humidity. There {{is a great deal of}} interest in modifying the functional properties of proteins and in the use of novel conjugates for various industrial applications. This review discusses various methods and their implications for preparing and characterising these conjugates. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of conjugates such as solubility, thermal stability, emulsifying activity, <b>emulsion</b> <b>stabilising</b> properties, gelling and foaming properties are also analysed. A novel processing technology, spinning disc reactor, could be an alternative process for the production of protein-polysaccharide conjugates, with desirable functionality in different food systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the preparation and characterisation of hexane-in-water <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by clay particles. These emulsions, called Pickering emulsions, are characterised by the adsorption of solid particles at the oil/water (o/w) interface. The development of an elastic film at the o/w interface following the adsorption of colloidal particles helps to promote emulsion stability. Three different solid materials were used: silica sand, kaolin, and bentonite. Particles were added to the liquid mixtures in the range of 0. 5 – 10 g dm− 3. Emulsions were prepared using o/w ratios of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4. The effect of sodium chloride, on the stability of the prepared emulsions, was assessed in the range of 0 – 0. 5 mol dm− 3. In addition the use of a cationic surfactant hexadecyl-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as an aid to improving emulsion stability was assessed in the concentration range of 0 – 0. 05...|$|R
