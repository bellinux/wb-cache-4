Longitudinal cohort studies {{have been designed to}} determine associations between early life events and asthma prevalence. One such cohort is the Merthyr Allergy Prevention Study (MAPS). MAPS recruited high risk subjects, before birth, from a deprived population in South Wales. The original study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of either normal diet for the first four months of life, or a cows’ milk protein exclusion diet with <b>soya</b> formula <b>milk</b> supplementation if subjects were not breast fed. Subjects were subsequently followed up as part of a cohort study. The findings presented are based on the final follow up at age 23 years. While there was a significant protective effect of breast feeding on wheeze at age 1, {{there was no evidence of}} an association with wheeze at age 23 years. The intervention arm of the RCT was associated with an increased risk of asthma and sensitisation at age 23 years. There was tracking of both total serum IgE and positive skin prick test results over the years but there was no clear relationship between these two measures of allergy. Although the prevalence of atopy was low in childhood, there was still a clear association with this and wheeze later in life. Wheeze at age 3 years or older was an important determinant of asthma at age 23 years. There was a significant association between those who wheeze from age of 3 to age 23 years and atopic status at age 7 years. In conclusion we have investigated a birth cohort from a relatively deprived area of South Wales and found characteristics in the first 7 years of life are critical in determining if asthma develops in early adulthood...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, a multi-allergen {{detection}} method based on mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis was developed {{as described in}} JCA 1218. This method was able to demon-strate that seven allergens could be detected in a single analysis. Later, it could be shown that the same method is capable to detect allergens in processed materials while conventional methods like ELSIA and PCR failed in the same matrix, even when amounts as high as 1000 mg/kg were present. This was reported in JAOAC 94 / 4. In mid- 2012 {{a case of a}} finished product was reported, which caused allergic reactions in children. The product was analysed by ELISA and LC-MS/MS. The ELISA failed to detect the allergens while mass spectrometric analysis clearly demonstrated the presence. This is the first case where evidence suggests that conventional methods like ELISA and PCR are not sensitive enough in some pro-cessed materials to protect allergic individuals, while LC-MS/MS is still able to detect these allergens. Methods To protect the allergic consumer, analytical methods need to be capable of detecting allergens in finished products that typically contain multiple allergens. An LC/MS/MS method for simultaneous detection of seven allergens was developed and compared with commercially available ELISA kits. The detection capabilities of this novel method were demonstrated by analyzing incurred material con-taining milk, egg, soy, peanut, hazelnut, walnut, and almond. Bread was chosen as a model matrix. To assess the influence of baking on the method’s performance, analysis was done before and after baking. Results It was demonstrated that in the model matrix bread allergens in concentrations of 1000 mg/kg for egg, <b>soya</b> and <b>milk</b> remained undetected by ELISA while the developed mass spectrometric method was well capable of detecting the allergens.

40|$|As {{pressure}} {{mounted in}} mid-twentieth century Europe and America, planners were increasingly {{anxious about the}} availability of wool for military purposes. Research into substitutes focused on transforming <b>milk,</b> <b>soya</b> and maize protein into wool-like fibres; experiments were undertaken into the fibre-forming potential of egg white, feathers, fish and slaughterhouse waste. Manufacturers and politicians shared a common interest in developing these fibres, named azlons, for the war effort. Companies such as Atlantic Research Associates in America and Imperial Chemical Industries in England were directly promoting their new milk-based fibres to female consumers, making their purchase a patriotic act. Nowadays, regenerated protein fibres are being marketed as high quality ecological and biodegradable fibres. This paper presents a brief survey of development of azlon fibres together with a review of technical aspects of their production. Few examples of mid-twentieth century azlon textiles and garments have yet been identified in museum collections and accounts of their development no longer appear in standard textile histories. Issues relating to this ‘disappearance’ from cultural memory are discussed. Thompson’s rubbish theory is used to explore attitudes to the collecting of man-made materials. The implications of this for conservation practice in both identifying and treating these fibres is reviewed. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Politicians and {{planners}} in Europe and America in the 1930 s and 1940 s {{were increasingly}} {{anxious about the}} availability of wool for military requirements and actively encouraged research into substitute fibres. Innovation energised by the needs of war informed the development of processes to transform proteins normally used for food (<b>milk,</b> <b>soya,</b> corn, and fish) or perceived as waste (egg whites, chicken feathers and slaughter-house products) into fibres. This paper explores both innovative technology and conceptual models of innovation as applied to substitute fibres which were intended to result in both technical and cultural shifts. Substitute innovation was used to modify existing technology used to produce regenerated cellulosic fibres was modified to make regenerated protein fibres. Moderately successful in the unusual economic conditions of war and marketed as modernistic, patriotic and utopian fibres, regenerated protein fibres lost their price advantage to competing petrochemical fibres. Their physical disadvantages outweighed their benefits and they rapidly faded from popular memory and are only scantily represented in museum collections. The brief trajectory of these fibres prompted a revision of the traditional conceptualisation of innovation as developed by Usher and Schumpeter. Innovation is influenced by producers’ technological and tacit knowledge and skills and public policies. A new model of substitute innovation is proposed here to aid understanding of attitudes to the acceptability of new fibres which is relevant for the development, marketing and popular acceptance of today’s regenerated protein fibres. This paper will be illustrated with case studies of American and English fibres including Aralac, made from milk, Henry Ford’s soyabean fibre, Ardil made from peanuts and today’s milk and soyabean fibres, promoted as innovative, environmentally sensitive and health-giving...|$|R

International Lupin Conference, 'Lupins for Health and Wealth', Fremantle, Western Australia, 14 - 18 September 2008 RONO: DB 05225 An experiment investigated {{the hypothesis that}} incorporating lupins (Lupinus spp.) compared with soya bean (Glycine max) meal into concentrate diets would not alter the yield or composition of milk from dairy cows. There were 2 dietary treatments: yellow lupin (cv. Wodjil) and soya bean meal. The experiment consisted of a continuous design with 3 phases: a covariate period (weeks 2 and 3 of lactation), an adaptation period (7 days; week 4 of lactation) and a measurement period (weeks 5 to 12 of lactation). Twenty-four mature autumn-calving dairy cows were used. During the covariate period, feed intakes and milk yields were recorded whilst cows were offered ryegrass silage ad libitum plus 6 kg d- 1 of a standard dairy concentrate. Cows were allocated to treatment and adapted to their respective diet over 7 days, during which the concentrate offered was increased up to 9 kg d- 1. During the measurement period, cows received ryegrass silage ad libitum using individual feeders. Concentrates of each treatment (9 kg d- 1) were fed 3 times d- 1. Milk yields were measured and 50 ml sub-samples of milk from two consecutive milkings were collected from all cows every week for measurement of fat, protein, lactose and somatic cell counts. Dairy cows offered the soya bean meal concentrate had a higher DM intake, and therefore, ME intake than cows offered the lupin dietary treatment {{but there was no}} difference in the N intake by cows on the two treatment diets. As animals on both dietary treatments consumed the same (9 kg) amount of concentrates each day, the intake data showed that dairy cows offered concentrates containing soya bean meal consumed more ryegrass silage than those offered concentrates containing yellow lupins. There were no significant differences in the milk yield or milk composition from dairy cows offered concentrate diets containing either yellow lupins or soya bean meal during weeks 5 to 12 of lactation (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction: Asthma is {{the most}} common chronic {{disorder}} in children and is more prevalent in children 5 - 10 years of age. The prevalence of childhood asthma has increased in recent years. Food allergy has beenimplicated as a risk factor for asthma. In this study, we determined the prevalence of food allergy andassociated factors in asthmatic children less than 18 years of age. Materials and Methods: In this Cross-sectional study, we studied 298 asthmatic children less than 18 yearsof age in Semnan (Iran) in 2007 - 2008, who were diagnosed according to physical examination and history. Skin prick test was performed for all of participants and a questionnaire was filled out. Wheals of 3 millimeter and flares of 10 millimeters larger than negative control was regarded as a positive test. Results: 35. 9 %(95 % Confidence Interval: 30. 5 - 41. 3 %) of asthmatic children showed sensitization to atleast one of the principal allergenic foods (wheat, rice, peanut, egg, <b>soya</b> and cow <b>milk).</b> Prevalence of foodallergy in asthmatic children under 18 years of age had significant association with gender, birth weight,history of other allergies, family history of allergy, type of coexistent allergy and age of initiation ofsymptoms, age of introduction of complementary feeding, consumption of cow milk before one year of ageand also duration of breast feeding(P< 0. 05). Conclusion: these finding showed that the prevalence of food allergy in asthmatic children is high. There issignificant association between food allergy and use of cow's milk before one year of age, low birth weight,short breast feeding period, male gender, history of other allergies in the patient and close relatives, early ageof initiation of symptoms and also introduction of complementary foods before six month of age. Thus, weshould have particular attention on food allergens in such kind of patients, until they outgrown their foodallergies. This is the optimum way for controlling asthma in these people...|$|R

40|$|Background: Development of more {{cost-effective}} ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) {{is a global}} public health priority. To date, previous lower-cost recipes have been less effective than the standard peanut and milk (PM) –based RUTF, particularly in children aged, 24 mo. Objective: We aimed to compare {{the efficacy of the}} PM-RUTF to a milk-free soya, maize, and sorghum (FSMS) –RUTF enriched with crystalline amino acids without cow milk powder and a <b>milk,</b> <b>soya,</b> maize, and sorghum (MSMS) –RUTF containing 9. 3 % skim cow milk powder. Design: This nonblinded, 3 -arm, parallel-group, simple randomized controlled trial enrolled Malawian children with severe acute malnutrition. Results: In intention-to-treat analyses, FSMS-RUTF showed noninferiority for recovery rates in children aged 24 – 59 mo (D: 21. 9 %; 95 % CI: 29. 5 %, 5. 6 %) and 6 – 23 mo (D: 20. 2 %; 95 % CI: 27. 5 %, 7. 1 %) compared with PM-RUTF. MSMS-RUTF also showed noninferiority for recovery rates in children aged 24 – 59 mo (D: 0. 0 %; 95 % CI: 27. 3 %, 7. 4 %) and 6 – 23 mo (D: 0. 6 %; 95 % CI: 24. 3 %, 5. 5 %). Noninferiority in recovery rates was also observed in per-protocol analyses. For length of stay in the program (time to cure), both FSMS-RUTF in children aged 24 – 59 mo (D: 2. 8 d; 95 % CI: 20. 8, 6. 5 d) and 6 – 23 mo (D: 3. 4 d; 95 % CI: 21. 2, 8. 0 d) and MSMS-RUTF in children aged 24 – 59 mo (D: 0. 2 d; 95 % CI: 23. 1, 3. 6 d) and 6 – 23 mo (D: 1. 2 d; 95 % CI: 23. 4, 5. 8 d) were not inferior to PM-RUTF. FSMS-RUTF was also significantly better than PM-RUTF at increasing hemoglobin and body iron stores in anemic children, with mean hemoglobin increases of 2. 1 (95 % CI: 1. 6, 2. 6) and 1. 3 (95 % CI: 0. 9, 1. 8) and mean body iron store increases of 2. 0 (95 % CI: 0. 8, 3. 3) and 0. 1 (95 % CI: 21. 1, 1. 3) for FSMS-RUTF and PM-RUTF, respectively. Conclusions: FSMS-RUTF without milk is efficacious in the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children aged 6 – 23 and 24 – 59 mo. It is also better at correcting iron deficiency anemia than PM-RUTF. This trial was registered at www. pactr. org as PACTR 201505001101224. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
