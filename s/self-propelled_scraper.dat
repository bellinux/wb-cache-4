The work proposes methods for testing and calculating a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>scraper</b> with {{tractive}} loading provided with an automatic engine loading control system. The results of the work include the substantiation of the control principle {{and the development of}} the scraper unit automatic control system which provides for its higher reliability and efficiency. The results also include the development of a contactless engine loading converter {{and the development of a}} bucket position automatic control system employing this converter. The use of such a system enhances the reliability and the efficiency of the scraper unit. Prototype converter and automatic control system are manufactured and investigated. They are being prepared for installation on a scraper with a mechanical transmissionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

Elevating scrapers do not require assistance from push-tractors. The pioneer developer of the elevating scraper was Hancock Manufacturing Company of Lubbock, Texas USA. <b>Self-propelled</b> <b>scrapers</b> were invented by R. G. LeTourneau in the 1930s. His company called them Tournahoppers. This concept was further developed by LeTourneau Westinghouse Company.
