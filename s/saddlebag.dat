500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{returning}} monsters, the Ice Warriors were not heavily redesigned. Gatiss insisted upon keeping {{the fundamentals of}} the original and Moffat explained that the original design was not well-known enough to put a new spin on it, and so Skaldak's shell is just a [...] "super-version of the original". Of the original design, Millennium FX's Neill Gorton said, [...] "My problem with the old ones is they had Lego hands and weird, spindly arms but a bulky body and these strange <b>saddlebag</b> hips, almost feminine. They had fur sticking out everywhere. So all of that together didn't suggest [...] "ice warriors." [...] They should be much beefier and stronger. We gave it more of a bodybuilder physique, changed the hands and styled the body {{to make it look}} more like armour-plating, even though it's reptilian." [...] The costume was made of flexible urethane rubber instead of the fibreglass like the original, as it would damage less easily and be more comfortable to wear. The costume was made to specially fit Spencer Wilding. Though only some of the Skaldak's real appearance was shown on-screen, Gorton stated that they created a full animatronic body.|$|E
500|$|From medieval times, beagle {{was used}} as a generic {{description}} for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood [...] at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a [...] "pocket" [...] or <b>saddlebag,</b> they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and {{it is possible that the}} two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: [...] Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.|$|E

2500|$|Next, Gimlin and Patterson {{rounded up}} Patterson's horses, which {{had run off}} in the {{opposite}} direction, downstream, before the filming began. Patterson got his second roll of film from his <b>saddlebag</b> and filmed the tracks. Then the men tracked [...] "Patty" [...] for either one mile or three miles (5km), but [...] "lost it in the heavy undergrowth". They went to their campsite three miles south, picked up plaster, returned to the initial site, measured the creature's step-length, and made two plaster casts, one each of the best-quality right and left prints.|$|E
2500|$|Patterson {{estimated}} he {{was about}} 25ft (7.6 m) away from the creature at his closest. Patterson said that his horse reared upon sensing the figure, and he spent about twenty seconds extricating himself from the saddle, controlling his horse, getting around to its other side, and getting his camera from a <b>saddlebag</b> before he could run toward the figure while operating his camera. He yelled [...] "Cover me" [...] to Gimlin, [...] "meaning to get the gun out". He crossed the creek on horseback after Patterson had run well beyond it, riding on a path somewhat {{to the left of}} Patterson's and somewhat beyond his position. Perez estimates he came within 60–90 feet of [...] "Patty". Then, rifle in hand, he dismounted, but did not point his rifle at the creature.|$|E

2500|$|... day in {{the life}} of nine 19th-century {{characters}} traveling between Mecca and Medina in this engaging first novel. Though they come from a wide variety of religious, national and socioeconomic backgrounds, all find themselves in the same caravan when it is beset by a sandstorm and a brutal bandit attack. Each chapter recounts these events from the perspective of its title character, a device Nakhjavani uses skillfully; not only does she avoid the tedium that could result from multiple retellings, but she also turns the bit player in one narrator's story into the complicated hero of another… Nakhjavani shows how God uses their respective religious orientations and the secrets bundled in a <b>saddlebag</b> to reveal life-changing truths to each of them. The novel's Baha'i message is beautifully rendered in these tales of multiple paths leading to one destination.|$|E
2500|$|The austere {{beauty of}} Euclidean {{geometry}} {{has been seen}} by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his <b>saddlebag,</b> and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, [...] "You never can make a lawyer {{if you do not}} understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight". Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet [...] "", [...] "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!".

The homestead site on Goosenest Prairie, about [...] south of Charleston, Illinois, is preserved as the Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site, although his original <b>saddlebag</b> log cabin was lost after being disassembled and shipped to Chicago for display at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.
