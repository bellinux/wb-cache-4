40|$|Abstract. The {{reactor vessel}} body and closure head are {{fastened}} with the <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> {{that is one}} of crucial parts for safety of the reactor vessels in nuclear power plants. It is reported that the <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> is often experienced by fatigue cracks initiated at threads. Stud bolts are inspected by the ultrasonic technique during the overhaul periodically for the prevention of failure which leads to radioactive leakage from the nuclear reactor. The conventional ultrasonic inspection for stud bolts was mainly conducted by reflected echo method based on shadow effect. However, in this technique, there were numerous spurious signals reflected from every oblique surfaces of the thread. In this study, ultrasonic phased array technique was applied to investigate detectability of flaws in stud bolts and characteristics of ultrasonic images corresponding to different scanning methods, that is, sector and linear scan. For this purpose, simplified <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> specimens with artificial defects of various depths were prepared...|$|E

Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special <b>bolting</b> applications.For <b>studs</b> that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R

40|$|Flanged joints {{on large}} {{diameter}} flanges can prove problematic to seal successfully with many {{factors contributing to}} ensuring a successful operation. One such factor is <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> loading contributing to stress and deflection of the flanged joint. This investigation {{involves the use of}} finite element analysis (F. E. A) to predict levels of stress and deflection of a particular flanged joint when the stud bolts are tightened and flange pressurised. The level of <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> force selected must ensure the joint is sufficiently tight to avoid leakage. However, the force must not be excessive causing damage. The flanged joint is located on the channel head of a shell and tube heat exchanger. For the purposes of this project, the educational version of ANSYS 5. 5 was used thus a number of critical assumptions were made to operate within the restrictions of the software. As a comparative check of the F. E. A method, a conventional method termed the target load bolt-up method was employed. The analysis results using both methods, when interpreted, indicated the flange was not excessively stressed. Field monitoring by observation of the flanged joint for signs of leakage and other detrimental effects indicates the <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> load selected is acceptable...|$|E
40|$|The {{bolts and}} nuts are widely used in various fields as {{important}} joining elements with long history. However, screw loosening is easily induced by vibration and external loads, and sometimes causes very serious accident without notice. In this paper, a special <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> named "Super <b>Stud</b> <b>Bolt</b> (SSB) " is studied, which can prevent loosening effectively. Between the upper threads and the lower threads, there is a thin walled tube which can be deformed along the axial direction so that the phase difference is designed and SSB is developed. During fastening, this phase difference induces the contrary forces on the surfaces of the upper threads and the lower threads, which bring out the anti-loosening performance. In this stydy, both courses of processing and fastening are simulated, {{and the relationship between}} axial force and displacement is illustrated with the finite element method. In this analysis, the large plastic strains and elastic-plastic large deformation theory are applied to 4 nodes axial symmetric FEM models. Through the comparison among the results, the desirable range of the phase difference of lower and upper threads is decided. Since the thin walled tube is the heart of anti-loosening mechanism, optimum original dimensions are discussed in this study...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the design of}} a new shear connector and the corresponding results obtained on push-out tests. This new shear connector consists on a steel rib with indented cut shape that provides resistance to longitudinal shear and prevents transversal separation between the concrete slab and the steel profile (uplift). Adding to this, the connector openings cut makes easier the arrangement of transversal reinforcement bars. The installation of the connectors is simple and requires only common welding procedure. Due to its load capacity, the indented connector is able to replace a group of stud bolts. Its structural behaviour is analyzed and compared with other existing connectors, like the <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> and the Perfobond. The influence of different geometrical and mechanical aspects on the ultimate load capacity and ductility is assessed.

30|$|In {{this study}} the {{progressive}} collapse resisting {{capacity of a}} RC beam-column subassemblage with and without strengthening was investigated. Total of five specimens were tested; two unreinforced specimens, the one designed as gravity load-resisting system and the other as seismic load-resisting system, and three specimens reinforced with: (i) bonded strand, (ii) unbonded strand, and (iii) side steel plates with <b>stud</b> <b>bolts.</b> The two-span subassemblages were designed {{as part of an}} eight-story RC building. Monotonically increasing load was applied at the middle column of the specimens and the force–displacement relationships were plotted. It was observed that the gravity load-resisting specimen failed by fractures of re-bars in the beams. In the other specimens no failure was observed until the maximum displacement capacity of the actuator was reached. Highest strength was observed in the structure with unbonded strand. The test result of the specimen with side steel plates in beam-column joints showed that the force–displacement curve increased without fracture of re-bars. Based on the test results it was concluded that the progressive collapse resisting capacity of a RC frame could be significantly enhanced using unbonded strands or side plates with <b>stud</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a single 7 / 8 ” nominal diameter <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> and nuts assembly would fail to perform its required function in a flange assembly when the nut was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206. 8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B 16. 5 - 2003 Pipe Flanges and Flanges Fittings. A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206. 8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS 12. 0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the nut and stud at the thread roots. It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a > 60 % material loss from the nut. The failure mode experienced was deformation of the flange plate. This analysis proved that a nut can experience significant effective material loss without damaging the flange integrity...|$|E

No âmbito dos perfis formados a frio, a utilização do sistema misto ainda é incipiente, necessitando de investigações mais aprofundadas a respeito do comportamento estrutural e a adequação dos modelos de cálculo adotados para vigas mistas em perfis laminados e soldados. No Brasil, a ampla disponibilidade de aços planos tem impulsionado o emprego do sistema misto constituído por perfis formados a frio em edifícios de pequeno porte, porém, mediante concepções clássicas, o que não conduz a um aproveitamento mais racional do sistema. Neste trabalho foi investigado um sistema não-convencional de vigas mistas em perfil cartola leve preenchido com concreto, cuja conexão com a laje foi feita mediante duas soluções: conectores do tipo alça em barra chata soldados ao perfil e conectores do tipo alça em barra redonda soldados ao perfil. Foi feita avaliação do comportamento estrutural da conexão aço-concreto, via ensaios de cisalhamento direto (push-out tests), e ensaios em vigas mistas simplesmente apoiadas para avaliação da região de momento fletor positivo. Os conectores de cisalhamento apresentaram ductilidade e resistência compatíveis com as vigas mistas analisadas, e as respostas de rigidez e resistência à flexão para uma condição de interação completa comprovam que a hipótese de plastificação total da seção descreve com precisão o comportamento estrutural do sistema proposto.

In the cold-formed steel sections scope, the use of a composite steel and concrete solution is still premature, what makes necessary a higher degree of a structural behavior investigation and the adequacy of the theoretical solutions proposed, also for the composite steel and concrete hot-rolled and welded shapes. In Brazil, the high availability of steel sheets has pushed the employee of the composite system of cold-formed steel in small and mid-height buildings, however, because of classical conceptions, it doesnt́ lead too a more rational use of the system. It was investigated in this work a non-conventional lightweight composite system formed by hat-shaped beams filled with concrete, witch connection with the slab was done by means of two solutions: arc-shaped connectors in at bars welded too the section and arc-shaped connectors in round bars welded too the section. An analysis was conducted for evaluation of the structural behavior in the steel and concrete interface by push-out tests, and tests in simple two points supported beams for evaluation of the bending strength. The shear connectors showed ductility and resistance compatible with the analyzed composite beams and the stiffness and bending resistance responses for the given condition of full interaction showed that the full section plastification consideration describes with precision the structural behavior of the proposed system...|$|E

40|$|As per {{the modern}} Industrial requirements, higher surface finish {{mechanical}} components and mating parts with close limits and tolerances, {{is one of}} the most important requirement. Abrasive machining processes are generally the last operations performed on manufactured products for higher surface finishing and for fine or small scale material removal. Higher surface finish and high rate of removal can be obtained if a large number of grains act together.

The hook or bend radius used were 50 mm and 57. 5 mm for sample L 1 and L 2, respectively. 90 -degree bend were used on sample T 1 and T 2. Based on test results, it can be seen that the performance of concrete failure pattern under tensile load on both L and T anchor bolt design samples with 200 mm embedment depth was better than deeper embedment depth of 230 mm.

In this report hold downs have been experimentally studied {{with respect to the}} strength and stiffness of the connection. Four different types of hold downs have been tested. The specimen was subjected to tension load applied to the stud. Four tests series are presented. Each series was divided into different sets according to the type of fastener used with the hold down device. The results show that the failure load is higher when hold downs with anchor bolts are used, up to ten times higher than the anchorage that uses only screws or nails. The failure mode vary with the type of hold down and the type of fasteners used. The tests showed three primary failure modes: failure of the <b>stud</b> when a <b>bolt</b> is used as the fastener between hold down device and stud, failure due to pull-out of the screws or nails from the rail and failure due to failure or pull-out of screws or nails from stud.
