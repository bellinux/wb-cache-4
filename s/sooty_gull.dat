50|$|The <b>sooty</b> <b>gull</b> is a {{predator}} and scavenger. It feeds on discarded fish and fish offal, other small fish that it catches itself, prawns, newly hatched turtles and {{the eggs and}} chicks of other sea birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sooty</b> <b>gull</b> (Ichthyaetus hemprichii) is {{a species}} of gull in the family Laridae, {{also known as the}} Aden gull or Hemprich's gull. It is found in Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Maldives, Mozambique, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. As is the case with many gulls, it has {{traditionally}} been placed in the genus Larus. The <b>sooty</b> <b>gull</b> is named in honour of the German naturalist Wilhelm Hemprich who died in 1825 while on a scientific expedition to Egypt and the Middle East with his friend Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg.|$|E
5000|$|Hemprich is commemorated in {{the names}} of the <b>sooty</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus hemprichii [...] ), Hemprich's {{hornbill}} (Tockus hemprichii [...] ), and the fossil amber pseudoscorpion (Pseudogarypus hemprichii [...] ). He is also commemorated {{in the names}} of two reptiles: Hemprich's skink (Scincus hemprichii [...] ) and Hemprich's coral snake (Micrurus hemprichii [...] ).|$|E
50|$|About 250,000 waders {{visit the}} Gulf shores and mudflats at peak {{migration}} time; {{these include the}} grey plover, the greater and lesser sand plovers, the crab plover, the Kentish plover and the broad-billed sandpiper. The coast, and particularly offshore islands are used by many seabirds. About twenty to thirty percent of the world's Socotra cormorants, about 200,000 birds, breed in the United Arab Emirates, but they are under threat from fishermen who fear for their livelihoods. <b>Sooty</b> <b>gulls</b> breed here, as do red-billed tropicbirds {{as well as several}} species of tern; white-cheeked, bridled and lesser crested tern.|$|R

50|$|The white-eyed gull (Ichthyaetus leucophthalmus) {{is a small}} gull {{which is}} endemic to the Red Sea. Its closest {{relative}} is the <b>sooty</b> <b>gull.</b> It {{is one of the}} world's rarest gulls, with a population of just 4,000 - 6,500 pairs. The species is classed as Near Threatened by the IUCN; human pressure and oil pollution are deemed the major threats. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus Larus.|$|E
5000|$|The IUCN {{lists the}} <b>sooty</b> <b>gull</b> as being of [...] "Least Concern". This {{is because it}} has a very wide range and its total {{population}} is large. The population trend is believed to be downwards but the rate of decrease is insufficient to warrant listing the bird in a more threatened category. The main threats faced by the bird are from the exploration of some of its traditional breeding grounds for oil, land reclamation, and the possibility of oil spills.|$|E
50|$|Isolation {{has helped}} {{maintain}} several endemic life forms on Astola. The endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbracata) nest {{on the beach}} {{at the foot of the}} cliffs. The island is also an important area for endemic reptiles such as the Astola viper (Echis carinatus astolae). The island is reported to support a large number of breeding water birds including coursers, curlews, godwit, gulls, plovers and sanderling. Feral catsoriginally introduced by fishermen to control the endemic rodent population, pose an increasing threat to wildlife breeding sites. E.g. the <b>sooty</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus hemprichii) had a major breeding colony on the island, now extirpated because of introduced rats.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sooty</b> <b>gull</b> is {{native to}} the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf and its range extends as far east as Pakistan. It is also native to {{the east coast of}} Africa as far south as Tanzania and Mozambique. It occurs as a vagrant in India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Bahrain. It is a coastal bird, seldom going further out to sea than about 10 km beyond coastal reefs {{although}} it has occasionally been seen 140 km from land. It frequents ports and harbours, the coast, inshore islands and the intertidal zone. It seldom moves inland or visits freshwater locations. It is nomadic or partially migratory and many populations move southwards after breeding, though Red Sea populations seem to be relatively sedentary.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSkin lipids play an {{important}} role in the regulation of cutaneous water loss (CWL). Earlier studies have shown that Saudi desert birds exhibit a tendency of reduced CWL than birds from temperate environment due to adaptive changes in composition of their skin lipids. In this study, we used thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for separation and detection of non-polar and polar lipids from the skin of six bird species including <b>sooty</b> <b>gull,</b> brown booby, house sparrow, Arabian waxbill, sand partridge, and laughing dove. The lipids were separated and detected on Silica gel G coated TLC plates and quantified by using densitometric image analysis. Rf values of the non-polar lipids were as follows: cholesterol (0. 29), free fatty acids (0. 58), triacylglycerol (0. 69), fatty acids methyl esters (0. 84) and cholesterol ester (0. 97). Rf values for the polar lipids were: cerebroside (0. 42), ceramide (0. 55) and cholesterol (0. 73). The results showed the abundance of fatty acids methyl esters (47. 75 – 60. 46 %) followed by triacylglycerol (12. 69 – 24. 14 %). The remaining lipid compositions were as follows: cholesterol (4. 09 – 13. 18 %), ceramide (2. 18 – 13. 27 %), and cerebroside (2. 53 – 12. 81 %). In conclusion, our findings showed that TLC is a simple and sensitive method for the separation and quantification of skin lipids. We also reported a new protocol for lipid extraction using the zirconia beads for efficient disruption of skin tissues. This study will help us better understand the role of skin lipids in adaptive physiology towards adverse climatic conditions...|$|E
