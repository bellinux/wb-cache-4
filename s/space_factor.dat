50|$|In pipe organs, {{this is done}} {{by having}} two pipes, one pipe of the note being played, and another harmonically related, {{typically}} at its fifth, being sounded at the same time. The result is a pitch at a common subharmonic of the pitches played (one octave below the first pitch when {{the second is the}} fifth, 3:2, two octaves below when the second is the major third, 5:4). This effect is useful especially in the lowest ranks of the pipe organ where cost or space could prohibit having a rank of such low pitch. For example, a 64' pipe would be costly and take up at least 32' of space (if capped) for each pipe. Using a resultant tone for such low pitches would eliminate the cost and <b>space</b> <b>factor,</b> but would not sound as full as a true 64' pipe.|$|E

40|$|Distribution of {{air voids}} in {{concrete}} {{was regarded as}} 2 D spatial point processes. Characteristics of their distribution were evaluated by several spatial statistics functions. Furthermore, a characteristic distance between air voids was defined in the nearest neighbor distance function. Correspondence between the characteristic distance and the conventional <b>spacing</b> <b>factor</b> was investigated. Clustered distribution of air voids due {{to the presence of}} aggregate particles were properly estimated by the spatial statistics functions. However, as far as the cement paste matrix was concerned, it was possible to assume that air voids were distributed randomly except a range of short distances. Thus, spatial structure of air-void systems, in particular the characteristic distance between air voids could be simply simulated as a random point process. Furthermore, the characteristic distance of real air-void distribution was almost the same as the conventional <b>spacing</b> <b>factor.</b> Compared to the conventional <b>spacing</b> <b>factor</b> that is obtained by following the ASTM C 457 procedure, the characteristic distance is quite easy to obtain. Furthermore, taking account {{of the fact that the}} characteristic distances measured for real distribution in concretes are plotted within the 95 % confidence interval of binominal random point process, air-void systems in concrete can be assumed as 2 D Poisson point process. Thus, a simple equation to obtain the <b>spacing</b> <b>factor</b> from a point process was proposed. The <b>spacing</b> <b>factor</b> was correctly estimated by the equation. Therefore, the characteristic distance of air voids defined in this study can be used as a new distance parameter between air voids, alternatively it may be used as a parameter to estimate the traditional <b>spacing</b> <b>factor.</b> コンクリート中の気泡の分布を点過程とみなし，分布の特徴と距離特性の評価を行った．気泡量を変化させた種々の気泡系に対し最近傍距離関数から特性値を定義し，従来の気泡間隔係数との対応を検討した．その結果，気泡は見かけ上凝集性の分布を示すが，セメントペーストマトリックス内ではある程度の距離以上にてランダム分布と見なせ，シミュレーションにてその分布を再現できることを確認した．また，そのランダム分布の特性値は気泡間隔係数と同等の値を与え，その理由を気泡間隔係数が定義される 3 次元規則配置下での距離の同義性から説明した．また，点密度と配合から気泡間隔係数を簡便に推定できることを示した．空間点過程としての取り扱いは，新たな気泡構造評価法もしくは気泡間隔係数推定の有用な手段になりうると考えられる...|$|R

The values of the contact angle (CA), contact angle hysteresis (CAH) and tilt angle (TA) are measured and compared with the theoretical values.

40|$|AbstractA new {{description}} is proposed {{of the air}} void structure in air-entrained concretes using a PPV (Protected Paste Volume) parameter. The PPV is determined as a ratio of the paste area protected by air voids to the total paste area, obtained from the 2 D surface measurements. This approach, although constitutes a development of the Philleo concept, {{takes into account the}} number, size and distribution of not only air voids but also aggregate grains, often disregarded by other researchers. The obtained results show that the standard <b>spacing</b> <b>factor</b> L⩽ 0. 20 mm fails to guarantee that 100 percent of the paste volume is protected against the harmful effects of frost, which is the basic assumption in the Powers <b>spacing</b> <b>factor</b> model. The preliminary verification was carried out of the relationships between the parameters L and PPV and the results of freeze–thaw experiments. According to the authors, {{at this stage of the}} study the PPV provides better correlation with the frost resistance results than the standard <b>spacing</b> <b>factor</b> L. Unlike other indicators representing a statistical estimation of the average spacing of air bubbles, the PPV much better reflects the spatial displacement of the air pores in concrete and can thus be considered as an improved factor of air voids spatial dispersion...|$|R
40|$|The {{freeze-thaw}} resistance of concretes was studied. Nine concrete mixes, made with five cements and cement-Class C fly ash combinations, {{were exposed to}} freeze-thaw cycling following 110 to 222 days of moist curing. Prior to the freeze-thaw cycling, the specimens were examined by a low-vacuum scanning electron microscope (SEM) for their microstructure. The influence of a wet/dry treatment was also studied. Infilling of ettringite in entrained air voids was observed in the concretes tested. The extent of the infilling depends on the period of moist curing {{as well as the}} wet/dry treatment. The concretes with 15 % Class C fly ash replacement show more infilling in their air voids. It was found that the influence of the infilling on the freeze-thaw durability relates to the air <b>spacing</b> <b>factor.</b> The greater the <b>spacing</b> <b>factor,</b> the more expansion under the freeze-thaw cycling. The infilling seems to decrease effective air content and to increase effective <b>spacing</b> <b>factor.</b> The infilling also implies that the filled air voids are water-accessible.
