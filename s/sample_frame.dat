5000|$|A probability-based survey {{sample is}} created by {{constructing}} {{a list of the}} target population, called the sampling frame, a randomized process for selecting units from the <b>sample</b> <b>frame,</b> called a selection procedure, and a method of contacting selected units to and enabling them complete the survey, called a data collection method or mode. [...] For some target populations this process may be easy, for example, sampling the employees of a company by using payroll list. However, in large, disorganized populations simply constructing a suitable <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> is often a complex and expensive task.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In our {{application}} {{practice of}} sample survey, we mostly neglect some non-sampling errors such as <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors. Actually, {{the influence of}} non-sampling errors to the total survey deviation can not be ignored. In view of this topic, this paper briefly discussed the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors as non-sampling errors. First {{a brief review of}} the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> together with the type and structure of the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> is given. Next the distinction between <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors and <b>sampling</b> errors is made theoretically in general. Then through the analysis of a series of non-random impact factors and the application of corresponding improvements or solutions, the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> errors are reduced or controlled within a certain range. Finally, this paper summed up and sorted out the influencing factors based on the sample units or elements for the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> and also discussed the problems and solutions...|$|R
40|$|A master <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> is a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> that {{provides}} the basis for all data collections based on sample surveys and censuses in a certain sector. Current technologies, in particular the availability of remote sensing, the ability of geographic information systems to overlay and integrate efficiently different layers of geographic information, have completely transformed the way of building master <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> for the agricultural sector and considerably reduced the cost and the time needed. The evolution of global positioning systems has substantially changed the field work, influencing also the definition of master <b>sampling</b> <b>frames.</b> In this paper, we analyze how the use of satellite imagery and geo-referencing technology has influenced the building of master <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> for agricultural statistics...|$|R

The sample design for HINTS 2008 consisted of two samples with each sample selected from a separate <b>sample</b> <b>frame.</b> One sample used the same RDD/CATI methodology as prior surveys. Survey administration averaged 30 minutes per respondent. Data were collected from 4,092 respondents.|$|E
5000|$|Coverage bias: Coverage bias {{can occur}} when {{population}} members {{do not appear}} in the <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> (undercoverage). Coverage bias occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between covered and non-covered units. Telephone surveys suffer from a well known source of coverage bias because they cannot include households without telephones.|$|E
50|$|The import {{merchandise}} <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> {{are obtained}} from the U.S. Customs Service. The export merchandise <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> are {{obtained from the}} Canadian Customs Service for exports to Canada and from the Bureau of the Census for exports {{to the rest of}} the world. Data sources for services are researched and developed separately for each category. For example, the Department of Transportation provides the <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> for the air freight price indexes. The reference period for a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> is generally the most recent available 12 months.|$|R
40|$|Link-tracing {{designs are}} often used to {{estimate}} the size of hidden populations by utilizing the relational links between their members. A major problem in studies of hidden populations {{is the lack of}} a convenient <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> The most frequently applied design in studies of hidden populations is respondent-driven sampling in which no <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> is used. However, in some studies multiple but incomplete <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> are available. In this article, we introduce the B-graph design {{that can be used in}} such situations. In this design, all available incomplete <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> are joined and turned into one <b>sampling</b> <b>frame,</b> from which a random sample is drawn and selected respondents are asked to mention their contacts. By considering the population as a bipartite graph of a two-mode network (those from the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> and those who are not on the frame), the number of respondents who are directly linked to the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> members can be estimated using Chao’s and Zelterman’s estimators for sparse data. The B-graph sampling design is illustrated using the data of a social network study from Utrecht, the Netherlands. Keywords: Network sampling; capture recapture; hidden population...|$|R

50|$|Virtual snowball {{sampling}} technique {{was used in}} order to find participants for the study of a minority group - Argentinian entrepreneurs living in Spain. About 60 percent of this population has double nationality - both Spanish and Argentinian. Spanish national statistics classifies them as European citizens only and there is no information about the place of birth tied to the profiles of entrepreneurs in Spain either. Therefore, referring to national statistics only, made it impossible to build a <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> for this research. The use of virtual networks in this example of hard to reach population, increased the number of participating subjects and as a consequence, improved the representativeness of results of the study.|$|E
50|$|The LA 2 (ЛА-2) is a Carbine. The {{sample was}} {{designed}} by Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant A. I. Nesterovym in 1961 {{under the influence of}} plant competition for the AKM. The <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> limited progress in its rearmost position of the cutting insert receiver. This allowed the elasticity of its walls to reduce the impact of hitting the moving parts in an extreme position on the tip-off weapon. Automatic mode shows improved shooting accuracy. Location of the return spring {{on the left side of}} the bolt allowed its height to be reduced along with the height of the arms in general. Shoe flies combine with the gas chamber, with a diopter sight fully posted on the cover of the receiver. A cleaning gas vent at the top of the gas chamber in the firing position is covered by a crane. Weight is reduced to 2.15 kg. Its prototype 1961 magazine capacity was 30 rounds with an effective range of 1,000 meters.|$|E

50|$|The most {{straightforward}} type {{of frame}} {{is a list of}} elements of the population (preferably the entire population) with appropriate contact information. For example, in an opinion poll, possible <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> include an electoral register or a telephone directory. Other <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> can include employment records, school class lists, patient files in a hospital, organizations listed in a thematic database, and so on. On a more practical levels, <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> have the form of computer files.|$|R
40|$|Under-coverage {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{problems}} of <b>sampling</b> <b>frames.</b> To reduce the impact of coverage error on survey estimates several frames can be combined in order to achieve a complete (or nearly complete) coverage of the target population. Multiple frame estimators have been developed to be used in the context of multiple <b>frame</b> surveys. <b>Sampling</b> <b>frames</b> may overlap which is the case when a single unit of the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> is related with more than one element of the target population. Indirect sampling (Lavallée, 1995) is an alternative approach to classical sampling theory in dealing with the overlapping problem of <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> on survey estimates. Not infrequently a survey may need more than one <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> in order to improve coverage and simultaneously the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> overlap. In this paper a new class of estimators is presented which is the result from merging multiple frames estimators (only the particular case of dual frames will be presented) with indirect sampling estimators in order to bring together in a single estimator the effect of several frames on survey estimates.

40|$|A <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> is {{the listing}} of the units fromwhich a sample is to be selected. Whendeciding upon a file {{to serve as a}} source for a <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> for a survey, perhaps the most {{important}} consideration {{is the extent to which}} the target population will be covered by the frame. However, other issues also come into play such as the accuracy of contact and other information appearing on the file as well as its cost. The American Medical Association Masterfile has long been considered the preferred choice for surveys of physicians, although it does have drawbacks. Here we consider two alternative files, discussing their relative advantages and disadvantages. For surveys of phy-sician practices (or other organizations that employ physicians), there have been no files that are obvious choices to serve as the basis for a <b>sample</b> <b>frame.</b> Here we discuss data collection on physician practices from an analyti...|$|E

50|$|While offline content such as {{printed text}} remains static once produced, online content can {{frequently}} change. The dynamic nature of online material {{combined with the}} large and increasing volume of online content can make it challenging to construct a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> from which to draw a random sample. The content of a site may also differ across users, requiring careful specification of the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> Some researchers have used search engines to construct <b>sampling</b> <b>frames.</b> This technique has disadvantages because search engine results are unsystematic and non-random making them unreliable for obtaining an unbiased <b>sample.</b> The <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> issue can be circumvented by using an entire population of interest, such as tweets by particular Twitter users or online archived content of certain newspapers as the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> Changes to online material can make categorizing content (step 3) more challenging. Because online content can change frequently it is particularly important to note the time period over which the sample is collected.

30|$|Due to the {{urbanized}} and congested {{nature of}} the AMA, nine communities with the highest concentration of itinerant traders were purposively sampled for the study.

The snowballing technique was employed to generate a <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> of 842 itinerant traders in the nine communities. The <b>sample</b> <b>frame</b> of 842 itinerant traders {{was used as the}} sample size because quantitative approaches demand large sample sizes for rigorous statistical analysis (Fawcett & Arnold, 1987).
