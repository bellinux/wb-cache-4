5|$|In the divisional {{round of}} the playoffs, the Red Sox faced the Anaheim Angels in a best-of-five series. They won Game 1 largely thanks to a 7-run 4th inning, {{and went on to}} sweep the series. In the 7th inning of Game 3, with the Red Sox leading by 4, Vladimir Guerrero tied the game for the Angels with a grand slam. However, David Ortiz won the series with a game winning home run in the 10th. In the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox lost the first three games against the New York Yankees and were {{trailing}} in Game 4 when they began the 9th inning. Kevin Millar was walked by Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. Dave Roberts then came into the game to pinch run for Millar and stole second base. Mueller then singled to enable him to tie the game. Another game winning home run by Ortiz won the game for the Red Sox in the 12th inning. Ortiz' single in the 14th inning of Game 5 scored the winning run for the Red Sox, in what was the longest post-season game in baseball history. Despite having a dislocated ankle tendon, Schilling started Game 6 for the Red Sox. He pitched for seven innings, and allowed just one run, during which time his sock became soaked in blood. In the eighth inning, Yankees third baseman Rodriguez <b>slapped</b> <b>a</b> ball out of pitcher Arroyo's hand, allowing the Yankees to score a run. However, after a discussion the umpires called Rodriguez out for interference and canceled the run. Fans then threw debris onto the field in protest and the game was stopped for ten minutes. The Red Sox won the game and became the first baseball team to ever force a Game 7 after having been down 3 games to none. A 10â€“3 win in Game 7 brought the Red Sox to the World Series {{for the first time in}} 18 years.|$|E

25|$|Justin Keller {{scored the}} game-winning goal {{late in the}} third period to defeat Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) {{champion}} Gatineau Olympiques. Despite numerous chances on both ends of the ice through the first two periods of play, neither team could find the back of the net until the third. With six-and-a-half minutes gone in the third and Gatineau on the power-play, Jean-Michel Daoust <b>slapped</b> <b>a</b> pass to Guillaume Fournier, who tipped the puck past Rocketes goaltender Kelly Guard for his first of the tournament. Less than four minutes later, however, Kelowna tied the game after a rebound from a Brett Palin slap shot went straight to Randall Gelech, who chipped it in past Gatineau goaltender David Tremblay for his third of the tournament. Kelowna had a chance to take the lead just seconds later, but the shot hit the post.|$|E
25|$|A {{preliminary}} inquiry {{was held in}} 2003, the testimony from which was covered by a publication ban until 2010. At the inquiry, the fact that Pickton {{had been charged with}} attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of prostitute Wendy Lynn Eistetter in 1997 was revealed. Eistetter testified at the inquiry that after he had driven her to the Port Coquitlam farm and had sex with her, Pickton <b>slapped</b> <b>a</b> handcuff on her left hand and stabbed her in the abdomen. She stabbed Pickton in self defense. Later, both she and Pickton were treated at the same hospital, where staff used a key they found in Pickton's pocket to remove the handcuffs from the woman's wrist. The attempted-murder charge against Pickton was stayed on January 27, 1998, because the woman had drug addiction issues and prosecutors believed her too unstable for her testimony to help secure a conviction. The clothes and rubber boots Pickton had been wearing that evening were seized by police and left in an RCMP storage locker for more than seven years. Not until 2004 did lab testing show that the DNA of two missing women were on the items seized from Pickton in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey's {{interest}} in skiffle, the two began rehearsing {{songs in the}} manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: [...] "I played a guitar, and [...] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just <b>slapped</b> <b>a</b> biscuit tin with some keys, or banged {{on the backs of}} chairs." [...] The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as [...] "Rock Island Line" [...] and [...] "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.|$|E
500|$|On 26 April 2008, Winehouse was cautioned {{after she}} {{admitted}} to police she <b>slapped</b> <b>a</b> 38-year-old {{man in the}} face, a [...] "common assault" [...] offence, her first of two. She voluntarily turned herself in and was held overnight. Police said, at her arrival she was [...] "in no fit state" [...] to be interviewed. Ten days later, Winehouse was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs after a video of her apparently smoking crack cocaine was passed to the police in January, but was released on bail {{a few hours later}} because they could not confirm, from the video, what she was smoking. The Crown Prosecution Service considered charging her, but cleared her when it could not establish that the substance in the video was a controlled drug. Some members of Parliament reacted negatively. Two London residents were subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine and ecstasy to Winehouse. One of the pair was sentenced to two years in prison on 13 December 2008, while the other received a two-year community order.|$|E

2500|$|By all accounts, the Lightning's plunge to {{the bottom}} of the NHL was due to the way Kokusai Green ran the team.

Its scouting operation consisted of Tony Esposito and several satellite dishes. The Internal Revenue Service investigated the team in 1994 and 1995, and nearly <b>slapped</b> <b>a</b> lien on the team for $750,000 in back taxes.
