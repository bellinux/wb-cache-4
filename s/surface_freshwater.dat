5000|$|Jalisco's {{rivers and}} streams {{eventually}} empty into the Pacific Ocean and are divided into three groups: the Lerma/Santiago River and its tributaries, rivers that empty directly into the Pacific and rivers {{in the south of}} the state. [...] Jalisco has several river basins with the most notable being that of the Lerma/Santiago River, which drains the northern and northeastern parts of the state. The Lerma River enters extends from the State of Mexico and empties into Lake Chapala on the east side. On the west, water flows out in the Santiago River, which crosses the center of Jalisco {{on its way to the}} Pacific, carving deep canyons in the land. Tributaries to the Santiago River include the Zula, the Verde River, the Juchipila and the Bolaños. About three quarters of the state’s population lives near this river system. In the southwest of the state, there are a number of small rivers that empty directly into the Pacific Ocean. The most important of these is the Ameca, with its one main tributary, the Mascota River. This river forms the state’s border with Nayarit and empties into the Ipala Bay. The Tomatlán, San Nicolás, Purificación, Marabasco-Minatitlán, Ayuquila, Tuxcacuesco, Armería and Tuxpan rivers flow almost perpendicular to the Pacific Ocean and drain the coastal area. Another river of this group is the Cihuatlán River, which forms the boundary between Jalisco and Colima emptying into the Barra de Navidad Bay. [...] The southeastern corner belongs to the Balsas River basin. This includes the Ayuqila and Tuxcacuesco, which join to form the Armería and the Tuxpan.The other main surface water is Lake Chapala, and is the largest and most important freshwater lake in Mexico, accounting for about half of the country’s lake surface. The lake acts as a regulator of the flow of both the Lerma and Santiago Rivers. There are a number of seasonal and salty lakes linking to form the Zacoalco-Sayula land-locked system. There are other smaller lakes called Cajititlán, Sayula, San Marcos, and Atotonilco. Dams include the Cajón de Peña, Santa Rosa, La Vega, Tacotán and Las Piedras.

The {{goal of this}} paper is to estimate and examine <b>surface</b> <b>freshwater</b> flux at monthly scale exclusively from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) measurements over the tropical oceans for the period of 1998 - 2010. The monthly mean fields of TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed (WS), and total precipitable water (W) are used to estimate the surface evaporation utilizing the bulk aerodynamics parameterization formula. The merged TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) - 3 B 43 product is combined with the estimated evaporation to compute the <b>surface</b> <b>freshwater</b> flux. A preliminary comparison of the satellite derived evaporation, precipitation and freshwater flux has been carried out with the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes (HOAPS- 3) datasets.
