25|$|Freddy is a dream-demon who attacks {{his victims}} from within their dreams. He is {{commonly}} identified by his burned, disfigured face, red-and-green striped sweater, brown fedora, and trademark metal-clawed brown leather glove only {{on his right}} hand. This glove {{was the product of}} Krueger's own imagination, the blade having been welded by himself. Robert Englund has <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that he feels the character represents neglect, particularly that suffered by children. The character also more broadly represents subconscious fears.|$|E

That's been <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> {{and has always}} been true, for no other man has ever rivaled Batman as a {{champion}} of the law, nor matched his superb acrobatic skill, his scientific keenness, his mastery of disguise and detective skill! But now, in one suspenseful surprise after another, Batman finds he has a great rival in the mysterious and glamorous girl... The Batwoman!" ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in March, Winton {{organised}} eight trains, {{which in}} total transported 669 mainly Jewish children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia to Great Britain. A ninth and final train with 250 children on board was {{stopped at the}} last minute, due to {{the outbreak of the}} war. Only two children on this ninth aborted train survived the war. According to Channel 4 News reporting on the 2009 Winton Train, [...] "Sir Nicholas has <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that the vision that haunts him most is the families waiting at Liverpool Street for the train that never arrived".|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>said</b> so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> yesterday, {{and the day}} before, that I {{would never}} mind things again, if only Mamma would get well and come home," [...] said the little girl; [...] "and I never shall." ...|$|R
500|$|Bacon was {{introduced}} to Aeschylus through T. S. Eliot's 1939 play The Family Reunion, in which the protagonist Harry is haunted by [...] "the sleepless hunters / that will not let me sleep". In Eliot's play, the Furies serve as embodiments of the remorse and guilt felt by Harry, who harbours a dark family secret, shared only with his sister. Bacon was captivated by Aeschylus' play, and keen {{to learn more about}} Greek tragedy, although he <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that he regretted being unable to read the original in Greek. In 1942, he read the Irish scholar William Bedell Stanford's Aeschylus in his Style, and found the theme of obsessive guilt in The Oresteia to be highly resonant. In 1984, Bacon told Sylvester that although his painting's subject matter did not have a direct relationship with the poet's work, for him Eliot's work [...] "opened the valves of sensation".|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both clubs had become strained, {{not least because}} of Chelsea's financial advantage; the club was owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich. The day after Chelsea announced losses of £80million for 2005–06, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger expressed concern over his opponent's conduct: [...] "I have <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that all the clubs should be balanced with their natural resources. That means they can only spend what they earn." [...] Chelsea manager José Mourinho refused to respond to Wenger's comments in his UEFA Champions League pre-match press conference, but made reference to his record in the competition in contrast to his counterpart: [...] "Many great managers {{in the world have}} never won it. The big example is not far from us; Arsène Wenger is a top manager in the world. He's a big manager in the world of football and he never did it so when I did it once, I can thank God for that. I have that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 PwC India {{said they}} were {{disappointed}} with court judgement of the case saying, “As we have <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> {{there has never been}} any evidence presented that either of our former partners S Gopalakrishnan or Srinivas Talluri were involved in or were aware of the management-led fraud at Satyam. We understand that Gopal and Talluri are considering filing an appeal against this verdict." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will say}} again, as I have <b>said</b> before <b>many</b> <b>times</b> in these sittings, that I {{answered}} all questions {{of this sort}} before the court at Poitiers, and I would that you wold bring here the record of that court and read from that. Prithee, send for that book." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, thank goodness, he'll {{never be}} a soldier," [...] said Miss Cornelia. [...] "I never {{approved}} of our boys going to that South African fracas. But it's over, and not likely anything of the kind will ever happen again. I think the world is getting more sensible. As for the Merediths, I've <b>said</b> <b>many</b> a <b>time</b> and I say it again, if Mr. Meredith had a wife all would be well." ...|$|R
2500|$|So {{while the}} general public could easily {{perceive}} Jane Russell or Sophia Loren as [...] "Russ Meyer material", their balanced bodies did not mesh with Meyer's precise aesthetic preferences." [...] And indeed Meyer <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that it was Gina Lollobrigida's smaller breasted figure that he preferred visually over her larger breasted, taller and bigger hipped rival, Sophia Loren. Thus Meyer's oeuvre shows the viewer that while his actresses could easily be described as voluptuous, buxom and curvaceous, it's debatable to some if they were strapping, stately or even statuesque as Meyer readily proclaimed." ...|$|E
2500|$|People {{who heard}} Coady speak at these {{meetings}} described his speeches as [...] "fiery" [...] and [...] "energizing". Coady challenged his audience {{not to accept}} their poverty but {{to take action to}} understand their situation, and then to think and to plan to change it. As he <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> [...] "You can get the good life. [...] You’re poor enough to want it and smart enough to get it." [...] He would propose that they set up study clubs, and that those who could read help those who could not.|$|E
2500|$|Kumble relies more on accuracy, {{variations}} {{and bounce}} rather than spinning the ball. Sambit Bal, {{the editor of}} Cricinfo, wrote, [...] "That he [...] has been an unusual spinner has been <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> before. It has also been said, a trifle unfairly, {{that he is a}} unidimensional bowler. Palpably, he has lacked the turn of Warne and Murali, but his variety has been subtler, far more apparent to batsmen than to viewers. He has shown that not only turn and flight that can deceive the batsman but also the changes of length and pace. He has been a cultured practitioner of his unique craft and a master of nuances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't s'pose you've {{heard from}} Ed?" [...] Mrs. Smith shook her head. [...] "He'll turn up some day, when you ain't look-in' for 'm." [...] The good old soul had <b>said</b> that so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that poor Mrs. Smith derived no comfort from it any longer.|$|R
6000|$|... (1) What she <b>said</b> {{has been}} <b>many</b> <b>times</b> translated, but never with success. There is a {{haunting}} pathos about the original which eludes all efforts to convey it into our tongue. It is as subtle as an odor, and escapes in the transmission. Her words were these: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that was}} not learning," [...] said Mirah, her tearful face {{breaking}} into an amused smile. [...] "I <b>said</b> it so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> for a lesson.

2500|$|In Ariel Sharon's {{biography}} by his son, Gilad Sharon, {{the author}} {{referring to the}} Habib ceasefire, comments: [...] "However, the agreement was explicit only regarding preventing terror from Lebanon, which is why my father encouraged the cabinet not to accept the offer as presented by the Americans." [...] "The cease-fire, as both the PLO and the Americans saw it, did not include terror attacks stemming from Lebanon and carried out against Jews in Europe and other locales. In a meeting my father had with Alexander Haig and Philip Habib on May 25, 1982, Habib repeated what he had already <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> before: “Terrorist attacks against Israelis and Jews in Europe {{are not included in}} the cease-fire agreement.”" ...|$|E
2500|$|Li {{believes}} that Wushu is not primarily for self-defense {{and instead of}} trying to play the hero people should think about peaceful resolutions of conflicts and call the police if necessary: [...] "A gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second. Like I've <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> before, it is important to differentiate between movies and reality. The hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day, but in real life – probably that is not the case." [...] He has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a real life fight and he does not wish to, either.|$|E
2500|$|Russert, {{a devout}} Catholic, <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> {{he had made}} a promise to God to never miss Sunday Mass if his son were born healthy. In his writing and in his news reporting, Russert spoke openly and fondly of his Catholic school {{education}} and {{of the role of the}} Catholic Church in his life. He was an outspoken supporter of Catholic education on all levels. Russert said that his father, a sanitation worker who never finished high school, [...] "worked two jobs all his life so his four kids could go to Catholic school, and those schools changed my life." [...] He also spoke warmly of the Catholic nuns who taught him. [...] "Sister Mary Lucille founded a school newspaper and appointed me editor and changed my life," [...] he said. Teachers in Catholic schools [...] "taught me to read and write, but also how to tell right from wrong." ...|$|E

"It {{is a great}} pleasure," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "but <b>many</b> <b>times</b> I {{wonder why}} you Englishmen, so clever, so world-conquering, do not take the trouble to make yourselves with the {{languages}} of other nations familiar.

6000|$|Certain it is {{that the}} lad was alarmed, but he understood, from what his father had <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> that it was not wise to let the Indians know of his fear, and, {{continuing}} at the labor, he said, in a low tone, to Mark: ...|$|E

60|$|Although as I have <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> I {{had little}} {{knowledge}} of military matters, {{it appeared to}} me {{that as soon as}} it was learned the red-coats had crossed over to Gloucester our people would, by using the boats and vessels which were lying in the stream 'twixt York and Williamsburg, cross directly over to the other shore without coming down through the village, for thus they might circle around the advance of the retreating foe.|$|E
6000|$|On {{our return}} to the Casco we confessed to each other with what alarm and repugnance we touched the miserable girl. We talked long that evening of Father Damien, his sublime heroism, and his martyrdom which was already nearing its sad end. Beyond all noble qualities my husband placed courage. The more he saw of leprosy, and he saw much in the islands, the higher rose his admiration for the simple priest of Molokai. ‘I must see Molokai,’ he <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>times.</b> ‘I must somehow manage to see Molokai.’ ...|$|E
