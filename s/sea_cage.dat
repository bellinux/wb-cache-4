25|$|Farming of {{the species}} in New Zealand began in the 1970s, when {{hatcheries}} were initially set up to enhance and support wild fish stocks with the first commercial operations initiating in 1976. After some opposition against their establishment by societal groups, including anglers, the first <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> farm was established in 1983 at Big Glory Bay in Stewart Island by British Petroleum NZ Ltd.|$|E
500|$|Rainbow trout are commercially farmed in many {{countries}} throughout the world. The practice {{began in the late}} 19th century, and since the 1950s commercial production has grown dramatically. [...] Worldwide, in 2007, [...] of farmed rainbow trout were harvested with a value of about US $2.6billion. The largest producer is Chile. In Chile and Norway, <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> production of steelhead has expanded to supply export markets. Inland production of rainbow trout to supply domestic markets has increased in countries such as Italy, France, Germany, Denmark and Spain. Other significant trout-producing countries include the U.S., Iran, the United Kingdom, and Lesotho. While the U.S. rainbow trout industry as a whole is viewed as ecologically responsible, trout raised elsewhere are not necessarily farmed with the same methods.|$|E
2500|$|Sea cages, {{also called}} sea pens or net pens, are usually made of mesh framed with steel or plastic. They can be square or circular, [...] across and [...] deep, with volumes between [...] A large <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> can house up to 90,000 fish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>cages</b> {{can attract}} {{a variety of}} wild predators which can {{sometimes}} become entangled in associated netting leading to injury or death. In Tasmania, Australia salmon farming <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> have entangled white-bellied sea eagles. This has prompted one company, Huon Aquaculture to sponsor a bird rehabilitation centre and trial more robust netting.|$|R
50|$|The most {{promising}} technique for aquaculture in New Zealand is <b>sea</b> <b>cages.</b> These {{have been successfully}} used internationally to grow similar species. In Vietnam <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> are used to grow large amounts of Panulirus ornatus (ornate spiny lobster) in excess of 1,500 t valued at US$90 million. This species is also commercially cultured in Indonesia and the Philippines.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to pearl aquaculture, a pilot <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> finfish farm was licensed in 2004, although [...] the license {{had not been}} exercised. Interest has also been expressed {{in the culture of}} live rock and coral for the aquarium industry. The Department of Fisheries has identified a number of species as having potential for aquaculture in the Abrolhos, including the Shark Bay pearl oyster (Pinctada albina), the maxima clam (Tridacna maxima), rock oysters (Saccostrea sp.), the saucer scallop (Amusium balloti), the western rock lobster, and a number of species of finfish, most of which are filter feeders.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{the salmon}} are hatched in {{land-based}} hatcheries (several [...] of which exist) {{and transferred to}} sea cages or freshwater farms, where they are grown out to harvestable size of [...] The broodstock for the farms is usually selected from existing farm stock or sometimes sourced from wild populations. Eggs and milt are stripped manually from sexually mature salmon and incubated under conditions (around [...] ), replicating the streams and rivers where the salmon would spawn naturally. After hatching, the baby salmon are typically grown to smolt stage (around six-months of age) before they are transferred to the sea cages or ponds. Most <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> farming occurs in the Marlborough Sounds, Stewart Island, and Akaroa Harbour, while freshwater operations in Canterbury, Otago, and Tasman use ponds, raceways, and hydrocanals for growout operations.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{commonly}} used arrangements of gravity <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> in deep <b>sea</b> farming, 5 composite type working models {{are designed with}} modelbased testing by which the forces acting on the mooring line are measured under pure current, pure wave and the combination of both. Meanwhile, the forces acting on the normal mooring line are also analyzed. Based on the test data, a conclusion is made about {{the characteristics of the}} mooring line force. In the end, some feasible suggestions are given, which should be adopted for arrangement of <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> in real farming...|$|R

25|$|Atlantic salmon is, by far, {{the species}} most often chosen for farming. It {{is easy to}} handle, it grows well in <b>sea</b> <b>cages,</b> {{commands}} a high market value and it adapts well to being farmed away from its native habitats.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, farmers first {{successfully}} spawned breeding fish. However, they {{were hard to}} obtain and produced unreliable egg viability. In 1980, the first spontaneous spawning happened in <b>sea</b> <b>cages.</b> These eggs {{were found to be}} sufficient to generate a constant supply for farms.|$|R
50|$|The farming of Argyrosomus regius {{is still}} rather {{experimental}} and involves intensive production, in land-based tanks and <b>sea</b> <b>cages.</b> There are few facilities established mainly in southern France {{where they are}} in the Camargue, Cannes, and Corsica, and at La Spezia and Ortobello in Italy.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} marine abalone systems include <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> {{technology}} {{and a special}} converted grow out vessel. Broodstock is sourced from the wild and juvenile abalone grown in hatchery complexes. The stock is then transferred to special sea cages with unique grow out plates and the stock is managed and harvested on a continuous basis by groups of commercial divers. Operations are performed round the clock, seven days a week.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>cage</b> {{aquaculture}} {{is responsible}} for nutrient enrichment of the waters {{in which they are}} established. This results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs. Elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth, including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish. Flushing times, current speeds, distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|The {{sites for}} lobster farms {{should be in}} shallow water (not {{exceeding}} 20 m) and sheltered from currents and swell as well as potential strong winds. Often behind islands and in sheltered bays are the best sites as the sea cages are easily damaged by swell and high winds. Also the type of <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> affects the site, floating and submerged cages can be in deeper water, and wooden fixed cages {{have to be in}} water only a few metres deep.|$|E
40|$|Positioning of <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> {{at sites}} with high water current {{velocities}} expose {{the fish to}} a largely unknown environmental challenge. In this study we observed the swimming behaviour of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at a commercial farm with tidal currents altering between low, moderate and high velocities. At high current velocities the salmon switched from the traditional circular polarized group structure, seen at low and moderate current velocities, to a group structure where all fish kept stations at fixed positions swimming against the current. This type of group behaviour has not been described in <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> previously. The structural changes {{could be explained by}} a preferred swimming speed of salmon spatially restricted in a cage in combination with a behavioural plasticity of the fish...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to do a {{preliminary}} seasonal screening of ecotoxicological biomarkers in European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax in three different fish farms, {{to know if the}} different location and typology can discriminate them. A set of selected biomarkers of xenobiotic exposure, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, Glutathione (GSH) and gonad morphology were investigated seasonally in male European sea bass D. labrax (L.) reared in three different intensive farms: a land-based farm of cement tanks (T), an in-shore <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> farm (C 1) and an off-shore <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> farm (C 2). The results showed that both location and typology can discriminate AChE activity, GSH content and gonad morphology. Further investigation is needed to propose these biomarkers in the protocol of fish farm quality control...|$|R
50|$|Aquacultural {{engineering}} is a multidisciplinary field of engineering {{that aims to}} solve technical problems associated with farming aquatic vertebrates, invertebrates, and algae. Common aquaculture systems requiring optimization and engineering include <b>sea</b> <b>cages,</b> ponds, and recirculating systems.

50|$|In both onshore and {{offshore}} facilities Cod require daily maintenance. In the onshore facility an estimated team of 4 or 5 laborers {{are required for}} daily tasks, which include: feeding plank-tonic animals, regulating tank temperatures, monitoring health of fish (removing any sick fish), and general maintenance to the water facilities.2 One must also consider labor for transport, which would include a truck driver, a machine operator (fork lift/crane for moving fish) and a team operating a sea barge (is located far enough off shore). Transport and <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> crew included would be an estimated 10 people {{depending on the size}} of the operation.|$|E

50|$|The major {{industry}} is farming - cereal crops, sheep, and cattle in the drier north and more water-intensive {{activities such as}} dairy farming and a growing wine industry in the south. Many coastal towns have commercial fishing fleets, the largest being located at Port Lincoln. The town has previously harbored a large tuna-fishing fleet, which is gradually transforming its practice to fish farming {{with the growth of}} <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> aquaculture. Oyster farming was established in the 1980s and occurs in several sheltered bays including Franklin Harbour (near Cowell in Spencer Gulf) and Smoky Bay off the west coast.|$|E
50|$|Tassal has six marine regions, {{where the}} {{standard}} pen has {{a volume of}} 11,600 cubic meters and holds enough salmon to produce 120 tonnes once harvested.

40|$|A {{relatively}} new and highly valuable aquaculture industry focuses on three species of bluefin tunas, which are captured {{from the wild}} and fattened for several months in <b>sea</b> <b>cages.</b> In teleost aquaculture, mortalities and extra production costs are very commonly associated with metazoan ectoparasites. In tuna, however, the production value lost due to diseases associated with ectoparasites is unknown. We collected epidemiological data on burdens of metazoans on the gills of farmed southern bluefin, Thunnus maccoyii, {{in a series of}} monthly samples of tuna from the time of stocking through to harvest (March to August, 2004; N= 210) in five <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> on a farm off Port Lincoln, Australia. Three species were recorded; for one (a copepod, Pseudocycnus appendiculatus), there was a gradual, significant increase in both abundance (from a mean of 0. 1 in March, to 3. 83 in August) and prevalence (from 10...|$|R

50|$|Oceanic Victor {{intends to}} use {{existing}} infrastructure on Granite Island to service tourists, {{who will be}} transported by boat to a pilot aquaculture lease adjacent to the island. The attraction will be a single modified tuna seacage moored to the seabed, which was purchased from Swim with Tuna in 2015. Visitors will {{be given the opportunity}} to swim with and feed southern bluefin tuna, and observe other species via an underwater viewing deck and two touch-tank aquaria. The <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> will contain up to five tonnes of southern bluefin tuna, and up to 0.5 tonnes combined of other species native to South Australian waters. Tuna will be fed with South Australian caught pilchards.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment is transferring the affected fish to a freshwater bath {{for a period of}} 2 to 3 hours. This is achieved by towing the sea cages into fresh water, or pumping the fish from the <b>sea</b> <b>cage</b> to a tarp filled with fresh water. Mortality rates have been lowered by adding Levamisole to the water until the saturation is above 10ppm. Due to the difficulty and expense of treatment, the productivity of salmon aquaculture is limited by access to a source of fresh water. Chloramine and chlorine dioxide have also been used. Other potential in-feed treatments such as immunosupportive-based feeds, mucolytic compounds such as L-cysteine ethyl ester and the parasticide bithionol have been tested with some success although not developed for commercial use.|$|E

40|$|A {{semantic}} {{model for}} overall welfare assessment of Atlantic salmon reared in <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> is presented. The model, called SWIM 1. 0, {{is designed to}} enable fish farmers to make a formal and standardized assessment of fish welfare using a set of selected welfare indicators. In order to cover all welfare relevant aspects from the animals’ {{point of view and}} to create a science-based tool we first identified the known welfare needs of Atlantic salmon in <b>sea</b> <b>cages</b> and searched the literature for feasible welfare indicators. The framework of semantic modelling was used to perform a structured literature review and an evaluation of each indicator. The selected indicators were water temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation, water current, stocking density, lighting, disturbance, daily mortality rate, appetite, sea lice infestation ratio, condition factor, emaciation state, vertebral deformation, maturation stage, smoltification state, fin condition and skin condition. Selection criteria for the indicators were that they should be practical and measureable on the farm, that each indicator could be divided into levels from good to poor welfare backed up by relevant scientific literature. To estimate each indicator’s relative impact on welfare, all the indicators were weighted based on their respective literature reviews and according to weighting factors defined as part of the semantic modelling framework. This was ultimately amalgamated into an overall model that calculates welfare indexes for salmon in <b>sea</b> <b>cages.</b> More importantly, the model identifies how each indicator contributes (negatively and positively) to the overall index and hence which welfare needs are compromised or fulfilled...|$|R
