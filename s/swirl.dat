30|$|The {{semicircle}} groove on {{the tube}} surface can produce the <b>swirling</b> flow through the test section. The <b>swirling</b> flow can separate into two types: main and secondary <b>swirling</b> flows. The main <b>swirling</b> flow is found in all DRs, while the secondary <b>swirling</b> flow is detected at DR[*]≥[*] 0.06. The <b>swirling</b> flow disturbs the thermal boundary layer near the tube wall that is reason for heat transfer augmentation. The intensity or strength of the <b>swirling</b> flow depended on DR and PR of the groove. The increasing DR and reducing PR lead to augmenting strength of the flow that helps to increase heat transfer rate in the test section.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A <b>swirl</b> of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{phenomenon}} of vapor blockage (vapor lock) on LPG hose {{is one of}} major causes of fires and explosions on the gas stove system. Vapor blockage {{is very easy to}} occur during the liquid phase of the LPG flow along the hose. One way to prevent the liquid phase flow of LPG to the hose of the gas stove is by adding a <b>swirling</b> nozzle on the regulator. Different from other type of nozzles, a <b>swirling</b> nozzle has a <b>swirling</b> chamber in it which can generate a vortex effect, so that the atomization process is better. This study is focused to experimentally investigate the <b>swirling</b> chamber volume relationship with the LPG mass flow rate, discharge coefficient (CD), flow coefficient (KD), Reynolds Number and the <b>swirling</b> flow number. Results of experiments showed that the volume of the <b>swirling</b> chamber in <b>swirling</b> nozzle gives effects on the LPG mass flow rate through the <b>swirling</b> nozzle. It can be confirmed that the larger of <b>swirling</b> chamber volume, the greater the mass flow rate through the <b>swirling</b> nozzle. The increase of mass flow rate causes the discharge coefficient (CD), flow coefficient (KD), the Reynolds number and flow number also increase.

30|$|In {{order to}} apply a <b>swirling</b> jet to a PDC drill bit, the nozzle {{performance}} influenced by nozzle inlet geometric parameters and rock breaking tests under submerged conditions were studied. Numerical simulation was used to study {{the influence of the}} nozzle structure on the <b>swirling</b> intensity and nozzle discharge coefficient. Simulation results indicate that spreading angle of the <b>swirling</b> jet is greater than that of the non-swirling jet, and the <b>swirling</b> intensity of the jet is strongly influenced by the length of the nozzle body but weakly by the number of tangential inlets. Rock breaking tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the <b>swirling</b> jet. It is found that the <b>swirling</b> jet shows a lower threshold pressure to break the rock samples and could break rock more efficiently compared with the non-swirling jet.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (<b>swirl</b> chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E

5|$|After {{a rather}} lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven-E, a {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Eight-E on August 21.

Fausto steadily strengthened and intensified into a hurricane on August 22. It continued to intensify, peaking as a Category4 on August 24, and also substantially increased in size. The hurricane began to weaken thereafter, and was a minimal tropical storm by the time it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on August 27. The tropical cyclone dropped to a depression and degenerated into a non-convective <b>swirl</b> of clouds on August 28.|$|E

5|$|Charley {{originated}} {{with a large}} <b>swirl</b> of clouds which parted off of {{the west coast of}} Africa on August 9. Lacking deep convection or a well defined center, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, satellite images indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation center was present. The following morning, a second flight reported that a center had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression. Initially, the center was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.|$|E
40|$|Confined {{turbulent}} <b>swirling</b> flows play {{an important}} role for industrial problems. Their prediction requires satisfactory turbulence models. In this work, we examined five turbulence models, the renormalization group #kappa#-#epsilon# model, for the non-linear #kappa#-#epsilon# model, the algebraic Reynolds stress model, the differential Reynolds stress model as well as the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model. To investigate their behaviour of prediction of confined turbulent <b>swirling</b> flows, the <b>swirling</b> straight pipe flow, <b>swirling</b> diffuser flow, <b>swirling</b> flow in a curved pipe and vortex throttle flow were calculated and the calculated results were compared with the measured data. From these investigations, we find that the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model can make satisfactory prediction to the <b>swirling</b> diffuser flow. But to other flows, the behaviour of the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model is poor. Basically, the renormalization group #kappa#-#epsilon# model and algebraic Reynolds stress model have similar properties as the standard #kappa#-#epsilon# model. The differential Reynolds stress model that is used in this work and the non-linear #kappa#-#epsilon# model clearly improve the prediction of the turbulent <b>swirling</b> flows compared with the other turbulence models, and so they are recommended more suitably to predict the turbulent <b>swirling</b> flows. It is also important to develop numerical algorithms for calculation of turbulent <b>swirling</b> flows that guarantee the stability and convergence of the numerical solutions, because the complicated turbulence models, such as, the non-linear #kappa#-#epsilon# model, algebraic Reynolds stress model and differential Reynolds stress model often destabilize the numerical algorithm to calculate complex flows. In order to guarantee availability of the correct solutions of the turbulent <b>swirling</b> flows, we implemented the Uzawa method and SIMPLE-type algorithm for steady flow problem and the projection-like method for unsteady flow problem.
