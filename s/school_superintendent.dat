5|$|In 1872, Phebe Sudlow was {{appointed}} principal of Davenport High School. She {{was the first}} female principal in the United States.

5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to detonate dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the <b>school</b> <b>superintendent,</b> and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the educational and}} professional backgrounds, opinions, practices, and working conditions of Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> {{with respect to their}} districts' reading programs. The questions investigated for this study were: (1) What are the educational, professional and reading backgrounds of Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents?</b> (2) What professional organizations and publications appear to be most influential for Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents?</b> (3) What are the expressed important tasks of Arizona superintendents? (4) Who advises Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> about reading matters? (5) What criteria do Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> use to select advisors in the area of reading? (6) What methods do Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> use to evaluate their reading programs? (7) What are the opinions of Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> regarding the effectiveness of their district reading programs? (8) What solutions to the reading problems of their districts do Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> propose? (9) What negative factors do Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> believe influence their districts' reading programs? A stratified, randomized sample of (36) Arizona <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> was selected to participate in the study. Twenty-nine superintendents actually participated. Superintendents tended to hold advanced degrees, and a majority of them had earned doctorates. Their advanced degrees were usually in education administration, while their undergraduate degrees were very diverse. They tended to have few if any hours in reading courses. They did not read journals devoted to reading, nor did they attend reading conferences. Their reading advisors did not tend to be reading specialists, although superintendents stated that they valued "reading knowledge" and "reading experience" in their advisors. The solutions to superintendents' reading program difficulties tended to be external solutions, rather than solutions which could be implemented by themselves. A variety of other findings are reported in the study...|$|R
40|$|The {{underlying}} theoretical {{argument in}} this article views munici- pal <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> in the Nordic context as middle man- agers in organizational theory terminology. Empirical support for this discussion emerges from national data collected among Norwegian <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> in 2009. Findings show that the actual work and leadership functions of Norwegian <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> match theoretical properties of middle managers fairly well. Findings also suggest <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> actively mediate tensions embedded in the current Norwegian educational policy stream. Specifically, central aims derived from account- ability discourse are filtered out and translated into traditional school-development and pedagogical-leadership discourse at the local managerial level...|$|R

5|$|Davenport {{public schools}} serve nearly 17,000 {{students}} in the communities of Davenport, Blue Grass, Buffalo, and Walcott. The Davenport Community School District is the second-largest school district in Iowa. Davenport has four public high schools: Central, West, Mid City and North and one private high school: Assumption. There are six public intermediate schools and 23 public elementary schools. Sudlow, one of the intermediate schools, was named after Phebe Sudlow, the first female public <b>school</b> <b>superintendent</b> in the United States. She was superintendent for Davenport schools from 1874 to 1878. The high schools {{are part of the}} Mississippi Athletic Conference for sports. The city has four colleges and universities: Palmer Chiropractic College, which is the first chiropractic school and the location of the first chiropractic adjustment in the world, Saint Ambrose University, Kaplan University, and Hamilton Technical College. Marycrest International University was a university in Davenport from 1939 to 2002, when it closed and became senior citizen housing.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the <b>school</b> <b>superintendent,</b> who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to (1) {{determine}} the level of satisfaction that Nebraska <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> found in their work, (2) report the area of work in which Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> found the least and most satisfaction, and (3) determine the effect of five specific factors (age, experience, school size, salary, and degree attainment) upon the job satisfaction reported by the superintendents. ^ A total of 109 of the 125 Nebraska <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> contacted responded to the survey which requested demographic information and included the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ). The responses on the MSQ were compiled and analyzed, and the constructs of the MSQ were ranked high to low. A multiple regression procedure was used to predict the effect of five factors upon job satisfaction and to predict the relationship between the constructs of the MSQ and the five factors studied. ^ The findings of the study revealed that the general satisfaction scores of the Nebraska <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> were comparable to the average scores of the norm groups established for the MSQ. The analysis of the 20 constructs of the MSQ indicated that Nebraska <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> found the least satisfaction in the opportunity for advancement, the ability of their board to make good decisions, and the lack of recognition they received from their board for a job well done. The areas in which Nebraska <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> found the most satisfaction were in their ability to be of service to others, the opportunity to be able to do things that did not go against their conscience, and the ability to do things on their own. ^ With the exception of salary, the results of the multiple regression procedure indicated there was little support that any of the factors researched in the study had a major influence upon the job satisfaction of Nebraska <b>school</b> <b>superintendents.</b> Although a statistical difference existed between the salary of Nebraska <b>school</b> <b>superintendents</b> and the general satisfaction score on the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, little practical significance was established. ...|$|R
