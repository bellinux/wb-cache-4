There is strong evidence to describe the ISM as comprising well defined cold, warm and hot regions, which are statistically close to thermal and total pressure equilibrium. This result is not sensitive to the choice of parameters considered here. The distribution of the gas density within each can be robustly modelled as lognormal. Appropriate distinction is required between the properties of the gases in the supernova active mid-plane and the more homogeneous phases outside this region.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} numerical framework utilizing multi-element unstructured CFD and rigorous real fluid property routines {{has been}} developed to carry out analyses of propellant tank and delivery systems at NASA SSC. Traditionally CFD modeling of pressurization and mixing in cryogenic tanks has been difficult primarily because the fluids in the tank co-exist in different sub-critical and supercritical states with largely varying properties {{that have to be}} accurately accounted for in order to predict the correct mixing and phase change between the ullage and the propellant. For example, during tank pressurization under some circumstances, rapid mixing of relatively warm pressurant gas with cryogenic propellant can lead to rapid densification of the gas and loss of pressure in the tank. This phenomenon can cause serious problems during testing because of the resulting decrease in propellant flow rate. With proper physical models implemented, CFD can model the coupling between the propellant and pressurant including heat transfer and phase change effects and accurately capture the complex physics in the evolving flowfields. This holds the promise of allowing the specification of operational conditions and procedures that could minimize the undesirable mixing and heat transfer inherent in propellant tank operation. In our modeling framework, we incorporated two different approaches to real fluids modeling: (a) the first approach is based on the HBMS model developed by Hirschfelder, Beuler, McGee and Sutton and (b) the second approach is based on a cubic equation of state developed by Soave, Redlich and Kwong (SRK).

This unique combination of electrical conduction, catalytic activity and long-term material stability makes this material a promising candidate for solid oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) and solid oxide reversible fuel cell (SORFC) applications. Powder of BZF 10 was synthesized via solid-state reaction and characterized using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD); results indicated {{the presence of a}} primary cubic perovskite phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated stable grain structure and well-defined grain boundaries within the pellet. Electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) was carried out on the sintered pellet at 600 - 800 ?C under various oxygen partial pressures (pO 2). ECR indicated that both chemical diffusion coefficient DV and surface kinetic parameter k? increased with pO 2. The oxygen permeation flux through BZF 10 membrane at 900 ?C was 0. 102 mL/(min?cm^ 2) with air/Ar gradient. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and effluent gasses analysis were carried out at 600 - 800 ?C under a wide range of gas environments. Under dry O 2 conditions, this material displayed p-type semi-conduction behavior; upon exposure to dry CO 2 atmosphere, the material showed catalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction to CO and O 2; exposure to moisture inert suggested only mild interaction with steam; under moist CO environment, a complex conduction mechanism was displayed alongside significant rates of water-gas-shift reaction; exposure to humidified H 2 resulted in increase in conductivity with H 2 partial pressure indicating n-type semi-conduction.

We also find a decrease of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) relative abundance with respect to big grains, as well as an increase of the near-infrared (NIR) continuum. These three results (i. e., warmer temperature, decrease of PAH abundance, and increase of the NIR continuum) are found consistently for all regimes of ionized gas. On the contrary, the molecular phase appears to provide favorable conditions for the survival of PAHs. Furthermore, the very small grain relative abundance tends to increase in the ionized phase, especially in bright H II regions.

We focus particularly on the regions of enhanced X-ray brightness associated with the inner radio lobes, which are known not to be described very well by single-temperature spectral models. Compared to a simple two-temperature fit, we obtain a better and more physical description of the spectra using a model that involves a continuous range of temperatures in each spatial bin. The range of temperatures of the multiphase <b>gas</b> <b>spans</b> ~ 0. 6 - 3. 2 keV. Such a multiphase structure is only possible if thermal conduction is suppressed by magnetic fields. In the multi-temperature regions, we find a correlation {{between the amount of}} gas cooler than the surrounding X-ray plasma and the metallicity, and conclude that the cool gas is more metal-rich than the ambient halo. We estimate the average Fe abundance of the cool gas to ~ 2. 2 solar. Our results thus point toward the key role of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in transporting heavy elements into the intracluster medium. The abundance ratios of O/Si/S/Fe in and outside the X-ray arms are similar, indicating that the dominant fraction of metals in the gas halo was uplifted by AGN outbursts relatively recently compared to the age of M 87. Our estimate for the mass of the cool gas is 5 e 8 M_sun, which probably stems from a mixture of ICM, stellar mass loss, and Type Ia supernova products. ~ 30 - 110 Myr are required to produce the observed metals in the cool gas.

40|$|Accretion discs are {{staples of}} astrophysics. Tapping into the {{gravitational}} potential {{energy of the}} accreting material, these discs are highly efficient machines that produce copious radiation and extreme outflows. While interesting in their own right, accretion discs also act as tools to study black holes and directly influence {{the properties of the}} Universe. Black hole X-ray binaries are fantastic natural laboratories for studying accretion disc physics and black hole phenomena. Among many of the curious behaviors exhibited by these systems are black hole state transitions [...] complicated cycles of dramatic brightening and dimming. Using X-ray observations with high temporal cadence, we show that the evolution of the accretion disc spectrum during black hole state transitions can be described by a variable disc atmospheric structure without invoking a radially truncated disc geometry. The accretion disc spectrum can be a powerful diagnostic for measuring black hole spin if the effects of the disc atmosphere on the emergent spectrum are well-understood; however, properties of the disc atmosphere are largely unconstrained. Using statistical methods, we decompose this black hole spin measurement technique and show that modest uncertainties regarding the disc atmosphere can lead to erroneous spin measurements. The vertical structure of the disc is difficult to constrain due to our ignorance of the contribution to hydrostatic balance by magnetic fields, which are fundamental to the accretion process. Observations of black hole X-ray binaries and the accretion environments near supermassive black holes provide mounting evidence for strong magnetization. Performing numerical simulations of accretion discs in the shearing box approximation, we impose a net vertical magnetic flux that allows us to effectively control the level of disc magnetization. We study how dynamo activity and the properties of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability depend on the magnetized state of the <b>gas,</b> <b>spanning</b> weak-to-strong disc magnetization regimes.

Spectra of ∼ 150 early-type {{stars in}} the disk of the Milky Way {{recorded}} by FUSE reveal absorption features from interstellar O VI, a tracer of collisionally ionized gases at temperatures near 300, 000 K. (Hotter material is better sensed by its diffuse x-ray emission.) The FUSE survey indicates that hot gas in {{the plane of the}} Galaxy yields an average density n(O VI) = 1. 7 × 10 − 8 cm − 3, a value consistent with earlier results from the Copernicus satellite, but at great distances there is a large dispersion in the measurements from one line of sight to another. This dispersion indicates that O VI absorbing regions probably have a broad distribution of sizes, perhaps giving a power-law behavior for column densities. Comparisons of O VI with other Li-like ions should give some guidance on the nature and origin of the O VI-absorbing regions, but poor correspondences in the velocity profile shapes will complicate the interpretations. 1 Principal Ways to Detect Hot Gas An important achievement of space astronomy has been the discovery of a hot phase of the interstellar medium, confirming an early prediction by Spitzer [1] that this phase may be pervasive – a conclusion based on the need to explain the confinement of cool clouds in the Galactic halo. We now know that highly ionized <b>gases</b> <b>spanning</b> the temperature range from 10 5 to 10 7 K are indeed an important constituent of the ISM, in both the plane and halo of the Galaxy. There are three fundamental ways to detect this hot gas: 1. Absorption by highly ionized atoms in the UV spectra of background sources (stars for Galactic disk gas, quasars or AGN for the Galactic halo or IGM) 2. Emision of soft x-rays over broad energy bands, with the radiation coming from collisionally excited levels, free-free emission, or recombination 3. Emission of discrete UV lines from collisionally excited levels Most of the findings on the hot phase have come from the phenomena 1 and 2 above; item 3 in this list is technically difficult to observe, and so far the results have been rather primitive and limited in scope...|$|R
40|$|RESISTANCE TRAINING PROGRAMS {{have been}} {{developed}} {{with the aim of}} improving variables of muscle function such as strength, power, speed, local muscular endurance, coordination, and flexibility (21). Resistance training is now considered an important part of training and rehabilitation programs for healthy subjects and for various types of patients, such as cardiac patients (45), patients with pulmonary diseases (10), patients undergoing prolonged bed-rest periods (2), or elderly subjects (28). In these populations, the combination of resistance training with the more conventional endurance exercise improves the patients’ outcomes and quality of life (45). An increase in the cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle fibers and a shift of fiber-type distribution toward type 2 fibers are typical adaptations induced by resistance training; these adaptations enhance the muscle force-generating potential (12) but could represent an impairment to skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. On the other hand, muscles with higher maximal force would need to recruit a lower number of motor units, and therefore more oxidative (and more efficient) muscle fibers (20, 26). According to other authors, strength training may increase skeletal muscle efficiency (4) and enhance skeletal muscle “metabolic stability” (50). Other studies reported, after resistance training, unchanged values of maximal O 2 uptake (V˙ O 2) (6), as well as unchanged (19) or lower (42, 43) mitochondrial volume density, oxidative enzyme activity, and capillary density in the hypertrophic muscles. Thus the specific effects of resistance training, with the related changes in muscle phenotype, on oxidative metabolism appear difficult to reconcile in a unifying scenario. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether increases in muscle mass induced by chronic resistance training are associated, in humans, with alterations in skeletal muscle oxidative function and aerobic performance. Experiments were carried out on a group of resistance-trained athletes (RTA), in whom muscle adaptations to resistance exercise are expected to be particularly marked. An integrative approach was applied by analyzing oxidative metabolism at different levels, <b>spanning</b> from pulmonary <b>gas</b> exchange to skeletal muscle function and mitochondrial respiration. Oxidative function was assessed in vivo during incremental cycle ergometer (CE) exercise and dynamic knee extension (KE) exercise with one leg (3). During KE, the recruitment of a relatively small muscle mass, i. e., the quadriceps femoris of one leg, significantly reduces constraints to oxidative function deriving from cardiovascular O 2 delivery, thereby allowing a more direct assessment of quadriceps muscle oxidative capacity in vivo. The intrinsic properties of mitochondria were assessed ex vivo in permeabilized muscle fibers obtained by biopsy by high-resolution respirometry (36). We hypothesized, in RTA vs. control subjects (CTRL), an impaired skeletal muscle oxidative function in vivo and an impaired mitochondrial respiratory function ex vivo...|$|R
