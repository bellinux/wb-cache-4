5|$|During 1947 Katsura {{caught the}} eye of American {{serviceman}} Vernon Greenleaf (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps {{who had been in the}} armed services for 22 years. Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> billiard exhibitions. Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her. They were married on November 30, 1950, but never had any children.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's backup singers Donna De Lory and Niki Haris {{were called}} in to provide harmonies on [...] "Survival". She commented, [...] "The minute you walked in , <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> you the lyric sheet. That was the atmosphere—we're not here to just hang out.

500|$|As {{the series}} ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the {{pregnancy}} of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully {{giving birth to}} an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as [...] "the {{best thing that ever}} happened to the series" [...] as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. The writers decided to close the X-Files at the end of the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson's pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing". Anderson was not featured at all in the episode [...] "3", as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> birth to her daughter at the time.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, Clear also {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} in Final Destination 2. Robert Koehler of Variety said that Larter was cast little light; while Putman of TheMovieBoy.com admired that Larter accurately plays Clear as an emotionally worn-down {{young woman who}} may still be alive, but realizes {{that it is only}} a matter of time before fate has its way with her. Nevertheless, Putman found her performance short. David Grove of Film Threat stated that she spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting; and criticized her and A. J. Cook as [...] "dumb blonde leads" [...] as well. Despite this, Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews was favorable to Larter's performance, saying <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> the smart-ass edge her character needs. Gallman of Oh, The Horror! claimed that Larter is again the bright spot; whereas Andrew Manning of Radio Free Entertainment positively acknowledged her, declaring that Larter rules the movie. Manning argued that while everyone else is merely a hastily assembled caricature without depth, Clear has a well-defined background and history with recognition to her appearance in the first film. He further affirmed that Final Destination fans will see Clear as the heroic franchise veteran.|$|E
500|$|Clemens {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Gabrilowitsch in 1899 in Vienna by Theodor Leschetizky who was also training Gabrilowitsch. At noon on October 6, 1909, she subsequently married Gabrilowitsch {{in the drawing room}} at Stormfield, the Clemens home with Rev. Dr. Joseph H. Twitchell presiding. (Twitchell was a great friend of her father.) Her father said that the engagement was not new, having been [...] "made and dissolved twice six years ago." [...] He also said that the marriage was sudden because Gabrilowitsch had just recovered from a surgical operation he had undergone in the summer and they were about to head off to their new house in Berlin where he would begin his European season. Her sister, Jean Clemens, drowned in the bathtub on December 24, 1909 after having an epileptic seizure. On April 21, 1910, her father died and left his entire estate to her in a will dated August 17, 1909 which provided for quarterly payments of interest to keep it [...] "free from any control or interference from any husband she may have." [...] On July 9, she announced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> practically the entire library of her father, comprising nearly 2,500 books, to the Mark Twain Free Library. On August 19, 1910, her only child was born in Connecticut at Stormfield.|$|E

2500|$|The Lynns {{were married}} for almost fifty years until Doolittle {{died at age}} 69 in 1996. The couple had six children, and the {{marriage}} was reportedly rocky. In her 2002 autobiography Still Woman Enough and {{in an interview with}} CBS News the same year, she recounted how her husband cheated on her regularly and once left her while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> birth. She and her husband fought frequently, but she said that [...] "he never hit me one time that I didn't hit him back twice".

[...] It was becoming obvious that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> direction to the other students, though unofficially, [...] as neither Muche, the form master nor Helene Börner, the crafts master, could really teach and promote the students in technical aspects.

2500|$|The {{story of}} Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya became popular after [...] Pravda {{published}} an article written by Pyotr Lidov on January 27, 1942. The journalist had heard about Zoya's execution from an elderly peasant, and {{was impressed by the}} young woman's courage. The witness recounted: [...] "They were hanging her and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> a speech. They were hanging her and she was threatening them." [...] Lidov travelled to Petrishchevo, collected details from local residents and {{published an article}} about the then-unknown partisan girl. Soon after, Joseph Stalin noticed the article. He proclaimed: [...] "Here is the people's heroine", which started a propaganda campaign honouring Kosmodemyanskaya. In February, she was identified and was awarded the order of Hero of the Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|After the war, {{the fight}} for {{abortion}} rights was renewed and Browne {{came back to her}} fight for the education of women in matters of sex. Her endeavors on this front afforded her the rank of first Patron and later Vice-President of the Society for Sex Education and Guidance, a group set up in 1943. [...] She continued to be involved with the ALRA until her death, however she was unable to attend most of their meetings due to failing health. [...] During this time, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> suggestions for actions that the ALRA could perform and these were continually followed. [...] Browne’s opinions on sexual reform were clearly still valued despite her increasing age and inability to be as involved as she once was. Browne was able to see the time come when medical terminations of pregnancy became more common though, which was a comfort to her.|$|E
