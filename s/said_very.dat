500|$|Word of the British {{movement}} reached Acton {{just before}} dawn on April 19, most likely delivered by Dr. Samuel Prescott, a resident of Concord {{and one of the}} Sons of Liberty. [...] As the alarm spread, the Acton Minutemen began to gather at Davis's home. [...] While waiting for others to arrive, the men made paper cartridges and some powdered their hair with flour so as to appear more like gentlemen when they met the British in battle. [...] As the Minutemen prepared, Davis's wife noticed that he seemed especially somber and <b>said</b> <b>very</b> little. [...] As some of his men joked about getting shot at by a British soldier, Davis rebuked them, reminding them that some of them would soon be killed.|$|E
500|$|Gittings recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} a man {{said to his}} kids, 'Hold your noses— it's dirty here.' And {{there was a woman}} dragging a string of kids who <b>said,</b> <b>very</b> angrily, 'You should all be married and have children like me.'" [...] Leaflets were distributed to passersby that described their reasons for picketing, surprising some recipients who were unaware gays and lesbians could be fired so easily, and disgusting others. Gittings remembered, [...] "It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a popular tactic at the time. And our cause seemed outlandish even to most gay people." [...] The evening prior to the group's picketing the State Department, Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced the pickets at a press conference. Gittings connected the high-profile visibility with a [...] "breakthrough into mainstream publicity." ...|$|E
500|$|John Calvin Coolidge Jr. ( [...] ; July 4, 1872 – January 5, 1933) was the 30th President of the United States (1923–29). A Republican {{lawyer from}} Vermont, Coolidge {{worked his way}} up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, {{eventually}} becoming governor of that state. His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. Soon after, he was elected as the 29th vice president in 1920 and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative, and also as a man who <b>said</b> <b>very</b> little, although having a rather dry sense of humor.|$|E

500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and {{felt as if the}} show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also <b>said</b> <b>very</b> little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure seem to be having a lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office eye candy. She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right now who doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend described [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] as [...] "one of the most random episodes of The Office." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoxha {{delivered}} {{his speech to}} the Conference on November 16; he [...] "spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting... The only crime his régime had committed, the Albanian leader added, was {{that it did not}} agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned. For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby, anti-Marxist and uncomradely. Hoxha's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering." [...] Amongst other things Hoxha said that, according to Khrushchev, the Party of Labour and Albania itself [...] "should merely applaud and approve, but express no opinion of its own. But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable. Marxism-Leninism has granted us the right to have our say, and no one can take this from us, either by means of political and economic pressure, or by means of threats and names they might call us." [...] According to Alia, Khrushchev [...] "tried to appear calm" [...] when first replying, reading his written text [...] "almost mechanically" [...] in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha's speech [...] "he lost his head and began to shout, scream and splutter." [...] Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked, [...] "Comrade Hoxha, you have poured a bucket of filth over me: {{you are going to have}} to wash it off again." [...] Jon Halliday states that, [...] "On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map. His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage." [...] In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha [...] "bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, comrade Dolores Ibarruri, an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and <b>said,</b> <b>very</b> much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm {{the king}} rat!" [...] Generally <b>said</b> <b>very</b> over-dramatically by John Cleese, {{on which the}} rest of the cast would reply, [...] "Oh, no you're not!" [...] This was later {{referenced}} in a Monty Python sketch at a [...] "hospital for over-actors." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lucetta Scaraffia, another auditor, professor, and {{coordinator}} of the Vatican newspaper's monthly insert [...] "Women, Church, World," [...] complained that the Synod's documents <b>said</b> <b>very</b> little about women, and {{that they needed to}} be listened to in greater numbers. [...] Agnes Offiong Erogunaye, national president of Catholic Women Organization of Nigeria, said mothers are [...] "the heart of the family" [...] and that their contributions must be recognized and supported.|$|E

2500|$|Vulgar Latin is {{a blanket}} term {{covering}} the popular dialects and sociolects of the Latin language throughout its range, from the hypothetical prisca latinitas of unknown or poorly remembered times in early Latium, {{to the language}} spoken around {{the fall of the}} empire.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, though she still lived at home, she and Flora Eldershaw took a flat in Potts Point where they held regular gatherings which {{operated}} {{something like a}} literary salon. Many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the time visited the flat, and {{it was here that}} she was able to spend time with Frank Dalby Davison whom she admitted many years later had been her love. She wrote of this relationship to her writer friend, Jean Devanny, [...] "I was deeply in love with him ... We were lovers for eight years ... In 1942 I knew things were coming to an end ... I was, as he <b>said,</b> <b>very</b> naïve". She admitted to Devanny that the break-up of this relationship was the cause of a serious illness.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{consequential}} walk-off of {{his career}} {{was the one that}} left him unemployed and stranded in England. The legendary Hungarian director, Alexander Korda, was attempting to make British films distinguishable from American films, and in 1934 he invited the image-oriented Brown to direct The Scarlet Pimpernel. The invitation was a huge opportunity for the young director. Not long after the filming had begun, Korda arrived on the set to observe Brown at work. He told Brown that he was directing the classic like a gangster film. Raymond Massey, who witnessed the scene, wrote [...] "Brown announced he would direct the way he liked or walk out. Alex <b>said</b> <b>very</b> sweetly, 'Please walk.'" [...] Korda, himself, an enormously successful director was known for his outbursts and the ill treatment of subordinates, Brown was known for walkouts related to autonomy.|$|E

2500|$|Communist {{leaders and}} intellectuals took many {{different}} positions on LGBT-rights issues. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels <b>said</b> <b>very</b> {{little on the}} subject in their published works. Marx in particular commented rarely on sexuality in general. Norman Markowitz, writing for politicalaffairs.net, writes that: [...] "Here, to be frank, one finds from Marx a refusal to entertain the subject, and from Engels open hostility to the individuals involved." [...] This is because, in private, Engels criticized male homosexuality and related it to ancient Greek pederasty, saying that [...] " [...] fell into the abominable practice of sodomy [...] and degraded alike their gods and themselves with the myth of Ganymede"; Engels {{also said that the}} pro-pederast movement [...] "cannot fail to triumph. Guerre aux cons, paix aus trous-de-cul [...] will now be the slogan". Engels also referred to Dr. Karl Boruttau as a Schwanzschwulen (faggotty prick) in private.|$|E
2500|$|Speculation has {{sometimes}} focused on Rosario, Hedgepeth's roommate at the time, {{due to her}} 9-1-1 call, the last texts sent from Hedgepeth's phone to her former boyfriend suggesting [...] " [...] needs you more than you know", the woman addressed as [...] "Rosie" [...] on the voicemail conversation and her decision to leave the apartment unlocked with, she claims, a sleeping Hedgepeth inside, to go sleep somewhere else at 4:30 {{the morning of the}} killing. Although she has left North Carolina and <b>said</b> <b>very</b> little about the case since then, Gasparoli wrote in 2017 that he learned from his police sources that they still regularly speak with her, and she cooperates. [...] "They do believe there is more Rosario can tell them," [...] he says. [...] " [...] sounds to me like [...] has been in the crosshairs ... as a key figure who knows more than she says she knows." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of letters Van Gogh wrote, he <b>said</b> <b>very</b> little about The Starry Night. After {{reporting}} that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a [...] "night study." [...] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, [...] "All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me"; [...] "the rest" [...] would include The Starry Night. When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he didn't send. Finally, in a letter to painter Émile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a [...] "failure." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet {{government}} itself <b>said</b> <b>very</b> little publicly about {{the change in}} the law, and few people seemed to be aware that it existed. [...] In 1934, the British Communist Harry Whyte wrote a long letter to Stalin condemning the law, and its prejudicial motivations. [...] He laid out a Marxist position against the oppression of homosexuals, as a social minority, and compared homophobia to racism, xenophobia and sexism. While the letter was not formally replied to, Soviet cultural writer Maxim Gorky authored an article, published in both Pravda and Izvestia titled [...] "Proletarian Humanism", that seemed to reject Whyte's arguments point by point. He rejected the notion that homosexuals were a social minority, and argued that the Soviet Union, governed by [...] "manly proletariat", is obliged to persecute homosexuals to protect the youth from their corrupting effect. He also equated homosexuality with fascism, stating that destroying homosexuality would in turn destroy fascism. In 1936, Justice Commissar Nikolai Krylenko publicly stated that the anti-gay criminal law was aimed at the decadent and effete old ruling classes.|$|E
