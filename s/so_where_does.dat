When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?” In [...] "Deep Breath" [...] (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In [...] "The Girl Who Died" [...] (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision {{to save the life of}} Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.|$|E

5000|$|Agent {{causation}} advocates {{respond that}} agent causation is actually more intuitive than event causation.

50|$|<b>So</b> <b>where</b> <b>does</b> {{nuclear power}} fit within this debate? Although it is {{mentioned}} {{a lot more}} in the Review compared to the White Paper (441 times, compared to 55 to be exact), the Government does not propose building new stations itself. Instead, it will leave it to the market, although it will ease some of the planning constraints (which it also aims to do for renewables) and look into providing a design authorisation procedure. However, as with many other aspects of the Energy Review Response, the document {{is not likely to be}} the last word on the subject, as there are plans for further consultation, and the establishment of further reviews and studies in issues such as identifying suitable sites, and managing the costs of decommissioning and long term waste management.|$|E

"There is, of course, strong {{precedent}} in the Islamic legal tradition {{to argue that}} blasphemous speech targeted at any religion should be restricted, {{but at the same}} time there is scholarly consensus around the notion that there is no criminal or worldly sanction mandated... <b>So</b> <b>where</b> <b>does</b> the confusion arise from? It appears that many Islamic jurists conflated blasphemy and apostasy. As prominent classical and contemporary scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah, Mahmood Shaltut, Mohamed Hashim Kamali and Rabb, among others, have examined the context of the ruling on apostasy and concluded that death was only mandated even in the case of apostasy when it was combined with war against the community...In other words, classical Islamic law interpretations stipulated death as a punishment when apostasy was combined with treason and rebellion against the state, not for blasphemy." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>So,</b> <b>where</b> <b>does</b> {{surplus value}} originate? Quite simply, {{the origin of}} surplus value arises from the worker. To better {{understand}} how this happens consider the following example from Marx's Capital Volume I. A capitalist hires a worker to spin ten pounds of cotton into yarn. Suppose {{the value of the}} cotton is one dollar per pound. The entire value of the cotton is 10 dollars. The production process naturally causes wear and tear on the machinery that is used to help produce the yarn. Suppose this wearing down of machinery costs the capitalist two dollars. The value of labor power is three dollars per day. Now also suppose that the working day is six hours. In this example the production process yields up 15 dollars, and also costs the capitalist 15 dollars. Thus there is no profit.|$|E

40|$|The {{main stream}} {{literature}} on {{social justice and}} European integration distinguishes between three models of providing social justice in Europe: the family, {{the market and the}} state.

The Welfare State appealed to many and was a main driver of European integration, but its fiscal implications and its normative bias toward social engineering  render it practically impossible. The family does well, these days, as a coping model, but individualization is widespread and this makes it impossible to view the family as a prime base for social justice in the European Union in the decades. <b>So,</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> we turn...|$|R
