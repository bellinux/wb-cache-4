40|$|EN] The {{relationship}} between the unemployment and the international immigration is getting interest while the differences between poor and rich countries are stressed. The poor countries offer cheap work force to occupy less qualified jobs in rich countries, with citizen increasingly demanding and qualified. In spite of this evidence, the immigration is object of huge polemics and by this motive is being studied in those countries where this phenomenon is important. In this study, evidence of the unitary roots in the seasonal frequencies of the "Work Permits" and "Unemployment" series is provided. Because of this, the existence of seasonal cointegration between both series is tested. The {{results indicate that the}} only cointegrating relations between both variable are trivial and, therefore, the variables are not related in the long run. In the Short term, the estimate of the VAR model shows that the changes in the immigration during the years 1981 - 1998 hardly had effects on the unemployment.

We use an additive multivariate structural model for the cities of Chillán, Concepción, Gran Concepción and Talcahuano, an additive bivariant structural model for Coronel and Lota, and an additive univariate structural model for Arauco and Los Angeles. The main results show, firstly, that the estimated state-space approach models present a good explanation power (MAPE is less than 8 per cent for four cities); secondly, the hypothesis which states that seasonal peak levels for unemployment rate are related to cities strongly linked with the primary sector (raw materials) is verified, thirdly, quantifying the <b>seasonal</b> component for <b>unemployment</b> series in each city gives useful information to local policy-makers, because it can determine the optimal length for emergency employment plans. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the simultaneity and timing {{aspects of the}} relationships between youth crime and employment. It begins with a review of the theoretical and empirical literatures related to this subject. Several conclusions were reached based upon this review. First, the theoretical sociological and economic literatures conflict with respect to the existence, nature and importance of youth crime and employment relationships. Secondly, the findings of the empirical studies on this topic conflict with respect to the direction, magnitude and significance of any youth crime-employment relationships. Moreover, with the exception of this thesis, there have been no studies based on micro level data which investigate the simultaneity of youth crime and employment relationships. ^ The theoretical components of this thesis goes on to develop likely patterns of youth crime and employment relationships. Based on this analysis, an empirical model is constructed and tested. The main component of the empirical analysis consists of a FIML simultaneous probit model where the latent dependent variables are the net utility of crime and an employability index. The estimation is based on data on 302 youths who were enrolled in a crime prevention program in Philadelphia. The employment, police contact, <b>seasonal</b> dummies, <b>unemployment</b> rate and relevant youth and family demographic data are constructed as time series data where each person/month observation is assigned a set of historical variables. ^ The thesis concludes that the net utility of crime and the employability of youths are simultaneously determined. The one other variable found to be a significant determinant of the net utility of crime is the length of time since the youth 2 ̆ 7 s last police contact. Other significant determinants of a youth 2 ̆ 7 s employability include the length of time since the youth 2 ̆ 7 s last police contact, the youth 2 ̆ 7 s employment status in the preceeding time period, and the seasons. ^ Dropping the strict econometric interpretations of the two latent dependent variables, this study concludes that policies such as government employment programs or a reduction in the minimum wage for youths would have the beneficial effect of reducing youth crime. However, if youths displace adults in the labor force, there may be an increase in adult criminality. Moreover, this study suggests that judges who harshly reprimand delinquent youths demanding that youths find and keep jobs as 2 ̆ 2 proof 2 ̆ 2 of their reformation will be successful in reducing delinquency. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the rural poor of south Asia and their {{struggle}} to cope with the <b>seasonal</b> risk of <b>unemployment</b> and the ensuing income risks. In the absence of formal credit or insurance markets the rural poor typically resort to, among other options, the following informal strategies to cope with seasonal income risks: (i) seasonal rural-to-urban migration, and (ii) mutual (ex-post) transfers between families of friends and relatives. Access to credit through a microfinance institution could also provide a competing source of insurance. The question raised in this paper is how the access to credit may affect the more traditional/time honoured means of risk coping, such as seasonal migration. Given that credit, i. e., a creditfinanced activity, is potentially a substitute for seasonal migration, it is reasonable to argue that easy access to credit (or high return on credit) will lower the incidence of migration. However, there also exists a potential complementarity between the two activities (if implemented jointly) in terms of gains due to diversification of income risks. That is, given that income from migration is not typically subject to the same shocks as income generated by a credit-financed activity, a joint adoption of both activities creates opportunities for diversification of risk in the family incomes portfolio. If the diversification gains are large enough then the adoption of both activities jointly will be preferred to adopting either of the activities individually. In that event, introduction of microfinance in rural societies may result in raising the incidence of migration. The joint adoption case for rural households is modelled using a choice theoretic framework, and exact conditions are derived for when joint adoption is preferable to adoption of a single project. The model of joint adoption is estimated by applying a Bivariate Probit regression model on a single cross-section of household survey data from rural Bangladesh. Our preliminary results show that indeed the probability of participation in migration by household members is positively related to the probability of the household being a credit recipient.

Fresh graduates applying for their first job are considerably disadvantaged in competition with other applicants. They lack of job experience as well as basic working habits; what is more, they fail in being acknowledged with the labour market and employers´ requirements on their future employees. Their unreal visions often contribute to their unemployment, too. Theoretical part clarifies the phenomenon of unemployment and various types of unemployment from frictional, cyclical, <b>seasonal</b> to structural <b>unemployment</b> are confronted. The other theoretical part deals with labour market in general, supply and demand of workforce, job offers and study programmes offers so that there is an equilibrium of the number of graduates at various specialisations and demands of labour market. More attention is paid to the importance of work for a young person, which is the precondition for one´s independence and taking over the responsibility for work done. The problem of young people and unemployment has become so serious that European Union decided to deal with it. One proposal of European Parliament suggests that the state ought to guarantee young people the security for work, offers of requalification courses or work internships. These measures ought to contribute to the prevention of unemployment within this target group. One of the goals covers the field of employment and considers decreasing the unemployment rate of juvenile and young people between the ages of 15 and 24 by a third (compared with the year 2010). The aim of the practical part of the thesis was to find out what visions of young people concerning to their involvement in labour market are like, if they correspond with their conditions and capabilities, whether they look for jobs entirely in their field of study or they are interested in requalification if needed. Questionnaire survey was used for confirmation the hypothesis. The practical part states the results of field research which was carried out in the form of anonymous questionnaire. The questionnaire survey inquired about education of the target group of young people up to the age of 30, their knowledge and skills in the fields of foreign languages, computer literacy and driving vehicles. The survey inquired about the graduates´ willingness to work in shifts, in jobs involving business trips, in various working environments as well as their willingness to work aside their qualification fields. Their near-future visions were verified, i. e. the interest in early job placement, their own activity in looking for a job, the effort to enlarge their qualifications.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine labour market seasonality in Canada over the past three decades in order to shed light on what policies might be best suited to address seasonal economies. The main findings are as follows. The seasonality of the Canadian economy has declined since 1976 according to a wide range of output and labour market variables. However, since 1996 unemployment rate seasonality has increased. Seasonality ?both in employment and the unemployment rate ?is much higher for the young than for older workers and much higher for men than for women. Canada’s level of employment seasonality was more than three times higher than that in the United States in 2003. However, unemployment rate seasonality was perhaps surprisingly the same in the two countries. Relative to OECD countries, Canada has average unemployment rate seasonality, but very high employment seasonality. Atlantic Canada has higher levels of employment and unemployment rate seasonality than the other provinces reflecting a greater importance of primary industries and greater propensity of employers to hire part-year workers. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>unemployment</b> represents a much more important public policy issue than seasonal employment. The basic problem is an underlying lack of employment opportunities in rural and remote areas where <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment</b> is concentrated, not <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment</b> itself. An economic development strategy that ensures that all persons who want full year work can obtain it must be the most important element in any attempt to reduce <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment.</b> But such a strategy might need to be supplemented, at least in the short-to-medium term, by out-migration, particularly in very high unemployment regions, and incentives for firms to transform seasonal work into full-year work, or at least into near full-year work. Since unrestricted benefits for seasonal EI repeaters will not reduce <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment,</b> a strong case can be made that long-term income support for the seasonally unemployed is not in the long-run in the best interest of the beneficiaries, high unemployment regions, and the country, although reducing such benefits is politically difficult. seasonality, seasonal employment, <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment,</b> unemployment, Atlantic Canada, Canada...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] With {{high current}} {{interest}} in unemployment and inflation, {{policy makers and}} academicians have begun to reassess the impact of unemployment insurance on the labor market. Some ask whether high unemployment rates are partly {{the result of an}} addition to the labor market of workers with a high propensity for unemployment.

Still others concentrate on the factors that lead to greater labor turnover and flows of workers through the labor market. Consequently, there has evolved a “new view” of unemployment, which considers more than the familiar concepts of deficient demand and structural and <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment.</b> It also pays attention to job search processes and the instability of certain jobs and certain workers. Based on this “new view,” this paper seeks to gauge the impact of the American system of unemployment insurance (UI) on the labor market.

40|$|Le chômage saisonnier en {{existence}} au Canada et dans la province de Québec en particulier pose de graves problèmes qui ont leurs répercussions sur le plan économique et social. S'appuyant sur des chiffres et sur des faits éloquents, l'auteur examine cette situation et expose les rôles joués par les gouvernements fédéral et provinciaux dans le but de l'améliorer. Some {{facts and}} figures illustrate better than a long article {{the social and economic}} impact of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment</b> of {{an important part of the}} workers. In 1961, the population of the Province of Quebec amounted to 1, 471, 840 people, according to the Federal Census. At the end of January of the same year, 83, 791 people, according to the estimates of the Federal Minister of Labour, were without employment, i. e. a proportion of nearly 89 fc of the total-man power; at the end of February, 1952, 114, 973 people were in the same situation, making up at this time almost 8 % of the total active population. In studying the figures of the variations in employment since 1948, the following facts may be noted:The most recent information that we have on the length of unemployment in our district, show that on February 1, 1955, 53. 5 % or 7 705 people capable of work were looking for employment since a month or more than a month. The number of those looking for employment represented 7. 5 % of the active labour supply in the Quebec métropolitain district. If one takes into account the maximum weekly unemployment insurance payments made to unemployed persons, one may realize not only thé acuteness of the problems created to the families and to the society as a whole by <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment,</b> but also the depreciation of the collective buying power that the presence of such a large inactive mass creates in a district or a locality which may result in serious economic evils. Our province, and particularly our district, are especially vulnerable to the harm done by <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment.</b> The district of Quebec is, furthermore, very frequently a district with an excess of man-power, this surplus being mainly made of general or non-specialized labour coming to a large extent from neighbouring or more distant rural territories; for these workers, of which a large number emigrate by necessity, the city and district of Quebec constitutes the first stage and, quite often, the end of their road. There is then brought into existence in the metropolitan district a state of what could be called permanent unemployment, the unemployment that is known as "structural" unemployment, and which may be defined as being the result of a "surplus of labour in a city, and economic district or a country, taking into account the capacities for absorption of existing enterprises". A certain number of our industries, even important ones, are subject to two other particular types of unemployment: "competitive" unemployment, which, through the play of certain economic factors, result from the reduction in production in a plant or in an industrial sector. This "competitive" unemployment is characterized by a temporary lay-off, by a reduced work week or by shorter work days or by both. Finally, "competitive" unemployment may also lead to the worst, that is to say, the permanent dismissal of labour. The other type of unemployment, is technological unemployment which consists of the loss of employment brought about by new processes, new machines or new organization methods or even caused by the temporary or permanent loss of a market due to changes in consumers' tastes. If one examines finally the structure of the labour market of the Quebec district, one can easily detect that there exists a certain "occupational" lack of balance. Our territory contains a high percentage of seasonal industries or business. Furthermore, it is a market where a relatively high percentage of feminine labour is to be found, characterized by a frequently high turnover. NECESSITY OF POSITIVE MEASURESThe Federal government, who is considered in most circles as responsible for the general employment policy, has recently decided to alter the programme of public works wrich it was keeping in reserve in provision of general unemployment and to set up a new short-range programme more flexible, more changeable and more easily adaptable to employment conditions in the various regions of the country. Moreover, the provincial governments seem ready to carry out the various public works in taking their inspiration from the same conceptions, and in coordinating as much as possible the programme of public investment with that of the Federal government. An attempt is being made to apply the same methods to the level of municipal administrations. The main purpose of the government action should be to stimulate private activity or in other words, to give it a greater impetus. It only constitutes a partial and negative solution of the problem we are examining just now. It has become necessary to add some positive measures by making more flexible the income tax regulation on depreciation of capital invested during the months of <b>seasonal</b> <b>unemployment,</b> by influencing through some positive measures the private as well as the public policies on credit and by certain other action of a similar nature, which would have as direct result the quickening of private initiative...|$|E
