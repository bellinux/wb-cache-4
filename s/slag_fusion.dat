The {{objective of this}} study is to determine the optimum leaching condition of REE from tin slag after alkali fusion. Silica structure in slag is causing the direct leaching uneffective. Therefore, pre-treatment step using alkali fusion is required to break the structure of silica and to increase the porosity of <b>slag.</b> <b>Fusion</b> is conducted in 2 hours at 700 oC, with ratio of natrium hidroxide (NaOH) : slag = 2 : 1. Later, frit which is leached by water then leached by chloride acid to dissolve REE. As much as 87, 5 % of REE is dissolved at 2 M on chloride acid (HCl) concentration, in 40 o C temperature, - 325 mesh particle size, 15 g/ 100 ml of S/L, 150 rpm of agitation speed, and 5 minutes of leaching tim...|$|E

After solidification, the samples are knocked out, and the lead bullets recovered for cupellation, or for analysis by other means.|$|R

Effect of heat input on structure and hardness of joints during repair of underwater pipeline was analyzed. Welding defects like microcracks, micro-lacks of <b>fusion,</b> <b>slag</b> inclusions, as well as HAZ hardness increase over an assumed acceptance criterion for welded joints in pipes without anticorrosion polymer insulation, were identified.

40|$|Type, {{through-wall}} dimension (depth), {{and location}} {{are the most}} important flaw characteristics that need to be determined for the fracture-mechanics evaluation of a flawed component or part. In this paper, the three-step approach to the ultrasonic evaluation of flawed reactor pressure vessel components (i. e., flaw detection, identification, and sizing) are discussed in relation to fatigue cracks, <b>slag</b> inclusions, incomplete <b>fusion</b> flaws, and porosity clusters. The emphasis is on flaw identification (cracks vs. benign flaws) which must take place before estimating the depth of the flaw. The composite pulse patterns obtained with four multibeam/multimode SLIC transducers [1] for two model flaws (a side-milled notch and a side-drilled hole) and two real flaws (fatigue crack and slag inclusion) are imaged in a B-scan format...|$|R
40|$|Full penetration, double-vee {{butt welds}} with {{reinforcement}} removed have been fabricated using a high-yield-strength steel, HY- 130. Various filler metals and welding techniques were used. Most welds contained intentionally incorporated weld discontinuities such as <b>slag,</b> lack of <b>fusion</b> and /or porosity. Fatigue specimens were cut from these welds and tested in zero-to-tension, axial fatigue. The {{point at which}} a fatigue crack began to propagate within the specimen was determined by radiographic measurements. The fatigue life of a specimen could therefore be separated into two parts-that portion spent in initiating a fatigue crack and that spent in fatigue crack propagation. The influence of flaw size and geometry upon the crack propagation portions of the fatigue life {{was found to be}} large and to depend upon the thickness of the member. The results of these studies were found to be in good agreement with the fatigue lives predicted {{on the basis of a}} fracture mechanics analysis. ASM...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{tests to}} determine partial resistance factors {{that are to be}} used in designing small steel structures. Several welding skills were incorporated into the investigation so as to come up with different partial resistance factors. Different skills will then be included in the design procedure, allowing the engineer freedom to assess the availability of skills and to specify connection details accordingly. This investigation was carried out using butt and fillet-welded specimens in tension under static loading only. Half of the samples were welded flat and the other half were welded vertical. It is evident from the load-elongation graphs that plastic deformation is more extensive in specimens welded by experienced welders and that specimens welded flat are more ductile than those welded vertical. Vertical welding also resulted in a greater percentage of defects than flat welding. Most of the defects in the welds were a result of incomplete penetration, lack of <b>fusion,</b> <b>slag</b> inclusion, porosity and failure to weld to the given dimensions...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{evaluation of the}} axial fatigue behavior of plates and transverse butt-welded joints in HY- 130 (T) steel is presented. The weldments were prepared using each of two experimental "second-generation" GMA welding wires and a coated electrode. Fatigue tests were conducted using both sound weldments and weldments containing various internal defects, including porosity, <b>slag,</b> lack of <b>fusion,</b> and lack of penetration. Radiographic and ultrasonic testing techniques were used to study the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks originating at internal weld flaws. The fatigue {{studies have indicated that}} although the highest standards of quality may be used in the fabrication of HY- 130 (T) welded joints, it has not been possible to guarantee the elimination of all defects which have proven to be critical sites for internal fatigue crack nucleation under axial loading. Internal failures were as likely to occur in specimens rated as sound weldments under radiographic inspection as in weldments having regions containing readily detected flaws. Fatigue cracks originating at internal defects were found to initiate at approximately twenty to eighty percent of the total cyclic life-time of butt-welded joint, for tests conducted at a stress cycle of zero-to-tension. Within the normal limits of scatter for fatigue data, however, the number of cycles of crack propagation to failure beyond the point of internal initiation was found to be reasonably consistent at a specific test stress level, for weldments containing various types and percentages of weld defect area.

40|$|Slag {{material}} {{produced by}} the Plasma Hearth Process (PHP) varies in chemical composition due to the heterogeneous nature of the input sample feed. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a spectroscopic technique which has been evaluated to perform elemental analyses on surrogate slag material for process control. Vitreous slag samples were ground to a fine powder in an impact ball mill and analyzed directly using laboratory prepared standards. The fluorescent intensities of Si, Al and Fe in the slag samples was utilized to determine the appropriate matrix standard set for the determination of Ce. The samples were analyzed for Cr, Ni, Fe and Ce using a wavelength dispersive XRF polychromator. Split samples were dissolved and analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). The precision of the XRF technique was better than 5 % RSD. The limit of detection for Ce varied with sample matrix and was typically below 0. 01 % by weight. The linear dynamic range for the technique was evaluated over two orders of magnitude. Typical calibration standards ranged from 0. 01 % Ce to 1 % Ce. The Ce determinations performed directly on ground slag material by the XRF techniques were similar to ICP-AES analyses. Various chemical dissolution and sample preparation techniques were evaluated {{for the analysis of}} Ce in <b>slag</b> samples. A <b>fusion</b> procedure utilizing LiBO{sub 2 } was found to provide reliable analyses for the actinide surrogate in a variety of slag matrices. The use of the XRF technique reduced the time of analysis for Ce and Cr from three days to one day for five samples. No additional waste streams were created from the analyses by the XRF technique, while the ICP technique generated several liters of liquid waste...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic signal {{processing}} presents several challenges {{with respect to}} both noise removal and interpretation. The interference of unwanted reflections from material grain structure can render the data extremely noisy and mask the detection of small flaws. It is therefore imperative to separate the flaw reflections from grain noise. The interpretation or classification of ultrasonic signals in general is relatively difficult due {{to the complexity of}} the physical process and similarity of signals from various classes of reflectors;Adaptive noise cancellation techniques are ideally suited for reducing spatially varying noise due to the grain structure of material in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation. In this research, a multi-stage adaptive noise cancellation (MANC) scheme is proposed for reducing spatially varying grain noise and enhancing flaw detection in ultrasonic signals. The overall scheme is based on the use of an adaptive least mean square error (LMSE) filter with primary and reference signals derived from two adjacent positions of the transducers. Since grain noise is generally uncorrelated, in contrast to the correlated flaw echoes, adaptive filtering algorithms exploit the correlation properties of signals in a C-scan image to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output signal;A neural network-based signal classification system is proposed for the interpretation of ultrasonic signals obtained from inspection of welds, where signals have to be classified as resulting from porosity, <b>slag,</b> lack of <b>fusion,</b> or cracks in the weld region. Standard techniques rely on differences in individual A-scans to classify the signals. This thesis investigates the need for investigating signal features that incorporate the effects of beam spread and echo dynamics. Such effects call for data interpretation schemes that include a neighborhood of A-scans carrying information about a reflector. Several ultrasonic signal features based on the information in a two-dimensional array of ultrasonic waveforms, ranging from the estimation of statistical characteristics of signals to two and three-dimensional transform-based methods, are evaluated. A two-dimensional scan of ultrasonic testing is also represented in the form of images (B- and B 2 ̆ 7 -scans). Multidimensional signal and image-processing algorithms are used to analyze the images. Two and three-dimensional Fourier transforms are applied to ultrasonic data that are inherently three-dimensional in nature (2 spatial and 1 time). A variety of transform-based features are then utilized for obtaining the final classification...|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} {{overview of}} the phase-mineral transformations of organic and inorganic matter during biomass combustion was conducted in Part I of the present work. The ash fusion and ash formation mechanisms of biomass types and sub-types during combustion are {{described in the present}} Part II. For that purpose the identified systematic associations based on the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases in the biomass ash (BA) system, namely (1) Si - Al - Fe - Na - Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca - Mg - Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K - P - S - Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, glass and some silicates and carbonates); were used as classification of BAs into four types ("S", "C", "K" and "CK") and six sub-types with high, medium and low acid tendencies and their description was given. Then, topics related to ash fusion behaviour such as some general considerations and observations about ash melting, ash fusion temperatures (AFTs) of biomass and their comparisons with coal, relationships between AFTs and inorganic composition of biomass and coal, and ash fusion mechanisms of biomass and coal are characterized. Further, issues connected with the ash formation mechanisms such as phase-mineral transformations of organic and inorganic matter and ash formation, ash acidity and description of ash types and sub-types are discussed. Subsequently, aspects related to potential applications of ash formation mechanisms for biomass types and sub-types during combustion, namely some key technological problems (<b>fusion,</b> <b>slagging</b> and fouling predictions, low ash fusion temperatures, co-combustion and application of biomass ash) and environmental risks (volatilization, capture and water leaching of hazardous elements) are described. Finally, it is emphasized that the application of this new classification approach based on combined phase-mineral and chemical composition of biomass and BA has not only fundamental importance, but also has potential applications in prediction of behaviour and properties connected with the innovative and sustainable utilization of biomass and BA. It is also demonstrated that the definitive utilization, technological and environmental advantages and challenges related to biomass and BA associate preferentially with specific BA types and sub-types and they could be predictable by using the above or similar combined chemical and phase-mineral classification approaches.
