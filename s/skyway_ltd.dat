50|$|Skyways Coach-Air, {{which had}} {{remained}} a separate entity following {{the sale of}} sister airline <b>Skyways</b> <b>Ltd</b> to Euravia, got into financial difficulties in 1970. This resulted in a management buyout and the following year's {{formation of a new}} company trading as Skyways International to succeed the defunct Skyways Coach-Air. Skyways International was taken over by Dan-Air in 1972.|$|R

2500|$|The first Norseman, {{powered by}} a Wright R-975-E3 Whirlwind, was flight tested on floats on November 14, 1935 and was sold and {{delivered}} to Dominion <b>Skyways</b> <b>Ltd.</b> on January 18, 1936, registered as [...] "CF-AYO" [...] and named “Arcturus." [...] In summer 1941, Warner Brothers leased CF-AYO for the filming of [...] "Captains of the Clouds" [...] starring James Cagney. Principal aerial photography took place near North Bay, Ontario with CF-AYO carrying temporary registration [...] "CF-HGO." [...] CF-AYO was lost in a crash in Algonquin Park in 1952.

5000|$|... 1953 Skyways Avro York disappearance: The worst {{accident}} {{involving a}} Skyways group aircraft occurred on 2 February 1953. On that day a <b>Skyways</b> <b>Ltd</b> Avro 685 York 1 (registration: G-AHFA) operating the Terceira-Lajes Airport, Azores, Portugal, to Gander Airport, Newfoundland, Canada, sector of a Stansted—Kingston trooping flight with 39 occupants (six crew and 33 passengers) was lost over the Atlantic Ocean without trace. The last radio contact was a distress signal (SOS) {{received from the}} aircraft. The aircraft's last position was 46deg 15'N Long 46deg 31'W. The wreckage was never found. This crash lost Skyways its trooping contract with the War Office.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this statement, the Court of Appeal held that the {{contract}} was not legally enforceable; the intentions of the parties were sufficient to override the presumption of intention to create legal relations. Such language must however be clear and free of any ambiguity; where it is not, it is for the party asserting there was no legal relations to prove it. Where in Edwards v <b>Skyways</b> <b>Ltd</b> a bonus payment, described as 'ex gratia', was promised to an employee, this was found to be legally binding. He had relied upon the promise in accepting a redundancy package, and his employer could not adequately prove that they had not intended their promise to become a contractual term.|$|R
50|$|The Urban Aeronautics X-Hawk is {{a design}} for a flying car which is being {{developed}} by Rafi Yoeli in Yavne, Israel. It is planned to be built by Metro <b>Skyways</b> <b>Ltd.,</b> a subsidiary of Urban Aeronautics. Yoeli and his privately held company, Urban Aeronautics, claim to have flown the car to a height of 3 ft, though they say that greater heights are possible. It will be {{about the size of}} a large van. The X-Hawk and its smaller unmanned version, the AirMule, would be used in search and rescue operations where a helicopter would be useless or at least very dangerous, such as evacuating people from the upper stories of burning buildings, or delivering and extracting police and soldiers while very close to structures, narrow streets, and confined spaces.|$|R
50|$|In February 1971, a {{group of}} former Skyways Coach-Air senior {{managers}} led by John Knox, the erstwhile airline's last commercial manager, formed International <b>Skyways</b> <b>Ltd</b> as a successor to the failed company. With the backing of London merchant bank Sterling Industrial Securities, the new management team purchased defunct Skyways Coach-Air's assets. These included aircraft and routes. Following the successful management buyout, the new entity began trading as Skyways International. It resumed the ex-Skyways Coach-Air year-round route from Ashford to Beauvais on 8 February 1971 with four 748s that had been grounded at Ashford Airport since the cessation of operations three weeks earlier. This {{was followed by the}} reintroduction of routes from Ashford to Ostend, Clermont-Ferrand and Montpellier, as well as from Luton to Ostend and from East Midlands to Beauvais.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2003, <b>Skyway</b> Broadcasting, <b>Ltd.,</b> {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to sell this station to Styles Broadcasting subsidiary Styles Media Group, LLC (Thomas A. DiBacco, managing member) for a total sale price of $750,000. [...] The deal {{was approved by the}} FCC on August 20, 2003, and the transaction was consummated on October 1, 2003. [...] The new owners had the FCC change the station's callsign to WLDA on March 4, 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The Company {{was started}} by a {{consortium}} led by Les Kerr consisting of: Leslie George [...] "Les" [...] Kerr, K. Barry Marsden, Herman Joseph [...] "Slim" [...] Knights, Ronald [...] "Ron" [...] F. Connelly of Whitehorse, Yukon, and John De Voin (a silent partner). Les Kerr had worked for <b>Skyway</b> Air Services <b>Ltd.</b> for 17 years and put together the 5 man group {{to take control of}} the fire control and aerial agricultural interests of <b>Skyway</b> Air Services <b>Ltd.</b> In the transaction, they took 35 employees and 19 single engine aircraft. This took place after the owner for Skyway (Art Seller), had suffered a stroke and wanted to eliminate some of his workload.|$|R
50|$|<b>Skyway</b> Air Services <b>Ltd.,</b> {{was started}} {{shortly after the}} close of WW2. They were pioneers in the {{development}} and operation of aerial firefighting, agricultural and pest control spraying. After the interests were sold, Skyway continued to operate as a flying school and charter business out of Langley, British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Skyways leased four Lockheed Constellation airliners from BOAC. These {{replaced}} Hermes on the London—Singapore scheduled {{freight service}} Skyways operated {{on behalf of}} BOAC. This was the year Skyways embarked upon a major expansion in the Caribbean, following its acquisition of an 80% stake in Bahamas Airways from BOAC. Skyways allocated two Hermes aircraft with completely refurbished interiors to its new joint venture, the renamed <b>Skyways</b> (Bahamas) <b>Ltd.</b> However, these did not appeal to the largely US-based clientele of Bahamas Airways, and stiff competition from Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) between Nassau, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and West Palm Beach resulted in few passengers and mounting losses. As this situation had become untenable, Skyways's holding company, Eric Rylands Ltd, decided to sell back to BOAC its shares in Bahamas Airways. That year, Skyways also launched scheduled passenger services between London Heathrow and Tunis, utilising the refurbished Hermes aircraft that had originally been allocated to the unsuccessful joint venture in the Bahamas. This was furthermore the time London's premier airport became the airline's main operating base. Although the airline's Yorks were by then {{nearing the end of}} their service lives, they were still kept busy ferrying spare parts around the world on behalf of BOAC and Pan Am.|$|R
