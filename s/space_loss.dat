The <b>spacing</b> <b>loss</b> coefficient, K, which is the slope when the <b>spacing</b> <b>loss</b> is plotted versus d/λ, has been measured for sinusoidal magnetization. The results show that for a single layer medium, K is almost {{the same as that}} in longitudinal recording, and that for a double layer medium, the K value is large at long wavelengths and becomes small with decreasing wavelength to the value less than 54. 6. Particularly for a ring head, a striking wavelength dependence of K is observed. Such a wavelength dependence results from the change of the distribution and the magnitude of the head sensitivity function with spacing. Nevertheless in digital recording, the deterioration in recording density characteristics with increasing spacing is small, even at low densities, because of the contribution of harmonics in output singnals...|$|R

50|$|Shorter {{wavelengths}} in {{this band}} permit {{the use of}} smaller antennas to achieve the same high directivity and high gain as larger ones in lower bands. The immediate consequence of this high directivity, coupled with the high free <b>space</b> <b>loss</b> at these frequencies, is the possibility of a more efficient use of frequencies for point-to-multipoint applications. Since a greater number of highly directive antennas can be placed in a given area, the net result is greater frequency reuse, and higher density of users. The high usable channel capacity in this band might allow it to serve some applications that would otherwise use fiber-optic communication.|$|E

5000|$|Millimeter waves {{propagate}} {{solely by}} line-of-sight paths, {{they are not}} reflected by the ionosphere nor do they travel along the Earth as ground waves as lower frequency radio waves do. [...] At typical power densities they are blocked by building walls and suffer significant attenuation passing through foliage. [...] Absorption by atmospheric gases is a significant factor throughout the band and increases with frequency. However it is maximum at a few specific absorption lines, mainly those of oxygen at 60 GHz and water vapor at 24 GHz and 184 GHz. [...] At frequencies in the [...] "windows" [...] between these absorption peaks, millimeter waves have much less atmospheric attenuation and greater range, so many applications use these frequencies. Millimeter wavelengths are the same order of size as raindrops, so precipitation causes additional attenuation due to scattering (rain fade) as well as absorption. [...] The high free <b>space</b> <b>loss</b> and atmospheric absorption limits useful propagation to a few kilometers. Thus, they are useful for densely packed communications networks such as personal area networks that improve spectrum utilization through frequency reuse.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{antimicrobial}} prescription is {{to achieve}} effective drug concentrations. Standard antimicrobial dosing regimens are based on research peiformed often decades ago {{and for the most}} part with patients who were not critically ill. More recent insights into antibiotic activity (e. g. the importance of high peak/MIC ratios for aminoglycosides and time above MIC for j 3 -lactam antibiotics), drug pharmacokinetics (e. g. increased volume of distribution and altered clearances) and the pathogenesis of sepsis (e. g. third <b>space</b> <b>losses</b> and altered creatinine clearances) have made re-evaluation ofdosing regimens necessary for the critically ill. The inflammatory response associated with sepsis results in a rapid decrease in serum albumin levels, large fluid shifts and third <b>space</b> <b>losses,</b> initially with a high cardiac output. In turn these changes result in increased creatinine clearance and increased renal drug clearance. Unless these effects are offset by ensuing renal and/or hepatic impairment, with subsequent drug accumulation, antibiotic levels may be too low for optimal efficacy. The institution of continuous renal replacement therapy separately affects antibiotic clearances, and therefore dosing, even further. This article reviews relevant literature and offers principles for more effective and appropriate antibiotic dosing in the critically ill, based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles of the main antibiotic groups (aminoglyosides, glycopeptides, j 3 -lactams, carbapenems and quinolones) and knowledge of the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response syndrome. Finally it also provides some guidance on the basic principles of drug prescription for patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy...|$|R

MethodsWe used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) (full limb and flexed knee X-rays) to examine agreement of anatomic and mechanical alignment and data from Boston Osteoarthritis of the Knee Study (BOKS) to evaluate the association of full limb mechanical alignment vs knee X-ray anatomic alignment with joint <b>space</b> <b>loss.</b> A 4 ° offset was used to correct for the more valgus angulation of the anatomic alignment. ResultsOf 143 subjects whose knee X-rays and full limb films were publicly released from the OAI, the agreement of varus, neutral and valgus alignment was only moderate (κ= 0. 43, P< 0. 001). In BOKS, varus mechanical and anatomic alignments measured from full limb and knee X-rays respectively both predicted {{a high risk of}} medial joint <b>space</b> <b>loss</b> vs neutral alignment – for mechanical alignment, odds ratio (OR) = 4. 82 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 93, 12. 00] and for anatomic alignment OR= 4. 25 (95 % CI 2. 08, 8. 72). ConclusionsWhile agreement of alignment from knee X-ray to full limb film was only moderate, varus malalignment measured from a flexed knee predicted the likelihood of progression well. Flexed knee alignment may be more relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk than that of a fully extended knee, but a measurement of alignment from a short limb is an imperfect surrogate for full limb alignment...|$|E

In ring head recording, an increase of write spacing causes the change of magnetization mode in the Co-Cr layer from perpendicular to longitudinal. In single pole head recording, the magnetization mode remains perpendicular, even for large write spacing. Furthermore, the reproduced voltage in saturation recording decreases with increased write spacing, since the magnetization transition length is broadened by the decreasing write head field gradient resulting from disappearance of head-to-medium magnetic coupling. Therefore, in {{perpendicular magnetic recording}}, a slight reduction of the head-to-medium spacing leads to a remarkable improvement in high density recording characteristics...|$|R
