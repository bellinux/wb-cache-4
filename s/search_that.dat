5|$|Shea Ohmsford, the protagonist, Flick's adopted {{brother and}} the only {{remaining}} descendant of Jerle Shannara. Shea must find an ancient magical sword, the Sword of Shannara, {{and use it to}} destroy the antagonist, the Warlock Lord. A major theme of this novel revolves around Shea—part of his quest includes finding a belief in himself. This is a <b>search</b> <b>that</b> every subsequent Brooks protagonist must undergo.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{then decided}} to produce James Dean as a TV movie for Turner Network Television (TNT); both Warners and TNT are owned by Time Warner. Franco was cast as Dean in May 2000 after a <b>search</b> <b>that</b> {{resulted}} in 500 auditions. Franco researched his role to closely portray Dean. James Dean was shown on TNT in the United States on August 5, 2001, receiving generally positive reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary <b>search</b> <b>that</b> {{successively}} shortens the interval in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E

5|$|After a <b>search</b> <b>that</b> {{had taken}} several years, Wheeler {{was able to}} secure a {{premises}} for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers {{made it clear that}} the building was only intended as a temporary home for the Institute, which it was hoped would be able to move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub. In his speech, the university's Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, John Mauchly {{made the}} first mention of binary search {{as part of the}} Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures {{regarding}} any computer-related topic. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary <b>search</b> <b>that</b> placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous search problems in computational geometry.|$|E
5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 clues, {{although}} finding them is not a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer <b>search</b> <b>that</b> the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues {{have been found}} with 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of clues is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of clues is minimal for this case.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea behind}} Il Divo came when Simon Cowell, {{inspired}} {{after listening to}} the Three Tenors, decided to form a multinational quartet of talented young singers to recreate the quality of Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo. Cowell conducted a worldwide search for young singers {{who were willing to}} embark on the project, a <b>search</b> <b>that</b> lasted nearly three years, from 21 January 2001, until 16 December 2003, when the fourth member, American tenor David Miller, was signed. Prior to Il Divo, Miller and his European counterparts Spanish baritone, Carlos Marín, Swiss tenor Urs Bühler and French pop singer, Sébastien Izambard were each enjoying moderate success in their own right.|$|E

25|$|Other theorems have a known {{proof that}} cannot easily be written down. The most {{prominent}} examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture. Both of these theorems are only {{known to be}} true by reducing them to a computational <b>search</b> <b>that</b> is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but {{it has become more}} widely accepted. The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has even {{gone so far as to}} claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved. Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.|$|E
25|$|After an {{exhaustive}} <b>search</b> <b>that</b> included interviews with several established head coaches, Frei's offensive line coach, Dick Enright, was elevated to head {{coach for the}} 1972 season. Enright was the least experienced candidate for the position, having been a high school coach until 1970, and he struggled to maintain team discipline and consistent play. Enright famously tried to make an option quarterback out of Dan Fouts, {{who was not a}} runner. Although his 1972 team did beat Oregon State {{for the first time in}} nine seasons, Enright's teams only won six games in two seasons. After complaining to the media about what he considered sub-standard conditions of football facilities, he was fired after the 1973 season, replaced by Don Read, his quarterback coach.|$|E
25|$|Thus began Swaminatha Iyer's long {{search for}} the {{original}} texts of ancient literary works during which he regularly worked with S. V. Damodaram Pillai. It was a <b>search</b> <b>that</b> lasted until his death. Many people voluntarily parted with the manuscripts in their possession. Swaminatha Iyer visited almost every hamlet and knocked at every door. He employed all the resources at his command {{to get at the}} works. As a result, a large number of literary works which were gathering dust as palm-leaf manuscripts in lofts, storerooms, boxes and cupboards saw the light of day. Of them, the Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai and Purananuru were received by Tamil lovers with a lot of enthusiasm. Purananuru, which mirrored the lives of Tamils during the Sangam period, prompted scholarly research on the subject. In a span of about five decades, Swaminatha Iyer published about 100 books, including minor poems, lyrics, puranas and bhakti (devotional) works.|$|E

500|$|The {{worst case}} is [...] {{iterations}} of the comparison loop, where the [...] notation denotes the floor function that rounds its argument to the next-smallest integer and [...] is the binary logarithm. The worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest {{level of the}} tree, equivalent to a binary <b>search</b> <b>that</b> has reduced to one element and, in each iteration, always eliminates the smaller subarray out of the two {{if they are not}} of equal size.|$|E
500|$|On April 18, in a {{trail of}} {{evidence}} stretching several hundred yards down a McAllen road, passersby found Garza's purse, her left shoe and her lace veil. Authorities and volunteers started a <b>search</b> <b>that</b> was the largest in Rio Grande Valley history at that time. A woman called the Garza home claiming to be Irene, saying {{that she had been}} kidnapped and taken to a hotel in nearby Hidalgo, but the call was found to have been a prank. Another person told an Edinburg waitress that he had killed Garza, but that was found to be a joke made after the man had been drinking heavily.|$|E
500|$|On average, {{assuming}} that each element is equally {{likely to be}} searched, the procedure will most likely find the target value the second-deepest level of the tree. This is equivalent to a binary <b>search</b> <b>that</b> completes one iteration before the worst case, reached after [...] iterations. However, the tree may be unbalanced, with the deepest level partially filled. Equivalently, the array may not be divided exactly in half by the search in some iterations, half of the time resulting in the smaller subarray being eliminated. This cannot occur if {{the size of the}} array is one less than a power of two, but otherwise the actual number of average iterations is slightly higher, at [...] iterations. In the best case, where the target value is the middle element of the array, its position is returned after one iteration.|$|E
