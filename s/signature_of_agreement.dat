40|$|At {{first the}} thesis focuses on {{describing}} historical context of Czech Republics {{entry to the}} European Union. It also specifies evolution of the relations of the Czech Republic and European Union, common commercial policy of Union, its Inner market and after-effects of the entry of Czech Republic to EU. It is foremost aimed at characterization of historical evolution of European Structural Funds {{that serves as the}} financial instruments of the regional policy of the European Union.

40|$|The {{international}} {{structure of}} the telecommunication market is changing rapidly, shaped by waves of privatization, technological progress and international activism of Multinational Companies and former national monopolists. With the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Basic Telecommunications and the Reference Paper of 1997, 69 member countries of the WTO have engaged {{in a process of}} liberalization of both trade and Foreign Direct Investment. To study the effects of such a process, I extend Mattoo, Oralleaga and Saggi (2001) to model FDI in the telecommunication sectors of transition and developing economies by considering explicitly a demand function with network externalities and capacity constraints. In this three-stage game the government decides how to liberalize, either through acquisition of national monopolists or direct entry of new operators, while the Multinational Corporation (MNC) decides on capacity expansion and on technology transfer. I provide econometric evidence using a panel of 46 transition and emerging economies for the period 1989 - 2000. Using a set of different indicators for the telecommunication sector, I show that privatization processes are significantly correlated with increases in teledensity and that the foreign participation in the incumbent generates positive benefits through an underlying non-linear relationship that also characterizes the theoretical model...|$|E
