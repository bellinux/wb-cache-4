25|$|McKittrick {{remained}} at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a drive-in bank. Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino {{that she had}} met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> anything to get custody of his grandson, but {{that the only way}} that would happen was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at Ben Taub Hospital, where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 {{on the day of the}} shooting. McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a not guilty plea, but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed. McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver and given a ten-year jail sentence. She was paroled after serving five years.|$|E
500|$|Although {{registered}} Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, {{which includes}} Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign {{offices in the}} city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{whatever it took to}} deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district [...] "in play". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Disney {{began to}} {{consider}} producing a sequel, {{but rather than}} using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. [...] "I was always very protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or things of that kind," [...] Burton explained. [...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it {{and the people that}} like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it." [...] The 2004 video game [...] did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice, and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor. In 2009, Selick <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.|$|E

Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), came into her studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at that time I called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. So can you force him to sign something, so he has to do a record with me? If I do this video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} his retirement, in May 1964, Governor John J. McKeithen came to his office hoping that Middleton would accept a job on a {{commission}} that he was forming. The governor was wanting to ease the state's growing racial tensions by creating a biracial commission composed of 21 blacks and 21 whites. The governor needed a chairman who would command {{a tremendous amount of}} respect, and his choice was Middleton. Middleton <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it for a year, beginning in 1965, but as had often happened in the past, the year stretched into five, and it wasn't until 1970 when the commission had reached its goals and was disbanded that Middleton was freed from this duty. [...] Middleton's black counterpart on the commission was Dr. Albert Dent, president of Dillard University in New Orleans, and the directors chosen to head the staff of this Commission on Human Relations, Rights, and Responsibilities were white attorney John Martzell and black attorney Jesse N. Stone. [...] Some of the potential trouble spots where the commission was able to have a positive effect included the towns of Ferriday and Opelousas, and the commission helped to open the ranks of the Louisiana State Police to qualified blacks. [...] The commission was disbanded in May 1970, after having effectively served its purpose, and the members each received a letter of thanks from the governor.|$|E

In 1990, Leonard finally offered Hagler a rematch which reportedly would have earned him $15m, but he declined. By then he had settled down to a new life as an actor in Italy and was now uninterested in boxing. He said [...] "A while ago, yeah, I wanted him so bad, but I'm over that." [...] At the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show Hagler and Leonard had a mock rematch by playing {{against each other in}} the video game Boxing Legends of the Ring, and claimed that an actual rematch was being planned.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} when Antiochus {{approached}} Ptolemy and meant to occupy Pelusium, Caius Popilius Laenas, the Roman commander, on Antiochus greeting him from a distance and then holding out his hand, handed to the king, as he had it by him, the copy of the senatus-consultum, {{and told him to}} read it first, not thinking it proper, as it seems to me, to make the conventional sign of friendship before he knew if the intentions of him who was greeting him were friendly or hostile. But when the king, after reading it, {{said he would like to}} communicate with his friends about this intelligence, Popilius acted in a manner which was thought to be offensive and exceedingly arrogant. He was carrying a stick cut from a vine, and with this he drew a circle round Antiochus and told him he must remain inside this circle until he gave his decision about the contents of the letter. The king was astonished at this authoritative proceeding, but, after a few moments' hesitation, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> all that the Romans demanded. Upon this Popilius and his suite all grasped him by the hand and greeted him warmly. The letter ordered him to put an end at once to the war with Ptolemy. So, as a fixed number of days were allowed to him, he led his army back to Syria, deeply hurt and complaining indeed, but yielding to circumstances for the present. Popilius after arranging matters in Alexandria and exhorting the two kings there to act in common, ordering them also to send Polyaratus to Rome, sailed for Cyprus, wishing to lose no time in expelling the Syrian troops that were in the island. When they arrived, finding that Ptolemy's generals had been defeated and that the affairs of Cyprus were generally in a topsy-turvy state, they soon made the Syrian army retire from the country, and waited until the troops took ship for Syria. In this way the Romans saved the kingdom of Ptolemy, which had almost been crushed out of existence: Fortune having so directed the matter of Perseus and Macedonia that when the position of Alexandria and the whole of Egypt was almost desperate, all was again set right simply owing to the fact that the fate of Perseus had been decided. For had this not been so, and had not Antiochus been certain of it, he would never, I think, have obeyed the Roman behests.

2500|$|In early 2016, Khan {{was seen}} in a {{supporting}} role in Shakun Batra's family drama Kapoor & Sons. The film, which featured Khan with an ensemble cast including Rishi Kapoor, Ratna Pathak Shah, Rajat Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra, and Alia Bhatt, became a commercial success upon its release, and Khan received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics for his portrayal of Rahul Kapoor, a writer who is revealed to be a closeted homosexual. Bollywood Hungama's review praised Khan's performance saying, [...] "As far as performances are concerned, the film totally belongs to Fawad Khan, Ratna Pathak Shah and Rajat Kapoor." [...] It continued, [...] "He surprises everyone with his exceptionally sensitive performance that can be rightly termed as a 'straight-from-the-heart' act. The emotional bond that his character develops with the audiences {{is so strong that}} almost everyone will want to have a son and a brother like him." [...] Writing for NDTV, Saibal Chaterjee said, [...] "On the acting front, Fawad Khan steals the show with an impressively modulated, confident performance as an achiever condemned to perpetually carry the burden of expectation and hide his true self behind a wall of falsehoods." [...] Kapoor & Sons also earned him the Diversity Award at Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Six actors, including Karan Johar, rejected the role of Rahul Kapoor. The film's producer said, [...] "We went to six actors and after six rejections, I told Shakun Batra (director) that we should drop the idea and he started developing another screenplay. Later, in a flash of thought Fawad came to my mind. I sent him the script, he loved it and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Later in 2016, he appeared in a small role opposite Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Karan Johar's romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Critics noted that Khan's role was too short to judge. Raja Sen of Rediff.com said, [...] "As the princely DJ, Fawad Khan has far too little to do in this film —though even a role with him on-screen throughout the film wouldn't have justified the ridiculous kerfuffle his casting has caused — but looks perfect for the part." [...] Subhash K. Jha of Deccan Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fawad's entry is welcome and his exit baffling. Why does he reject Anushka’s love? If you are a Fawad fan, his meagre presence and sketchy role would infuriate you." [...] Following the Uri terror attack, bilateral relations between India and Pakistan took a downturn resulting in the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPPA) and The Film Producers Guild of India deciding to ban all Pakistani artists from working in India until the situation normalises.|$|E
