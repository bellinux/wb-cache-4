5|$|The {{design of}} a state coat of arms or seal has {{generally}} been authorized by {{a provision in the}} state constitution or a legislative act. In most instances a committee (more often than not consisting of three members) was appointed to study the issue, <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> qualified artists, historians, legal scholars, etc., and report back to the authorizing legislative body with a design for their approval. Historically, this committee has consisted of notable members of society and elected officials.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} expression by the United States Supreme Court of {{adherence to}} this requirement {{came during the}} presidency of George Washington. Washington {{sent a letter to}} the Court asking for their approval should he choose to <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> them from time to time on matters that might not come before the Court in a timely manner. Chief Justice John Jay wrote in his response that, although the members of the Court had great confidence in the ability of the president to receive appropriate advice from his executive officers, the Court itself was constitutionally bound not to go beyond its role as an arbiter of judicial questions.|$|E
25|$|Some people, {{mostly in}} villages, have {{the belief that}} {{witchcraft}} and black magic are effective. On one hand, people may <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> witch doctors for health, financial or marital problems. On the other hand, people, especially women, are accused of witchcraft and attacked, occasionally killed. It {{has been reported that}} mostly widows or divorcees are targeted to rob them of their property. Reportedly, revered village witch-doctors are paid to brand specific persons as witches, {{so that they can be}} killed without repercussions. The existing laws have been considered ineffective in curbing the murders. In June 2013, National Commission for Women (NCW) reported that according to National Crime Records Bureau statistics, 768 women had been murdered for allegedly practising witchcraft since 2008, and announced plans for newer laws.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{a long-running}} program {{in place at}} Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was {{introduced}} in the fall of 2006. The program consists of an 8-minute session between the first two periods during which students of all grades meet with a teacher to whom they were randomly assigned {{at the beginning of the}} year. More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> an influential adult. Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions. Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents. Most students do not have their advisor as a classroom instructor. In most circumstances, students will have the same advisor for all four years of high school.|$|E

25|$|By 2012, SAORVIEW offered 98% {{coverage}} for all channels. This {{was a significant}} improvement in free-to-air television coverage. Consumers should <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> their specialist retailer or manufacturer if looking to make a purchase in the immediate future. Similar services such as Saorview available in the United Kingdom (i.e. Freeview) {{and other parts of}} Europe are not compatible with Ireland's DTT service. RTÉ recommends that consumers wishing to avail of the SAORVIEW service only purchase receivers that carry the SAORVIEW approved logo. In practice, however, most MPEG-4 DVB-T compatible equipment, such as that conforming to the UK's Freeview HD standard, is capable of receiving SAORVIEW transmissions, albeit with some limitations to the EPG function. As the Freeview HD system is based on the newer DVB-T2 standard, SAORVIEW reception is dependent on the backward-compatibility of such devices.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Germans and Italians enjoyed the feast which Hitler had intended for all the participants. During this break, Chamberlain adviser Sir Horace Wilson met with the Czechoslovaks; he informed them of the draft agreement and asked which districts were particularly important to them. The conference resumed at about 10pm and was mostly {{in the hands of a}} small drafting committee. At 1:30am the Munich Agreement was ready for signing, though the signing ceremony was delayed when Hitler discovered that the ornate inkwell on his desk was empty.|$|E

However, Peter Riegert did not reprise his role of Max Weinstein. Instead, voice actor Jeff Bergman, notable for playing Fred Flintstone in the show, voices him. In addition to Stein, Durning, Bergman, and the regular cast, child actor Max Burkholder and voice actor William Woodson guest {{starred in the}} episode. Recurring guest voice actors Johnny Brennan, actor Ralph Garman, writer Mark Hentemann, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener also made minor appearances.|$|E
500|$|The tax-driven {{nature of}} {{investment}} in the sector made it vulnerable to policy changes and court rulings interpreting tax law. Tax law reforms in the late 1990s resulting from a major review of tax policy (called the Ralph review) altered {{the way in which}} deductions could be claimed. These changes, together with company profit warnings, caused a decline in Great Southern's share price and its business prospects in 2000 and 2001. Although Great Southern survived the reforms, another company, Australian Plantation Timber, was driven into administration. In June 2001 a Senate committee report was critical of Australian Taxation Office (ATO) advice on forestry investments, and the ATO released a statement reassuring forest product investors that they had investment certainty. MIS schemes recovered in 2002, despite a further Senate Committee report critical of mass-marketed investment schemes, that recommended [...] "that the government <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> both ASIC and the ACCC {{on the question of the}} adequacy of the current measures for monitoring the schemes market, with particular reference to agribusiness and franchise schemes".|$|E

[...] He did not <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a [...] "surprise." [...] Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter's run was an attempt to find [...] "something to do" [...] in preparation for his loss of the Armed Services Committee chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House. Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign's success.

Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing [...] "but after all if I could not get the woman I loved it would be a comfort for a little while to devote myself to another". For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> a friend (a [...] "sponsor").

Robin enters, claiming to <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> Rose about [...] "a friend" [...] who is in love. Rose says that she has such a friend too, but Robin is too shy to take the hint.

[...] On September 26, the parliament accepted 19 of the proposed changes but denied 6 one of which is to delay the full implementation of the law to 2027 and it became enacted on September 30.

2500|$|Bernstein {{also met}} the {{conductor}} Dimitri Mitropoulos at the time. Although he never taught Bernstein, Mitropoulos's charisma and {{power as a}} musician was {{a major influence on}} Bernstein's eventual decision to take up conducting. Mitropoulos was not stylistically that similar to Bernstein, but he probably influenced some of Bernstein's later habits such as his conducting from the keyboard, his initial practice of conducting without a baton and perhaps his interest in Mahler. The other important influence that Bernstein first met during his Harvard years was composer Aaron Copland, whom he met at a concert and then at a party afterwards on Copland's birthday in 1938. At the party Bernstein played Copland's Piano Variations, a thorny work Bernstein loved without knowing anything about its composer until that evening. Although he was not formally Copland's student as such, Bernstein would regularly <b>seek</b> <b>advice</b> <b>from</b> Copland in the following years about his own compositions and would often cite him as [...] "his only real composition teacher".|$|E
