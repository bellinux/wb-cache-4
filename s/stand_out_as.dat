5|$|Seamounts are a {{possible}} future source of economically important metals. Even though the ocean makes up 70% of Earth's surface area, technological challenges with {{deep sea mining}} have severely limited its extent. But with the constantly decreasing supply on land, many see oceanic mining as the destined future, and seamounts <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> candidates.|$|E
5|$|Inside Olivia's mind, Walter and Peter {{find they}} <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> invaders, {{and the people}} that {{populate}} her mind, including a vision of her step-father (Chris Bradford), seek to stop them. Walter sees someone sending a Morse code signal from William Bell's office in one of the World Trade Center buildings. After evading a crowd and a trap set by a false vision of Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), they arrive at Bell's office, where they find William waiting for them as an animated cartoon.|$|E

A few lines or words <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> they are written in rustic capitals. Over time, the parchment has slightly warped, {{and there is a}} fold {{in the middle of the}} document. It is presented in a permanent exhibition of the State Archives of Lower Saxony in a dimly lit room.|$|E

5|$|As traders sailed farther east, the voyages became {{longer and}} more expensivea Smaller {{enterprises}} were merged into larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began to <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most}} important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{devoted his}} life entirely to his profession, {{remaining}} single. He {{is known to have}} been attracted to only one woman—Josefa Moreu, teacher at the Mataró Cooperative, in 1884—but this was not reciprocated. Thereafter Gaudí took refuge in the profound spiritual peace his Catholic faith offered him. Gaudí is often depicted as unsociable and unpleasant, a man of gruff reactions and arrogant gestures. However, those who were close to him described him as friendly and polite, pleasant to talk to and faithful to friends. Among these, his patrons Eusebi Güell and the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, <b>stand</b> <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> well as the writers Joan Maragall and Jacint Verdaguer, the physician Pere Santaló and some of his most faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Llorenç Matamala.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} migration between the Nordic countries, but {{owing to the}} similarity between the cultures and languages (with the exception of Finnish), expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a group. According to the 2000 United States Census, some 67,000 people {{over the age of}} five were reported as Swedish speakers, though without any information on the degree of language proficiency. Similarly, there were 16,915 reported Swedish speakers in Canada from the 2001 census. Although there are no certain numbers, some 40,000 Swedes are estimated to live in the London area in the United Kingdom. Outside Sweden and Finland, there are about 40,000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E

25|$|Looking at the {{cultural}} assemblages of this period, two sequences in particular <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> possible archeological correlates {{of the earliest}} Nostratians or their immediate precursors.

25|$|Fatwas {{have the}} role of {{explaining}} religion and guiding the faithful in modern matters that were not previously tackled by scholars or specifically addressed by the Quran or the Hadith of Mohammed. Some fatwas <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> controversial and often lead to hardship, violence and misunderstanding of religion.|$|E
25|$|Several Tang poets <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> {{being to}} individualistic {{to really be}} {{considered}} a group, yet sharing a common interest in experimental exploration {{of the relationship of}} poetry to words, and pushing the limits thereof; including: Han Yu (韩愈, 768-824), Meng Jiao (孟郊, 751-814), Jia Dao (賈島/贾岛, 779-843), and Lu Tong (盧仝/卢仝, 795-835).|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} nations with modern air forces, Iraq {{was engaged in}} an intense and {{protracted}} war. The 8 year long conflict with Iran gave the Air Force {{the opportunity to develop}} some battle-tested and hardened fighter pilots.

In the last two decades of Catherine's life, only two painters <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> recognisable personalities, Antoine Caron and Jean Cousin the Younger. The majority of paintings and portrait drawings that have survived from the late Valois period remain difficult or impossible to attribute to particular artists.|$|E
25|$|Manuel Noriega became {{politically}} active at this time, {{and joined the}} Socialist party's youth wing. He did not <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> {{a leader in the}} movement, preferring instead to stick to his books. But he wrote and published nationalist poems and articles attacking the US presence in Panama as an affront to attacking to Panamanian sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wider}} context of Graeco-Roman {{religious}} culture, Rome's earliest reported portents and prodigies <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> atypically dire. Whereas for Romans, a comet presaged misfortune, for Greeks it might equally signal a divine or exceptionally fortunate birth. In the late Republic, a daytime comet at the murdered Julius Caesar's funeral games confirmed his deification; a discernible Greek influence on Roman interpretation.|$|E

25|$|Coral reef {{fish are}} fish which live amongst or in close {{relation}} to coral reefs. Coral reefs form complex ecosystems with tremendous biodiversity. Among the myriad inhabitants, the fish <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> colourful and interesting to watch. Hundreds of species can {{exist in a}} small area of a healthy reef, many of them hidden or well camouflaged. Reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the job, three {{determinants}} <b>stand</b> <b>out</b> <b>as</b> {{predictors of}} performance: (1) general mental ability (especially for jobs higher in complexity); (2) job experience (although {{there is a}} law of diminishing returns); and (3) the personality trait of conscientiousness (people who are dependable and achievement-oriented, who plan well). These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job knowledge and the motivation to do well. Further, an expanding area of research in job performance determinants includes emotional intelligence.|$|E
