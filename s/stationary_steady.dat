Depending on the reconstruction step, the second-order {{versions of the}} schemes there could be made either well-balanced or positivity preserving, but fail to satisfy both properties simultaneously. Here, we introduce an improved second-order central-upwind scheme which, unlike its forerunners, is capable to both preserve <b>stationary</b> <b>steady</b> states (lake at rest) and to guarantee the positivity of the computed fluid depth. Another novel property of the proposed scheme is its applicability to models with discontinuous bottom topography.

40|$|Vertical {{concentration}} {{profiles of}} nitrate in interstitial water of sediment in the Sluice Dock at Ostend (Belgium) commonly show a maximum in nitrate concentration {{at a few}} centimeters depth where sediments are sandy and poor in organic matter, while in muddy and organic-rich sediments, nitrate is lower in interstitial water than in the overlying water and decreases rapidly with depth. Direct measurements of the activity of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria in the sediments show nitrification in the upper few centimeters of sandy sediments but not in muddy sediments.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{empirical}} financial time series data exhibit long memory phenomena: the behaviour of the market at various times in the past continues to exert an influence in the present. One explanation for these phenomena is that they result from a process of social learning in which poorly performing agents switch their strategy to that of other agents who appear to be more successful. We test this explanation using an agent based model and we find that the stability of the model {{is directly related to the}} dynamics of the learning process; models in which learning converges to a <b>stationary</b> <b>steady</b> state fail to produce realistic time series data. In contrast, models in which learning leads to dynamic switching behaviour in the steady state are able to reproduce the long memory phenomena.

40|$|A {{modified}} lattice Boltzmann {{model is}} proposed to describe {{shallow water flows}} over complex topography. In the proposed model, the quadratic depth term is excluded from the equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs), and the hydrostatic pressure term is combined with the bed slope term {{to be treated as}} a part of the sourcing term in the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). Therefore, it is unnecessary to match the coefficients of the quadratic depth term in the EDFs with those of the bed slope term in the sourcing terms in the LBE. This would bring more flexibility to the treatment of the sourcing terms in the LBE. In order to recover the shallow water equations (SWEs), the basic constraints are redefined, and under these constraints, the coefficients of the EDFs are derived afterwards. Several benchmark problems are used to validate the proposed model, including <b>stationary</b> case, <b>steady</b> flows over a two-dimensional bump and tidal wave flows over irregular bed elevation. The computed results are in excellent agreement with the results of the other numerical methods and the analytical solutions, indicating that the proposed model is capable of simulating shallow water flows over complex bathymetry.
