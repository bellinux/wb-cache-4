50|$|The <b>scaled</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Patagioenas speciosa) {{is a large}} New World {{tropical}} dove. It is {{a resident}} breeder from southern Mexico south to western Ecuador, southern Brazil, northern Argentina, and Trinidad.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scaled</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{has been}} {{recorded}} as successfully nesting on a fern (Pteridium aquilinum at ground level, and in the canopy of the tree fern Cyathea cyatheoides). The pearl kite visits nests of this species as a natural predator.|$|E
50|$|The <b>scaled</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{is fairly}} common in semi-open forest. It builds a stick {{platform}} nest {{in a tree}} and lays two white eggs.Its flight is high, fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It is usually very wary, since it is frequently hunted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scaled</b> <b>pigeons</b> feed {{mainly on}} forest fruits and seeds. The call {{is a series}} of deep cooing cro ku-ks that differs {{markedly}} from that of its relatives, such as the white-crowned pigeon. This is a solitary bird which does not form flocks.|$|R
30|$|On {{a larger}} <b>scale,</b> <b>pigeon</b> control does not {{influence}} the actual population size (Krimowa 2012) but simply displaces individuals {{away from the}} deterring systems to untreated buildings or sites (Mooallem 2006; Geigenfeind 2013). Nevertheless, {{a decline in the}} pigeon population index on campus after the control structures were implemented was noted and a 23  % reduction in the pigeon population index between the baseline year and the management year on the untreated building occurred. It can therefore be inferred that no pigeons which previously inhabited the treated buildings moved to the untreated control building.|$|R
40|$|In a concurrent-chains procedure, pigeons chose between {{outcomes}} that differed {{in the rate}} of response-independent delivery of food and electric shocks. The application of functional measurement techniques confirmed the matching relation—between choice and rate of reinforcement value—for two of three <b>pigeons.</b> <b>Scale</b> values of the outcomes were extracted for the two birds that conformed to matching, and the value of a single occurrence of shock per minute—in terms of negative food units—was estimated. A second experiment with concurrent chains provided a test of these parameter estimates. The close correspondence between predicted and obtained choice behavior found in Experiment II indicated that the estimates of outcome value were indeed reliable. Both experiments together support the contention that the effects on choice behavior of positive and aversive stimuli appear to be equal, though opposite in sign...|$|R
50|$|The <b>scaled</b> <b>pigeon</b> is 36 cm {{long and}} weighs {{normally}} about 290 g. Adult males have mainly purple brown plumage, with a paler scaly appearance {{to the neck}} and underparts. The lower underparts are whitish edged with purple. The eyering, legs and bill are red, the latter having a white tip. The female is dull dark brown rather than purplish, and is slightly smaller than the male.|$|E
50|$|It may in {{the field}} {{resemble}} a <b>scaled</b> <b>pigeon</b> (P. speciosa), which has a similar display flight. These two large species are also the only pigeons in their range which are often seen flying in the open away from forests. But of course P. cayennensis lacks the scaly appearance, and the calls and appearance from close by indicate that the two are not particularly close relatives among their congeners.|$|E
50|$|The white-crowned pigeon {{can measure}} 29 - 35 cm in length, span 48 - 59 cm across the wings, and weigh 150 - 301 g. It {{is around the}} same size as the common rock pigeon, but weighs a bit less since it is {{generally}} less chunky and has a relatively longer tail. The adult is dark grey, with green and white bars on the nape, a brilliant white crown to the head, a white iris, and a pale-tipped red bill. Juveniles are a less dark shade of grey, lack the nape pattern and white iris, and show only a few pale feathers on the crown. The song is a series of mourning dove-like woo pop woooo calls; this species is a member of a diverse clade of Patagioenas which vary much in appearance, but are united by their triple coos (except in the <b>scaled</b> <b>pigeon).</b>|$|E

40|$|Sangay National Park {{is located}} at the mid-eastern Andean foothills of the Cordillera Oriental of Ecuador. We present a {{preliminary}} avifauna inventory corresponding to the lower zone of the Sangay National Park (SNP). One-hundred and twenty-seven bird species belonging to 39 families were recorded, including noteworthy records that represent range extensions for four species, Phaetornis hispidus (Gould 1846) (White-bearded Hermit), Ramphastos ambiguus Swainson 1823 (Black-mandibled Toucan), Phylloscartes orbitalis (Cabanis 1873) (Spectacled Bristle Tyrant), and Microcerculus bambla (Boddaert 1783) (Wing-banded Wren). We also obtained information on threatened species such as Aburria aburri (Lesson 1828) (Wattled Guan), Phlogophilus hemileucurus Gould 1860 (Ecuadorian Piedtail), and Dendroica cerulea (Wilson 1810) (Cerulean Warbler) and reproductive data on one species, Patagioenas speciosa (Gmelin 1789) (<b>Scaled</b> <b>Pigeon).</b> To our knowledge this is a first ornithological survey carried out at this specific site of the SNP...|$|E
