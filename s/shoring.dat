5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement {{at the end of}} the tunnel {{enlargement}} work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. A collapse on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary <b>shoring</b> near Elephant & Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a gas main exploded, causing a water main to break and leaving a water-filled crater in the middle of the street. The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|The tunnels were {{enlarged}} {{by removing}} {{several of the}} cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers.

5|$|By late 1988, the Pioneer Square station {{structure}} was 70 percent complete, and work had begun on the station's entrances and the vaulted ceiling.

In late 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham was forced to remove steel beams used for temporary <b>shoring</b> at the station box after unknowingly sourcing it from South Africa. Metro later acquired South African black granite {{to be used in the}} station's platform and mezzanine, which was discovered and returned; the incident resulted in the resignation of Metro's executive director, amid outcry from African American leaders.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault.

5|$|With the {{initiative}} {{back with the}} Germans and Italians, Kesselring hoped to launch an offensive that would drive the Allies out of North Africa.

Kesselring now concentrated on <b>shoring</b> up his forces by moving the required tonnages of supplies from Sicily but his efforts were frustrated by Allied aircraft and submarines. An Allied offensive in April finally broke through, leading to a collapse of the Axis position in Tunisia. Some 275,000 German and Italian prisoners were taken. In return, Kesselring had, however, held up the Allies in Tunisia for six months, forcing a postponement of the Allied invasion of Northern France from the middle of 1943 to the middle of 1944.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Andronikos II, who had disbanded the Byzantine {{army and}} navy, and who favoured monks and intellectuals, Andronikos III was an {{energetic}} ruler who personally led his forces in military campaigns. In 1329, his first {{campaign against the}} Ottomans resulted in a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Pelekanos, after which the Byzantine position in Bithynia rapidly collapsed. Subsequent sorties into the Balkans were nevertheless successful in <b>shoring</b> up Andronikos' tottering realm. Thessaly and the Despotate of Epirus, two territories separated from the Empire after the Fourth Crusade, were restored to imperial rule, almost without bloodshed in 1328 and 1337 respectively. Andronikos III also rebuilt a modest fleet, which allowed him to recover the rich and strategically placed island of Chios from the Genoese Zaccaria family in 1329 {{as well as to}} claim the allegiance of Andreolo Cattaneo, the Genoese governor of Phocaea on the Anatolian mainland. In 1335, however, Andreolo's son Domenico captured the island of Lesbos with Genoese assistance. The Emperor led a fleet to recover it and Phocaea, and requested the aid of the Turkish emirs of Saruhan and Aydin. Saruhan sent troops and supplies, but Aydin's ruler Umur Beg came to meet the Emperor in person. It was during this encounter that Kantakouzenos and Umur established a long-lasting close friendship and alliance.|$|E

40|$|The author {{surveyed}} the <b>shores</b> along the steep, indented coasts {{in order to}} illustrate the evolution of <b>shore</b> forms (i. e., depositional forms according to King(1972, p. 502). In each <b>shore,</b> grain size and roundness were measured and <b>shore</b> profiles were surveyed. (1) The <b>shore</b> sediments at Nagashima are supplied by the Akabane river. At the other <b>shores</b> they are originated from adjacent sea cliffs, but at Miura <b>shore,</b> they are supplied both from the Ohse river and from sea cliff. However, the small embayed <b>shores</b> (e. g., No. 231 <b>shore,</b> Shukuura <b>shore,</b> etc) are still being supplied with their sediments from adjoining cliffs. (2) In these areas, there is longshore drift of sediments in each <b>shore.</b> And main moving particles are below 32 mm, for the particles 32 mm have high roundness by compared with those above 32 mm. (3) In these <b>shores,</b> the sediments have lower roundness of sediments than Kumanoura <b>shore</b> (NAKAYAMA, 1965) and Atsumi <b>shore</b> (YAMANOUSHI, 1967). Calling them ‘exposed shore’, we could classify those of present examination into two types {{from the viewpoint of}} ‘roundness’, : ‘partially exposed shores' and ‘embayed shores’. For example, the former is No. 238 <b>shore,</b> the latter is No. 231 <b>shore</b> (see in fig. 1.). (4) The ‘partially exposed shores' are relatively large among the <b>shores</b> in these areas. They are classified as barriers (with lagoon or marsh) as to <b>shore</b> form. On the other hand, ‘embayed shores' are smaller than the former. Their forms belongs mostly to beach type, valley below 10 m in height penetrates deeply inland. (5) Based on the matters above mentioned, the author classified the forms and formations of the <b>shores</b> in the areas as illuslated in tab. 3...|$|R
