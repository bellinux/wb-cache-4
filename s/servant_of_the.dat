He was survived by his four sons; his wife Hilda had died in 1936. His memoirs, Prosper the Commonwealth, were {{published}} posthumously in 1958, having been completed shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her vampire novels, Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints (adapted for television in 2001) and <b>Servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bones, which {{formed the basis of}} a 2011 comic book miniseries. Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers. Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A.N.Roquelaure, including Exit to Eden, which was later adapted into a 1994 film.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough's {{weakness}} during Anne's reign {{lay in the}} English political scene. His {{determination to}} preserve {{the independence of the}} Queen's administration from control of party faction initially enjoyed full support, but once royal favour turned elsewhere, the Duke, like his key ally Godolphin, found himself isolated; first becoming little more than a <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Whigs, then a victim of the Tories.|$|E

5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} elsewhere and he was a <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime. He was not exactly a shining liberal or Social Democrat. Mostly, he was interested in his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} Szigeti's appeal to composers was {{articulated}} by Bloch {{upon completion of}} his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere {{would have to be}} delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music.|$|E
5|$|With {{the removal}} of Constantine VI, Irene {{henceforth}} reigned alone, the first Byzantine empress to do so. Staurakios, however, found his own position increasingly challenged by another powerful eunuch and trusted <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empress, Aetios. Both were engaged in an intense rivalry to place their relatives {{in positions of power}} so as to secure control of the Empire after Irene's death.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the current}} owner Charles Spencer professes to have never {{witnessed}} a ghost at Althorp or anywhere else, {{over the years}} numerous ghostly sightings {{have been reported in}} the mansion. In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed out around the bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E
5|$|Day's {{origins and}} the events of his early life remain obscure. Scholars have assumed that Day {{was born and raised}} in Dunwich, but there is no direct {{evidence}} that proves this claim. He may have been in London by 1540, as his name is mentioned in a city deposition as being a former <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> printer and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546, he was probably one of twenty men who were granted the freedom of the city by redemption to work for the Stringers' Company of London.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt is {{the main}} {{character}} in only two books of the Paths of Darkness series. The Silent Blade (1998) describes the group's journey to permanently destroy the Crystal Shard. Sea of Swords (2001) continues Drizzt's story after the events of The Spine of the World (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and <b>Servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shard (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle as the main characters. Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} his {{historical}} interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered Grand Pensionary of Holland, Johan de Witt (1625–1672). The statue {{was designed and}} made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close {{to the place where}} De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the freedom of the seas, caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.' Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus: Uprising {{takes place}} in a setting based loosely around Greek mythology. The main protagonist is the angel Pit, <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goddess of Light Palutena. When the Goddess of Darkness Medusa returns to destroy humanity, Pit goes on {{missions}} first against her, then against the forces of Hades, Lord of the Underworld and the source behind Medusa's return. During gameplay, players control Pit during airborne rail shooter segments and ground-based third-person shooter segments. In addition to the single-player campaign, multiple multiplayer modes are available, with competitive modes available for up to six players.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Carlos Casas {{conceptualized}} <b>the</b> birth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Our Lady <b>of</b> Lourdes Hospital on July 15, 1948 and was co-managed by Dr. Basilio Valdes {{as medical}} director. Nuns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missionary Sisters <b>Servants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit {{were asked to}} join its nursing staff during post-war Manila. It was then an unnamed hospital. The hospital was then bought by <b>the</b> Missionary Sisters <b>Servants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit from Dr. Casas and Valdes.|$|R
50|$|German diocesan priest, Father Arnold Janssen {{established}} three congregations {{dedicated to}} <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> evangelization: in 1875, <b>the</b> Society <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Divine Word, commonly called the SVD; in 1889, <b>the</b> Missionary Sisters, <b>Servants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit, and in 1896, <b>the</b> Missionary Sisters <b>Servants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit <b>of</b> Perpetual Adoration, commonly called the Pink Sisters.

5|$|The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the {{original}} Sanskrit, {{the name is}} written as Tulasīdāsa. Using the Hunterian transliteration system, it is written as Tulsidas or Tulsīdās reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are {{an aspect of the}} Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Tulasī, which is an Indian variety of the basil plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means slave or servant and by extension, devotee. Tulsidas, which means a <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant Tulsi.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} wildling Osha, now a <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Starks, is {{harassed by}} Theon Greyjoy, who warns {{her that if}} she had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.|$|E
5|$|The war {{had claimed}} {{the lives of}} nine Arsenal first team players, the most of any top flight club, and the {{intervening}} time had cut short the careers of several others, including Bastin and Drake. Additionally, the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden, and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946. They lost 6–1 on aggregate to West Ham United in the third round of the 1945–46 FA Cup, and upon the league's resumption in 1946–47 the club finished 13th, their worst in 17 years. George Allison decided to retire from football {{at the end of that}} season, and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker, a long-time <b>servant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club who had been trainer under Chapman.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of what he}} saw as a need {{to serve}} the poor, Bojanowski was able to found an order <b>of</b> nuns, called <b>the</b> {{congregation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sisters <b>Servants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Immaculate Conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mother <b>of</b> God (Sióstr Służebniczek Bogarodzicy Dziewicy Niepokalanie Poczętej). This later led to <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> separate orders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> congregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sisters <b>Servants</b> <b>of</b> Mary Immaculate (Sióstr Służebniczek Najświętszej Maryi Panny Niepokalanie Poczętej) in Poznań, Przemyśl, Wrocław, and Dębica (Tarnow). In 1867 Bojanowski authorized <b>the</b> founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poor <b>Servants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mother <b>of</b> God headed by Frances Margaret Taylor in England.|$|R
