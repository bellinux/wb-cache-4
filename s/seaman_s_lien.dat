40|$|Since September 20, 1957, the Nebraska {{oil and gas}} lien statute {{has been}} in effect. Prior to its passage, Nebraska had only a general {{mechanic}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute. With a growing oil and gas drilling industry, it soon became apparent that due to the complexities and uniqueness of {{the oil and gas}} drilling business, the general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute had many shortcomings when it was stretched to include this industry. In some of these states the oil and gas drilling industry was brought within the terms of the more general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes either by judicial construction or by slight amendment of their already existing mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes. In other jurisdictions, particularly those with a significant oil and gas drilling industry, special oil and gas lien statutes were enacted. Even though Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute can and often does cover many wide and varied contingencies, the complexities of the oil and gas drilling industry convinced many that a special statute, addressed specifically to this growing industry, was needed. As the oil and gas drilling industry in Nebraska grows in significance, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s oil and gas lien statute will likewise grow in significance. It should become a necessary and familiar tool to those attorneys who do oil and gas work in Nebraska. While Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s statute is similar to other oil and gas lien statutes, many questions concerning this statute are at present unanswered...|$|R

A creditor asserting a security interest in his debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property is likely to find himself in competition with a wide assortment of other claimants.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{one aspect}} of the law regarding the satisfaction of judgments: when a creditor is determined to have a lien on property of the debtor. The unnecessary cumbersomeness of the present system, which limits the ability of creditors to promptly obtain a legally cognizable interest in specific property, hampers creditors in preventing the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s use, sale, or hypothecation of property {{that could be used to}} satisfy their debts. This is particularly true of intangible property and property where federal law or the law of sister states controls transfers. Not only do judgment creditors face the risk that the debtor will voluntarily dissipate or transfer assets, but also the risk that they will be defeated by subsequent parties who deal with the debtor, become creditors, and are able to find assets. Possibly the most pernicious of those subsequent creditors are the federal and state taxing authorities. The tax lien, once filed, locks in all personal and real property of the debtor. Bankruptcy also presents a serious difficulty for the judgment creditor. If the debtor files for bankruptcy before the creditor can locate personal property of the debtor, the creditor (despite having obtained a judgment) has no greater priority than all of the unsecured creditors of the debtor. If the judgment creditor locates personal property and obtains a lien on that property shortly before the date that the debtor files a Bankruptcy petition, the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> can be avoided as a preference. Even where a debtor files a Chapter 11 petition and maintains control of the business as a debtor in possession, the debtor can still use the preference section to avoid the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien.</b> This article proposes that the computer systems currently being introduced to automate court systems around the country serve as the vehicle for the implementation of major reforms in the substantive and procedural law regarding judicial liens. The most significant change would involve the creation of statewide judgment liens on virtually all of the property of the debtor. This article will explore how the proposed system might deal with various types of property and particular third parties, and how to solve some of the transitional problems involved in adopting such a system. The changes proposed are incorporated in a Model Judgment Lien Act (MJLA) which is set forth in the Appendix of this article. It is hoped that the MJLA makes clear precisely how the rules discussed in the article would operate...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{inside the}} nuclei of cells is folded into an {{intricate}} three-dimensional (3 D) structure that influences {{how and when}} genes are turned on and off. For example, 3 D interactions between distal regulatory elements, such as enhancers and their promoter targets {{are known to be}} responsible for regulating a range of genes with cell-type specific functions. Recent technologies coupling chromosome conformation capture to next-generation sequencing, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, allow for genome-wide identification of 3 D interactions at unprecedented resolution. However, analysis is challenging due to the complexity of the data. This PhD-thesis presents several statistical models and computational tools to analyze such data, based on realistic assumptions regarding the underlying properties of chromatin structure. The thesis presents a model for analysis of 3 D co-localization of selected elements in the genome. Additionally, the thesis presents a web-based analysis server called HiBrowse ([URL] for performing statistical analysis of 3 D genomes in a range of different settings. Finally, the thesis presents a statistical model for ChIA-PET data, allowing for accurate identification of significant interactions between regulatory regions in the genome.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to continue the dialogue begun by the proposed Restatement and has two distinct goals in this effort. Parts I through III argue that {{the position of the}} Restatement drafters is both legally and functionally sound and that bankruptcy courts should embrace and apply the proposed Restatement in administering distressed real estate developments. Part I reviews the reasoning articulated in the hotel bankruptcy cases, demonstrating how courts have applied the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and state law in a formalistic manner to extinguish the hotel mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> upon postpetition room revenues. Part II rejects the analysis of the hotel bankruptcy cases on legal grounds. Although the drafters of the proposed Restatement appear to base their recommendations purely upon the functional similarity of rents and hotel room revenues, bankruptcy courts properly may characterize hotel room revenues as “rent” in the nature of real property. The notion that a licensee may pay “rent” in exchange for its constituent rights respecting the land is consistent with the original common law scope of the term “rent,” as well as the nature and scope of the term within the civil law tradition. Part III then criticizes the hotel bankruptcy cases on policy grounds, demonstrating that financial and economic realities do not justify distinguishing between real estate projects based solely upon the status of the occupier as a tenant rather than a licensee. To the developer and the mortgagee, the occupancy revenues generated by the apartment and the hotel are economically identical. Accordingly, sound commercial policy dictates that security law should treat hotel mortgagees with liens upon hotel room revenues no differently than apartment mortgagees holding liens upon rents...|$|R

40|$|Creditors {{have more}} than a dozen prejudgment, no-notice {{remedies}} which permit them to seize or encumber a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property even before the creditor has sued the debtor and recovered a judgment. Moreover, a creditor may take a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property without giving the debtor prior notice and the opportunity to oppose the taking in a judicial proceeding. These extraordinary remedies have been employed in England and the United States for centuries and in the 1920 s the Supreme Court affirmed their constitutionality. However, in a set of decisions beginning in with Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. in 1969 and Fuentes v. Shevin in 1972, the Supreme Court laid down the broad principle that, except in extraordinary circumstances, no private citizen could use the courts to summarily seize another person 2 ̆ 7 s property. Now, however, the Supreme Court is retreating from these decisions, signalled by its actions in three cases decided in May 1974 which, respectively, rehabilitated replevin, upheld the constitutionality of mechanics 2 ̆ 7 and materialmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liens,</b> and held that cognovits were valid. The author surveys current Supreme Court jurisprudence on creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies, analyzing the constitutionality of: I. Liens which do not disturb possession, II. Judicial remedies of secured creditors, III. Judicial remedies of unsecured creditors, and IV. Self-help remedies. The author argues that it was a mistake for the Supreme Court to invalidate various no-notice creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies on due process grounds because the vindication of abstract and subjective notions of procedural due process is not the business of the courts. The author concludes that the present Court is more likely to defer to the judgment of the peoples 2 ̆ 7 legislators and, as such, creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies which inflict no injustice on debtors in general or upon a particular debtor in a given case will pass constitutional muster despite the absence of prior notice and the opportunity for a hearing...|$|R
