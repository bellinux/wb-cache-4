40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether perfusion-weighted and proton <b>spectroscopic</b> MR <b>imaging</b> {{can be used}} to differentiate high-grade primary gliomas and solitary metastases on the basis of differences in vascularity and metabolite levels in the peritumoral region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with a solitary brain tumor (33 gliomas, 18 metastases) underwent conventional, contrast material [...] enhanced perfusion-weighted, and proton <b>spectroscopic</b> MR <b>imaging</b> before surgical resection or stereotactic biopsy. Of the 33 patients with gliomas, 22 underwent perfusion-weighted MR imaging; nine, spectroscopic MR imaging; and two underwent both. Of the 18 patients with metastases, 12 underwent perfusion-weighted MR <b>imaging,</b> and six, <b>spectroscopic</b> MR <b>imaging.</b> The peritumoral region was defined as the area in the white matter immediately adjacent to the enhancing (hyperintense on T 2 -weighted images, but not enhancing on postcontrast T 1 -weighted images) portion of the tumor. Relative cerebral blood volumes in these regions were calculated from perfusion-weighted MR data. Spectra from the enhancing tumor, the peritumoral region, and normal brain were obtained from the two-dimensional spectroscopic MR acquisition. The Student t test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in relative cerebral blood volume and metabolic ratios between high-grade gliomas and metastases. RESULTS: The measured relative cerebral blood volumes in the peritumoral region in high-grade gliomas and metastases were 1. 31 +/- 0. 97 (mean +/- SD) and 0. 39 +/- 0. 19, respectively.
