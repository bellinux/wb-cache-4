25|$|In a mixed-domain {{oscilloscope}} (MDO) {{you have}} an additional RF input port that goes into a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> part. It links those traditionally separate instruments, {{so that you can}} e.g. time correlate events in the time domain (like a specific serial data package) with events happening in the frequency domain (like RF transmissions).|$|E
25|$|SETI Net started {{operation}} in the early 1980s {{as a way to}} learn about the science of the search, and has developed several software packages for the amateur SETI community. It has provided an astronomical clock, a file manager to keep track of SETI data files, a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> optimized for amateur SETI, remote control of the station from the Internet, and other packages.|$|E
25|$|Pulse-Doppler signal {{processing}} includes frequency filtering in the detection process. The space between each transmit pulse {{is divided into}} range cells or range gates. Each cell is filtered independently much like the process used by a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> to produce the display showing different frequencies. Each different distance produces a different spectrum. These spectra are used to perform the detection process. This is required to achieve acceptable performance in hostile environments involving weather, terrain, and electronic countermeasures.|$|E

500|$|The first sensors {{utilized}} {{by the program}} were Air-Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detector (ADSID), which had been developed from devices then in use in underground mapping for the oil industry. The device could sense vertical earth motion {{by the use of}} an internal geophone and could determine whether a man or a vehicle was in motion at a range of [...] and [...] respectively. The first acoustic sensors were developed from the U.S. Navy's Project Jezebel anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys, which recorded and processed sound by the utilization of an audio <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer.</b> The first model of seismic detectors (Phase I) outshone their contemporary acoustic types in {{the quality and quantity of}} the information they reported. The Phase I models of both the acoustic and seismic sensors were only available for operation in a continuous mode, which meant that under normal conditions, their lithium batteries would function for approximately 30 days.|$|E
500|$|Vampire Weekend {{concentrated}} {{their efforts}} on giving each recording [...] "warmth", feeling that modern digital recordings lacked the sound quality of older records. In {{an attempt to make}} the tracks sound less harsh, the band and their recording engineers used a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer,</b> Sonnox SuprEsser and heavily automated EQs to edit out harsher, colder frequencies and soften the mix. Vampire Weekend painstakingly listened to the record several separate times using technology from standard commercial iPod earbuds to professional equipment to ensure the record sounded nice regardless of equipment the listener owned. Desiring to [...] "check the relative warmth levels", the engineers would [...] "go in and perform surgery and automate EQs" [...] {{in order to make the}} mixes listenable. The band felt the finished product was something of a third chapter and a continuation of material explored in their previous two efforts. [...] "We thought these three albums should look like they belong together on a bookshelf", said Batmanglij. [...] "We realized that there are things connecting the songs across three albums, like an invisible hand was guiding us. It does feel like we've been able to create three distinct worlds for each album, and yet have them be interconnected." ...|$|E

30|$|In summary, <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{are made}} for fast {{visualization}} of various signals and performing sophisticated off-line analysis. The capability of <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> are far beyond FFT or storing raw samples; however, they lack the capabilities of continuous recording and fast data transfer, hence are not suitable for basic channel assessment.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers,</b> in the 1960s, were swept-tuned instruments.|$|R
2500|$|Version 1.006 was {{released}} June 7, 1997, renamed [...] "Winamp" [...] (lowercase). It showed a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> and color-changing volume slider, but no waveform display. [...] The AMP non-commercial license {{was included in}} its help menu.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Harvard University {{physicist}} Paul Horowitz took {{the next step}} and proposed {{the design of a}} <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> specifically intended to search for SETI transmissions. Traditional desktop spectrum analyzers were of little use for this job, as they sampled frequencies using banks of analog filters and so were restricted in the number of channels they could acquire. However, modern integrated-circuit digital signal processing (DSP) technology could be used to build autocorrelation receivers to check far more channels. This work led in 1981 to a portable <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> named [...] "Suitcase SETI" [...] that had a capacity of 131,000 narrow band channels. After field tests that lasted into 1982, Suitcase SETI was put into use in 1983 with the [...] Harvard/Smithsonian radio telescope at Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Massachusetts. This project was named [...] "Sentinel" [...] and continued into 1985.|$|E
2500|$|WinAMP 0.92 was {{released}} as a freeware in May 1997. Within the standard Windows frame and menu bar, {{it had the}} beginnings of the [...] "classic" [...] Winamp GUI: dark gray rectangle with silver 3D-effect transport buttons, a red/green volume slider, time displayed in a green LED font, with track name, MP3 bitrate, and [...] "mixrate" [...] in green. There was no position bar, and a blank space where the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> and waveform analyzer would later appear. Multiple files on the command line or dropped onto its icon were enqueued in the playlist.|$|E

30|$|The above {{requirements}} are also {{described in the}} lower part of Figure 2. <b>Spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> that are capable of seamless measurements are referred to as real-time spectrum analyzers[8]. The exact features of real-time analyzers depend on the type of the device. To illustrate this, two specific <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> are described in more detail in the following section: the FSVR series of ROHDE & SCHWARZ and the RSA series of Tektronix. Although modern <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzers</b> also include the swept mode to increase the frequency range, here we only focus on the FFT mode. The discussion below does not include implementation details but instead emphasizes the underlying processing mechanism and the amount of flexibility for the end users.|$|R
2500|$|When natural {{sounds are}} {{analyzed}} {{in the frequency}} domain (as on a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer),</b> the spectra of their sounds exhibits amplitude spikes {{at each of the}} fundamental tone's harmonics corresponding to resonant properties of the instruments (spectral peaks that are also referred to as formants). [...] Some harmonics may have higher amplitudes than others. [...] The specific set of harmonic-vs-amplitude pairs is known as a sound's harmonic content. [...] A synthesized sound requires accurate reproduction of the original sound in both the frequency domain and the time domain. [...] A sound does not necessarily have the same harmonic content throughout the duration of the sound. [...] Typically, high-frequency harmonics die out more quickly than the lower harmonics.|$|E
2500|$|Even 131,000 {{channels}} {{were not}} enough to search the sky in detail at a fast rate, so Suitcase SETI was followed in 1985 by Project [...] "META", for [...] "Megachannel Extra-Terrestrial Assay". The META <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> had a capacity of 8.4 million channels and a channel resolution of 0.05 hertz. An important feature of META was its use of frequency Doppler shift to distinguish between signals of terrestrial and extraterrestrial origin. The project was led by Horowitz {{with the help of}} the Planetary Society, and was partly funded by movie maker Steven Spielberg. A second such effort, META II, was begun in Argentina in 1990, to search the southern sky. META II is still in operation, after an equipment upgrade in 1996.|$|E

50|$|An optical <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyzer</b> uses {{reflective}} and/or refractive {{techniques to}} separate out the wavelengths of light.

5000|$|Realtime {{spectrum}} analyzers {{are able to}} produce much more information for users to examine the frequency spectrum in more detail.
