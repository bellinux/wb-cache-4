5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} of body sway on a ship and ship motion. The ship navigated for four days. The subjects controlled their posture under the conditions both with eyes open and eyes closed on the oscillating ship. The indexes of body sway were velocity, acceleration, shift length, and area. The indexes of ship motion were the amplitude and frequency of rolling and pitching. The results were as follows: (1) Velocity, acceleration, shift length, and area under the eyes-closed condition were larger than under the eyes-open condition. (2) Velocity, accelaration, and shift length of X-component were larger than those of Y-component under both the eyes open and the eyes closed conditions. (3) There were <b>strong</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> the amplitude of rolling and the body sway. (4) There were <b>strong</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> the frequency of rolling and the X -component of the body sway. (5) There were <b>strong</b> <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> the frequencies and amplitude of pitching and the body sway...|$|R

In these studies, the strongest correlates came from measurements of total height and lower leg length.|$|E

25|$|While {{economic}} {{compensation is}} merely the result of scarcity, educational attainment {{may be related to}} that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a graduate degree represents the acquisition of expertise (a factor of production) that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner. As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on educational attainment (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being. The following chart further explains the <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> educational attainment and personal as well as household income.|$|E
25|$|There is a <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> {{the type}} and age of a household's family {{structure}} and homeownership.

Age played a significant role as well with homeownership increasing with the age of the householder until age 65, when a slight decrease becomes visible. While only 43% of households with a householder under the age of thirty-five owned a home, 81.6% of those with a householder between the ages of 55 and 64 did.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} {{self-recognition}} in mirrors {{is independent of}} familiarity with reflecting surfaces. In some cases the rouge test {{has been shown to}} have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a Cameroonian Nso sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact. A <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self-concept and object permanence have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{reveal that}} the poverty level in the {{district}} {{is associated with the}} social identity, source of livelihood, landless and level of education of the head of household. Education is a crucial instrument for raising income levels of people and moving out of the vicious circle of poverty. A study done by Delhi-based NGO, Nav Bharat Nirman indicates a <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> educational attainment and poverty levels among various social classes in the district. The incidence of poverty is much higher among scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) households in Pilibhit. Nearly 60 per cent of SC households were below the poverty line in Pilibhit in 1999-2000. However, this proportion came down to 45.23 per cent in 2007-08.|$|E
25|$|Employment {{conditions}} abroad {{are relevant}} to the individual worker and their families {{as well as for the}} sending country and its economic growth and well being. Poor working conditions for Filipinos hired abroad include long hours, low wages and few chances to visit family. Women often face disadvantages in their employment conditions as they tend to work in the elder/child care and domestic. These occupations are considered low skilled and require little education and training, thereby regularly facing poor working conditions. Women facing just working conditions are more likely to provide their children with adequate nutrition, better education and sufficient health. There is a <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> women's rights and the overall well being of children. It is therefore a central question to promote women's rights in order to promote children's capabilities.|$|E
