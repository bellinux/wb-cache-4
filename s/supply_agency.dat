25|$|As a {{response}} to India’s nuclear test conducted 18 May 1974, the United States adopted more restrictive policies regulating the transfer of nuclear fuel and related technologies to different countries, including Brazil. In addition to suspending USAEC contracts of uranium supply, U.S. officials also pressed the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) <b>Supply</b> <b>Agency</b> to cease all transfers of special nuclear material to Brazil. Likewise, the U.S. pushed West Germany to remove ultracentrifugation technology from its agreement with Brazil and tried to craft a complementary safeguards agreement with the IAEA.|$|E
25|$|McNamara {{became a}} close adviser to Kennedy and {{advocated}} {{the use of}} a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense <b>Supply</b> <b>Agency.</b> During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up in U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.|$|E

25|$|In May 1964, the US {{government}} {{established the}} Miyakojima water <b>supply</b> <b>agency,</b> {{but it was}} abolished by the inhabitants. On July 1, 1965, a Miyakojima water supply and sewage organization was established Due {{to the increase in}} the demand of water, investigations on the situation of ground water were started in 1962. On July 15, 1965, Miyakojima ground water control regulations were determined; which were renewed on May 23, 1987. In 1973, there was a considerable drought in Miyakojima; leading to the investigation for new water sources. Projects for an underground dam and the conversion of Yonaha Bay into a fresh water lake were considered. The Yonaha Bay project met an opposition campaign in 1981 and was cancelled in 1983. The underground dam project continued and the Fukuzato underground dam and Sunakawa underground dam were completed in 1998. In 1993, rainfall dropped to two-thirds of the annual mean. Water restrictions continued from January 21 to April 1.|$|E
2500|$|McNamara took {{other steps}} to {{increase}} U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. He raised {{the proportion of}} Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission [...] "to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace {{in any part of}} the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations." [...] McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. After reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, McNamara in 1961 consolidated these functions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Communications Agency (the latter originally established by Secretary Gates in 1960), having both report to the secretary of defense through the JCS. The end effect was to remove the Intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it {{under the control of the}} Secretary of Defense. In the same year, he set up the Defense <b>Supply</b> <b>Agency</b> to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the Secretary of Defense rather than the uniformed military.|$|E

The installation name changed to Defense General Supply Center to match its new logistical mission. In 1977 Defense <b>Supply</b> <b>Agency</b> became Defense Logistics Agency.
