5|$|The Lebaudy Patrie was a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> {{built for}} the French army in Moisson, France, by sugar {{producers}} Lebaudy Frères. Designed by Henri Julliot, Lebaudy's chief engineer, the Patrie was completed in November 1906 and {{handed over to the}} military the following month. The Patrie bears the distinction of being the first airship ordered for military service by the French army.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> {{required}} that the pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to 1942, Kasuga {{was used}} as a {{training}} vessel for navigators and engineers. On 27 July 1928 she rescued the crew of the <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> N3 after it exploded in heavy weather during fleet maneuvers. In January–February 1934, Kasuga ferried 40 scientists to Truk to observe a total solar eclipse on 14 February. She was hulked and disarmed in July 1942 and used as a floating barracks {{for the rest of the}} Pacific War. Kasuga capsized at her mooring at Yokosuka on 18 July 1945 during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft from TF-38. Her wreck was salvaged in August 1948 and broken up for scrap by the Uraga Dock Company.|$|E

50|$|The most {{advanced}} construction of <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> {{between the two}} World Wars took place in Italy. There, the state-factory Stabilimento di Costruzioni Aeronautiche (SCA) constructed several. Umberto Nobile, later General and director, was its most well-known member, and he designed and flew several <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships,</b> including the Norge and Italia, for his overflights of the North Pole, and the W6 OSOAVIAKhIM, for the Soviet Union's airship program.|$|R
50|$|Their <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> were {{considered}} useful {{for military purposes}} and several were ordered by the French War Ministry.|$|R
25|$|The Lebaudy République (later {{known as}} La République) was a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> {{built for the}} French army in Moisson, France, by sugar {{manufacturers}} Lebaudy Frères. She was a sister ship of the Patrie, the main {{differences between the two}} being in the dimensions of the gasbag (or 'envelope') and the ballonet. Although she was operationally successful, the République crashed in 1909 due to a mechanical failure, killing all four crew members.|$|E
500|$|Semi-rigid {{airships}} {{were considered}} {{more suitable for}} military use because, unlike rigid airships, they could be deflated, stored and transported by land or by sea. The Patrie was a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> manufactured by the French sugar magnates Paul and Pierre Lebaudy and designed by their chief engineer, Henri Julliot. She was the second Lebaudy airship, and [...] "surpassed her predecessor in both size and method of construction". The company's first airship, simply known as the Lebaudy, and dubbed by the French public [...] "Le Jaune" [...] ("The Yellow (One)") because of the yellow colour of the lead chromate paint on its cloth exterior, was considered the most successful airship then in operation.|$|E

2500|$|The Lebaudy Morning Post was a French <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> {{built for}} the British Army in Moisson, France, by [...] {{manufacturers}} Lebaudy Frères. The airship was commissioned by the newspaper The Morning Post, who created a fund to purchase the airship and present it to the British Army. The airship's envelope was damaged on the delivery flight {{and then it was}} destroyed on a subsequent trial flight after repair. [...] At the time of construction it was the largest airship that had been built in France.|$|E

Each of the SS versions used similar envelopes that were composed of four layers: two of rubber-proofed fabric {{with a layer of}} rubber between them, and a further rubber layer on the inner, or gas surface. The external surface had five coats of dope applied to it to protect it from the elements and to render the envelope completely gastight. The first two coats were of [...] "Delta dope" [...] (a flexible dope used {{for the first time in}} 1913 on the British Army <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airship</b> Delta), followed by two of aluminium dope and finally one of aluminium varnish. To stiffen the nose of the envelope and to prevent it blowing in, 24 canes were arranged radially from its centre and covered with an aluminium cap.|$|E

50|$|A {{rigid airship}} {{is a type}} of airship (or dirigible) in which the {{envelope}} is supported by an internal framework rather than by being kept in shape by the pressure of the lifting gas within the envelope, as in blimps (also called pressure <b>airships)</b> and <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships.</b> Rigid airships are often commonly called Zeppelins, though this technically refers only to airships built by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin company.|$|R
50|$|Blimps are {{the most}} {{commonly}} built airships because they are relatively easy to build and easy to transport once deflated. However, because of their unstable hull, their size is limited. A blimp with too long a hull may kink in the middle when the overpressure is insufficient or when maneuvered too fast (this has also happened with <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> with weak keels). This {{led to the development}} of <b>semi-rigids</b> and rigid <b>airships.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century, <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> were {{considered}} more suitable for military use because, unlike rigid airships, they could be deflated, stored and transported by land or by sea. Non-rigid airships had a limited lifting capacity due to the strength limitations of the envelope and rigging materials then in use.|$|R
5000|$|By 1905, {{thanks to}} {{improvements}} in motor design, an appropriate engine was now available. His designs were licensed to the British Vickers company.Up {{to the end}} of the First World War, 22 Parseval airships (both non-rigid (blimps) and semi-rigid (with keels)) were built. In the late twenties and early thirties, four more <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> were built in accordance with the [...] "Parseval-Naatz principle".|$|R
5000|$|Both craft are {{outfitted}} with LED sign technology Goodyear calls [...] "Eaglevision." [...] This allows the aircraft to display bright, multi-colored, animated words and images. Goodyear also has blimps operating {{in other parts}} of the world. These airships are built and operated by Van Wagner of Orlando, Florida. In May 2011, Goodyear announced it will be replacing its fleet of non-rigid <b>airships</b> with three <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> built by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.|$|R

50|$|Commissioned in the Italian air force, Nobile {{spent the}} war {{overseeing}} airship construction and developing new designs. The Italian military had already used airships {{as early as}} 1912, during the Italo-Turkish War, for bombing and reconnaissance. Italy built about 20 M-class <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>airships</b> with a bomb load of 1000 kg which it used for bombing and anti-shipping missions. The Italians also used other, smaller airships, some of them British-built. None of Nobile's designs flew until after the war.|$|R
