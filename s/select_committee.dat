50|$|The United States Senate did not {{establish}} its first standing committees until 1816, so <b>select</b> <b>committees</b> performed {{the overwhelming majority}} of the committee work for the Senate during the earliest Congresses.

As of the 2013 legislative session, there are no active <b>select</b> <b>committees.</b>|$|R

It conducted 253 active investigations, served 8,000 subpoenas for witnesses and documents, held 270 days of hearings, took testimony from 1,526 witnesses (343 of whom invoked the Fifth Amendment), and compiled almost 150,000 pages of testimony. At the peak of its activity in 1958, 104 persons worked for the committee.|$|E

Usually the make-up of the Committee of Judges, who selects the winners of the printed media, is different from those who determine the winners of the electronic media.|$|R

5|$|The bill then {{proceeds}} {{to the committee}} stage, where {{the details of the}} drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. Bills that are more controversial, or that require the views of interested groups or the public, are often referred to a <b>select</b> <b>committee.</b> This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations to the committee. Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held. The <b>select</b> <b>committee</b> then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.|$|E

5|$|In September 1992, Woon was {{appointed}} to the <b>select</b> <b>committee</b> to review the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 33/92) which proposed, among other things, that scripless trading in securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore be authorised so that share transfers can be made through computerised book entries.

The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and the transcripts of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the <b>Select</b> <b>Committee</b> on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E
