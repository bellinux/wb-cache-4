25|$|H.F Morgan, an old {{speculator}} of the field, {{formed the}} local Golden Gate United Block and 98 block Gold Mining Company Limited in 1899 on striking the reef at Golden Gate No. 4 and 5 South Block. The shaft, commenced in 1899, {{continued to be}} sunk through 1900, before striking water and having to constantly bail in 1901. A powerful pump was installed. In 1902 the shaft cut the Golden Gate reef at 480 feet and they sunk an underlie for 142 feet however the reef was not payable and the <b>straight</b> <b>shaft</b> was the outlet for the water. Surrounding mines contributed to the sinking and bailing as their mines would eventually be flooded otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{robustness}} of {{the skeleton}} of Xingxiulong, especially in the hip, femur, and foot, are convergent upon sauropods, and collectively suggest {{that it had a}} relatively large gut and overall high body mass. However, unlike sauropods, Xingxiulong would have been bipedal; it lacks sauropodan adaptations to quadrupedalism including relatively longer forelimbs, the ulna bearing a prominent process on the front of its side, and the femur having a relatively <b>straight</b> <b>shaft.</b> Instead, its ulna and femur are overall more reminiscent of the typical basal sauropodomorph. The large and robust scapulae of Xingxiulong, Jingshanosaurus, and Yunnanosaurus may have increased the mobility of the forelimb during bipedal browsing, but this trait was later adopted as an adaptation to quadrupedality in sauropods.|$|E

25|$|The main {{characteristic}} of these scripts was their writing style. The letters {{in most of}} these manuscripts are heavy-looking, relatively short and horizontally elongated. The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared and was replaced by a <b>straight</b> <b>shaft</b> with a pronounced right-sided foot, set at a considerable distance from the following letter. Also, unlike the Hijazi scripts, these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colors. Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins. These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards, structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable upper cover that was fastened {{to the rest of the}} structure with leather thongs.|$|E
25|$|Further {{development}} work {{was required to}} enable the mine to be worked systematically and the Rogers' Golden Gate produced 3,295 tons of quartz yielding 3,947 ounces of gold in 1900. The mine was worked with two stem engines of eight and ten horsepower, two sets of double winding gear, one steam pump, and one whip, valued at £850. In 1902 additional plant was erected including three steam engines {{with a total of}} 51 horsepower, one single and two sets of double winding gear. The <b>straight</b> <b>shaft</b> was done to 510 feet and the underlie of the extended shaft down to 531 feet. The mine kept 15 head of stamps at the Golden Gate mill constantly employed. The mine was partly tributed in 1904 with the tributers doing well. In 1906 Rogers' Golden Gate was the Golden Gate line's largest producer - 2,000 tons for 10,527 ounces by the tributers.|$|E

40|$|Piling {{contractors}} are {{constantly on the}} lookout for innovative solutions that can put them a step ahead of their competitors. The idea of the High Shear Capacity Ribbed Pile, whereby the construction of ribs {{along the length of the}} pile shaft might significantly increase the shaft capacity, has been considered by contractors in the past. Various tools with which to construct these ribs, using different methods, have been explored in an effort to find an efficient method of construction. Through experimentation of these tools in the field, and subsequent pile tests, it has been confirmed that the construction of ribs does indeed increase the shaft capacity of piles. The extent to which the shaft capacity is increased compared with a similar <b>straight</b> <b>shafted</b> pile and what exactly the factors affecting this increase in shaft capacity might be are, as yet, uncertain. Thus it is not known whether the construction of this type of pile would be a more efficient alternative to a normal <b>straight</b> <b>shafted</b> pile. This research project aims to identify the important factors in rib geometry of a ribbed pile in order to optimise its shaft capacity, and to compare with the shaft capacity of a similar <b>straight</b> <b>shafted</b> pile. This has primarily been investigated through physical modelling of the ribbed pile in a geotechnical centrifuge. Tools with which to install and load the piles have been developed so that traditional load tests can be carried out on small scale piles of varying rib geometries. Results will be compared and discussed with respect to previous research into the behaviour of piles in stiff clay. This thesis details the achievements of a two year research programme into the behaviour of high shear capacity ribbed piles in stiff clay. The research has been jointly funded by Expanded Piling Limited and the Geotechnical Engineering Research Group at City University London and carried out in collaboration with Arup Geotechnics.

60|$|Later on, {{when their}} hired brougham had, {{with the long}} vociferation that tormented her impatience, been extricated from the endless rank, she rolled into the London night, beside her husband, as into a {{sheltering}} darkness where she could muffle herself and draw breath. She had stood for the previous half-hour in a merciless glare, beaten upon, stared out of countenance, it fairly seemed to her, by intimations of her mistake. For what she was most immediately feeling was that she had, in the past, been active, for these people, to ends that were now bearing fruit and that might yet bear a larger crop. She but brooded, at first, in her corner of the carriage: it was like burying her exposed face, a face too helplessly exposed, in the cool lap of the common indifference, of the dispeopled streets, of the closed shops and darkened houses seen {{through the window of}} the brougham, a world mercifully unconscious and unreproachful. It wouldn't, like the world she had just left, know sooner or later what she had done, or would know it, at least, only if the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity. She fixed this possibility itself so hard, however, for a few moments, that the misery of her fear produced the next minute a reaction; and when the carriage happened, while it grazed a turn, to catch the <b>straight</b> <b>shaft</b> from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his inquisitive flash over an opposite house-front, she let herself wince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest, not less quickly, against mere blind terror. It had become, for the occasion, preposterously, terror--of which she must shake herself free before she could properly measure her ground. The perception of this necessity had in truth soon aided her; since she found, on trying, that, lurid as her prospect might hover there, she could none the less give it no name. The sense of seeing was strong in her, but she clutched at the comfort of not being sure of what she saw. Not to know what it would represent on a longer view was a help, in turn, to not making out that her hands were embrued; since if she had stood in the position of a producing cause she should surely be less vague about what she had produced. This, further, in its way, was a step toward reflecting that when one's connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored. By the time they were nearing Cadogan Place she had in fact recognised that she couldn't be as curious as she desired without arriving at some conviction of her being as innocent. But there had been a moment, in the dim desert of Eaton Square, when she broke into speech.|$|E
60|$|This {{assault of}} images became for a moment, in {{the address of}} the {{distinguished}} sculptor, almost formidable: Gloriani showed him, in such perfect confidence, on Chad's introduction of him, a fine worn handsome face, a face that was like an open letter in a foreign tongue. With his genius in his eyes, his manners on his lips, his long career behind him and his honours and rewards all round, the great artist, {{in the course of a}} single sustained look and a few words of delight at receiving him, affected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type. Strether had seen in museums--in the Luxembourg as well as, more reverently, later on, in the New York of the billionaires--the work of his hand; knowing too that after an earlier time in his native Rome he had migrated, in mid-career, to Paris, where, with a personal lustre almost violent, he shone in a constellation: all of which was more than enough to crown him, for his guest, with the light, with the romance, of glory. Strether, in contact with that element as he had never yet so intimately been, had the consciousness of opening to it, for the happy instant, all the windows of his mind, of letting this rather grey interior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in his old geography. He was to remember again repeatedly the medal-like Italian face, in which every line was an artist's own, in which time told only as tone and consecration; and he was to recall in especial, as the penetrating radiance, as the communication of the illustrious spirit itself, the manner in which, while they stood briefly, in welcome and response, face to face, he was held by the sculptor's eyes. He wasn't soon to forget them, was to think of them, all unconscious, unintending, preoccupied though they were, as the source of the deepest intellectual sounding to which he had ever been exposed. He was in fact quite to cherish his vision of it, to play with it in idle hours; only speaking of it to no one and quite aware he couldn't have spoken without appearing to talk nonsense. Was what it had told him or what it had asked him the greater of the mysteries? Was it the most special flare, unequalled, supreme, of the aesthetic torch, lighting that wondrous world for ever, or was it above all the long <b>straight</b> <b>shaft</b> sunk by a personal acuteness that life had seasoned to steel? Nothing on earth could have been stranger and no one doubtless more surprised than the artist himself, but it was for all the world to Strether just then as if in the matter of his accepted duty he had positively been on trial. The deep human expertness in Gloriani's charming smile--oh the terrible life behind it!--was flashed upon him as a test of his stuff.|$|E

40|$|Ribbed {{bored piles}} {{are known to}} give {{increased}} shaft capacity in comparison to conventional <b>straight</b> <b>shafted</b> bored piles. The commercial benefit of greater pile capacity is cheaper foundations. Significant environmental benefits will also accrue {{from the use of}} efficient foundations that are able to carry higher load, leading to less excavation and spoil removal requiring disposal, and reduced concrete in construction. Moreover, redevelopment of urban sites often requires removal of existing deep foundations owing to clashes in position of old and new foundations. Higher capacity piles offer potential for greater flexibility in foundation layout owing to their reduced size, making them easier to install around existing piles. This paper describes a series of tests conducted using the City University London Geotechnical Centrifuge. The tests show that concentrically ribbed piles can provide an increase in capacity of about 30 % when compared with plain piles. Furthermore, ribbed piles provided a greater capacity than that of a pile with a diameter equal to that of the rib diameter...|$|R
