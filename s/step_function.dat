25|$|Related is the Gibbs phenomenon: if the sine {{integral}} {{is considered}} as the convolution of the sinc function with the heaviside <b>step</b> <b>function,</b> this corresponds to truncating the Fourier series, {{which is the}} cause of the Gibbs phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In quantum {{mechanics}} and scattering theory, the one-dimensional step potential is an idealized system used to model incident, reflected and transmitted matter waves. The problem consists {{of solving the}} time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle with a step-like potential in one dimension. Typically, the potential is modelled as a Heaviside <b>step</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

25|$|The result {{obtained}} for R depends {{only on the}} ratio E/V0. This seems superficially to violate the correspondence principle, since we obtain a finite probability of reflection regardless {{of the value of}} Planck's constant or the mass of the particle. For example, we seem to predict that when a marble rolls {{to the edge of a}} table, there can be a large probability that it is reflected back rather than falling off. Consistency with classical mechanics is restored by eliminating the unphysical assumption that the step potential is discontinuous. When the <b>step</b> <b>function</b> is replaced with a ramp that spans some finite distance w, the probability of reflection approaches zero in the limit , where k is the wavenumber of the particle.|$|E
25|$|From {{a signal}} {{processing}} point of view, the Gibbs phenomenon is the step response of a low-pass filter, and the oscillations are called ringing or ringing artifacts. Truncating the Fourier transform of a signal {{on the real}} line, or the Fourier series of a periodic signal (equivalently, a signal on the circle) corresponds to filtering out the higher frequencies by an ideal (brick-wall) low-pass/high-cut filter. This can be represented as convolution of the original signal with the impulse response of the filter (also known as the kernel), which is the sinc function. Thus the Gibbs phenomenon {{can be seen as}} the result of convolving a Heaviside <b>step</b> <b>function</b> (if periodicity is not required) or a square wave (if periodic) with a sinc function: the oscillations in the sinc function cause the ripples in the output.|$|E

This {{appendix}} covers the general case in which no such assumption is made. The proof is in two steps. First, an induction {{on the number of}} steps is made to generalize Lemma 3 to an arbitrary number of steps. Second, a limiting argument is used to establish the result for arbitrary (not necessarily <b>step)</b> <b>functions</b> c and v. Lemma 6 If c and v are <b>step</b> <b>functions,</b> and (x, p) is an allocation that is implementable in the full commitment program, and such that, for all t ∈ T, B(t) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a domain-theoretic calculus for Lipschitz and differentiable functions, which includes addition, subtraction and composition. We then develop a domaintheoretic {{version of the}} inverse function theorem for a Lipschitz function, in which the inverse function is obtained as a fixed point of a Scott continuous functional and is approximated by <b>step</b> <b>functions.</b> In {{the case of a}} C 1 function, the inverse and its derivative are obtained as the least fixed point of a single Scott continuous functional on the domain of differentiable functions and are approximated by two sequences of <b>step</b> <b>functions,</b> which are effectively computed from two increasing sequences of <b>step</b> <b>functions</b> respectively converging to the original function and its derivative. In this case, we also effectively obtain an increasing sequence of polynomial <b>step</b> <b>functions</b> whose lower and upper bounds converge in the C 1 norm to the inverse function. A similar result holds for implicit functions, which combined with the domain-theoretic model for computational geometry, provides a robust technique for construction of curves and surfaces. 1...|$|R

Equivalently, this is a study of when certain <b>step</b> <b>functions</b> related to the Beurling [...] Nyman criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis are always nonnegative. We give a complete classification {{of what we call}} the "height 1 " case, which proves a conjecture of V. I.

In addition to the application of these theorems to the classification of integer factorial ratios and nonnegative <b>step</b> <b>functions</b> related to the Beurling [...] Nyman criterion, through work of A.
