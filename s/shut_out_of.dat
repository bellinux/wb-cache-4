5|$|Saskatchewan Conservatives {{eventually}} {{arranged a}} leadership convention for October 28, 1936. Eleven people were nominated, including Diefenbaker. The other ten candidates all deemed the provincial party in such hopeless shape that they withdrew, and Diefenbaker won the position by default. Diefenbaker asked the federal party for $10,000 in financial support, but the funds were refused, and the Conservatives were <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the legislature in the 1938 provincial {{elections for the}} second consecutive time. Diefenbaker himself was defeated in the Arm River riding by 190 votes. With the province-wide Conservative vote having fallen to 12%, Diefenbaker offered his resignation to a post-election party meeting in Moose Jaw, but it was refused. Diefenbaker continued to run the provincial party out of his law office, and paid the party's debts from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|On April 28, Harris {{was named}} to the 18-player roster that would {{represent}} the United States at the CONCACAF U-19 Women's Qualifying Tournament held in Ottawa and Montreal, Canada. Harris was one of four members of the team that were also on the team that won the inaugural FIFA U-19 World Championship in 2002. She was also the most capped U-19 player on the roster. Harris recorded a shut out against Dominican Republic on May 28 for a 14–0 win. She then started in goal against Trinidad & Tobago on May 30. The lone goal for Trinidad & Tobago came during the 86th minute, after Kelsey Davis came on for Harris in the 62nd minute. The United States won the match 11–1, guaranteeing their spot in the semifinals. Harris recorded her second <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the tournament on June 1 during the team's final group match against Costa Rica, which ended in a 0–0 draw. In the semifinal match against Mexico on June 4, Harris recorded another shut out.

The 1933 San Diego State team was led by head coach Walter Herreid in his fourth season with the Aztecs. They played home games at Navy [...] "Sports" [...] Field.

5|$|Playing in a torrential downpour, the Buccaneers {{scored the}} first shutout in {{franchise}} history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title. The Chiefs were held to a franchise-low 80 yards of total offense. Despite the rain, Ricky Bell claimed that the field had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco. Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in such bad weather that the game had to be played under lights. The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble, two interceptions, and a fumbled snap on a field goal attempt. <b>Shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the end zone on three tries with first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, the Buccaneers brought Neil O'Donoghue in to kick {{what would be the}} winning field goal with 8:50 remaining. Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays {{for the rest of the}} game. The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory, saying that the AFC was superior to the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West.|$|E
25|$|The Tories were {{completely}} <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Toronto, where 19 out of 22 ridings were {{won by the}} Liberals, and the remaining three were carried by the New Democrats. Perhaps more ominously for the PCs, they were also <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> any seats bordering Toronto; only in the outermost suburbs like Aurora and Whitby were high-profile PC cabinet ministers able to retain their seats. With the arguable exception of Elizabeth Witmer, no PC member represents an urban riding.|$|E

25|$|At {{its annual}} meeting in November 1917, the NHA {{announced}} that it was suspending operations because of the difficulties in running a five-team league and the player shortages introduced by conscription in Canada during the off-season.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, its African-American and poor white populations were {{affected}} by changes to laws by the state legislature, which made voter registration and voting more difficult by requirements including imposition of a poll tax in 1889.
