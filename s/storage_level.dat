40|$|Subjects with insulin {{resistance}} {{have been shown}} to have higher <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) than their insulin-sensitive counterparts. It has been proposed that elevated IMCL stores may be the main cause of {{insulin resistance}}. The aim {{of the present study was}} to ascertain whether there is a causal relationship between IMCL storage and insulin resistance. IMCL storage was assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and insulin sensitivity was assessed by performing an oral glucose tolerance test. A 4 -week intervention of reduction of dietary glycaemic index was used to manipulate insulin sensitivity in a cohort of healthy volunteers; the effects of this intervention on IMCL were measured after 4 weeks of intervention. Significant improvements in the insulin sensitivity index occurred following the dietary intervention (baseline 7. 8 (sem 1. 11) v. post-intervention 9. 7 (sem 1. 11), P= 0. 02). However, there were no changes in IMCL <b>storage</b> <b>levels,</b> suggesting that insulin sensitivity can be manipulated independently of IMCL. This suggests that in healthy volunteers, insulin sensitivity is independent of IMCL storage and the high <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> that have been found in insulin-resistant subjects may occur as a consequence rather than a cause of insulin resistance...|$|R
