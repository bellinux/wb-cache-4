5|$|Ballpark is a {{light rail}} station in the People's Freeway {{neighborhood}} of <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City, Utah, in the United States, served by all three lines of Utah Transit Authority's TRAX light rail system. The Blue Line provides service from Downtown <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City to Draper. The Red Line provides service from the University of Utah to the Daybreak Community of South Jordan. The Green Line provides service from the <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City International Airport to West Valley City (via Downtown <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City).|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> Central (which {{is part of}} the <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City Intermodal Hub) {{connects with}} FrontRunner {{commuter}} rail (with service from Weber County through Davis County and <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> County to Utah County), as well as Amtrak and Greyhound Lines. In addition Murray Central and North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe also connect with FrontRunner. In December 2013 {{the first phase of the}} S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) project opened for service with a connection at Central Pointe in South <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> and Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E

40|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>lakes</b> are {{numerous}} and have signifi cant economical, ecological, recreational, and cultural values. Raising the awareness about <b>salt</b> <b>lakes,</b> nature of threats, impacts from human activities, and their special management requirements {{is one of}} the biggest challenges. Many <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> are likely to dry and unfortunately international bodies have not properly recognized <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> as important aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to provide a global awareness about drying of <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> and their environmental impacts. The case study is Orumieh Lake, one of the largest <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> on the earth. The catchment area of the lake contains 21 permanent and ephemeral streams together with 39 episodic rivers fl owing through agricultural, urban, and industrial areas that drain into this terminal lake. Drying of this lake would lead to salty winds, diseases, and cancers that would evacuate more than 20 cities. Beside effective management and conservation measures, international pressure from appropriate organizations would be effective for the conservation of many <b>salt</b> <b>lakes...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>lakes</b> are {{geographically}} widespread, {{numerous and}} {{a significant part of}} the world's inland aquatic ecosystems. They are important natural assets with considerable aesthetic, cultural, economic, recreational, scientific, conservation and ecological values. Some features, notably the composition of the biota, uniquely distinguish them from other aquatic ecosystems. The paper reviews the nature of environmental impacts and their effects upon <b>salt</b> <b>lakes.</b> Its aims are two-fold: to draw attention to the extensive damage that <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> have now undergone, and to indicate the likely status of <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> in 2025. <b>Salt</b> <b>lakes</b> develop as the termini of inland drainage basins where hydrological inputs and outputs are balanced. These conditions occur in arid and semi-arid regions (approximately one-third of total world land area). Many human activities threaten or have already impacted <b>salt</b> <b>lakes,</b> especially surface inflow diversions, salinization and other catchment activities, mining, pollution, biological disturbances (e. g. introduction of exotic species), and anthropogenically-induced climatic and atmospheric changes. The effects of such activities are always adverse and include changes to the natural character of <b>salt</b> <b>lakes,</b> loss of biodiversity and fundamental limnological changes. The effects are geographically widespread, mostly irreversible, and degrade the values of <b>salt</b> <b>lakes.</b> Four <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> are discussed, namely the Aral Sea in central Asia, Mono Lake in California, USA, and Lake Eyre and Lake Cantara South, in Australia. By 2025, most natural <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> will have undergone some adverse change. Many permanent ones will have decreased in size and increased in salinity, and many unnatural saline water-bodies will have appeared. In certain regions, many seasonally-filled <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> are likely to be drier for longer periods. The extent to which episodically-filled <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> will change by 2025 will largely depend upon the nature of climate change in arid regions. Objective cost/benefit analyses of adversely affecting <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> are rare, and international bodies have not properly recognized <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> as important inland aquatic ecosystems. To redress this situation, there is a need to raise awareness of: (1) the values of <b>salt</b> <b>lakes,</b> (2) the nature of threats and impacts from human activities, and (3) their special management requirements. More effective management and conservation measures need to be implemented. Mono Lake provides an example of what can be achieved in the conservation of <b>salt</b> <b>lakes.</b> Its conservation was largely brought about by (1) the commitment of a non-governmental organization which recognized its non-economic values, (2) the freedom to express views, (3) a legal system which took account of non-economic values, and (4) a legislature which implemented judicial findings. The conservation of Mono Lake was difficult; the conservation of other <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> is likely to be even more difficult. Only international pressure from appropriate organizations will be effective for the conservation of many. W. D. William...|$|R

5|$|From Springville {{north to}} <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City, US-89 parallels—and for a {{distance}} overlaps—Interstate 15, following the old Arrowhead Trail, once {{the main highway}} from <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City to Los Angeles, {{through a number of}} downtowns. Numerous state highways connect US-89 to I-15, including SR-77 in Springville, SR-114 in Provo, SR-52 in Orem, SR-180 and SR-145 in American Fork, and SR-73 in Lehi. In Provo, US-89 meets US-189, its only branch, which heads northeast through Provo Canyon to Heber City, connecting to I-80 and bypassing <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City. North of Lehi, US-89 merges with I-15 (at exit 282), which has been built on or near the old road through a gap in the Traverse Mountains (elevation 4800 feet/1500 m) into the <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> Valley. The routes split in Draper, formerly with a direct interchange north of SR-71, but US-89 traffic must now exit at SR-71 (exit 291), turn east to Factory Outlet Drive, and follow this frontage road to the location of the former split. From here all the way to downtown <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City, US-89 is marked along State Street, a major northsouth street that ends at the Utah State Capitol. After passing through Sandy, Midvale, Murray, Millcreek Township, and South <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake,</b> State Street enters <b>Salt</b> <b>Lake</b> City at the intersection with SR-201 (2100 South).|$|E

40|$|The Tanzanian rift system <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> present {{significant}} cultural, ecological, {{recreational and}} economical values. Beyond {{the wealth of}} minerals, resources of these rift <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> include unique wildlife, for instance Lesser Flamingo (Phoenicopterus minor) and Cichlids (Alcolapia spp), which adapted chemically aggressive environments like that of Lake Natron. The general hydrochemical equilibria of these <b>salt</b> <b>lakes</b> is governed by Na+> K+>> Ca 2 + ~ Mg 2 +: (CO 32 - + HCO 3 -) > Cl-> SO 42 - ~ F- ionic concentration pattern. Salt accumulation mechanism in these endorheic lakes is considered to base on thermo-mechanical disintegrative stress of the geochemistry sourcing. The rains chemically interact with rift terrains, which are dominated with natrocarbonatitic volcanic materials, thus transporting dissolved <b>salts</b> to the <b>lakes.</b> In addition, hot springs around the shores of these lakes carry significant salinity loads into the <b>lakes.</b> The <b>salt</b> reserves magnifies through recurring evaporative concentration in seasonal cycles. Despite this huge wealth of mineral resource potential of the Tanzanian rift <b>salt</b> <b>lakes,</b> they are still underutilized, thus contributing less into the national economy.
