40|$|AbstractSecnidazole (α, 2 -Dimethyl- 5 -nitro- 1 H-imidazole- 1 -ethanol) is {{a highly}} {{effective}} drug against a variety of G+/G− bacteria but with significant side effects because it is being used in very high concentration. In this study, gold nanoparticles (GNPS) were selected {{as a vehicle to}} deliver <b>secnidazole</b> drug at the specific site with more accuracy which made the drug highly effective at substantially low concentrations. The as-synthesized GNPs were capped with Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and subsequently bioconjugated with <b>secnidazole</b> because HSA provides the stability and improves the solubility of the bioconjugated drug, <b>secnidazole.</b> The quantification of covalently bioconjugated <b>secnidazole</b> with HSA encapsulated on enzymatically synthesized GNPs was done with RP-HPLC having SPD- 20 A UV/VIS detector by using the C- 18 column. The bioconjugation of GNPs with <b>secnidazole</b> was confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). The bioconjugated GNPs were characterized by UV–VIS spectroscopy, TEM, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and DLS. Zeta potential confirmed the stability and uniform distribution of particles in the emulsion of GNPs. The separation of bioconjugated GNPs, unused GNPs and unused drug was done by gel filtration chromatography.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Secnidazole</b> is an anti {{infective agent}} which {{belongs to the}} 5 -nitroimidazole class. Method: The {{objective}} of the trial was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of <b>secnidazole</b> after oral administration of a 2 g dose, as microgranules formulation in healthy subjects. Blood samples were collected before, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 240 h after dosing. Urines were collected in 24 -h-fractions {{for the first five}} days and in 48 h-fraction for the last sample. The cumulative urinary excretion was captured for each subject from urine concentration (lg/L). Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by a non-compartmental approach (WinNonlin Pharsight). The assay was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-MS/MS, Quattro Premier, Waters) after simple protein precipitation of 50 lL plasma sample. Chromatographic separation was done on a C 18 Acquity column (50 mm · 2. 1 mm, id 1. 7 lm, Waters), in isocratic mode (80 % water/ 0. 1 % formic acid and 20 % acetonitrile). Ornidazole was used as internal standard. The detection was operated in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for quantification (186 > 128 ion transition for <b>secnidazole).</b> The lower limit of quantification was 10 and 100 lg/L for plasma and urine samples respectively. Results: Sixteen subjects (8 female, 8 male) were included. Population characteristics such as: age ranged from 23 to 50 years (mean ± SD: 38 ± 9. 2 years), weight ranged from 51 to 90 Kg (mean ± SD = 64. 6 ± 10. 1 Kg) and body mass index (BMI) ranged from 19. 9 to 24. 2 Kg/m 2 (mean ± SD = 21. 9 ± 1. 5 Kg/m 2;). <b>Secnidazole</b> exposure achieved a maximal concentration (Cmax) with a mean of 37. 9 ± 8. 5 mg/L (range 20 – 56 mg/L) and at a median time associated with the Cmax (Tmax) of 6 h (range 3 – 6 h).

Results revealed that the pharmaceutical formulation based on 25 % PLGA containing <b>secnidazole</b> and doxycycline hydrochloride has promising activity in treating periodontitis in comparison with Atridox®...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of <b>secnidazole</b> (SEC) on the corrosion of mild steel in 0. 01 - 0. 04 M H 2 SO 4 at 303 - 323 K was studied by gravimetric method. Results obtained show that SEC acts as inhibitor for mild steel in H 2 SO 4 solution. The inhibition efficiency {{was found to}} increase with increase in SEC concentration but decreased with acid concentration and temperature, which is suggestive of physical adsorption mechanism although chemisorption may play a part. The adsorption of SEC onto the mild steel surface was found to follow the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Both kinetic parameters (activation energy, pre-exponential factor, enthalpy of activation and entropy of activation) and thermodynamics of adsorption (enthalpy of adsorption, entropy of adsorption and Gibbs free energy) were calculated and discussed. Quantum chemical calculations using DFT at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G level of theory was further used to calculate some electronic properties of the molecule in order to ascertain any correlation between the inhibitive effect and molecular structure of <b>secnidazole...</b>|$|E
40|$|Foi testado in vivo a sensibilidade de Giardia muris a quatro drogas comumente usadas no tratamento da giardíase humana. Foram utilizados 7 grupos de animais, com 12 camundongos cada, sendo que o grupo controle recebeu apenas solução salina 0, 15 M (0, 5 ml/animal). Os demais grupos receberam em dose única: {{metronidazole}} e furazolidone (500 mg/kg), tinidazole e <b>secnidazole</b> (200 mg/kg). A eficácia das drogas foi avaliada através da contagem de cistos nas fezes e pela ausência de trofozoítos no intestino. O metronidazole foi a droga mais eficaz. Os cortes histológicos mostraram diferenças entre o padrão da mucosa intestinal de animais normais e parasitados. No entanto, não se observou diferença entre o padrão de mucosa de animais infectados tratados e não tratados, o que sugere que estas alterações podem ser causadas pelo parasito e não pelas drogas. A {{comparative study}} {{about the effectiveness}} of metronidazole, tinidazole, <b>secnidazole</b> and furazolidone was performed on Giardia muris from mice naturally infected. Groups of 12 animals each was constituted: the control treated with saline; one treated with metronidazole; one treated with furazolidone; one treated with tinidazole; one treated with secnidazole; histological normal control; histological infected. Samples of three stools were examined before and after treatment with quantification of cysts. Animals were cured when the trophozoites was not seen in the small bowel. The curative activity of drugs was 58. 3 % for metronidazole, 50 % for furazolidone, 40 % for <b>secnidazole</b> and 16 % for tinidazole. It was also showed that there was a different pattern of the intestinal mucosa from the control and infected groups, treated or not, suggesting that the alterations encountered in the mucosa of infected animals were due to the parasitism either the action of the drugs...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the eradication rate of an ultra-short treatment schedule for Helicobacter pylori infection {{in a population}} with peptic ulcers, using omeprazole, <b>secnidazole,</b> and azithromycin in a once-daily dose for 3 days. METHODS: Thirty patients with peptic ulcer diagnosed by upper endoscopy and for Helicobacter pylori infection by rapid urease test and histologic examination received omeprazole 40 mg, <b>secnidazole</b> 1000 mg, and azithromycin 500 mg, administered once daily for 3 days. A follow-up exam was performed 12 weeks {{after the end of}} the treatment. Patients who were negative for Helicobacter pylori infection by rapid urease test and histologic examination were considered cured. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly female, and the mean age was 50 years. Duodenal peptic ulcer was found in 73 % of the patients. Eradication was achieved in 9 of the 28 (32 %) patients as determined from the follow-up endoscopic exam. The eradication rate by intention to treat was 30 %. Side effects were present in 3 % of the patients, and compliance to treatment was total. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the low rate of side effects and good compliance, the eradication index was low. A possible drawback of this therapy is that it reduces the efficacy of macrolide and nitroimidazole compounds in subsequent treatments. DESCRIPTORS: Peptic Ulcer/Treatment.
