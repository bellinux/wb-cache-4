5|$|Lehman {{played with}} the Millionaires until the 1925–26 season. During that time, Lehman {{and some of his}} {{teammates}} were involved in a humorous incident when going back to Canada after an exhibition game against the Montreal Wanderers in New York City. In New York, Lehman's wife bought numerous women's designer outfits, after being treated to a <b>shopping</b> <b>spree</b> by him. When going back to Canada, Lehman, on the advice of Cyclone Taylor, who was both a professional ice hockey player and a Canadian immigration officer, split up all outfits among his teammates to avoid paying additional taxes {{he would have had to}} pay if he had brought all the clothing by himself at once; this puzzled the Customs officers. In 1922–23, the Millionaires were renamed the Maroons, and joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The WCHL was renamed to the Western Hockey League in 1925–26; however, the league disbanded at the conclusion of that season. While playing for the Millionaires, Lehman appeared in six Stanley Cup finals, losing every time, except in his first season, in 1914–15.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} heavily {{promoted}} {{in the weeks}} leading up to its airing. Laura Benanti appeared on a retro style cover of Playboy magazine released on September 16, 2011.

The Walton Street store in Chicago included display windows inspired by the series, which were unveiled in September 2011 by Benanti, as well as Naturi Naughton and Wes Ramsey.

30|$|The {{researcher}} inferred that {{shopping for}} leisure {{is becoming more}} widespread than shopping simply to buy, based on the responses of most participants.

This suggests that by minimizing the role of staffs to working at the management level, operation costs can be reduced and consumers’ unrestricted <b>shopping</b> <b>sprees</b> can be enhanced.|$|R
