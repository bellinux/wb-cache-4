5000|$|In {{comparative}} genomics, a <b>sequence</b> <b>graph,</b> {{also called}} an alignment graph, breakpoint graph, or adjacency graph, is a bidirected graph {{in which the}} vertices represent segments of DNA and the edges represent adjacency between segments in a genome. [...] The segments are labeled by the DNA string they represent, and each edge connects {{the tail end of}} one segment with the head end of another segment. Each adjacency edge is labelled by a (possibly empty) string of DNA. Traversing a connected component of segments and adjacency edges (called a thread) yields a sequence, which typically represents a genome or a section of a genome. The segments {{can be thought of as}} synteny blocks, with the edges dictating how to arrange these blocks in a particular genome, and the labelling of the adjacency edges representing bases that are not contained in synteny blocks.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} for improving a fundamental aspect of iterated dynamic programming procedures on sequences, such as progressive sequence alignment. Instead {{of relying on}} the unrealistic assumption that each iteration can be performed accurately without including information from other sequences, our technique employs the combinatorial data structure of weighted <b>sequence</b> <b>graphs</b> to represent an exponential number of optimal and suboptimal sequences. The usual dynamic programming algorithm on linear sequences can be generalized to weighted <b>sequence</b> <b>graphs,</b> and therefore allows to align <b>sequence</b> <b>graphs</b> instead of individual sequences in subsequent stages. Thus, locally suboptimal, but globally correct solutions can {{for the first time}} be identified through iterated sequence alignment. We demonstrate the utility of our technique by applying it to the benchmark alignment problem of Sankoff et al. (J. Mol. Evol. 7 (1976) 133). Although a recent effort could improve on the original solution from 1976 slightly, our technique leads to even more significant improvements...|$|R
40|$|Three {{have been}} the main {{contributions}} of this thesis. First, a platform for the deployment of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) with a modular architecture has been designed. This platform, called SIT, focuses on the adaptation of the sequencing of learning content, not adaptation of the content itself. This separation permits specialization of pedagogical experts and encourages reuse of learning resources. Second, a tool for the adaptation of the sequencing of learning units has been presented: <b>Sequencing</b> <b>Graphs.</b> It is a specialization of the finite automata paradigm, adapted for {{the specific needs of}} learning. <b>Sequencing</b> <b>graphs</b> focus on reuse, both of learning units and of adaptive sequencings definitions. They are hierarchical to prevent scalability problems. Two ITS have developed using <b>sequencing</b> <b>graphs</b> for SIT. Experimental results support the hypothesis that sequencing adaptation has a good influence on learning and that <b>Sequencing</b> <b>Graphs</b> are a useful tool to achieve this objective. Finally, the thesis analyzes the current initiatives in the emerging field of swarm intelligence techniques in education. Apart of the theoretical overview, three results are presented: an experimental study performed on the Paraschool system, a system of pedagogical alarms based on learning pheromones on the same system, and a swarm paths information module for SIT. This module synthesizes the best results from swarm-based adaptation sequencing and collaborative filtering for providing an additional level of adaptation to the content sequencing in SI...|$|R

Test case explosion {{is the major}} problem in concurrency testing and make an interruption in systematic testing of concurrent systems.

Given k sequences q_ 1, [...] ., q_k of labeled bins and a positive integer p, {{the aim is to}} stack-up the bins by iteratively removing the first bin of one of the k sequences and put it onto an initially empty pallet of unbounded capacity located at one of p stack-up places. Bins with different pallet labels have to be placed on different pallets, bins with the same pallet label have to be placed on the same pallet. After all bins for a pallet have been removed from the given sequences, the corresponding stack-up place will be cleared and becomes available for a further pallet. The FIFO stack-up problem is to find a stack-up sequence such that all pallets can be build-up with the available p stack-up places. In this paper, we introduce two digraph models for the FIFO stack-up problem, namely the processing graph and the <b>sequence</b> <b>graph.</b> We show that there is a processing of some list of sequences with at most p stack-up places if and only if the <b>sequence</b> <b>graph</b> of this list has directed pathwidth at most p- 1. This connection implies that the FIFO stack-up problem is NP-complete in general, even if there are at most 6 bins for every pallet and that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, if the number p of stack-up places is assumed to be fixed. Further the processing graph allows us to show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, if the number k of sequences is assumed to be fixed. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
