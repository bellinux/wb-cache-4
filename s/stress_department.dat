40|$|Current {{oscillation}} {{will occur}} when a piezoelectric ceramic vibrator {{is driven by}} a high electric field. The mechanism of current oscillation is discussed, {{based on the results}} of the present experiment. Ring-shaped lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric vibrators are driven by a 5. 65 V electric field with a fixed frequency of slightly less than resonance, to form an oscillating current. The sample current, temperature, and phase between the driven electric field and sample current are recorded. The resonance frequency of PZT rings shifts in the direction of low frequency under a high electric field due to the heat produced by dissipated power, and then shifts back due to the effects of aging, which results in current oscillation.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in cold-formed {{members may}} {{play a significant role}} in determining their behaviour and strength, and have traditionally been obtained by laboratory measurements. This paper presents the results of research which forms part of a larger study on the theoretical predictions of residual stresses in cold-formed sections. The paper is concerned with residual stresses that arise from the coiling and uncoiling process experienced by steel sheets before they are cold formed into sections. In this paper, a closed-form solution is presented for these residual stresses, in which the coiling and uncoiling process is modelled as an elastic-plastic plane strain pure bending problem with the steel assumed to obey the von Mises yield criterion and the Prandtl-Reuss flow rule. To facilitate its application in subsequent finite element simulation of the cold-forming process, the prediction of equivalent plastic strains is also addressed in this solution. The accuracy of the solution is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with those from a finite element simulation. Numerical results from the analytical solution are also presented to illustrate the development process of residual stresses and the effects of coiling curvature and yield stress on the final residual <b>stresses.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

To achieve a high-quality part with maximum efficiency, it is essential to have a loop between the design team and the manufacturer.

It implicates various deficits of perceptual and attentional functions, and this inability to inhibit, or “gate”, irrelevant sensory inputs leads to sensory and information overload that also may result in neuronal hyperexcitability related to disturbances of habituation mechanisms. These findings seem to be particularly important {{in the context of}} modern electrophysiological and neuroimaging data suggesting that the filtering deficits in schizophrenia are likely related to deficits in the integrity of connections between various brain areas.

In this study, the fractal dimension of the fracture surface was estimated to describe the surface roughness of four types of track boards in terms of utilizing the improved projective covering method. The results showed that Weibull distributions were applicable to describing the contact stress distribution between tire and pavement, and the Weibull expectation could effectively characterize the stress level. In addition, {{it was found that}} greater stress expectations indicated more significant stress concentration effects on the pavement surface. The stress distribution increased with an increase of pavement texture depth or tire load or a decrease of the tire inflation pressure. The influence of pavement roughness and tire load was more significant than tire inflation pressure on the stress concentration. Compared to the general pavement texture depth (sand patch method), the surface fractal dimension adequately described the surface roughness including macro-texture and micro-texture, and it was directly affected by the proportion of coarse aggregate.

Specifically, alterations in pro-inflammatory cytokines have been related to the development of several psychological and neurobiological manifestations of depressive disorder, as well as to stress exposure. A number of findings point to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) as one of the central factors in these processes. Accordingly, in the present study, we test the hypothesis that specific influences of chronic stressors related to traumatic stress and dissociation are related to alterations in TNF-α levels. We performed psychometric measurement of depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]-II), traumatic stress symptoms (Trauma Symptom Checklist [TSC]- 40), and psychological and somatoform dissociation (Dissociative Experiences Scale [DES] and Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire [SDQ]- 20, respectively), and immunochemical measure of serum TNF-α in 66 inpatients with unipolar depression (mean age 43. 1 ± 7. 3 years).

In this work, statistical analyses show unavoidable large variations in the maximum nominal strains of as-cast BMGs, although they exhibited greatly-enhanced average values of the maximum nominal strains with reduced sample sizes and in the presence of stress gradients. The large variations are attributed to the intrinsic variability of the atomic arrangements stemming from the solidification processes. Nevertheless, the investigations show enhanced cut-off nominal strains (safety threshold) in the specimens with stress gradients. The findings suggest that, despite large variations in the plastic deformation behavior, BMGs are still reliable in practical structural-applications where the materials always deform under more complex <b>stress</b> states. <b>Department</b> of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{conventional}} electric instruments {{have already}} been widely used to monitor the performance of geotechnical structures. However, there are several inherent limitations of electric instruments for engineering including: electromagnetic interference, {{a large number of}} cables for multipoint measurement, signal loss in long distance transmission, and poor durability. Since the first Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor was fabricated in 1978, a significant progress has been made on the commercialization of optical fiber sensing technologies. In 1980 s, a fully distributed sensing technology named Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis (BOTDA) has been proposed and developed for measuring strain and temperature. In this paper, the authors review previous studies on the development and application of fiber optic sensors. Based on the measured strains, various analysis methods were transferred to required parameters such as displacement, force and pressure which can more directly reflect the safety of geotechnical structures under complex engineering <b>stress</b> condition. <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the time-dependent stress-strain behavior of Hong Kong marine deposits (HKMD), {{three types of}} triaxial tests have been conducted under both compression and extension states. The first is conventional undrained shear tests at different strain rates ranging from 0. 0025 to 0. 25 %/min. The second type is stress relaxation tests. The last type is undrained creep tests. The results are reported in this paper. One order increment of logarithmic strain rate causes about 5 to 9 % increase of undrained shear strength. In stress relaxation tests, the pore-water pressure increase is about 10 % of the consolidation pressure under extension states. A power law equation is presented to calculate the decay of the deviator stress in relaxation. In multi-stage triaxial creep tests, the log(strain rate) -log(t) relationship of the lower stress level is linear. The slopes of these lines are dependent on current deviator stress as well as <b>stress</b> history. <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
