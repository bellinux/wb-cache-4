40|$|Johannes Brahms {{worked his}} whole life on folksongs and he {{arranged}} folksongs for different ensembles. In 1894 he composed the Forty-nine German Folksongs. This collection is for a soloist with piano accompaniment. More {{than a third of}} the lyrics of the folksongs in this selection are Dialogues; conversations between two persons and the original folksong has been <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> alternate <b>parts</b> by <b>two</b> persons or by <b>two</b> groups <b>in</b> responsory. This study analyzes Johannes Brahms 2 ̆ 7 musical techniques, how he arranged the songs for only a soloist and how he succeeded in maintaining the original character of each folksong, which are sung responsorially. Brahms 2 ̆ 7 musical techniques, the musical form, melody, harmonization, volume, rhythm and tempo in these arrangements are well thought out and show a deep sensitivity for each part of the dialogue. Johannes Brahms was a master of all compositional techniques. That is why his musical interpretation of dialogues for a soloist seems very natural and folksong-like...|$|R
5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison <b>singing</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> or three <b>parts</b> carried {{by a single}} performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|R
5000|$|The {{order of}} the songs in the show was {{followed}} faithfully, except for [...] "With a Little Bit of Luck". The song is listed as being the third musical number in the play; in the film it is the fourth. Onstage, the song is split into <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> different scenes. <b>Part</b> of the song is sung by Doolittle and his cronies just after Eliza gives him part of her earnings, immediately before she makes {{the decision to go}} to Higgins's house to ask for speech lessons. The second half of the song is sung by Doolittle just after he discovers that Eliza is now living with Higgins. In the film, the entire song is <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> one scene that takes place just after Higgins has sung [...] "I'm an Ordinary Man". However, the song does have a dialogue scene (Doolittle's conversation with Eliza's landlady) between verses.|$|R
5000|$|... "Begin the Beguine" [...] - {{words and}} music by Cole Porter, <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> styles as <b>part</b> {{of the final}} musical piece in the film. The song is first <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> {{dramatic}} style by mezzo-soprano Lois Hodnott (who was also used to dub the vocals for screwball soprano Carmen D'Antonio in the comedy audition sequence Il Bacio {{in the middle of}} the movie) on a [...] "tropical" [...] set, with Powell, joined by Astaire dancing in side-by-side, their choreography drawing heavily from flamenco dance. Later, after it is <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> what was then contemporary jazz style by The Music Maids, Astaire and Powell tap dance to a big-band accompaniment; the sequence includes a passage in which they tap dance with no musical accompaniment. The big-band/jazz segment was featured in the 1974 documentary That's Entertainment!, which noted in the narration that the film was MGM's last black-and-white musical.|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 5 September 2012 Examining Board: Professor Antonella Romano (EUI); Professor Martin Van Gelderen (EUI); Professor Renata Ago (Universita degli studi di Roma La Sapienza); Professor Robert L. Kendrick (The University of Chicago). The musical {{genre of}} Italian oratorio—unacted, <b>sung</b> drama <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts</b> on a hagiographic, biblical, or moral plot—witnessed a great boom of {{interest}} in the priod around years around 1900 and the decades around 1700. During the first of these two periods the roots of its modern historiography were laid. One of the characteristics that emerge from both the historiography and performance tradition of Italian oratorio is its ambiguous position between the sacred and the secular spheres. The thesis argues that this was a defining characteristic of the genre as such, and that it was among the things that contributed to the popularity of the genre in the decades around in 1700. Its perceived ambiguities as a genre allowed it to be employed in and adapted to widely different performance contexts. It is further argued that the signification, function, and adaptability of the genre best emerge from studying how one and the same work was used in various differences places and circumstances. The thesis takes therefore as its basis the study of what it calls the use histories of a corpus of six librettos. By tracing how these six texts and the musical settings they engendered functioned in different contexts, a more precise picture emerges of these works’ (and the genre’s) versatility. Simultaneously, the use histories of these works highlight the relative importance of the ‘musical work’ compared to the specifics of performances, as well as add an element to a broader history of the circulation of objects in early modern Europe...|$|R
