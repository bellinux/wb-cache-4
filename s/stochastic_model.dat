This {{paper is}} devoted to the notion nondeterminism in general and {{particularly}} in <b>stochastic</b> <b>modeling.</b> It discusses how <b>stochastic</b> <b>modeling</b> formalisms can be mapped to a corresponding configuration graph which is convenient for the investigation of nondeterminism phenomena. Algorithms for mapping <b>stochastic</b> <b>models</b> onto configuration graphs are introduced, and two approaches – well-specified check and weak bisimulation – for eliminating nondeterminism are reviewed and related. ...|$|R

In recent years, the <b>stochastic</b> <b>modelling</b> approach of dialogue systems has gained interest. These <b>stochastic</b> <b>models</b> are estimated from a set of annotated dialogues. The definition of the set of labels to annotate dialogues is therefore an important issue {{in the development of}} <b>stochastic</b> dialogue <b>models.</b> We propose a set of labels, which is composed of three levels, and a set of rules for using them. The application of this labelling to a specific set of dialogues is reported. The adequacy of the set of labels for <b>stochastic</b> <b>modelling</b> is also demonstrated. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{decades have}} seen great {{progress}} {{in the use of}} <b>stochastic</b> methods to <b>model</b> aspects of water resource problems. However, the design implications of <b>stochastic</b> <b>modeling</b> have been relatively overlooked. In particular, there is little explicit realization that the <b>stochastic</b> <b>modeling</b> of single-valued, yet uncertain phenomena yields qualitatively different information than the <b>stochastic</b> <b>modeling</b> of multi-valued and uncertain phenomena in terms {{of the role of the}} modeled uncertainty in design decision-making. This paper explores this issue by way of some simple examples...|$|R
40|$|Microarray {{expression}} profiles are inherently noisy and many different sources of variation exist in microarray experiments. It {{is still a}} significant challenge to develop <b>stochastic</b> <b>models</b> to realize noise in microarray {{expression profiles}}, which has profound influence on the reverse engineering of genetic regulation. Using the target genes of the tumour suppressor gene p 53 as the test problem, we developed <b>stochastic</b> differential equation <b>models</b> and established {{the relationship between the}} noise strength of <b>stochastic</b> <b>models</b> and parameters of an error model for describing the distribution of the microarray measurements. Numerical results indicate that the simulated variance from <b>stochastic</b> <b>models</b> with a <b>stochastic</b> degradation process can be represented by a monomial in terms of the hybridization intensity and the order of the monomial depends on the type of stochastic process. The developed <b>stochastic</b> <b>models</b> with multiple <b>stochastic</b> processes generated simulations whose variance is consistent with the prediction of the error model.

25|$|Many {{mathematical}} {{models of}} physical systems are deterministic. This {{is true of}} most models involving differential equations (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called stochastic. Because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to numerical instability and a finite amount of precision in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a <b>stochastic</b> <b>model</b> even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.|$|E

2500|$|His second {{article that}} year {{delineated}} a <b>stochastic</b> <b>model</b> of Brownian motion. Brownian motion generates expressions for the {{root mean square}} displacement of particles. [...] Using the then-controversial kinetic theory of fluids, it established that the phenomenon, which still lacked a satisfactory explanation decades after it was first observed, provided empirical evidence for the reality of atoms. It also lent credence to statistical mechanics, which was also controversial at the time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study in}} 2014 argues {{the gap between}} these two {{controversial}} models can be bridged by providing an alternative explanation of tumor heterogeneity. [...] They demonstrate a model that includes aspects of both the Stochastic and CSC models. They examined cancer stem cell plasticity in which cancer stem cells can transition between non-cancer stem cells (Non-CSC) and CSC via in situ supporting a more <b>Stochastic</b> <b>model.</b> But the existence of both biologically distinct non-CSC and CSC populations supports a more CSC model, proposing that both models may {{play a vital role}} in tumor heterogeneity.|$|E
2500|$|These [...] {{mutations}} could progressively accumulate {{and enhance}} the resistance and fitness of cells {{that allow them to}} outcompete other tumor cells, better known as the somatic evolution model. The clonal evolution model, which occurs in both the CSC model and <b>stochastic</b> <b>model,</b> postulates that mutant tumor cells with a growth advantage outproliferate others. Cells in the dominant population have a similar potential for initiating tumor growth (Fig. 4). [...] These two models are not mutually exclusive, as CSCs themselves undergo clonal evolution. Thus, the secondary more dominant CSCs may emerge, if a mutation confers more aggressive properties (Fig. 5).|$|E

30|$|Commonly, {{due to the}} {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} solving the <b>stochastic</b> <b>models,</b> {{the usefulness of the}} <b>stochastic</b> <b>modelling</b> approach is always questionable. To check the suitability of using stochastic programming, the solutions of the <b>stochastic</b> programming <b>model</b> to that of a deterministic optimization problem are quantified. For <b>stochastic</b> <b>models,</b> when multiple runs of the models are averaged out, it still cannot be concluded that the output will also be the same.

2500|$|The Poisson point {{process is}} often defined {{on the real}} line, {{where it can be}} {{considered}} as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used, for example, in queueing theory [...] to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store or phone calls at an exchange, distributed in time. [...] In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network, [...] particles colliding into a detector, or trees in a forest. In this setting, the process is often used in [...] mathematical models and in the related fields of spatial point processes, stochastic geometry, spatial statistics [...] and continuum percolation theory. On more abstract spaces, the Poisson point process serves as an object of mathematical study in its own right. In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is stochastically independent to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process. [...] Despite its wide use as a <b>stochastic</b> <b>model</b> of phenomena representable as points, the inherent nature of the process implies that it does not adequately describe phenomena where there is sufficiently strong interaction between the points. This has inspired the proposal of other point processes, some of which are constructed with the Poisson point process, that seek to capture such interaction.|$|E
