5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a <b>say</b> <b>in</b> who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E

The other candidates of the party noted her enthusiasm during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would have a <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one}} who went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the matter.|$|E
5|$|The notability {{of there}} being four captains in just five Test matches can better be {{understood}} with context. The captain of a cricket team performs a vital role. Unlike many other team sports, the captain makes crucial decisions regarding on-field tactics, {{and may also}} have an important <b>say</b> <b>in</b> team selection. Traditionally, captains of international teams are not changed frequently – for example, between 1977 and 1988 (comprising 104 Test matches), only seven different men captained England, yet there were four captains {{in just a few}} weeks in the summer of 1988.|$|E

5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{documents}} declassified in 2006 {{show that}} the capture of Eichmann caused alarm at the CIA and West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). Both organizations had known {{for at least two}} years that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but did not act, because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might <b>say</b> <b>in</b> his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws (including the Nuremberg Laws). The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries.|$|E
5|$|Vanbrugh planned The Relapse, too, round these limited casting {{resources}} and minor talents, which Peter Holland has argued explains the robust, farcical {{character of the}} play; Vanbrugh's second comedy, The Provoked Wife (1697), written for the better actors of the cooperative company, is a much subtler piece. The Relapse was written in six weeks and offered to the Patent Company in March, {{but because of the}} problems with contracting and retaining actors, it did not première until November. It is known from Cibber's autobiography that Vanbrugh had a decisive <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the ongoing casting changes made during these seven months; it is not known whether he altered his text to accommodate them.|$|E

5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little <b>say</b> <b>in</b> federal decision making.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a <b>say</b> <b>in</b> shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
