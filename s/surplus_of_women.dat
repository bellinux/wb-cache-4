Black death and the sufferings caused by the Great Northern Wars made Stockholm the capital of a shrinking nation, despair which would deepen even further when Sweden lost Finland in 1809. Notwithstanding Sweden's partial recover of spirit with the union with Norway in 1814, during the period 1750-1850, Stockholm was a stagnating city, with a dwindling population and widespread unemployment, marked by ill-health, poverty, alcoholism, and rampant mortality.

[...] Wars and alcohol abuse resulted in a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> during the period, with widows outnumbering widowers six to one in 1850.

50|$|The term {{originated}} in Germany {{in the late}} 1990s to refer {{to people who are}} involuntarily single or become involuntary virgins way into adulthood. The reasoning behind their sexlessness varies from psychological issues, an unsocial life, shyness, being socially inept, or a lack of initiative in making the first move. Absolute Beginners gradually developed into communities that culminated into self-help groups of the same name. The etymology of the term derives from a David Bowie song. Absolute Beginners sometimes abbreviate their self-identification as AB, and sometimes communicate with one another on online forums. They vary in age, with some being in their 20s, others in their 30 while others are in their 40s. In some online forums, the hallmark of being an Absolute Beginner is at the age of twenty if one still has had no sexual or romantic experience. In online forums, AB's sometimes discuss tribulations associated with their status such as pressures to date and the embaressments and secrecy associated with their inexperience. Awareness of the AB community in Germany has increased. Some German AB's have attempted to document their lifestyle in order to explore the reasoning behind their ineffectiveness at courtship. The concept is considered to be analogous to other concepts such as incel (involuntary celibacy), and love-shy. The appearance of AB's has also been blamed on various factors including a skewed sex ratio, such as a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> or a surplus of men in a particular region, feminism and a perception of themselves as unattractive and the subsequent low-self esteem.|$|E

This paper introduces search frictions into a matching model with transferable utility and age-dependent match payoffs to study if this so-called marriage squeeze has caused a dowry âinflation â in India.

40|$|Abstract. The Indian {{marriage}} {{market has}} seen substantial change during the 20 th century. The {{reason may be}} a demographically driven âmarriage squeezeâ: if women marry older men, their eligible husbands come from an earlier birth cohort. Declining (child) mortality or in-creased {{growth in the number}} of births can then cause a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the marriage market. For all women to continue to marry, the age gap at marriage must shrink. At the same time, the new market conditions may lead to a higher price of husbands, contributing to the lamented âinflation â of dowries in India. This paper builds a two-sided search model to investigate the effects of demographic change on marriage age patterns and transfers at marriage. Women and men are characterized by their respective ages. They become older during search, and market entry and exit rates depend on demographic variables. Changes in demographic parameters affect not only marriage strategies and transfers for a given pair of ages, but also the age distribution of market participants and therefore the composition of observed marriage ages. It is shown that both changed marriage age patterns and dowry inflation can simultaneously arise from changing demographics. Using data on age and mar-riage status from before and after the marriage squeeze, the model predicts that the observed shifts in the age distributions and the sex ratio of unmarried men and women have led to higher dowries conditional on the age of the partners. In addition, the age-dependent mar-riage surplus can be estimated to analyze the implied change in average marriage age and dowries. The estimates suggest that average dowries have increased as well, while the age gap at marriage has reduced. (JEL J 11, J 12, O 18...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} report introduces {{a set of}} tools {{to get a better}} overview over the mechanisms in the demographic change. Further the connections between the research based process of analysis and the administrative process of policy development is discussed. A general demographic trend is the migration from smaller places to larger towns and cities. Besides that we tend to live longer and we tend to produce fewer children per woman. The consequence of this trend is that the population is gradually growing older. The main challenge in respect of gender is the uneven settlement pattern. With the exception of some major city areas few places see a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> The rest of the regions have a surplus of men. Another trend in the policy of the Nordic countries has in the recent years been to focus on attracting international migrants with a higher education. Thus, the value of international migration is seen more and more as an investment in human capital {{in the same way as}} investments are made in education itself. These are only some of the demographic challenges being discussed in the {{synthesis report}}.

40|$|Kinship {{systems in}} China, the Republic of Korea, and North India have similar {{features}} that generate discrimination against girls, and {{these countries have}} some of the highest proportions of girls"missing"in the world. The authors document how the excess mortality of girls was increased by war, famine, and fertility decline - all of which constrained household resources - between 1920 and 1990. Of the three countries, China experienced the most crises during this period (with civil war, invasion, and famine). The resulting excess mortality of girls in China offset the demographic forces making for a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> wives as overall mortality rates declined. India had the quietest history during this period, and consequently followed the expected pattern <b>of</b> a growing <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> available wives. These changes in sex ratios had substantial social ramifications. The authors hypothesize that these demographic factors: 1) Encourages the continuation of bride-price in China, while in India there was a shift to dowry. 2) Influenced the extent and manifestations <b>of</b> violence against <b>women.</b> An oversupply <b>of</b> <b>women</b> is the worst scenario for women, as there are fewer constraints to domestic violence. A shortage <b>of</b> <b>women</b> leads to better treatment of wives, as people become more careful not to lose a wife. However in situations of shortage, a small proportion <b>of</b> <b>women</b> may be subject to new types of violence such as being kidnapped for marriage. Ironically, then, higher levels of discrimination against girls can help reduce violence against women. When women are in short supply, their treatment improves. But their autonomy can increase only with fundamental changes in their family position, changes that are taking place only slowly.
