5|$|The Rodrigues parrot was scientifically {{described}} and named as Psittacus rodricanus in 1867 by the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards, {{based on a}} subfossil partial beak. The <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> refers to Rodrigues, which is itself named after the discoverer of the island, the Portuguese navigator Diogo Rodrigues. Milne-Edwards corrected the spelling of the <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> to rodericanus in 1873 (in a compilation of his articles about extinct birds), a spelling which {{was used in the}} literature henceforward, but it was changed back to rodricanus by the IOC World Bird List in 2014. Milne-Edwards moved the species to its own genus Necropsittacus in 1874; the name is derived from the Greek words necros, which means dead, and psittakos, parrot, in reference to the bird being extinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{generic name}} is a {{combination}} of the Latin prefix semi, meaning half, and noun cassis, meaning helmet. The <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> of this taxon, granulata, is derived from the Latin noun grana meaning grain. Here it is used in the diminutive form, meaning granulated, or covered in granules, i.e. small grains or pellets, referring to the shell sculpture.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} not placed {{in its own}} {{scientific}} genus, Pinguinus, until 1791. The generic name {{is derived from the}} Spanish and Portuguese name for the species, and the <b>specific</b> <b>name,</b> impennis, is from Latin and refers to the lack of flight feathers or pennae.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée. Labillardière chose the <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> obovata, {{in reference to the}} leaves of his specimen, which were obovate (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base). This leaf shape is often seen in this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- ("inverse") and ovum ("egg"), and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, to the name of the related genus Apeomys, while the <b>specific</b> <b>name,</b> savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E

5|$|Early writers {{claimed the}} Mascarene parrot {{was found on}} Madagascar, an idea that led the French naturalist and ornithologist René Primevère Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when Tommaso Salvadori {{combined}} it with the earlier <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name {{in which the two}} parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a <b>specific</b> <b>name,</b> since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Claude Casimir Gillet, the species retains the name {{which it was}} first given, but {{has a number of}} taxonomic synonyms. Its <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> honours Louis-Luc Godey. Within the genus Inocybe, it has been classified in a number of ways, but appears to form part of a clade (that is, a group sharing a common ancestor) with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica.|$|E
5|$|Hatzegopteryx {{was named}} in 2002 by French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut, and Romanian paleontologists Dan Grigorescu and Zoltan Csiki. The generic name {{is derived from}} the Hatzeg (or Hațeg) basin of Transylvania, where the bones were found, and from Greek pteryx (ἡ πτέρυξ, -υγος (also ἡ πτερύξ, -ῦγος), or 'wing'. The <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> thambema {{is derived from the}} Greek for 'terror, monster' (τό θάμβημα, -ήματος), in reference to its huge size.|$|E

5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{was first}} {{described}} by Haruki Takahashi (2002) {{in an article}} in Mycoscience, based on specimens collected from Ikuta Ryokuchi Park, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan in 2000 and 2001. The <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> sasicola refers to the fact the species grows upon the leaves of Sasa species. The Japanese common name for the species is Sasa-no-houraitake. Within the genus Mycena, it probably belongs to the section Marasmius, and the subsection Penicillati, due to characters of the stem, gills and pileipellis (the outer-most layer of the cap).|$|E
5|$|Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that it was probably a tree squirrel and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to the squirrel family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The <b>specific</b> <b>name,</b> vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{were found}} during {{fieldwork}} in northwestern Madagascar {{that started in}} 2001. The species was described in a 2010 paper by Pierre Mein and colleagues, together with another extinct rodent, Nesomys narindaensis. The <b>specific</b> <b>name,</b> mahajambaensis, refers to Mahajamba Bay, which {{is close to the}} places where the species has been found. It is placed in the genus Brachytarsomys, together with two larger living species, B.albicauda and B.villosa. Brachytarsomys is classified in the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E

5|$|The Latin <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> pennanti {{is named}} for Thomas Pennant, who {{described}} the fisher in 1771. Buffon had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a pekan. Pennant examined the same specimen but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as Schreber, who named it Mustela canadensis, and Boddaert, who named it Mustela melanorhyncha. The fisher was eventually placed in the genus Martes by Smith in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark {{was one of the}} many {{amphibia}} originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its generic name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' <b>specific</b> <b>name</b> and the current scientific name, Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.|$|E
