5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{characters from}} Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Pokémon. Melee includes all playable characters {{from the first}} game in the series on the Nintendo 64 and also adds new characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. The stages and gameplay modes make references to, or take their designs from, popular games released by Nintendo. Melees gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments, and is <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> popular fighting games for competitive play.|$|E
