5|$|Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines {{includes}} the cooking of Andalusia, Murcia, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating {{early on to}} Catalonia and Murcia along Spain's Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork, rabbit, or shellfish, sautéed in {{olive oil in a}} large <b>shallow</b> <b>pan,</b> with vegetables, and typically round-grain rice (often of the local albufera, arròs bomba, sénia varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron. The dish may be varied with artichoke hearts, peas, sweet peppers, lima beans, string beans, or sausages.|$|E
25|$|The monks rise before dawn, most around 5:00 a.m. {{but some}} {{as early as}} 2:00 a.m. In {{observance}} of utsarg-samiti, defecation {{takes place in the}} open where feces not harm living creatures; urination is into a <b>shallow</b> <b>pan,</b> which is emptied onto a dry patch of ground.|$|E
25|$|Valencians use {{the word}} paella for all pans in the Valencian language, {{including}} the specialized <b>shallow</b> <b>pan</b> used for cooking paellas. However, in most other parts of Spain and throughout Hispanic America where the Spanish language is spoken (as opposed to the Valencian language), the term paellera ("paella pan") is more commonly used for the specialised pan while paella is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it, although both terms are deemed correct for the pan, as stated by the Royal Spanish Academy, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish language in Spain. Paelleras are traditionally round, shallow, and made of polished steel with two handles.|$|E

50|$|Hyperolius argus is {{a common}} species living near water in low {{elevation}} dense, humid savanna and grassland. Breeding takes place in vegetated <b>shallow</b> <b>pans,</b> vleis and marshes, typically in temporary water.|$|R
5000|$|It is Swaziland's largest {{protected}} area and park. The park and its adjacent dispersal areas covers 30,000 ha of Swazi bushveld. It is a flat lowland area, covered with ancient hardwood trees like knobthorn, leadwood and tambuti, with some grasslands and <b>shallow</b> <b>pans.</b>|$|R
500|$|Traditionally, {{clotted cream}} {{was created by}} {{straining}} fresh cow's milk, letting it stand in a <b>shallow</b> <b>pan</b> in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream {{to rise to the}} surface, then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling. The clots that formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a reamer or raimer. [...] By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, which produced far more clotted cream than the traditional method from the same amount of milk. As a farmer's wife in Poundsgate said, [...] "the separator saves a whole cow!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Outside of {{the central}} valleys, the city of Tehuantepec also as a {{significant}} pottery tradition. The most distinctive aspect are the figures of women, which average about a meter tall and have on their heads a <b>shallow</b> <b>pan</b> of sand to set a water storage jar. Miniature figures based on these are similar in design but are often painted in accents of white and gold. These are called [...] "tanguyus" [...] and are created to be given as gifts to {{mark the end of}} the year.|$|E
2500|$|Annealing brass {{to make it}} softer {{and less}} brittle is fairly easy, but {{annealing}} cartridge cases is a more complex matter. Since {{the base of the}} case must be hard, it cannot be annealed. What is needed is a form of heat treatment called differential hardening, where heat is carefully applied to part of the case until the desired softness is reached, and then the heat treatment process is halted by rapidly cooling the case. [...] Since annealing brass requires heating it to about 660°F (350°C), the heating must be done {{in such a way as}} to heat the neck to that temperature, while preventing the base of the case from being heated and losing its hardness. The traditional way is to stand the cases in a <b>shallow</b> <b>pan</b> full of water, then heat the necks of the cases with a torch, but this method makes it difficult to get an even heating of the entire case neck. A temperature-sensitive crayon can be used at the point to which it is to be annealed, which is just behind the shoulder for bottlenecked cartridges, or at the bottom of the bullet seating depth for straight-wall cartridges. The neck of the case is placed in a propane torch flame and heated it until the crayon mark changes color, indicating the correct temperature. Once the correct temperature is reached the case is completely quenched in water to stop the annealing process at the desired hardness. [...] Failing to keep the base of the case cool can anneal the case near the head, where it must remain hard to function properly. [...] Another approach is to immerse the case mouth in a molten alloy of lead that is at the desired annealing temperature for a few seconds, then quickly shake off the lead and quench the case.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are Nama karroo shrubland, grassland, dry savanna, and pastureland. It is a locally common species that breeds in various small waterbodies (temporary <b>shallow</b> <b>pans,</b> pools or depressions containing rainwater, quarries, and rock pools along rivers). It is locally threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The {{surrounding}} rural landscape, {{not more}} than a few minutes’ drive from any part of the city, consists of relatively flat plains dotted with hills, mainly outcropping basement rock (andesite) to the north and north west, or Karoo age dolerite to the south and east. <b>Shallow</b> <b>pans</b> formed in the plains.|$|R
50|$|The ash of {{the plants}} was then {{carefully}} sieved and then placed into water to be gently boiled with constant mixing. Then the ashen mixture was placed into <b>shallow</b> <b>pans</b> to be dried. Once dried the alume catino would repeat the boiling and drying process until all of the salt was extracted from the ashes.|$|R
6000|$|The {{number of}} {{vibrations}} per {{second in the}} note of a whistle or other [...] "closed pipe" [...] depends on its depth. The theory of acoustics shows that the length of each complete vibration is four {{times that of the}} depth of the closed pipe, and since experience proves that all sound, whatever may be its pitch, is propagated at the same rate, which under ordinary conditions of temperature and barometric pressure may be taken at 1120 feet, or 13,440 inches per second,--it follows that the number of vibrations in the note of a whistle may be found by dividing 13,440 by four times the depth, measured in inches, of the inner tube of the whistle. This rule, however, supposes the vibrations of the air in the tube to be strictly longitudinal, and ceases to apply when the depth of the tube is less than about one and a half times its diameter. When the tube is reduced to a <b>shallow</b> <b>pan,</b> a note may still be produced by it, but that note has reference rather to the diameter of the whistle than to its depth, being sometimes apparently unaltered by a further decrease of depth. The necessity of preserving a fair proportion between the diameter and the depth of a whistle is the reason why these instruments, having necessarily little depth, require to be made with very small bores.|$|E
5000|$|The word scuttler comes, via Middle English and Old English, {{from the}} Latin word Scutula, meaning a <b>shallow</b> <b>pan.</b> It {{is often called}} a hod due to its {{structural}} integrity being derived from a raw material commonly found on Mars.|$|E

50|$|Tofu skin, yuba, {{bean curd}} skin, bean curd sheet, or bean curd robes, is a food product made from soybeans. During the boiling of soy milk, {{in an open}} <b>shallow</b> <b>pan,</b> a film or skin forms on the liquid surface. The films are {{collected}} and dried into yellowish sheets known as tofu skin. Since tofu skin is not produced using a coagulant, it is not technically a proper tofu; however, it does have similar texture and flavor to some tofu products.|$|E
50|$|Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines {{includes}} the cooking of Andalusia, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia and now popular across {{a much wider}} area, made in many versions.

Other local ingredients may include artichoke hearts, peas, sweet peppers, sausages and so on.|$|E
50|$|To {{maintain}} top quality, berries {{are harvested}} {{at least every}} other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least half an inch of stem left. Strawberries need {{to remain on the}} plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease spreadings. The berries do not get washed until just before consumption. They are covered in a <b>shallow</b> <b>pan</b> and refrigerated when storing.|$|E

50|$|Gold panning {{is mostly}} a manual {{technique}} of separating gold from other materials. Wide, <b>shallow</b> <b>pans</b> are filled with sand and gravel that may contain gold. The pan is submerged in water and shaken, sorting the gold from the gravel and other material. As gold is much denser than rock, it quickly settles {{to the bottom of}} the pan. The panning material is usually removed from stream beds, often at the inside turn in the stream, or from the bedrock shelf of the stream, where the density of gold allows it to concentrate, a type called placer deposits.|$|R
50|$|The {{conservation}} of textiles {{should always be}} left to a specialist conservator. Before any conservation treatment {{the composition of the}} textile must be identified. Testing textiles such as burning a sample can quickly identify the presence of animal fiber, animal fiber will not burn readily and shrivel into a carbon residue. Plant fibers burns easily to a fine ash. Overall simple testings can enable the conservator to identify the type of textile fiber. The proper treatment of textiles requires the use of flat, <b>shallow</b> <b>pans,</b> hot plates, and racks, or other devices that can support fragile textiles during rinsing, treatment, and drying.|$|R
