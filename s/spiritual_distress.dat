40|$|Background: Leukemia and hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) create physical, psychological, social, and <b>spiritual</b> <b>distresses</b> in patients. Understanding this threatening situation in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT will assist health care professionals in providing holistic care to the patients. Objectives: The aim {{of the present study}} was exploring the perceived threat in adults with leukemia undergoing HSCT. Patients and Methods: This article is part of a longitudinal qualitative study which used the grounded theory approach and was conducted in 2009 - 2011. Ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for HSCT were recruited from the Hematology–Oncology Research Center and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran. A series of pre-transplant and post-transplant in-depth interviews were held in the hospital’s HSCT wards. Totally, 18 interviews were conducted. Three written narratives were also obtained from the participants. The Corbin and Strauss approach was used to analyze the data. Results: Perceived threat was one of the main categories that emerged from the data. This category included four subcategories, "inattention to the signs and symptoms", "doubt and anxiety", "perception of danger and time limitation" and "change of life conditions", which occurred in linear progression over time. Conclusion: Suffering from leukemia and experiencing HSCT are events that are uniquely perceived by patients. This threatening situation can significantly effect perception of patients and cause temporary or permanent alterations in patients' lives. Health care professionals can help these patients by deeper understanding of their experiences and effective interventions...|$|R

40|$|Even {{though a}} {{majority}} of Americans report having spiritual/religious beliefs, the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is not well understood. Moreover, given {{that the experience of}} spirituality/religiosity differs for men and women, {{it is possible that the}} strength of the association between spirituality/religiosity and health may also differ by gender. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and three markers of health and well-being, and any gender differences in these relationships. First, we test the hypothesis that engagement with formal religious institutions (i. e. public religious activity) will be more beneficial for men than for women and we examine the role of denominational affiliation in any observed differences. Second, we directly compare effects of three different kinds of religious activities (public and private religious activity and spiritual experience) on health and well-being. Data are from the 1998 US General Social Survey, a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized adults. Participants were asked about the frequency of engaging in public and private religious activities and having <b>spiritual</b> experiences. Psychological <b>distress,</b> happiness and self-rated health were used as indicators of health and well-being. Results suggest that weekly public religious activity was significantly associated with better health and well-being. Furthermore, this relationship was stronger for men than women and was influenced by denominational affiliation. When public religious activity, private religious activity and spiritual experiences were considered simultaneously, public religious activity emerged as the most consistent predictor of health and well-being among men. Among women, both public religious activity and spiritual experiences maintained an independent association with the health and well-being. These results suggest that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the unmet self, relational, and <b>spiritual</b> needs underlying <b>distress</b> in couple relationships. The study was framed in Object Relations Theory and Self Psychology and the literature on spirituality and spiritual needs. Self needs were defined as {{the need to be}} affirmed for one’s lovability and the need to be admired for one’s competence. Relational needs were defined as the need for connection, and the need to be autonomous and one’s own person, {{while at the same time}} remaining connected. Spiritual needs were defined as the need for purpose and meaning in life, the need to establish interdependence with others, the need for inner peace, and the need for transcendence. Participants were 73 heterosexual couples who had been married and/or living together in a committed relationship for at least five years. A quantitative / qualitative mixed method was used to gather the data using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. From the 73 couples, eight high distress couples and eight low distress couples were selected for the analysis. Multivariate Analysis of Variance was used to test for group differences on unmet self, relational, and spiritual needs. Using all 73 couples, Regression Analysis was used to identify which of the unmet self, relational, and spiritual needs were predictors of distress. Using Giorgi’s Psychological Phenomenological Method, one high distress couple and one low distress couple from the 73 couples participated in a semi-structured interview. Results of the MANOVA suggest that high distress couples differ from low distress couples on the self need for lovability, the relational need for autonomy, and on all of the spiritual needs. Results of the Regression Analysis suggest that inner peace and transcendence are strong predictors of distress in couple relationships. Results of the qualitative analysis suggest that low distress couples are better able to empathize and respond to the needs of their partners while the high distress couples are unable to set their own needs aside in order to respond to the needs of their partner...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{interpersonal}} offenses {{have considerable}} {{consequences for the}} victim, and these sequelae can be both negative and positive. Spiritual transformation and forgiveness are two processes that may follow a significant interpersonal offense. Spiritual transformation, which includes both spiritual gain and spiritual decline, is an important experience for many individuals following a highly stressful event. Likewise, forgiveness is one way that individuals may cope with {{the negative effects of}} being the victim of an interpersonal offense. Both spiritual transformation and forgiveness are related to physical and mental health. Given the prevalence of interpersonal offenses, the mental health link, and the personal importance of religion and spirituality to many individuals, it is imperative to understand these processes. However, the extant literature offers very little about the relationship between spiritual transformation and forgiveness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the role of forgiveness in experiencing spiritual transformation following significant interpersonal offenses. Participants were 146 individuals that had been 2 ̆ 2 significantly wronged 2 ̆ 2 by another person. Participants provided information on demographic variables, religious and <b>spiritual</b> importance, event-related <b>distress,</b> forgiveness, and <b>spiritual</b> transformation. Descriptive data are presented as well as correlates of spiritual transformation. Results showed that spiritual growth was positively related to religious and spiritual importance but not forgiveness variables. Event-related distress and avoidance, one component of unforgiveness, were positively related to spiritual decline. Regression analyses revealed that forgiveness did not uniquely account for a significant amount of the variance in spiritual growth after controlling for demographic variables, religious and spiritual importance, and event-related distress. Rather, religious and spiritual importance accounted for a significant amount of variance in spiritual growth. Forgiveness uniquely predicted spiritual decline after accounting for demographic variables, religious and spiritual importance, and event-related distress. This study suggests a complex relationship between spiritual transformation and forgiveness. Results are discussed within the context of implications for clinicians and researchers alike...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{lack of a}} {{holistic}} approach to palliative care {{can lead to a}} fractured sense of dignity at the end of life, resulting in depression, hopelessness, feelings of being a burden to others, and the loss of the will to live among terminally ill patients. Building on the clinical foundation of Dignity Therapy, together with the empirical understanding of dignity-related concerns of Asian families facing terminal illness, a novel Family Dignity Intervention (FDI) has been developed for Asian palliative care. FDI comprises a recorded interview with a patient and their primary family caregiver, which is transcribed, edited into a legacy document, and returned to the dyads for sharing {{with the rest of the}} patient’s family. The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of FDI in reducing psychosocial, emotional, <b>spiritual,</b> and psychophysiological <b>distress</b> in community-dwelling and in-patient, Asian, older terminally ill patients and their families living in Singapore. Methods/design An open-label randomized controlled trial. One hundred and twenty-six patient-family dyads are randomly allocated to one of two groups: (1) an intervention group (FDI offered in addition to standard psychological care) and (2) a control group (standard psychological care). Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes are assessed in face-to-face interviews at baseline, 3 days and 2 weeks after intervention, as well as during an exit interview with family caregivers at 2 months post bereavement. Primary outcome measures include sense of dignity for patients and psychological distress for caregivers. Secondary outcomes include meaning in life, quality of life, spirituality, hopefulness, perceived support, and psychophysiological wellbeing, as well as bereavement outcomes for caregivers. Qualitative data are analyzed using the Framework method. Discussion To date, there is no available palliative care intervention for dignity enhancement in Asia. This first-of-its-kind study develops and tests an evidence-based, family driven, psycho-socio-spiritual intervention for enhancing dignity and wellbeing among Asian patients and families facing mortality. It addresses a critical gap in the provision of holistic palliative care. The expected outcomes will contribute to advancements in both theories and practices of palliative care for Singapore and its neighboring regions while serving to inform similar developments in other Asian communities.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis study {{considers}} {{the adequacy of}} explanatory accounts of recruitment to New Religious Movements [NRMs], defined by their doctrinal innovation or importation from another culture, and formed around a charismatic leader. It {{considers the}} coercive persuasion paradigm [brainwashing] which assumes no predisposing features of those who become involved in NRMs and a sociological account by Snow Zurcher and Ekland-Olsen (1980) which seeks to redress overly exclusive attention to psychological variables by emphasising the importance of structural variables such as the existence of 'discretionary time' and having a friend involved in the NRM. It is suggested that a psychological focus in explaining movement involvement need not entail a de-emphasis of the relevance of current life circumstances, such as social bonds, and life stress, nor a failure to acknowledge {{the importance of the}} group's ideology in lending definition to a person’s felt difficulties. A new model of personal change is proposed, termed the Rites de Passage model, which entails the disruption, transition and reincorporation of a socially sustained sense of identity and suggests conversion can be viewed as an example of re-socialisation. The historical lineage of the model is traced from Van Gennep's (1908) anthropological work to studies of brainwashing in the work of Schein (1957) and Lifton (1961). Since the emphasis is on the profile of a seeker, specific focus is placed on the early phases of this process where disruption occurs in existing coping techniques and social supports as a result of disruptive life events, and consideration is given to other relevant precursors of movement involvement. Lofland and Stark's (1965) model forms the conceptual framework from which literature regarding differences in life stress, social bonds, prior behavioural involvement in NRMs, and prior cognitive spiritual orientation can be addressed. The work of Galanter (1980, 1989), Barker (1981, 1984), Heirich (1977) and Snow and Phillips (1980) provides substantial evidence for the existence of pre-existing differences between affiliates (who make contact with such movements) and nonaffiliates (who do not). In this thesis two facets of differential involvement are addressed: i) why does one individual rather than another become involved ii) with a given genre of movement rather than another? The Rites de Passage model proposed here, which is a modified version of Lofland and Stark's (1965) account of cult conversion, is tested placing NRMs in a comparative context with a secular self-help agency: a therapy group. People with disrupted social identities might seek movement involvement, but what distinguishes whether they seek out a secular or spiritual movement, and if spiritual – what determines the appeal of eastern or western spiritual groups? To explore these questions, four groups of affiliates to three different eastern NRMs are compared to a therapy group, (Richardson and Kilbourne, 1984), two control groups (a student sample, and a sample from the general population) and a western NRM. There are 160 subjects overall, who completed a battery of questionnaires at point of first contact with the movement, to distinguish the precursors for movement involvement from the sequelae. Exceptions to this prospective data collection were the western NRM and the inclusion of a graduate rebirthing group. The latter was deliberately included to facilitate pre-involvement and post-involvement comparisons. The former's adept status was due to the leader's reluctance to burden new members with a three hour test battery. Measures were taken regarding life events and their psychological impact using Henderson, Byrne and Ducan-Jones (1981) recent life events inventory and impact scales using a twelve month time frame. A modified version of the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (by Henderson et al, 1981) was used to assess the availability and adequacy of acquaintance-level and intimate bonds in the recent past. Mental health was assessed using Galanter's (1980) General Wellbeing Scale and Tellegen's Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (1982). Recollections of early family relations were assessed using Likert scales derived from the detailed comparative study by Ullman (1982) which suppported the psychoanalytic hypothesis regarding troubled early parental relations, suggesting that current life difficulties re-evoked early life problems. Since disruption is seen as a necessary but not sufficient condition for movement involvement (Greil, 1977) the therapy and eastern groups were not expected to differ from each on the disruption and loneliness measures, and they did not differ. They were expected to have experienced more disruption in greater isolation than the control groups and those already belonging to a spiritual group – namely the western NRM. The therapy and eastern NRM groups did differ from the others in these respects. The value-added form of the model merely specifies that a substrate of stress and disruption suffered in relative isolation and loneliness will increase the probability that some for of social agency will be sought. Disruption experienced in relative loneliness is the first component of differential recruitment to movement involvement, or ‘differential openness’ as it is termed here. So the brainwashing model does not hold as there are differences between those drawn to movements compared to control groups. Do personality differences contribute to which movement genre appeals? A strikingly different personality profile emerged of those drawn to eastern NRMs. Differences were predicted and found between the eastern groups {{on the one hand and}} therapy group, control groups and western group on the other, when personality variables were considered. Relevant features of the profile included: a lack of traditionalism, a challenging attitude to conventional authority (assessed by Ray's (1971) balanced F scale) and absorption - a tendency to experience perceptual phenomena indicative of an absorptive or mystical tendency (Tellegen's MPQ was used to assess this personality feature). The eastern groups have a personality profile of being: unconventional, somewhat impulsive and highly absorptive in perceptual style. This profile distinguished them from all other groups. When the additional feature of the model was considered the profile of a potential seeker was more strongly delineated: the consonance between an individual’s intensity and orientation of spiritual beliefs and the orientation of movement ideology was highly influential. This was assessed by a spiritual orientation scale [the SOS] developed by the author across three pilot studies using Coombs Unfolding Technique (Coombs, 1964) to produce a metric ordinal scale which assesses general spiritual beliefs (which underlie any spiritual worldview), eastern and western spiritual beliefs. A major finding of the study was that a markedly distinctive feature of those drawn to NRMs is a spiritual orientation consonant with that of the movement approached. The SOS revealed a strongly demarcated pre-existing eastern spiritual orientation in those drawn to make contact with Eastern NRMs, which set them apart significantly from all other groups. The Western NRM, (already members of their group) had a western spiritual orientation, to the exclusion of an eastern orientation, while the eastern groups were more eclectic. Both eastern and western NRMs were spiritually more intense on the general spiritual items of the SOS, suggesting these items are central to any spiritual worldview. All of the major predictions of the Rites de Passage model were supported. The model provides a welcome link between a sociological and psychological focus on movement involvement. The systematic differences between affiliates and non-affiliates of NRMs at point of first contact, suggest (contra contemporary brainwashing models, though not the sophisticated models of Schein and Lifton) that recruitment is unlikely to be completely due to NRM design: the results suggest participants are likely to be interested and consenting. In summary, it is shown that those drawn to New Religious Movements of an eastern kind are indeed non-traditional, have a high incidence of recent life events and suffer a sense of community isolation, and loneliness which are considered as factors which might lead a person to modify an unfulfilling lifestyle. A portrait of a seeker is lightly (sketched against a background of this dissatisfaction) which includes personality variables like an impulsive, present-oriented pleasure/pain regulatory style, being high on absorption -a mystical perceptual style, and having both an intensity and a congruence of spiritual orientation with that of the ideology of the movement approached. These are considered potential influences on the genre of movement contacted, and are suggested as explanatory of the second facet of differential openness to movement involvement. Disruption sets a person seeking; personality shapes to which appeals s/he is open. The relative privilege of the Western NRM in terms of reduced stress, availability of community and intimate social support suggests that involvement does provide a relief effect, though caution must be exercised in interpreting this difference as these groups differ in membership status and <b>spiritual</b> orientation. The <b>distress</b> and neediness of those contacting movements for the first time is apparent, which suggests that movement contact might be a response to felt dissatisfaction interpreted within a spiritual worldview. An eastern spiritual worldview is a highly significant distinguishing feature of affiliates, and is the final phase of the Rites de Passage Model. Speculative theoretical consideration is offered of the data's implications for a psychoanalytic consideration of movement involvement, in the light of Cushman (1986), Deutsch (1983), Halperin (1983) Doi (1971) and Kohut's (1977).

5000|$|Melville's Geneva-Bible-based lexicon largely eschews {{specifically}} Scots {{items of}} vocabulary, and thus poses few problems for a non-Scotophone reader. The sound of Melville's language, however, {{is that of}} her native late 16th-century Fifeshire Scots, and her artistry and technical skill are all the more apparent when her work is pronounced as Scots. This {{is no easy task}} in view of the vagaries and often very anglicised spelling of her scribes and printers; by 1603, when Ane Godlie Dreame was first printed, the traditional Scots system orthography had long started to break down under the impact of imports of English printed books. [...] Melville's lines also need to be correctly scanned: she did not write unmetrical doggerel. In her verse, the standard Middle Scots written termination [...] "-is" [...] (marking plural nouns or the 3rd person singular) is almost never to be given syllabic value; the same often applies to the past participle ending ‘-it’, while - as so often in Middle Scots - intervocalic [...] "v" [...] is very frequently elided (cf. ‘Hallowe'en’ and ‘o’er’). Like all the vernacular poetry of late 16th- and early 17th-century Scotland, Melville's work uses much alliteration, and so [...] "k" [...] in words beginning [...] "kn", and [...] "w" [...] (pronounced as [...] "v") in words beginning [...] "wr" [...] should be voiced, e.g. ‘vretchit’ for written ‘wretchit’. [...] The guttural consonant [...] "ch" [...] should always be given its proper value, even if spelled [...] "gh” and the sound represented by ‘ow’ in words like ‘downe’ and ‘crowne’, or by ‘ou’ in words like ‘out’ and ‘about’, is ‘oo’, as in modern spoken Scots.) [...] As her rhyme-schemes show, in Melville's Fife-Angus dialect, words like [...] "peace", [...] "cease", or [...] "heid" [...] and [...] "deid" [...] were pronounced as [...] "pace, sayss, hayd, dayd" [...] (cf. modern Ulster pronunciation). [...] Like other Scots poets, Melville makes occasional use of ‘southern’ pronunciation of certain sounds for the purposes of rhyme; for example, when written [...] "moir/more" [...] is rhymed with [...] "gloir" [...] or [...] "befoir" [...] it is not pronounced as [...] "mair". [...] The richer the Scots in which Melville's lines are read, and the more accurately they are scanned, the greater their musicality. In her song lyrics, the lines are well shaped to the melodies she chose, and when sung, these poems are deeply affecting. [...] The impact of Melville's work in general is greatly heightened by being heard: Ane Godlie Dreame proved to be an effective performance piece at the Elizabeth Melville Day Symposium on 21 June 2014. [...] Also suitable for performance by two voices is the lengthy penultimate poem in the Bruce Manuscript, a dialogue between the soul of someone in great <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> - perhaps even dying? - and a soberly consoling spiritual counsellor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with worse health outcomes. Assessing patient's spirituality seems especially relevant in older patients undergoing post-acute rehabilitation. However, few instruments are designed to assess <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress.</b> The objectives of this research were 1) to conceptualize the spiritual dimension and to develop an instrument to assess <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> in hospitalized older patients; 2) to determine <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> prevalence and to investigate its relationship with rehab outcomes. A qualitative approach was used to develop the <b>Spiritual</b> <b>Distress</b> Assessment Tool (SDAT). The SDAT is a semi-structured interview that assess unmet spiritual needs, and quantifies <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress.</b> In a pilot study among rehab patients (N= 69, 82. 5  8. 3 years), 61 % reported <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress.</b> Compared to the others, these patients had more functional impairment and tended to have longer stay. Further studies are needed to determine whether spiritual intervention would be effective to address <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> and improve health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Although {{affective and}} spiritual states may share some common {{clinical}} features, the precise {{nature of the}} relationship between depression and spirituality is still unclear. We tested the hypothesis that two instruments that measure depressive symptoms and <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> describe similar dimensions. Methods: Patients admitted to geriatric rehabilitation (N = 185; mean age 81. 3 ± 6. 9 years) had depressive symptoms assessed with the 15 -item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS- 15) and <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> evaluated with the <b>Spiritual</b> <b>Distress</b> Assessment Tool (SDAT). Results: A principal components analysis pooling GDS- 15 and SDAT resulted in a 6 -factor solution, with only one factor shared by both dimensions. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> measured by the two instruments appeared only moderately correlated and corresponded to distinct dimensions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{spirituality is}} usually {{considered}} a positive resource {{for coping with}} illness, <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> may have a negative influence on health outcomes. Tools are needed to identify <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> in clinical practice and subsequently address identified needs. This study describes the first steps {{in the development of}} a clinically acceptable instrument to assess <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> in hospitalized elderly patients. METHODS: A three-step process was used to develop the <b>Spiritual</b> <b>Distress</b> Assessment Tool (SDAT) : 1) Conceptualisation by a multidisciplinary group of a model (Spiritual Needs Model) to define the different dimensions characterizing a patient's spirituality and their corresponding needs; 2) Operationalisation of the Spiritual Needs Model within geriatric hospital care leading to a set of questions (SDAT) investigating needs related to each of the defined dimensions; 3) Qualitative assessment of the instrument's acceptability and face validity in hospital chaplains. RESULTS: Four dimensions of spirituality (Meaning, Transcendence, Values, and Psychosocial Identity) and their corresponding needs were defined. A formalised assessment procedure to both identify and subsequently score unmet spiritual needs and <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> was developed. Face validity and acceptability in clinical practice were confirmed by chaplains involved in the focus groups. CONCLUSIONS: The SDAT appears to be a clinically acceptable instrument to assess <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> in elderly hospitalised persons. Studies are ongoing to investigate the psychometric properties of the instrument and to assess its potential to serve as a basis for integrating the spiritual dimension in the patient's plan of care...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} concepts and clinical indicators that evidence <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> in patients. Integrative review was the method adopted {{for the development}} of the study. In the initial stage, 82 studies were found in the following databases PUBMED, COCHRANE, CINAHL, LILACS and North American Nursing Diagnosis Association Conference Proceedings and 18 were selected. The descriptors used were spirituality and nursing diagnosis in addition to the term <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress.</b> Literature review (38. 9 %) and articles with level of evidence IV (27. 8 %) were the predominant types of study. The analysis of the articles revealed that the identified concepts of <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> presented common and related elements to the human being subjective and individual response to life experiences, which harm the human spiritual dimension. Defining <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> is a complex task since it depends on the perspective of those evaluating it, limiting in this way, its generalization. However, knowledge regarding the constructs that guide the understanding of human spirituality can base the nursing care in its spiritual dimension, thus providing theoretical support for the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Spirituality {{includes}} notions {{as diverse}} as the purpose and meaning of one's life, the feeling of internal peace and harmony. Several epidemiological studies have shown evidence of an association between spirituality and mental, physical, as well as functional health status. These evidences, in conjunction with the high incidence of <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> observed in older patients, increased the interest toward improving the assessment and management of <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> in these older patients. Several ongoing studies investigate the benefits to expect from such intervention...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{this article}} {{describes}} the assessment of the spiritual wellbeing of elderly patients with cancer submitted to chemotherapy and possible predictive factors of the <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> diagnosis. METHODOLOGY: this is a methodological study for clinical validation of a nursing diagnosis, using interviews to assist in completing the form. RESULTS: 45 elderly patients participated in this study, Catholics, mostly female, diagnosed with breast cancer, average age of 70. 3 years. The prevalence of <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress</b> was of 42 %; 24. 4 % of the elderly patients were under anti-depressant medication. A significant association was noted between <b>spiritual</b> <b>distress,</b> anti-depressant medication and level of education; an increase (not significant) was acknowledged {{at the start of the}} treatment. CONCLUSION: these results emphasize the relevance of clarifying this diagnosis and the responsibility of nurses to provide spiritual care to patients. Interventions should be planned appropriately every time a nursing diagnosis is identified as a complex answer and for which pharmacological treatment is not sufficient...|$|E
