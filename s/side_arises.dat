These are long and tapering, each with an eye behind and medial to its base. A pallial tentacle arises from the mantle edge on the right. In males (small, young animals) a penis with an open seminal groove on its dorsal <b>side</b> <b>arises</b> behind the right tentacle; in females (larger, older) a vestige of this persists. The foot is large but narrow, broad anteriorly, with conspicuous opercular lobes behind. The animal is white.|$|E

Edrich was called up to the side for the Second Test, at Lord's, and did not disappoint, scoring 120. The match ended in a draw due to rain. However, he was not selected for the 1964–65 tour of South Africa.|$|R

50|$|BiSL is {{a public}} domain {{standard}} since 2005, governed by the ASL BiSL foundation (previously ASL Foundation). The framework describes a standard for processes within business information management at the strategy, management and operations level. BiSL {{is closely related to}} the ITIL and ASL framework, yet the main difference between these frameworks is that ITIL and ASL focus on the supply side of information (the purpose of an IT organisation), whereas BiSL focuses on the demand <b>side</b> (<b>arising</b> from the end-user organisation).|$|R
50|$|In this period, the draped {{garments}} {{and straight}} seams of previous centuries {{were replaced by}} curved seams and the beginnings of tailoring, which allowed clothing to more closely fit the human form, as did the use of lacing and buttons.

50|$|SV St. Georg Hamburg is a German {{association}} {{football club}} playing in Hamburg. The club was established 3 June 1895 and shares a common origin with FC Hammonia Hamburg: both <b>sides</b> <b>arose</b> {{out of the}} students group Seminarvereinigung Frisch-Auf with St. Georg being formed first on the left bank of the Alster River, and Hammonia appearing later on the right bank. Like their brother side, St. Georg was {{a founding member of}} the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association) at Leipzig in 1900. However, while Hammonia folded after only a short existence, St. Georg still plays today.|$|R
50|$|The {{rivalry between}} these two <b>sides</b> <b>arise</b> from the Roosters {{recruiting}} Brad Fittler and Phil Gould from the Panthers {{in an attempt to}} turn the Roosters' fortunes around after almost a decade out of the finals. The pair had both won a premiership with the Panthers in 1991 and were looking to do the same at the Roosters. In fact, the Roosters failed to make the Grand Final with both Fittler (who was appointed captain during his arrival at the Roosters) and Gould, only for the Roosters to get there the year after Gould quit coaching the Roosters.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{facial nerve}} and close {{relationship}} between its branches and parotid duct were investigated. Methods: This study was performed on 31 half heads of 16 fixed cadavers. The extracranial course of the nerve was exposed. The posterior auricular nerve origined from facial nerve and branches forming the parotid and buccal plexuses were investigated. The parotid duct and anastomoses between branches of the nerve were also investigated. Results: We observed differences {{in the course of}} the branches of the facial nerve. The posterior auricular nerve was arised directly from the facial nerve before entering the parotid gland in 20 <b>sides,</b> <b>arised</b> from onset of cervicofacial ramus in 10 <b>sides</b> and <b>arised</b> from temporofacial ramus in one side. Pattern differences of parotid and buccal plexuses and especially anastomoses between the branches were identified. Conclusion: We are in the opinion that the knowledge of courses and relationships of the branches of the facial nerve will actually provide a great benefit in preventing surgical complications.

30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{preceding}} discussion, we conclude that the Plain and Hilly Terrain scenarios have similar time dispersive behaviors because the mountain in Hilly Terrain is relatively far from the rail, the reflected wave is too weak to be detected by TSMQ after the penetration loss of the carriage. Whereas, Railway Station and USG show significantly stronger multipath effects. In Railway Station scenario, radio waves will undergo the reflection many times, which induced from isolated components from reflections of strong stationary scatterers, e.g., the wall, pillar and roof of the platform. In USG environment diffuse reflections, caused by weak static scatterers such as cement slope <b>sides,</b> <b>arise</b> frequently.|$|R
40|$|The flow of {{superfluid}} 3 He-B {{through a}} 65 x 65 array of nanometer size apertures has been measured recently by Backhaus et al. They {{find in the}} current [...] phase relation a new branch, so-called pi state. We study two limiting cases which show that the pi state arises from coupling of the phase degree of freedom to the spin-orbit rotation. The pi state exists in a single large aperture, but is difficult to observe because of hysteresis. A better correspondence with experiments is obtained by assuming a thin wall, where the Josephson coupling between the two <b>sides</b> <b>arises</b> from a dense array of pin-holes.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the four muscles of the rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle and teres major muscles arise and exist in the shoulder region itself. The deltoid muscle covers the shoulder joint on three <b>sides,</b> <b>arising</b> from the front upper third of the clavicle, the acromion, and {{the spine of the}} scapula, and travelling to insert on the deltoid tubercle of the humerus. Contraction of each part of the deltoid assists in different movements of the shoulder - flexion (clavicular part), abduction (middle part) and extension (scapular part). The teres major attaches to the outer part {{of the back of the}} scapula, beneath the teres minor, and attaches to the upper part of the humerus. It helps with medial rotation of the humerus.|$|R

The river narrowed to a fraction of its width and roared through this gloomy passage in a madness of motion that heaped the water in the center into a ridge fully eight feet higher than at the rocky sides. This ridge, in turn, was crested with stiff, upstanding waves that curled over yet remained each in its unvarying place. The Canyon was well feared, for it had collected its toll of dead from the passing goldrushers.|$|R
50|$|Awareness of {{response}} bias has been present in psychology and sociology literature {{for some time}} because self-reporting features significantly in those fields of research. However, researchers were initially unwilling to admit {{the degree to which}} they impact, and potentially invalidate research utilizing these types of measures. Some researchers believed that the biases present in a group of subjects cancel out when the group is large enough. This would mean that the impact {{of response}} bias is random noise, which washes out if enough participants are included in the study. However, at the time this argument was proposed, effective methodological tools that could test it were not available. Once newer methodologies were developed, researchers began to investigate the impact of response bias. From this renewed research, two opposing <b>sides</b> <b>arose.</b>|$|R

In 1886, {{in the first of}} three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York. ADT did not merge with Western Union to become its subsidiary until 1901.|$|R

This mass of buildings was still alight at midnight, {{at which point the}} flames were licking at St. Mary's church; but this was saved by heroic effort. In the emergency, it was resolved to demolish by explosion some of the already shattered houses to the east of the fire to form a firebreak, a task quickly accomplished by parties of sappers and miners. By this means, and by the action of the powerful floating engines, the fire was confined and at length consumed and extinguished.|$|R
