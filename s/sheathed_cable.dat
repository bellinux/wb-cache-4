50|$|A ceiling-mounted {{light fixture}} was {{installed}} in each room, usually controlled by a single switch mounted near a door. At most, one outlet was installed per room, since plug-connected appliances were expensive and uncommon. Wiring was performed using type NM (nonmetallic <b>sheathed</b> <b>cable),</b> insulated with asbestos-reinforced rubber covered with jute and tar.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} three wires in the basic <b>sheathed</b> <b>cable,</b> in the United States it is {{referred}} to by its gauge {{and the number of}} the insulated (non-ground wires). Thus, 14-2 ("fourteen two") describes 14 gauge wires (black, white, ground). 12-2 describes thicker wire, 12 gauge. These types of cable are used for most (single pole) switches and receptacles.|$|E
40|$|Simple compact {{models for}} {{combined}} overhead-cable lines supplying a substation {{are presented as}} an extension of a previous paper for grounding system analysis. The overhead line section can be equipped with uniform or combined ground wires, whereas the cable line section can consist of coated metal <b>sheathed</b> <b>cables,</b> with/without intermediate grounding, or uncoated metal <b>sheathed</b> <b>cables</b> in continuous contact with the earth. Besides the calculation of the earth current at the faulted substation, the proposed modeling method allows the evaluation of the leakage current at the transition station, where cables are connected to the overhead line, as well as at critical overhead line towers. In this manner, the effects of the so called “fault application transfer” phenomenon can be conveniently estimated at the design stage in order to assess the most appropriate safety conditions. Some numerical examples are given by applying a computer program based on the proposed methodology...|$|R
50|$|Lead-sheathed cables {{were also}} used for {{telephone}} cables, as the lead outer sheath lasted well buried in wet ground. Jointing such cables could also require wiped lead joints. A typical such joint would involve a joint or tee junction between cables, with the copper pairs inside joined by fine soldering and insulating, then the overall joint wrapped in lead sheet and soldered. Such jointing continued until the 1960s {{and the availability of}} polyethylene <b>sheathed</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cables are copper conductor, {{cross linked}} {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) insulated, metal <b>sheathed</b> <b>cables</b> with {{high density polyethylene}} over-sheaths. They are about 160 mm in diameter and weigh about 40 kg a metre. Each section of the route is a single circuit, with three separate cables - one for each phase. In the trenched sections of the route, the cables are typically installed in ducts in trefoil configuration. The ratings of the four cable sections vary slightly, {{as shown in the}} following table.|$|R

This wire is required when multiway switches will be used such as two 3 way switches used to control one or more lights from 2 separate locations. Depending on the configuration, typically black represents hot/feed from the service panel and the other black to the load (light), with the white and red serving as the travelers. In some variations, the white wire recoded (retaped) black will be required as a traveler. There are many 3 way switch configurations such as powering the circuit through {{one or the other}} switch or the light fixture.|$|E
5000|$|Corvair Powerglide is a fully {{automatic}}, two-speed, rwd aluminum-cased {{automatic transmission}} mounted {{directly to the}} forward face of the cast iron differential housing. It uses a three-element, welded assembly 10 in diameter torque converter mounted remotely on the rear face of the differential, (that also incorporates the starter ring gear, and a centrifugal fan baffle for cooling, via slots in the engine bellhousing) and is driven directly from the engine crankshaft by a flexplate inside the engine bellhousing.

5000|$|Most {{circuits}} in {{the modern}} North American home and light commercial construction are wired with non-metallic sheathed (NM) cable designated type. [...] This type of cable is the least expensive for a given size and is appropriate for dry indoor applications. The designation NM XX-Y indicates, respectively, the type of sheathing (in this case, non-metallic), {{the size of the}} main conductors, and the total number of circuit conductors (exclusive of the grounding conductor). For example, NM 14-2 cable contains three conductors (two plus one ground) at 14 gauge, a size typically used for circuits protected at 15 amperes. Circuits with larger currents (such as for electric furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, or sub-mains to additional circuit panels) will have larger conductors. Not all US jurisdictions permit use of non-metallic <b>sheathed</b> <b>cable.</b> The NEC does not permit use of NM cable in large, fire-resistant, or high-rise structures.|$|E
5000|$|In the Republic of Ireland the {{situation}} is different. IS 201-4:2001 ( [...] I.S. 201 part 4: PVC and Low Smoke Halogen Free <b>Sheathed</b> <b>cables</b> for fixed wiring) permitted both the UK style of twin and earth, and also a version with a CPC with a cross-section {{equal to that of}} the main conductors and insulated in green and yellow inside the full length of the cable. However, from 2013, the option for the uninsulated and reduced CPC has been removed from the new standard IS 201-4:2013, and as such is no longer permitted in new Southern Irish installations after a short transitional period.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general methodology {{based on the}} matrix pencil method (MPM) for the fitting of frequency-domain responses {{in order to be}} properly represented in time-domain analysis. By virtue of the proposed method, a rational fitting of the frequency-domain responses can be inferred, which, in turn, helps with their inclusion into time-domain calculations. The proposed technique is well suited for the estimation of any type of function including the case of those with superimposed noise. The main feature of the method is its direct solution, hence avoiding any iteration in the estimation process. Moreover, the method does not require starting poles as opposed to the vector-fitting (VF) method. This paper presents the validation of the proposed approach by fitting the frequency responses of general a priori known functions, artificially created noisy functions and those of power components, namely: the elements of a power transformer admittance matrix and the characteristic admittance and propagation functions of a single-core <b>sheathed</b> <b>cable.</b> Finally, a time-domain analysis referring to lightning transients on a transmission line is presented...|$|E
40|$|Underground {{cable is}} {{commonly}} used in situation where power need to be transmitted across river or sea or through heavily populated areas. Even though underground cables are not directly exposed to hazard, lightning can induce a potential on the insulation of the underground cable. About 80 % of the lightning strikes in Malaysia produce voltage in excess of 20 kV. This study was done to determine the possibility of having insulation breakdown of the underground cable either by direct stroke or by induction. The simulation was performed using Alternative Transient Program version of the Electromagnetic Transients Program (ATP-EMTP) software {{to determine whether the}} induced voltage due to lightning can cause any insulation breakdown.

40|$|Leaky feeders have {{applications}} in restricted areas where wireless communications are difficult such as mines and tunnels or when only localized broadcast is desired. Methods of {{analysis of the}} electromagnetic modes for typical problems usually involve approximation techniques. The cable is replaced by simple parameters derived from solution of the cable in an infinite medium. ^ In this work modes of a leaky feeder cable in tunnels and buried in earth are investigated by modeling one type of cable as a sheath helix with a perfectly conducting core. The sheath helix model is a good representation for a helical shield when the helical period and radius is {{much less than the}} modal period. This model allows the rigorous formulation of the eigenmode problem of the cable centered in a tunnel or buried in earth. Numerical techniques are used to find the modes and disperson curves are plotted. ^ Results agree with those of previous studies involving the sheath helix and also with Hill and Wait 2 ̆ 7 s results using the wire helix model. Properties of modes found for the cable in infinite free space, buried in an infinite lossy medium, and centered in a tunnel are consistent with those found by investigators for other types of cables. ^ An interesting property of the sheath helix is the variation of its surface transfer impedance with helix angle. Most of the results are for a fixed helix angle. From the interpretation of the numerical results however it is suggested that study of this model is useful beyond its direct application to modeling of the helical <b>sheathed</b> <b>cable.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this work, we are {{developing}} an anthropomorphic robot hand and wrist to be teleoperated by a human using a glove input device. The present {{model of the}} hand is intended for use in grasping operations, and consists of a palm, two fingers, an opposed thumb, and two wrist joints that provide pitch and roll movements. Each of the three digits of the robot hand has two pitch joints to enable flexion and extension, and incorporates a new passive switching mechanism that allows a single actuator to drive the two joints successively. The hand/wrist system has {{a total of five}} independent degrees-of-freedom. It is driven by five remotely located DC motors through servo control, and the drive from the motors is transmitted to the hand and wrist joints through flexible <b>sheathed</b> <b>cables</b> acting as tendons.

30|$|The {{propagation}} of intracellular calcium {{is vital to}} signal transduction, synaptic transmission, and the dynamics of action potentials [21]. Calcium-induced calcium release brought about via ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) promotes such calcium propagation [22]. Breit and Queisser (2018) specifically study how dendritic geometry and the ER interact to influence calcium wave dynamics [7], modeling the ER within the dendrite as a <b>cable</b> <b>sheathed</b> by another <b>cable</b> layer. Interestingly, they find that a minimal RyR density, which scales inversely with ER surface area, is needed to ensure conditions for traveling wave propagation. Along these lines, as the RyR density increases, so does the speed of calcium waves. In future studies, the authors plan to explore systems with heterogeneous RyR distributions and propose that wave propagation failure could be analyzed using averaging and homogenization [23]. Alternatively, the authors propose to study the asymptotic limit of thin dendrites, so the model could be treated as one-dimensional.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years natural rubber has been {{completely}} replaced by synthetic rubbers and plastics as cable insulation. The physical properties required for wire and cable insulation depend {{on the type of}} application. It should have good elongation and tensile strength and toughness, so that it will withstand handling during installation and service. It should also have low dielectric constant and power factor but high dielectric strength and insulation resistance. Also, during operation, because of overloading, the insulation may be exposed to high temperatures for long periods. This necessitates the insulation to have excellent resistance to ageing at high temperatures [1]. The main types of insulation used in the cable industries are paper, rubber, plastics and compressed gas. Paper insulated lead <b>sheathed</b> <b>cables</b> are still used because of their reliability, high dielectric strength, low dielectric loss, and long life [2]. The most commonly used insulating materials for low and medium voltage (up to 3. 3 kV) cables are polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC is not suitable for high voltage applications because of its high dielectric constant and high loss. The polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has {{played an important role in}} electrical insulation in electrical components and equipment. Sometimes, in the manufacture of PVC cables jacketing, the additives for the formation and their compatibility may affect on the electrical properties of the cable. Therefore, the response of dielectric properties of PVC to imposed alternating electric field (AC) of various strengths and frequencies become point of interest [3]. The additives used in PVC formulations are mainly plasticizers, stabilizers, lubricants and fillers. Fillers have important roles in modifying the properties of various polymers and lowering the cost of their composites. The effect of fillers on properties of composites depends on their level of loading, shape and particle size, aggregate size, surface characteristics and degree of dispersion [4]. UEKI showed that the filler dispersion is one of the factors that have an influence in the electrical strength on composite [5]. Low electrical strength could lead to failure of cable due to overvoltage...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cone {{calorimeter}} {{tests were}} conducted on eight different elec-tric cable samples at four different external heat flux levels between 20 and 50 kW/m 2. Four of the <b>cable</b> samples were <b>sheathed</b> with PVC-based materi-als and four with polyolefin-based materials. Some of the cone calorimeter test results were {{compared with those of}} the horizontally ventilated laboratory-scale gallery fire test and the oxygen index test which had been previously conducted on these samples. From the ignitability data in the cone calorimeter test, these cable samples were considered to be thermally thick materials. The ignition times of the <b>cables</b> <b>sheathed</b> with a PVC-based mate-rial were shorter than those of the <b>cables</b> <b>sheathed</b> with a halogen-free poly-olefin. In addition, the heat and smoke release properties of the cable samples also depended mostly on the type of the main base polymer of the sheath ma-terial. The correlations between the flame propagation property in the duct fire test and the peak heat release rate in the cone calorimeter test were un-clear. On the other hand, there appeared to be relatively good correlations be-tween the minimum O 2 and maximum CO 2 concentrations in the exhaust gas in the duct fire test and the peak heat release rate in the cone calorimeter test.
