Particularly, the EU is engaged in the delicate regulation of passenger name records (PNR) transfers.

Though the purpose of partitioning is to shorten the execution time of an algorithm, each data reference can become a complex expression based upon the data partitions. As an attempt to minimize the computation needed for array references, loop <b>splitting</b> can further <b>divide</b> a partitioned loop into segments that allow the code hoisting and strength reduction optimizations. This thesis introduces two methods of loop splitting, rational and interval. While rational <b>splitting</b> <b>divides</b> the loop into equal-length GCD segments, interval splitting specifies segments as an explicit list of intervals. These two methods have been implemented and studied. Under our execution model, the loop in the algorithms analyzed executes an average of 2 to 3 times faster after loop splitting. ...|$|R

50|$|When a {{passenger}} books an itinerary, the travel agent or travel website user {{will create a}} PNR in the CRS, which may be an airline's database or typically one of the global distribution systems (GDSs), such as Amadeus, Sabre, or Travelport (Apollo, Galileo, and Worldspan). If a booking is made directly with of the airline's CRS, the PNR is called the Master PNR for the passenger and the associated itinerary. The PNR is identified in the CRS by a record locator. If portions of the travel itinerary {{are not to be}} provided by the holder of the Master PNR, then copies of the <b>PNR</b> <b>information</b> are sent to the CRSs of the airlines that will be providing transportation. These CRSs will open copies of the Master PNR in their own database to manage the portion of the itinerary for which they are responsible. Many airlines have their CRS hosted by one of the GDSs, which allows sharing of the PNR. The record locators of the copied PNRs are communicated back to the CRS that holds the Master PNR, so all records remain tied together. This enables exchanging updates of the PNR when the status of the trip changes in any of the CRSs.|$|R

A radical faction headed by Iléo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members.

40|$|In Fall 2011, U.

These two events thus provide a timely basis and background against which to review the ten year history of the cooperation between the U. S. and the EU in <b>PNR</b> <b>information</b> management. This article maps the evolution of collaboration between the U. S. and the EU with respect to the PNR program by presenting the major dimensions involved.

It furthermore sketches major legal and political developments that have most likely {{had a significant impact on}} the negotiations and are, as a consequence, reflected in the concrete design of the new PNR Agreement. All this leads the author to the conclusion that—as thoroughly as it may have been designed and as complete as it may seem—the new PNR Agreement will not be the end of the transatlantic PNR saga, but rather the beginning of another intriguing chapter...|$|R
