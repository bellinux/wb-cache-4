50|$|Lifelike {{mechanical}} arms, {{along with}} ordinary human arms, are so similar {{that it may}} be hard to distinguish between the two. The reason for this is because a spray, that places a coat on the prosthetic arm, makes the arm look real. This futuristic fantasy is beginning to become more of a reality.

This will allow people with prosthetics to not feel self-conscious of their robotic arm.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{positioning}} and <b>sleeve</b> <b>type</b> bracing on passive position sense of shoulder joints of healthy untrained subjects. Method: A cross over study was carried out on 26 subjects (13 male, 13 female) with a proprioception measurement device. The selected method of testing was passive reproduction of a target angle. Both shoulder joints of all the subjects were evaluated with and without a compressive neoprene <b>sleeve</b> <b>type</b> of brace at two different start positions (45 ˚ internal rotation, 75 ˚external rotation) with an angular rotational movement at a constant speed of 0. 5 /̊s. The angular displacements from the target angles {{at the end of the}} reproduction tests were recorded as position sense deficit scores. Results: The overall mean (SD) deficit score (0. 99 (0. 06)) was significantly (p, 0. 001) lower with the brace than without, and the overall mean deficit score was significantly (p, 0. 001) higher at the 45 ˚ internal rotation start position than at the 75 ˚ external rotation start position. However, there was no significant (p. 0. 05) interaction between brace application and start position. Conclusion: Terminal limits of range of motion facilitate the position sense of shoulder joints. Compressive brace application improves the passive positioning sense possibly by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} this study show that during growth of the {{immunogenic}} Meth A fibrosarcoma, two different <b>types</b> of <b>suppressor</b> T lymphocytes are generated in sequence. One type is generated during early tumor growth, reaches peak number around day 6, and is progressively lost thereafter. It is defined by its ability, upon passive transfer, to suppress the expression of a DTH reaction to tumor antigens in tumor- immunized recipients. It bears the Ly 1 -, 2 + membrane phenotype and is sensitive to relatively low doses of cyclophosphamide. In contrast, the second <b>type</b> of <b>suppressor</b> cell is not detected until after day 9 of tumor growth, and is defined by its ability to inhibit, upon passive transfer, the expression of adoptive immunity against an established tumor in T cell-deficient recipients. According to previous studies it bears the Ly 1 +, 2 -, L 3 T 4 a+ membrane phenotype and is less sensitive to cyclophosphamide than the T cell suppressor of DTH. It is argued that this second <b>type</b> of <b>suppressor</b> T cell seems likely to be responsible for the escape of immunogenic tumors from antitumor immunity, because it can suppress the expression of a powerful mechanism of antitumor immunity in recipient mice, and is generated progressively as the tumor- bearing host loses concomitant immunity. In contrast, although the Ly- 1 -, 2 + T cell suppressors of DTH can efficiently suppress a DTH reaction to an implant of living tumor cells, they fail to suppress the expression of immunity to the same implant...|$|R

When C 57 BL/ 6 mice were injected with strain Mino, very weak or almost no delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) {{to the specific}} antigen, M. intracellulare purified protein derivative, was observed. The DTH response was enhanced by cyclophosphamide pretreatment, indicating that some suppression mechanism(s) might be involved in DTH. In cell transfer experiments it was shown that two <b>types</b> of <b>suppressor</b> T cells, afferent type (TS-Aff) and efferent type (TS-Eff), are induced in the spleens of Mino-infected mice. TS-Aff were detected from the early stage to the late stage of infection. TS-Eff were detected only in the late stage of infection. These two <b>types</b> of <b>suppressor</b> T cells were both Thy- 1 positive and Lyt- 2 positive; however, TS-Aff seemed to be I-J positive, and TS-Eff seemed to be I-J negative.

50|$|The first {{successful}} sleeve valve was patented by Charles Yale Knight, and used twin alternating sliding sleeves. It {{was used in}} some luxury automobiles, notably Willys, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Minerva, Panhard, Peugeot and Avions Voisin. Mors adopted double sleeve-valve engines made by Minerva.The higher oil consumption was heavily outweighed by the quietness of running and the very high mileages without servicing. Early poppet-valve systems required decarbonization at very low mileages. The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve was named for the two inventors that applied for similar patents {{within a few weeks}} of each other. The Burt system was an open <b>sleeve</b> <b>type,</b> driven from the crankshaft side, while the McCollum design had a sleeve in the head and upper part of the cylinder, and a more complex port arrangement (Source: 'Torque Meter' Magazine, AEHS). The design that entered production was more 'Burt' than 'McCollum.' It was used by the Scottish company Argyll for its cars, and was later adopted by Bristol for its radial aircraft engines. It used a single sleeve which rotated around a timing axle set at 90 degrees to the cylinder axis. Mechanically simpler and more rugged, the Burt-McCollum valve had the additional advantage of reducing oil consumption (compared to other sleeve valve designs), while retaining the combustion chambers and big, uncluttered, porting area possible in the Knight system.|$|R

500|$|Lee {{writes that}} the {{silencer}} evidence became confused {{because of the way}} the exhibit was named. It was first called SBJ/1, because it was handed over by DS Stan Jones (SBJ). When it was learned that David Boutflour had found it and Jones had merely handed it over, the silencer was renamed exhibit DB/1. But because there was a DC David Bird, it was renamed again to DRB/1. The name changes led to confusion in later documents, giving the impression that more than one silencer had been found. In 2011, Lee writes, Bamber's blog announced: [...] "We can now prove 100% that there were two sound moderators obtained by police at different times". The CCRC responded that year that the claims were [...] "not supported by the material that exists...". Again in 2013 Bamber's blog said: [...] "I can now prove with 100% certainty that Essex police seized on Parker Hale (MM1 <b>type)</b> <b>suppressor</b> from the house on 7 August 1985" [...] (the day of the murder, rather than the day the cousin found it). According to The Times in 2013, Bamber said he intended to show the police took four silencers from his family members, including the one in the gun cupboard, and that evidence and paperwork from them—and from an additional laboratory silencer—was mixed up.|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} and subcellular localization of neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> 1 tumor <b>suppressor</b> was studied in keratinocytes induced to differentiate by increased Ca 2 + {{concentration of the}} culture medium. Differentiating keratinocytes became intensely immunoreactive for neurofibromatosis type 1 protein, which was apparently associated with cellular fibrils. Double immunolabeling with antibodies to cytokeratin 14 and neurofibromatosis type 1 protein suggested an association of intermediate type cytoskeleton and neurofibromatosis type 1 protein. The presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 protein in cell preparations treated with cytoskeletal buffer indicated a high affinity interaction between intermediate filaments and neurofibromatosis type 1 protein. Further studies utilizing double immunolabelings revealed that the intense neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> 1 tumor <b>suppressor</b> signal on intermediate filaments was temporally limited to the period in keratinocyte differentiation in which the formation of desmosomes takes place. Keratinocytes were also cultured from nine patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis and were studied with respect to cell morphology, and association of neurofibromatosis type 1 protein with intermediate cytoskeleton. The results showed that keratinocytes cultured from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 displayed a highly variable cell size and morphology compared to controls. The latter findings represent predicted alterations {{in a situation where}} cytoskeletal organization is disturbed. Furthermore, differentiating neurofibromatosis type 1 keratinocytes were characterized by a reduced number of cytokeratin bundles that were decorated neurofibromatosis type 1 protein. The {{results of this study suggest}} that neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> 1 tumor <b>suppressor</b> exerts its effects in part by controlling organization of cytoskeleton during the formation of cellular contacts...|$|R
