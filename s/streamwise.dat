5000|$|... i) Lifting line {{theory for}} wings, wing tip {{vortices}} and induced drag. A wing has a finite span, and the circulation at any {{section of the}} wing varies with the spanwise direction. This variation is compensated by the release of <b>streamwise</b> vortices (called trailing vortices), due to conservation of vorticity or Kelvin Theorem of Circulation Conservation. These <b>streamwise</b> vortices merge to two counter-rotating strong spirals, called wing tip vortices, separated by distance close to the wing span and may be visible if the sky is cloudy. Treating the trailing vortices {{as a series of}} semi-infinite straight line vortices leads to the well-known lifting line theory. By this theory, the wing has a lift force smaller than that predicted by a purely two-dimensional theory using the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. Most importantly, there is an induced drag. This induced drag is a pressure drag which {{has nothing to do with}} frictional drag.|$|E

50|$|Hodographs shapes {{are rarely}} a {{straight}} line, however some are {{close enough to}} the idealized example that mirror image splits will appear in radar imagery. In most cases however, there is usually a slight curvature in the hodograph, which tends to favor one split over the other. Take for example a hodograph that carves out a shallow right curve. Both crosswise and <b>streamwise</b> vorticity are present in this environment. As with the idealized environment crosswise vorticity lines are tilted into the vertical on the flanks of this updraft. Once the pressure perturbations initiate new updrafts on the flanks and they begin to rotate as a result of stretching and ingestion of newly experienced <b>streamwise</b> vorticity. The right split, having propagated even farther right to the hodograph, has increased the magnitude of positive SRH ingestion. This will serve to increase the rotation in the updraft, intensifying the pressure perturbation, strengthening the storm. On the other hand, the left mover, rotating anticyclonically, is struggling to maintain its updraft since it is ingesting positive environmental SRH. In this case, the left split will tend to weaken, as the right split becomes dominant.|$|E
50|$|The above lift {{equation}} neglects {{the skin}} friction forces, which typically have a negligible {{contribution to the}} lift compared to the pressure forces. By using the <b>streamwise</b> vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral, we obtain an expression for the pressure drag Dp (which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and, if the wing is three-dimensional, the induced drag). If we use the spanwise vector j, we obtain the side force Y.|$|E

50|$|In fluid dynamics, a Tollmien-Schlichting wave (often {{abbreviated}} T-S wave) is a <b>streamwise</b> unstable wave which {{arises in}} a bounded shear flow (such as boundary layer and channel flow). It {{is one of}} the more common methods by which a laminar bounded shear flow transitions to turbulence. The waves are initiated when some disturbance (sound, for example) interacts with leading edge roughness in a process known as receptivity. These waves are slowly amplified as they move downstream until they may eventually grow large enough that nonlinearities take over and the flow transitions to turbulence.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{has shown}} that a strong [...] "notch" [...] vortex is also formed, which is trailed <b>streamwise</b> across the blade. This vortex acts like an {{aerodynamic}} fence and retards the flow separation region from encroaching into the tip region. Further increases in angle of attack make little change to the flow structure until a very high angle of attack is reached (in the vicinity of 22 degrees!) when the flow will grossly separate. For a conventional tip planform, a similar gross flow breakdown {{would be expected to}} occur at about 12 degrees local angle of attack.|$|E

Let the velocity be [...] in Cartesian coordinate and the axis of the jet be [...] axis with origin at the orifice. The flow is self-similar for large Reynolds number (the jet is so thin that [...] varies much more rapidly in the transverse [...] direction than the <b>streamwise</b> [...] direction) and can be approximated with boundary layer equations.|$|E
5000|$|A {{splitting}} storm, {{commonly referred}} to as a [...] "Splitting Supercell", is a phenomenon when a convective thunderstorm will appear to break in two, with one side propagating to the left (left mover) and the other to the right (right mover) of the hodograph. Mirror image storm splits are found in environments where there are large amounts of crosswise vorticity (i.e. the hodograph is straight, rather than curved) are present. Storm splits also occur in environments where <b>streamwise</b> vorticity is immediately present to an updraft (i.e. right or left curve to the hodograph), however in this situation one split is highly favored over the other, with the weaker split quickly dying; in this case, the lesser favored split may be so weak that the process is not noticeable on radar imagery [...]|$|E
5000|$|As an updraft {{begins to}} form, it {{will tend to}} tilt the {{crosswise}} vorticity lines into the vertical, resulting in an anticyclonic vorticity axis on the northern fringe and a cyclonic vorticity axis on the southern fringe of the updraft. At this point, despite vorticity lines being oriented in the vertical, the storm {{can not be considered}} a supercell, as the areas of rotation are outside of the main updraft. Due to the short time scale (scale analysis reveals the Coriolis acceleration in the vorticity equation is negligible on short time scales [...] ), the areas of vorticity result in low pressure (perturbations) on the flanks of the convective updraft. Given favorable environmental thermodynamics (sufficient buoyancy and negligible convective inhibition {CIN}) these pressure perturbations will induce mass flux from below, initiating new convective updrafts. These new updrafts are now located [...] "off" [...] the hodograph, with one to the left and one to the right, both co-located with the previously mentioned pressure perturbations. The updraft can now enhance the vorticity (by as much a several orders of magnitude) through stretching. Additionally, since both new updrafts are now located off the hodograph, a <b>streamwise</b> vorticity component (quantifiable as Storm Relative Helicity...SRH) is able to be ingested into the storm (with the anticylonic split ingesting negative SRH and the right split ingesting positive SRH). Each split now contains a rotating updraft and can be considered a supercell.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current project was to experimentally investigate the structure and dynamics of the <b>streamwise</b> vorticity in a plane mixing layer. The {{first part of this}} research program was intended to clarify whether the observed decrease in mean <b>streamwise</b> vorticity in the far-field of mixing layers is due primarily to the 'smearing' caused by vortex meander or to diffusion. Two-point velocity correlation measurements have been used to show that there is little spanwise meander of the large-scale <b>streamwise</b> vortical structure. The correlation measurements also indicate a large degree of transverse meander of the <b>streamwise</b> vorticity which is not surprising since the <b>streamwise</b> vorticity exists in the inclined braid region between the spanwise vortex core regions. The <b>streamwise</b> convection of the braid region thereby introduces an apparent transverse meander into measurements using stationary probes.

The evolutions of the two types of deterministic structures, the spanwise and <b>streamwise</b> vortices, were first clarified in order to determine their roles in the transition process. A scaling rule for the <b>streamwise</b> distance from the trailing edge of the splitter plate to the vortex merging position was found for various velocity ratios. After this stremwise lengthscale was determined, {{it became clear that the}} spanwise wavelength of the <b>streamwise</b> vortices doubled after the merging of the spanwise structures which nominally doubled <b>streamwise</b> wavelengths.

40|$|Tracer pebbles {{are often}} used to study bed load {{transport}} processes in gravel bed rivers.

Here we use the Exner-Based Master Equation to characterize the transient coevolution of <b>streamwise</b> and vertical advection-diffusion of tracer pebbles under equilibrium transport conditions (no net aggradation or degradation). The coevolution of <b>streamwise</b> and vertical dispersion gives rise to behavior that can differ markedly from that associated with purely <b>streamwise</b> processes with no vertical exchange. One example is <b>streamwise</b> advective slowdown. Particles that are advected downward into zones where the probability of reentrainment becomes asymptotically small are essentially trapped and can no longer participate in <b>streamwise</b> advection.

40|$|The present {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} {{in order to determine the}} existence of <b>streamwise</b> vortex meander in a mixing layer, and if present, its significance on the measured properties. The dependence of the velocity cross-correlation on the fixed probe location was shown to be a good indicator of the stationarity of the <b>streamwise</b> vortex location. The cross-correlation measurements obtained here indicate that spanwise meander is negligible, although transverse apparent meander (normal to the plane of the mixing layer) was indicated. The transverse meander, exemplified by the elliptical shape of the mean <b>streamwise</b> vorticity contours, was expected, since the <b>streamwise</b> vorticity in the braid region is essentially inclined, with respect to the <b>streamwise</b> direction. These conclusions were supported by results of estimated spanwise profiles of the transverse velocity component. The balance of evidence suggests that the measured mean <b>streamwise</b> vorticity decay is representative of the decay of the vorticity rather than an artifact of meander...|$|E
