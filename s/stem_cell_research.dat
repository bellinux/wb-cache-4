30|$|Nanotechnology brings new {{chance to}} <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>research</b> and development. Nanotechnology {{is the term}} used to cover the design, construction, and {{utilization}} of functional structures {{with at least one}} characteristic dimension measured in nanometers [19, 20]. Such materials and systems can be designed to exhibit novel and significantly improved physical, chemical, and biological properties, phenomena and processes {{as a result of the}} limited size of their constituent particles or molecules. The reason for such interesting and very useful behavior is that when characteristic structural features are intermediate in extent between isolated atoms and bulk macroscopic materials, i.e., in the range of about 0.1 – 100 nm, the objects may display physical attributes substantially different from those displayed by either atoms or bulk materials. It is well-known that the nanomaterials own four basic unique effects such as small size effects, surface effects, quantum size effects, and tunnel effects, and ultimately these effects can lead to new technological opportunities as well as new challenges [21 – 23]. The application of nanomaterials and nanotechnology in <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>research</b> and development exhibits attracting technological prospects, which provide a new chance to solve current problems that <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> <b>research</b> and development meet.|$|R

His tenure was marked by controversy regarding his defense of the administration against allegations from over two dozen Nobel Laureates, amongst others, that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, including those relating to <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>research</b> and global warming. However, he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government. He also served as the President of Stony Brook University from 1980 until 1994, and director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1998 until 2001.|$|E
