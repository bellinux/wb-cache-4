25|$|Nothing in the {{principle}} {{of any of the}} motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made {{in the form of a}} cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a <b>self-supporting</b> <b>structure</b> comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.|$|E
25|$|When the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople, {{they found}} a variety of Byzantine Christian churches, {{the largest and most}} {{prominent}} amongst them was the Hagia Sophia. The brickwork-and-mortar ribs and the spherical shell of the central dome of the Hagia Sophia were built simultaneously, as a <b>self-supporting</b> <b>structure</b> without any wooden centring. In the early Byzantine church of Hagia Irene, the ribs of the dome vault are fully integrated into the shell, similar to Western Roman domes, and thus are not visible from within the building. In the dome of the Hagia Sophia, the ribs and shell of the dome unite in a central medallion at the apex of the dome, the upper ends of the ribs being integrated into the shell: Shell and ribs form one single structural entity. In later Byzantine buildings, like the Kalenderhane Mosque, the Eski Imaret Mosque (formerly the Monastery of Christ Pantepoptes) or the Pantokrator Monastery (today: Zeyrek Mosque), the central medallion of the apex and the ribs of the dome became separate structural elements: The ribs are more pronounced and connect to the central medallion, which also stands out more pronouncedly, so that the entire construction gives the impression as if ribs and medallion are separate from, and underpin, the proper shell of the dome.|$|E
2500|$|Brunel {{recognised}} that {{a circular}} cross-section tubular girder – a shallow [...] "bow", excellent in compression and tension – could be strung by suspension chains {{to form a}} stiff, <b>self-supporting</b> <b>structure</b> very much lighter (thus less expensive) than a Stephenson-type box girder. Instead of hanging the chains from towers and suspending the bridge deck from them, Brunel used the chains to stress and slightly bow the tubes, which were braced against the chains using struts. The bridge deck was rigid, because it was effectively clamped against the tubes by the chains. Brunel solved the problem in his own way, and for more than 100 years, the Chepstow and subsequently the Royal Albert Bridge were the only suspension bridges on the British railway system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{problems related}} to the numerical modeling of profiled steel sheets used as <b>self-supporting</b> arch <b>structures</b> for roof covering. The rules of preparing and full analysis {{of a set of}} numerical models of these elements with a different level of complexity are given. The models are evaluated by comparing numerical results with the results of extended experimental tests performed by 3 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method. For each model the comparison of numerical and experimental results has been made for samples of a single-wave trapezoidal profile with corrugated web and lower flanges subjected to compression and bending. The full-field analysis allows to determine the allowed simplification of numerical models which do not affect in significant way the reliability of the results. The proposed methodology {{is the first step in}} the development of full assessment methodology for different types of <b>self-supporting</b> arch <b>structures</b> produced by ABM technology. Key words: ABM technology, arch-shaped corrugated steel structure, FEM model, digital image correlation, data processing. 1...|$|R
5000|$|A corbel arch is {{constructed}} by offsetting successive courses of stone (or brick) at the springline {{of the walls}} so that they project towards the archway's center from each supporting side, until the courses meet {{at the apex of}} the archway (often, the last gap is bridged with a flat stone). For a corbeled vault covering the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two opposing walls.Although an improvement in load-bearing efficiency over the post and lintel design, corbeled arches are not entirely <b>self-supporting</b> <b>structures,</b> and the corbeled arch is sometimes termed a [...] "false arch" [...] for this reason. Unlike [...] "true" [...] arches, not all of the structure's tensile stresses caused by the weight of the superstructure are transformed into compressive stresses. Corbel arches and vaults require significantly thickened walls and an abutment of other stone or fill to counteract the effects of gravity, which otherwise would tend to collapse each side of the archway inwards.|$|R

The lower layer improved on Roman practice {{in that it was}} based on the understanding that the purpose of this layer (the sub-base or base course) is to transfer the weight of the road and its traffic to the ground, while protecting the ground from deformation by spreading the weight evenly.

A new injectable hydrogel material, developed from recombinant telechelic proteins expressed in E. coli, demonstrates shear thinning by 3 orders of magnitude at large strains. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear illustrates that shear thinning is due to yielding within {{the bulk of the}} gel, and the rheological response and flow profiles are consistent with a shear-banding mechanism for yielding. The sharp yielding transition and large magnitude of the apparent shear thinning allow gels to be injected through narrow gauge needles with only gentle hand pressure. After injection the gels reset to full elastic strength in seconds due to rapid re-formation of the physical network junctions, allowing <b>self-supporting</b> <b>structures</b> to be formed. The shear thinning and recovery behavior is largely independent of the midblock length, enabling genetic engineering to be used to control the equilibrium modulus of the gel without loss of the characteristic yielding behavior. The shear-banding mechanism localizes deformation during flow into narrow regions of the gels, allowing more than 95...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of {{reciprocal}} frames in temporary gridshell structures, such as architectural pavilions in expositions and installations. These architectural examples can benefit from the use of short, easy to handle, generally joint-free, and repeatable â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cmodulesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d in order to create particular <b>self-supporting</b> <b>structures.</b> The lightweight and interwoven grid obtained by connecting short elements according to the reciprocity principle is structurally efficient and, at the same time, aesthetically pleasing, mainly due to the resulting tessellation. The paper firstly investigates the connection between efficiency and aesthetics. The last part of the paper investigates some temporary architectural pavilions from both an aesthetical and parametric point of view. In order to deepen our understanding of these structures, they are re-modelled according to a bottom-up approach by means of a constraint-based parametric CAD modeller. In this way, a reciprocal frame can be explored and modified by the parametric arrangement of its generative elements, which, like a natural organism, grows in self-generating forms...|$|R
