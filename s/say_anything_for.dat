500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>for</b> I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1679, he {{was charged}} with seditious utterances and a warrant was issued for his arrest, but he was not found. [...] According to William Boyden, Josias was heard saying that, Lord Baltimore was a traitor and he could prove it, that people were fools if they paid taxes. [...] He was also heard saying {{that it was time for}} people to speak their minds and <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> it wasn't treason and he hoped within a few years to have more honor in the country than he ever had prior.|$|E
2500|$|The warlord Dong Zhuo {{ultimately}} led his forces into Luoyang, the imperial capital, and {{took advantage of}} the power vacuum to seize control of the Han central government. In 190, he deposed Emperor Shao (who was demoted to [...] "Prince of Hongnong") and replaced him with Liu Xie (the Prince of Chenliu), who is historically known as Emperor Xian. A tearful Empress Dowager He watched as her son was forcefully pulled away from his throne, while the officials watched and did not dare to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> fear of antagonising Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo subsequently relocated Empress Dowager He to Yong'an Palace (永安宮) and had her poisoned to death there. He also killed the empress dowager's mother, the Lady of Wuyang (舞陽君). Dong Zhuo then forced Emperor Xian to attend the empress dowager's funeral at Fengchang Village (奉常亭), a district of Luoyang. The officials who attended the funeral were dressed in plain colours but not proper mourning attire; the entire ceremony did not befit her status as an empress dowager. She was buried in the Wenzhao Mausoleum (文昭陵) with Emperor Ling, and posthumously honoured as [...] "Empress Lingsi" [...] (靈思皇后).|$|E
