40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{presentation}} concerns to create polymeric nanocomposites using distinctive polymers (amorphous and semicrystalline) and unmodified and organically modified clays, and investigate {{relations between the}} properties and the obtained materials and fillers concentration. As polymer matrices are chosen polypropylene, <b>styrene</b> <b>acrylate</b> <b>copolymer,</b> acrylic-vinylacetate-acrylnitrile copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol. Then as filler are used natural and organically modified monmorillonite nanoclays. Nanocomposites are prepared using solution, emulsion and melt blending techniques that corresponds to initial state of the polymer. Relatively to the preferred dispersion methods, montmorillonite nanoclays are utilized in different condition state – water or solvent dispersions and powders. Nanoclays are modified with different chemical structure organic compounds. Therefore, at all set of 4 polymers and 5 nanoclays are used. Materials with filler concentration from 0 till 15 wt. % (7 vol. %) are prepared {{in the state of}} films and granules. Structure-property-preparation relationships of the nanocomposites are examined considering micro- and nano-structure of the nanocomposites. Mechanical, thermal and permeability properties of the prepared materials are discussed. General conclusions are done about influence of polymer state (glass, rubber) and morphology (amorphous, semicrystalline) on the nanocomposites properties. We can conclude that exist many similarities of property improvements in examined nanocomposites that generally are independent from nanocomposites preparation method. The data of x-ray diffraction analysis indicates the exfoliation of clay platelets in rather low concentration of filler (up to 3 wt. %). Further increasing the filler content, the most part of the clay platelets remain {{in the state of the}} swelled lamina stacks, whose interlaminar galleries distances are equal to the thickness of the penetrated polymer layer. Obtained experimental results showed that nanocomposites are described with considerable increase in elasticity, strength, thermal stability, and also decrease in flammability, permeability. Micromechanical modelling of inherent elasticity constants used to describe nanocomposites structure-property regularities is proposed in [1]. The experimentally obtained barrier properties of the nanocomposites are calculated using analytical model taking into account the shield effect of platelet particles [2]...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the influence of composition drift and copolymer microstructure on the mechanical bulk properties of <b>styrene</b> methyl <b>acrylate</b> <b>copolymers,</b> several copolymers were produced by emulsion copolymerizalion. Three different average compositions were used. By perforrming the copolymerizations under batch and semicontinuous conditions with two different monomor addition strategies (starved conditions and optimal addition) it was possible to control composition drift and to produce copolymers with different microstructures (chemical composition distributions). All these copolymers were processed in a way that ensured that the original particle structure was lost before the polymers were tested. It was found that composition drift had an influence on the mechanical properties (Young's modulus, maximum stress, elongation at break). This influence could be understood very well on the basis of present knowledge about structure-mechanical properties relationships. In the case of homogeneous copolymers maximum stress and elongation at break arc dependent on the molecular weight, and only weakly dependent on the chemical composition, and Young's modulus is independent of chemical composition and molecular weight in the range of compositions investigated, as expected. ln the case of heterogeneous copolymers, the influence of copolymer microstructure on Young's modulus, maximum stress and elongation at break is very large. Depending on the extent of control of composition drift during the polymerizations, phase separation was observed in the processed polymers, and the presence of a rubber phase affected the properties profoundly...|$|R
