Based {{on the characteristics}} of differential <b>geared</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> characteristics of non-fractionated differential <b>geared</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are laid out. Admissible non-fractionated differential <b>geared</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can be identi ed from atlases of geared kinematic chains by checking the redundancy condition in a kinematic equation governing the terminals. The methodology presented here is systematic and ef cient, and can be easily applied to the enumeration of innovative non-fractionated differential <b>geared</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} kinematics, the torque distributions, {{and the power}} losses of epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> based upon the concepts of fundamental geared entities and fundamental circuits. The kinematic characteristics of fundamental geared entity are applied to the overall speed ratio analysis of epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> It is shown that the overall speed ratio of an epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be symbolically {{expressed in terms of}} the speed ratios of its fundamental geared entities by decomposing an epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism</b> into two subsystems and each subsystem into two subsystems until the lowest level subsystem contains only one fundamental geared entity. The results are then used for the estimation and comparison of various speed ratios of an epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which leads {{to the development of a}} methodology for the enumeration of feasible clutching sequences for a given epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Finally, a systematic methodology for the torque and power loss analyses is described and a procedure for selecting a most efficient clutching sequence of an epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism</b> is presented...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} many epicyclic-type {{automatic}} transmissions in production, the related configuration design methods are still tedious and borne to human error. A simple methodology for the systematic design of the Ravigneaux-type epicyclic gear transmissions needs to be developed. First, fundamentals and gear-shifting of four-speed and six-speed epicyclic-type automatic transmissions are illustrated to establish the design requirements. Second, based on the kinematic nomographs of the corresponding basic gear ratios, a simple clutching-sequence method is proposed and illustrated. Next, a planar-graph representation is presented to arrange the desired clutches for each possible clutching sequence into the epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Then, with the above methods, the systematic designs of the epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are given for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodology. The result of this work shows that the seven-, eight-, and nine-link two-DOF Ravigneaux-type epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could reach four-, six-, and eight-forward speeds at most, respectively. New five-, six-, seven-, and eight-velocity automatic transmissions are enumerated from the two-ring eight- and nine-link Ravigneaux <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> It is a major breakthrough to design completely satisfactory eight-speed automatic transmissions from the nine-link Ravigneaux <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} many epicyclic-type {{automatic}} transmissions in production, some of the related configurations are still far from attaining maximum sequential velocity ratios. This work in part will attempt to attain the maximum possible velocity ratios for any given epicyclic gear train. A methodology {{for the design of}} two-ring Ravigneaux-type epicyclic gear transmissions for automobiles is presented. First, based on the kinematic nomographs of the corresponding basic gear ratios, clutching-sequences are enumerated. Second, a planar-graph representation is used to arrange the desired clutches for each possible clutching sequence into the epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Then, with the above methods, the designs of the epicylic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are given for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Next, following the general trend of increased shift stages and a wider range of velocity ratios, new six-, seven- and eight-velocity automatic transmissions are enumerated from the two-ring nine-link Ravigneaux <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The result of this work shows that the nine-link two-DOF Ravigneaux-type epicylic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could reach eight-forward speeds at most. It is a major breakthrough to design eight-speed automatic transmissions from the nine-link Ravigneaux <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism</b> since it has only nine links. This structural design has realized a reduced length automatic transmission, while having minimal number of gears. The methodology can be applied to any transmission mechanism depending on its kinematic and geometric constraints. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Hondamatic, {{like all}} following Honda automatics, featured <b>sliding</b> <b>gears</b> on parallel axes rather than planetary gears {{like most other}} automatic transmissions.

Shifting between 1st and 2nd gears was done by simply <b>sliding</b> the <b>gear</b> selector from 1 to 2. It did not automatically shift, but because of the torque converter, could be driven entirely in 2nd gear. The Honda torque converter had a lockup, leading the company to sell the original Hondamatic (which had just two forward gear ratios) as a three-speed. The true three-speed H3 was launched in 1979.|$|R
