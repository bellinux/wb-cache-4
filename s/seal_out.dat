50|$|In {{soldering}} of metals, flux {{serves a}} threefold purpose: it removes any oxidized metal from the surfaces to be soldered, <b>seals</b> <b>out</b> air thus preventing further oxidation, and by facilitating amalgamation improves wetting {{characteristics of the}} liquid solder. Some fluxes are corrosive, so the parts have to be cleaned with a damp sponge or other absorbent material after soldering to prevent damage. Several types of flux are used in electronics.|$|R

5000|$|Aircraft {{storage and}} the {{cocooning}} {{of some of}} these planes was the last major activity at Pyote Airfield, which was the responsibility of the 2753d Aircraft Storage Squadron. Storage included not only preserving planes for future use but also transferring some of the stored planes to other Air Force units for their use.Corrosion control crews removed, cleaned and treated the turrets in all of the B-29s. The aircraft were [...] "cocooned" [...] to <b>seal</b> <b>out</b> the elements from the interior, and the aircraft were kept in flyable reserve storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{cryogenic}} {{assembly of}} IRAC {{is contained in}} the Multiple Instrument Chamber (MIC), which also houses the other focal plane elements and the pointing calibration reference sensor. The MIC is mounted to the helium chamber inside the cryostat vacuum shell, not only to efficiently keep the instruments cold but to <b>seal</b> <b>out</b> any stray light. Its warm electronics assembly is housed in the spacecraft bus. The IRAC instrument was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and the detectors were built by Raytheon. Its operational and scientific management is handled by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.|$|E
25|$|The {{first modern}} sealing ship was the SS Bear, built in Dundee, Scotland in 1874 as a steamer for sealing.

5000|$|Spark plug wires have {{an outer}} {{insulation}} several times thicker than the conductor, {{made of a}} very flexible and heat-resistant material such as silicone or EPDM rubber. The thick insulation prevents arcing from the cable to an earthed engine component. A rubber [...] "boot" [...] covers each terminal. Dielectric grease {{can be used to}} improve insulation; a small amount can be applied in the inside of the rubber boot at each end of each wire to help <b>seal</b> <b>out</b> moisture. Printing on spark plug wires may include a brand name, insulation thickness (in millimeters), insulation material type, cylinder number, and conductor type (suppressor or solid wire).|$|E
5000|$|In older cars, the {{trunnion}} {{is part of}} the suspension and either allows free movement of the rear wheel hub in relation to the chassis or allows the front wheel hub to rotate with the steering. On many cars (such as those made by the Triumph) {{the trunnion}} is machined from a brass or bronze casting and is prone to failure if not greased properly. American Motors recommended lubrication of its pre-packed front suspension trunnions using a sodium base grease every 32000 mi or three years. It later incorporated molded rubber [...] "Clevebloc" [...] bushings on the upper trunnion to <b>seal</b> <b>out</b> dirt and retain silicone lubricant {{for the life of the}} car.|$|E

Sail had been put on the schooner, as we had a run of seventy-five miles to make to the southward before morning, so as to get {{in the midst of the}} <b>seals,</b> <b>out</b> of which we had strayed during the last two days' hunting.|$|R
50|$|Shellac is a resin {{secreted}} by {{the female}} lac bug, on {{trees in the}} forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured) and dissolved in ethanol to make liquid shellac, which {{is used as a}} brush-on colorant, food glaze and wood finish. Shellac functions as a tough natural primer, sanding sealant, tannin-blocker, odour-blocker, stain, and high-gloss varnish. Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it possesses good insulation qualities and it <b>seals</b> <b>out</b> moisture. Phonograph and 78 rpm gramophone records were made of it until they were replaced by vinyl long-playing records from the 1950s onwards.|$|R

50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Revolutionary War, the inscription on the colonial seal was no longer appropriate. Therefore, in May 1784 the General Assembly directed the Secretary to alter the inscription to read SIGILL. REIP. CONNECTICUTENSIS. However, when {{a new version of the}} seal was prepared, the inscription contained the words spelled out: SIGILLUM REIPUBLICÆ CONNECTICUTENSIS ("Seal of the Republic of Connecticut"). There has been no subsequent alteration to the official state seal. In 1931 the General Assembly required that all representations of the state seal conform to the description in chapter 54 of the Public Acts of that year. This legislation also prohibited reproduction of the seal except by or under the direction of the Secretary of the State. It is the only non-circular state <b>seal</b> <b>out</b> of the fifty states, and is joined only by the Seal of Guam when insular areas are included.|$|E
50|$|Honda {{was born}} in Tenryū, Shizuoka, a small village under Mount Fuji near Hamamatsu on November 17, 1906. He spent his early {{childhood}} helping his father, Gihei, a blacksmith, with his bicycle repair business. At the time his mother, Mika, was a weaver. Honda {{was not interested in}} traditional education. His school handed grade reports to the children, but required that they be returned stamped with the family seal, to make sure that a parent had seen it. Soichiro created a stamp to forge his family <b>seal</b> <b>out</b> of a used rubber bicycle pedal cover. The fraud was soon discovered when Honda started to make forged stamps for other children. Honda was unaware that the stamp was supposed to be mirror-imaged. His family name 本田 was symmetrical when written vertically, so it did not cause a problem, but some of other children's family names were not.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, a Subaru {{dealership}} {{received a}} special order {{request from the}} Tohoku Electric Power Company for Subaru to build an all-weather vehicle with 4WD, as the company was currently using jeeps that were open to the weather. The jeeps could not <b>seal</b> <b>out</b> the cold weather, {{and did not have}} adequate heaters for winter use. The 4WD traction was advantageous in traveling on poor roads, but the jeeps were of a 30-year-old design and something more modern was desired. A car with 4WD would be more comfortable. Tohoku Electric asked that the Subaru 1000 station wagon be converted from front-wheel drive to 4WD. Given the design of the drivetrain being used in Subarus of the time, it was considered relatively easy to simply attach a driveshaft {{to the back of the}} transmission and add a rear differential that powered the rear wheels. A transfer case was also installed so that the 4WD system could be disengaged with an additional gearshift lever installed next to the transmission gearshift.|$|E
