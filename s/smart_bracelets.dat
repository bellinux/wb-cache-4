30|$|With {{increasing}} {{development of}} miniaturized electronic devices, {{the research on}} integrated power supplies become more urgent to meet the demanding applications, including micro-robots, <b>smart</b> <b>bracelets,</b> and strain sensors [1 – 3]. Miniaturized supercapacitors with high-rate performance are a promising candidate for powering these future devices [4, 5]. Moreover, linear supercapacitors have attracted much attention because their flexibility is well suited for wearable electronics [6, 7]. However, these fiber-shaped energy devices have to experience a dramatically stretching process in practical wearable applications. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate their properties when they are dynamically stretched. Carbon nanotubes are the more suitable for the electrode materials of linear supercapacitors [8 – 10]. However, energy density of supercapacitors is not high, which hindered the further development of the linear supercapacitors in the field of wearable devices. In order to improve the energy density of supercapacitors, it is common to use pseudocapacitive material to modify electrodes, such as conductive polymers (e.g., PANI, PPy) or metal oxides (e.g., MnO 2) [9, 11 – 14]. However, linear supercapacitors suffer a severe loss of capacity at high rates due to the trade-off of axial electron transport. Optimizing axial conductivity of electrodes is a key to circumvent this trade-off. Compared with the flexible linear supercapacitors, the stretchable linear supercapacitors have much poorer rate performances and they are usually tested at low scan rates (0.01 – 0.1  V s− 1) [10, 11, 13]. Therefore, it is a key to improve the rate performance of the stretchable supercapacitors.|$|E

This feature is so convenient on one hand but makes us lose control of our privacy on the other hand. With poor privacy protection mechanism embedded in these wearable devices that hackers can easily invade and steal user data. In addition, most smart bracelet companies have not made a clear declaration of which third parties {{are able to get}} users 2 ̆ 019 data, nor how long will the user's physical and health-related information be stored. These companies understand well that large amount of the user's movement and physiological monitoring data are valuable, because each user's information can be a unique sample. As soon as the smart bracelet companies collect extensive and diverse samples, they can figure out a variety of specific and practical applications through excavate data. Therefore, the research questions of this study are 1. how do smart bracelet companies strike a balance between protecting consumer privacy and selling user data to get more business opportunities? 2. In order to achieve this balance, what kind of strategy should smart bracelet companies adopt? This study addresses what measures smart bracelet companies take as well as what attitude they hold through literature review and the comparison of Fitbit, Xiaomi and Garmin's privacy policies. Meanwhile we adopt PEST analysis model and Porter 2 ̆ 019 s diamond model to engage external analysis of three main vendors {{in order to have a}} further understanding of the environment in which the industry is poised. At last, we apply the stakeholder analysis to determine what strategies the companies should take in correspondence after identifying the direct and indirect stakeholders of the smart bracelet companies. This research outcome indicates that beneficial tangible service is the main factor affecting consumers whether to share their data with wearable vendors, but vendors have to be aware of the impacts of privacy issues by selling user data. It is possible that consumers resist buying the wearable products if they find their privacy is disturbed. Furthermore, this study is valuable not only to wearable device vendors to strike balance between privacy and profits but also policy makers to figure out the necessity to get involve in personal data protection over wearable device market...|$|E

40|$|Falls are {{a leading}} cause of injury and {{hospitalization}} among the elderly population. It has been estimated that about 30 % of people aged 65 + are subject to a fall each year. In light of the relevance of these issues in our ageing society, there has been great interest in finding automatic systems to promptly detect falls. Fall detection systems can help reduce adverse health outcomes, including both physical and psychological consequences. Wearable devices embedding an accelerometer have been widely investigated as a means to automatically detect falls. However, usability and low-accuracy issues have hindered the adoption of such systems. In order to foster user-acceptance, the system should be comfortable to wear, unobtrusive and accurate. In this context, wrist-worn devices, such as smartwatch or <b>smart</b> <b>bracelets,</b> represent an attractive solution for a number of reasons. In particular, such devices can be worn during daily routines and provide continuous monitoring of falls. On the other hand, accurate recognition of falls exploiting a wrist-worn device is particularly challenging and has been scarcely investigated in the literature. This work proposes an innovative fall detection method based on a wrist-worn device. For example, the device could be a smartwatch or smart bracelet, embedding accelerometer and barometer sensors. In the proposed method, barometric pressure is combined with acceleration information to achieve high sensitivity (rate of falls correctly detected) and high specificity (rate of potential false alarms that are correctly discarded). More precisely, relevant features are extracted from the barometer and accelerometer signal and then used as inputs to a machine learning classifier. The classifier is responsible for discriminating falls from normal activities. To evaluate the method, we collected data from twelve volunteers. The volunteers executed some falls, and nine of them used the device during unsupervised daily activities. An off-line analysis shows that the proposed method is sound. The technique achieves promising results with a user-independent training approach. This actually means that the machine learning scheme can be trained with other users' data, which is an important factor as target users (older adults) cannot simulate falls to train the system. More precisely, the achieved average sensitivity is 92. 35 % and the average specificity is 99. 4 %. These results suggest that an unobtrusive fall detection system based on a single unit worn at the wrist is feasible. The use of the barometer in addition to the accelerometer has proved to be beneficial in order to achieve high accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Mención Internacional en el título de doctorWearable and implantable {{medical devices}} {{constitute}} an already established industry nowadays. According {{to a recent}} research [113], North America is currently the most important market followed by Europe, Asia-Pacific {{and the rest of}} the world. Additionally, the same document remarks the importance of the Asia-Pacific region due to the rising ageing population and the overpopulation in that area. The most common implantable medical devices include pacemakers, defibrillators, cochlear implants, insulin pumps, and neurostimulators among others. In recent years, the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile “smart” devices with substantial computational and communication capabilities have reshaped the way wireless body area network may be implemented. In their current generation (or in a near future), all of them share a common feature: wireless communication capabilities [127]. Moreover, implantable medical devices have the ability to support and store telemetry data facilitating the remote monitoring of the patient. Medical devices can be part of a wireless body area network, operating both as sensors and as actuators and making decisions in real time. On the other hand, a new kind of devices called wearables such as <b>smart</b> <b>bracelets</b> or smart watches have been equipped with several sensors like Photoplethysmogram (PPG) to record the heart beats, accelerometers to count the steps or Global Positioning System (GPS) to geopositioning users and were originally conceived as cheap solutions to help people to improve their workout. However these devices have demonstrated to be quite useful in many healthcare environments due to a huge variety of different and low-cost medical sensors. Thus, patients can be monitored for long periods of time without interfering in their daily life and taking their vital signs constantly under control. Security and privacy issues have been described as two of the most challenging problems of implantable medical devices and, more generally, wireless body area networks [6, 47, 84, 103]. As an example, it has been demonstrated that somebody equipped with a low cost device can eavesdrop on the data exchanged between a reader and a peacemaker and may even induce a cardiac arrest [71]. Health-related data have been the focus of several attacks almost since the adoption of computers in the healthcare domain. As a recent example, in 2010 personal data from more than 26 million of veterans were stolen from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ database in the US by an employee who had access to the database [104]. The Ponemon Institute pointed out that Germany and the US spent in 2013 more than $ 7. 56 and $ 11 millions, respectively, to protect personal health records from attacks. This PhD dissertation explores the security and privacy of data in healthcare environments where confidential information is measured in real time by some sensors placed in, on, or around the human body. Security and privacy in medical conditions have been widely studied by the research community, nonetheless with the recent boom of wearable devices, new security issues have arisen. The first part of this dissertation is dedicated to the introduction and to expose both the main motivation and objectives of this PhD Thesis. Additionally the contributions and the organization of this document are also presented. In the second part a recent proposal has been analysed from the security and privacy points of view. From this study, vulnerabilities concerning to full disclosure, impersonation, traceability, de-synchronization, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks have been found. These attacks make the protocol infeasible to be introduced with an adequate security and sufficient privacy protection level. Finally, a new protocol named Fingerprint⁺ protocol for Internet of Thing (IoT) is presented, which is based on ISO/IEC 9798 - 2 and ISO/IEC 18000 - 6 C and whose security is formally verified using BAN logic. In the third part of this dissertation, a new system based on International Standard Organization (ISO) standards and security National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommendations have been proposed. First, we present a mutual entity authentication protocol inspired on ISO/IEC 9798 Part 2. This system could be deployed in a hospital where Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology may be used to prune blood-handling errors, i. e., the identities of the patients and blood bags are confirmed (authentication protocol) and after that the matching between both entities is checked (verification step). Second, a secure messaging protocol inspired on ISO/IEC 11770 Part 2 and similar to that used in electronic passports is presented. Nowadays the new generation of medical implants possess wireless connectivity. Imagine a doctor equipped with a reader aims to access the records of vital signals stored on the memory of an implant. In this scenario, the doctor (reader) and the patient (implant) are first mutually authenticated and then a secure exchange of data can be performed. The fourth part of this Thesis provides an architecture based on two cryptographic protocols, the first one is for publishing personal data in a body area network composed of different sensors whereas the second one is designed for sending commands to those sensors by guaranteeing the confidentiality and fine-grained access control to the private data. Both protocols are based on a recently proposed public cryptography paradigm named ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption scheme which is lightweight enough to be embedded into wearable devices and sensors. Contrarily to other proposals made on this field, this architecture allows sensors not only to encrypt data but also to decrypt messages generated by other devices. The fifth part presents a new decentralized attribute based encryption scheme named Decentralized Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Searchable Encryption that incorporates ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with keyword search over encrypted data. This scheme allows users to (a) encrypt their personal data collected by a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) according to a policy of attributes; (b) define a set of keywords to enable other users (e. g., hospital stuff) to perform encrypted search over their personal (encrypted) data; (c) securely store the encrypted data on a semi-honest server and let the semi-honest server run the (encrypted) keyword search. Note that any user can perform a keyword query on the encrypted data, however the decryption of the resulting ciphertexts is possible only for users whose attribute satisfy the policy with which the data had been encrypted. We state and prove the security of our scheme against an honest-but-curious server and a passive adversary. Finally, we implement our system on heterogeneous devices and demonstrate its efficiency and scalability. Finally, this document ends with a conclusions achieved during this PhD and a summary of the main published contributions. Los dispositivos médicos implantables como los marcapasos o las bombas de insulina fueron concebidas originalmente para controlar automáticamente ciertos parámetros biológicos y, llegado el caso, poder actuar ante comportamientos anómalos como ataques cardíacos o episodios de hipoglucemia. Recientemente, han surgido uno dispositivos llamados wearables como las pulseras cuantificadoras, los relojes inteligentes o las bandas pectorales. Estos dispositivos han sido equipados con un número de sensores con capacidad de monitorizar señales vitales como el ritmo cardíaco, los movimientos (acelerómetros) o sistemas de posicionamiento (GPS) entre otros muchas opciones, siendo además una solución asequible y accesible para todo el mundo. A pesar de que el propósito original fue la mejora del rendimiento en actividades deportivas, estos dispositivos han resultado ser de gran utilidad en entornos médicos debido a su amplia variedad de sensores. Esta tecnología puede ayudar al personal médico a realizar seguimientos personalizados, constantes y en tiempo real del comportamiento de los pacientes, sin necesidad de interferir en sus vidas cotidianas. Esta Tesis doctoral está centrada en la seguridad y privacidad en entornos médicos, donde la información es recogida en tiempo real a través de una serie de sensores que pueden estar implantados o equipados en el propio paciente. La seguridad y la privacidad en entornos médicos ha sido el foco de muchos investigadores, no obstante con el reciente auge de los wearables se han generado nuevos retos debido a que son dispositivos con fuertes restricciones de cómputo, de memoria, de tamaño o de autonomía. En la primera parte de este documento, se introduce el problema de la seguridad y la privacidad en el paradigma de Internet de las cosas y haciendo especial hincapié en los entornos médicos. La motivación así como los principales objetivos y contribuciones también forman parte de este primer capítulo introductorio. La segunda parte de esta Tesis presenta un nuevo protocolo de autenticación basado en RFID para IoT. Este capítulo analiza previamente, desde el punto de vista de la seguridad y la privacidad un protocolo publicado recientemente y, tras demostrar que carece de las medidas de seguridad suficientes, un nuevo protocolo llamado Fingerprint⁺ compatible con los estándares de seguridad definidos en el estándar ISO/IEC 9798 - 2 y EPC-C 1 G 2 (equivalente al estándard ISO/IEC 18000 - 6 C) ha sido propuesto. Un nuevo sistema basado en estándares ISO y en recomendaciones realizadas por el NIST ha sido propuesto en la tercera parte de esta Tesis. En este capítulo se presentan dos protocolos bien diferenciados, el primero de ellos consiste en un protocolo de autenticación basado en el estándar ISO/IEC 9798 Part 2. A modo de ejemplo, este protocolo puede evitar problemas de compatibilidad sanguínea, es decir, primero se confirma que el paciente es quien dice ser y que la bolsa de sangre realmente contiene sangre (proceso de autenticación). Posteriormente se comprueba que esa bolsa de sangre va a ser compatible con el paciente (proceso de verificación). El segundo de los protocolos propuestos consiste en un protocolo seguro para el intercambio de información basado en el estándar ISO/IEC 11770 Part 2 (el mismo que los pasaportes electrónicos). Siguiendo con el ejemplo médico, imaginemos que un doctor equipado con un lector de radiofrecuencia desea acceder a los datos que un dispositivo implantado en el paciente está recopilando. En este escenario tanto el lector como el implante, se deben autenticar mutuamente para poder realizar el intercambio de información de manera segura. En el cuarto capítulo, una nueva arquitectura basada en el modelo de Publish/Subscribe ha sido propuesto. Esta solución está compuesta de dos protocolos, uno para el intercambio de información en una red de área personal y otro para poder reconfigurar el comportamiento de los sensores. Ambos protocolos están diseñados para garantizar tanto la seguridad como la privacidad de todos los datos que se envían en la red. Para ello, el sistema está basado en un sistema de criptografía de clave pública llamado Attribute Based Encryption que es suficientemente ligero y versátil como para ser implementado en dispositivos con altas restricciones de cómputo y de memoria. A continuación, en el quinto capítulo se propone una solución completamente orientada a entornos médicos donde la información que los sensores obtienen de los pacientes es cifrada y almacenada en servidores públicos. Una vez en estos servidores, cualquier usuario con privilegios suficientes puede realizar búsquedas sobre datos cifrados, obtener la información y descifrarla. De manera adicional, antes de que los datos cifrados se manden a la nube, el paciente puede definir una serie de palabras claves que se enlazarán a los datos para permitir posteriormente búsquedas y así obtener la información relacionada a un tema en concreto de manera fácil y eficiente. El último capítulo de esta Tesis se muestran las principales conclusiones obtenidas así como un resumen de las contribuciones científicas publicadas durante el período doctoral.

This paper proposes a novel method to recognize human emotions (neutral, happy, and angry) using a <b>smart</b> <b>bracelet</b> with built-in accelerometer. Methods: In this study, a total of 123 participants were instructed to wear a customized <b>smart</b> <b>bracelet</b> with built-in accelerometer that can track and record their movements. Firstly, participants walked two minutes as normal, which served as walking behaviors in a neutral emotion condition. Participants then watched emotional film clips to elicit emotions (happy and angry). The time interval between watching two clips was more than four hours. After watching film clips, they walked for one minute, which served as walking behaviors in a happy or angry emotion condition. We collected raw data from the bracelet and extracted a few features from raw data. Based on these features, we built classification models for classifying three types of emotions (neutral, happy, and angry). Results and Discussion: For two-category classification, the classification accuracy can reach 91. 3 % (neutral vs. angry), 88. 5 % (neutral vs. happy), and 88. 5 % (happy vs. angry), respectively; while, for the differentiation among three types of emotions (neutral, happy, and angry), the accuracy can reach 81. 2 %.

40|$|The {{way people}} {{meet each other}} is usually face to face. Meanwhile, the way people {{maintain}} their contacts is mostly through social media. This results in a gap of translating a handshake into a digital connection. Shake-On is a start-up that {{has come up with}} an answer by means of a <b>smart</b> <b>bracelet.</b> Their aim is to wirelessly exchange contact details between users wearing the bracelet. This exchange is triggered by the most common human gesture people use when introducing themselves: the handshake. This thesis will overcome two major challenges for Shake-On. First, no general pattern recognition method can be applied to detect handshakes. This is caused by the fact that handshakes gestures show large variations among individual persons. Second, the system should be robust to multiple handshakes happening concurrently. This applies to the scenario of more than two people shaking hands while standing close to each other. Contact details should only be exchanged between people that are handshaking, which requires handshake matching. Again, large variations in `handshaking style' make it a cumbersome task to identify matching handshakes. This thesis proposes a two-fold solution to address the above-mentioned challenges. The first part includes handshake detection, using new features for pattern recognition that are tailored to handshaking recognizing. The second part proposes a new method to perform handshake matching that overcomes the shortcomings of existing solutions. The work done in this thesis has led to the following results: 1. The developed detection method takes into account limited resources and is therefore suitable for implementation on a <b>smart</b> <b>bracelet.</b> Moreover, it shows similar performance as the state-of-the-art solutions, namely an accuracy of 95 %. In contrast to existing solutions using 6 stochastic features, our solution uses 4 computationally lightweight features. 2. Being the first of its kind, the matching method proposes a novel technique that maps handshakes to an abstract binary format. This format is called peakmaps. Because it eliminates personal handshaking style, peakmaps result in a pairing accuracy of 80 % compared to 24 % using basic cross correlation.

For reasons of cost, design and error avoidance, the bracelet could be designed to not have any user interface, nor any biometric sen-sors: All user interaction could be assisted by third-party devices, such as user phones and point of sale terminals. Our approach is based on the principle of physical and logical tether-ing of an identity manager to a user (e. g., by closing the clasp), where an identity manager represents its user’s interests after an initial user authen-tication phase, and until the user causes a disassociation by untethering the device (e. g., by opening the clasp). The authentication phase can be based on any type of authentication, and – to allow for the greatest pos-sible simplicity of design – can be aided by a third-party device, such as the user’s cell phone. We describe the physical design, including aspects to protect against violent attacks on users. We also describe the lightweight security pro-tocols needed for pairing, determination of user intent, and credential management, and give examples of usage scenarios – including automated login; simplified online and point-of-sale purchases; assisted appliance per-sonalization; and automated event logging.

30|$|Intra-body {{communication}} (IBC), {{using the}} human body as the channel to transmit data, has lower power consumption, less radiation, and easier linking than common wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and ANT+. As a result, IBC is greatly suitable for body area network (BAN) applications, such as the medical and health care field. Furthermore, IBC can be implemented in wearable devices, including <b>smart</b> watches, sports <b>bracelets,</b> somatic game devices, and multimedia devices. However, due to the limited battery capacity of sensor nodes in a BAN, especially implanted sensor nodes, it is not convenient to charge or change the batteries. Thus, the energy effectiveness of the media access control (MAC) layer strongly affects {{the life span of}} the nodes and of the entire system. Certainly, analyzing MAC layer performance in a galvanic coupling IBC is of great importance for the overall system. To obtain the attenuation properties of IBC, in vivo experiments with seven volunteers were performed. Meanwhile, an equalizer was used to compensate the frequency distortion in consideration of frequency-selective fading characteristics of intra-body channels. In addition, a comparison of the bit error rates (BER) of different modulation methods was carried out to obtain the best modulation method. Then, the attenuation characteristics of intra-body channels were applied in a multi-node physiological signal monitor and transmission system. Finally, TDMA and CSMA/CA protocols were introduced to calculate the bit energy consumption of IBC in the practical scenario. With stable characteristics of the intra-body channels, QPSK with an equalizer had a better performance than the tests without an equalizer. As a result, the modulation method of FSK could achieve a lower BER in lower signal-to-noise ratio situations and an FSK method with TDMA for the IBC had the lowest energy consumption under different practical scenarios.|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} {{development}} of economy and technology, there is a boom in wearable devices, such as smart watches, <b>smart</b> wristbands, sports <b>bracelets,</b> somatic game devices, and multimedia devices. Generally, these wearable devices were connected through Bluetooth or ZigBee. To increase the integration and communication security, body area network (BAN) was proposed as a new generation of wireless sensor networks which works in the vivo and vitro of the human body. It could be applied in many domains, including health care, medical, military, and consumer electronics [1]. Honeine, P. et al. [2] indicated using BAN in health care and medical domains to monitor the vital physiological signals. They analyzed the long-term information of physiological sensors which were worn or implanted in the body to provide a health care for some common diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart attack. In a health care BAN, transmission method should be low power consumption, low radiation, and high transmission efficiency and security. However, with high power consumption and network insecurity, traditional communication technologies (Bluetooth or ZigBee) were not suitable for the BAN. In this regard, intra-body communication (IBC) was identified by IEEE Standards Organization as a physical layer standard for BAN [3]. In intra-body communication (IBC), human body was selected as transmission medium for electrical signal propagation [4]. There are two signal coupling types in IBC, which are capacitive coupling and galvanic coupling, respectively [4 – 8]. In capacitive coupling IBC, the signal channel is mainly composed of four parts—human body, signal electrode, ground electrode, and the external ground. The ground electrode couples the signal towards the external ground via the electrostatic field. Meanwhile, the surrounding environment has a great influence on the quality of communication, whereas galvanic coupling injects the electric current signal into the body through a pair of electrodes attached to the skin, and another pair of electrodes is used to differentially detect the coupling potential on the skin. The transmission path of galvanic coupling IBC is completely dependent on the human body. Therefore, it does not interact with the external environment which contributes to higher security.|$|R
