5|$|No Blade of Grass (1970): Marshall {{perceived}} {{the film as}} a predecessor to 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later, though he <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Doomsday less straight-faced.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{endorsed}} Hitler's {{order that}} deserters should be hanged {{from the nearest}} tree. When a staff officer <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him aware of the hopelessness of the situation, Kesselring {{told him that he}} had driven through the entire army rear area and not seen a single hanged man.|$|E
5|$|As screenwriter, Fellowes <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{the film}} as {{historically}} accurate as possible. With this in mind, Academy Award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell and historical consultant Alastair Bruce were hired, and filming for The Young Victoria took place at various historical landmarks in England to further the film's authenticity. Despite this, {{various aspects of the}} film have been criticised for their historical inaccuracies.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde {{has largely}} retired from {{politics}} since his {{defeat in the}} 2011 elections. He <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends with Menem for their past political rivalry, and met him during the 2013 Papal inauguration of Pope Francis. They had a private meeting at Menem's house, and Menem {{reported that they were}} on peaceful terms. They had previously met in similar circumstances in 2005, during the funeral of Pope John Paul II.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him the National Republican {{nominee for}} governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an album that would dispel notions of {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E
50|$|Brother Love played drums for NYC-based {{southern}} rock band, Her and King's County {{for a few}} years. After {{leaving this}} band, he and guitarist Alex Haddad <b>sought</b> out <b>to</b> <b>make</b> straight forward honest rock with their new band Them Vibes.|$|R

5|$|In 2100, 28 years later, the company's failed {{stocks and}} assets were bought by a Russian oligarch named Anatoly Korenchkin, a former black market {{operator}} who <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money in legitimate ways. He re-licensed and restored {{the company to}} its former status in the following decade. Along with producing healthcare and consumer products, Korenchkin signed weapons contracts with various military organizations, private and political-owned. The new UNN was almost virtually powerless with Korenchkin exercising control over them.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} the next {{entry in the}} Wipeout series, developer Psygnosis retained many of the developers of the original game to preserve the distinctive racing experience of earlier games. At the same time, Psygnosis <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the game more accessible to new players of the fast-paced racer, and kept early courses easier for these players; the difficulty was adjusted for later courses so that experts still experienced a challenge. Wipeout 3 was the first Wipeout game {{to take advantage of}} PlayStation controllers with analogue sticks, used to offer smoother control of the player's craft.|$|E
5|$|Máel Sechnaill died in 862, and his {{territory}} in Meath was split between two rulers, Lorcán mac Cathail and Conchobar mac Donnchada. Amlaíb and Ímar, now joined in Ireland by their younger brother Auisle, <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{use of this}} change to extend their influence in the lands of the Southern Uí Néill. In 863 the three brothers raided Brega in alliance with Lorcán, and the following year Amlaíb drowned Conchobar at Clonard Abbey. Muirecán mac Diarmata, overking of the Uí Dúnchada, was killed by Vikings in 863, probably by Amlaíb and his kin trying to expand into Leinster.|$|E
50|$|The {{memory of}} St. Eucherius still clings to three vast caves {{near the village}} of Beaumont whither, it is said, the people of Lyon had to go in search of him in 434 when they <b>sought</b> him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him their archbishop.|$|R
50|$|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was {{released}} in 2009 to critical and popular acclaim. After the film {{was released}}, the two <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something different from Cloudy and pitched themselves as possible directors for the 21 Jump Street script that Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill had written. The studio agreed and the two directed their first live-action R-rated film, once again released to critical and popular acclaim {{which led to the}} production of a sequel titled 22 Jump Street.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, {{developers}} <b>sought</b> approval <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their proposed BP Building {{taller than}} the Terminal Tower, but city officials forced them to scale it down. The Terminal Tower remained the tallest building in Ohio until the 1991 completion of Society Center, now Key Tower.|$|R
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it easier for law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|The game {{continues}} Mother {{story in}} that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus {{did not die}} {{at the end of}} Mother) and the player has the option of choosing whether to continue the protagonist's story by choosing whether to name their player-character the same as the original. He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as cliché. Itoi <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such as girls.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place {{heavy emphasis on}} ethical issues, it did see the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E
50|$|Both the Calgary Bar and the City of Calgary <b>sought</b> ways <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{significant}} {{financial contributions}} {{for the development}} of a law library. In September 1974, the Ministry of Advanced Education gave its final approval to the proposal for the establishment of the Faculty of Law.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by the Vanuatu ritual called land diving and the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club {{experimental}} {{jumps in}} the 1970s, Hackett and fellow adventurer Chris Sigglekow, <b>sought</b> ways <b>to</b> <b>make</b> bungy jump safe. Using a mathematical formula developed by New Zealand's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, {{he created a}} super-stretchy elastic bungy cord in the mid-1980s.|$|R
25|$|Philosophers have {{sometimes}} criticized mathematicians' sense of beauty or elegance as being, at best, vaguely stated. By the same token, however, philosophers of mathematics have <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> characterize what <b>makes</b> one proof more desirable than another when both are logically sound.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Kurosawa, {{influenced}} by the democratic ideals of the Occupation, <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> films that would establish a new respect towards {{the individual and the}} self. The first such film, No Regrets for Our Youth (1946), inspired by both the 1933 Takigawa incident and the Hotsumi Ozaki wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar catchphrase.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{information in the}} game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Ba Cụt was surrounded, and <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{peace deal}} with the Diệm {{government}} to avoid being taken prisoner. Ba Cụt {{sent a message to}} Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, the public official who oversaw the civilian side of the campaign against the Hòa Hảo, asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears that the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Ba Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. According to historian Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Ba Cụt's lifelong antipathy towards Thơ's family influenced his behaviour during his last stand. Ba Cụt was arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956, and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E
50|$|Avanoo was {{originally}} called Placebo Effect. Its first product in 2013 was an iPhone app that <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> help people <b>make</b> positive changes {{with support from}} placebo research.

50|$|Because of its antiquity and {{its large}} population, Memphis had several necropoleis spread along the valley, {{including}} the most famous, Saqqara. In addition, the urban area itself consisted of cemeteries that were constructed {{to the west}} of the great temple. The sanctity of these places inevitably attracted the devout and the faithful, who <b>sought</b> either <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an offering <b>to</b> Osiris, or to bury another.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{reluctant}} {{to force her}} inclination as his own was forced, the Baron tries {{to determine whether or}} not his daughter, Amelia, loves the affected and foppish Count Cassel. It becomes clear to the audience that she instead loves Anhalt, a poor clergyman, and he her. It also becomes clear that the Baron regrets the misdeeds of his youth and has long <b>sought,</b> fruitlessly, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends.|$|R
5|$|However, one Hòa Hảo commander, Ba Cụt, {{continued}} to fight, {{having had a}} personal history of bad blood with Thơ's own family. The orphaned, illiterate Cụt's adopted father's rice paddies were confiscated by Thơ's father, which purportedly imbued Cụt with a permanent hatred towards the landowning class. Cụt was eventually surrounded and <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a peace deal so he {{sent a message to}} Thơ asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. Cụt was captured on 13 April 1956 and guillotined after a brief trial and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{considered}} Viva Piñata {{a success}} and the sequel's development team <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. Trouble in Paradise was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{problem was not}} solved: Joseph's foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the Austrian Netherlands. This time {{it would be a}} straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.|$|E
50|$|The friars <b>sought</b> ways <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{their task}} of {{converting}} millions of Indians less daunting. By using existing indigenous settlements in Central Mexico where indigenous rulers {{were kept in}} place in the post-conquest period, the mendicant orders created doctrinas, major Indian towns designated as important for the initial evangelization, while smaller settlements, visitas, were visited at intervals to teach, and preach, and administer the sacraments.|$|R
25|$|Gilbreth {{discovered}} his vocation {{as a young}} building contractor when he <b>sought</b> ways <b>to</b> <b>make</b> bricklaying faster and easier. This grew into a collaboration with his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who studied the work habits of manufacturing and clerical employees {{in all sorts of}} industries to find ways to increase output and make their jobs easier. He and Lillian founded a management consulting firm, Gilbreth, Inc., focusing on such endeavors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{smoking ban}} {{referendum}} {{was based on}} a popular initiative by the Lung League, who <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> clarify and <b>make</b> uniform the national smoking ban and to eliminate smoking rooms and smoking establishments, which had been allowed in some cantons; but it was rejected by 66% of voters.|$|R
