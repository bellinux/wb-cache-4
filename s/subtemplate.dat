40|$|Most {{existing}} {{methods for}} template matching require computationally demanding searches {{and may not}} be appropriate for matching multiple templates. We present a novel real-time solution by matching a number of <b>subtemplates</b> with an input image, instead of using the entire template. Each template class is first learned and depicted offline as a set of wavelet-based directional band-pass filters, each of which allows only the most salient wavelet frequencies (<b>subtemplates)</b> to pass. As a result, matching a template becomes equivalent to the problem of filtering the wavelet transformed image using a set of band-pass filters. Finally, the region with the highest response density after filtering is considered as the detection. The computational complexity of this matching method is 1 / 50 of optimal correlation based SSD [5]and 1 / 10 of orthogonal Haar transform based SSD [20]. Further, the use of <b>subtemplates</b> enables detection even in the presence of skew and rotation. We present experimental results that demonstrate the capacity of our system for detection with a total of 10 different logo classes in broadcast videos. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method for solving the single-trial evoked {{potential}} (EP) estimation problem. In this method, the single-trial EP is {{considered as a}} complex containing many components, which may originate from different functional brain sites; these components can be distinguished according to their respective latencies and amplitudes and are extracted simultaneously by multiple-input single-output autoregressive modeling with exogenous input (MISO-ARX). The extraction process is performed in three stages: first, we use a reference EP as a template and decompose it into a set of components, which serve as <b>subtemplates</b> for the remaining steps. Then, a dictionary is constructed with these <b>subtemplates,</b> and EPs are preliminarily extracted by sparse coding in order to roughly estimate the latency of each component. Finally, the single-trial measurement is parametrically modeled by MISO-ARX while characterizing spontaneous electroencephalographic activity as an autoregression model driven by white noise and with each component of the EP modeled by autoregressive-moving-average filtering of the <b>subtemplates.</b> Once optimized, all components of the EP can be extracted. Compared with ARX, our method has greater tracking capabilities of specific components of the EP complex as each component is modeled individually in MISO-ARX. We provide exhaustive experimental results to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our method...|$|R

40|$|The mean shift {{algorithm}} {{has achieved}} considerable success in target tracking {{due to its}} simplicity and robustness. However, the lack of spatial information may result in its failure to get high tracking precision. This might be even worse when the target is scale variant and the sequences are gray-levels. This paper presents a novel multiple subtemplates based tracking algorithm for the terminal guidance application. By applying a separate tracker to each <b>subtemplate,</b> it can handle more complicated situations such as rotation, scaling, and partial coverage of the target. The innovations include: (1) an optimal subtemplates selection algorithm is designed, which ensures that the selected subtemplates maximally represent the information of the entire template while having the least mutual redundancy; (2) based on the serial tracking results and the spatial constraint prior to those subtemplates, a Gaussian weighted voting method is proposed to locate the target center; (3) the optimal scale factor is determined by maximizing the voting results among the scale searching layers, which avoids the complicated threshold setting problem. Experiments on some videos with static scenes show that the proposed method greatly improves the tracking accuracy compared to the original mean shift algorithm...|$|E

WSU users can access the article via IEEE Xplore database licensed by University Libraries: [URL] paper formulates the problem encountered in the first stage of two-stage, binary template matching as a set of hypotheses to be tested, including a hypothesis of "no object. " Two new statistics R and G are proposed, based on a likelihood ratio, and are compared to the sum of absolute differences and a correlation measure by analytical approximations and Monte Carlo experiments. Statistical power and a measure of sensitivity to the true location of the object are the criteria. Parameters are the numbers of 1 's in object and image, <b>subtemplate</b> size, and parameters reflecting intensity distortion between template and object. One of the proposed statistics R is much more computationally intensive than the other G. Although R is more powerful than G and the other statistics, G is generally more sensitive to the true object location. Statistic G is also more powerful than the sum of absolute differences and correlation. All statistics are robust to incomplete knowledge of distortion parameters. Experiments on Landsat images confirm the sensitivity of G and recommend it for application in the first stage. Peer reviewed articl...|$|E

We choose a diagram that exhibits coexisting attractors and banded chaos. We use the topological characterization method to study these attractors. Then, we detail how the templates of these attractors are <b>subtemplates</b> of a unique template. Our main result is that only one template describes the topological structure of eight attractors. This leads to a topological partition of the bifurcation diagram that gives the symbolic dynamic of all bifurcation diagram attractors with a unique template...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for detecting objects in images, {{one of the}} fundamental tasks of computer vision. The algorithm extends the representational efficiency of eigenimage methods to binary features, which are less sensitive to illumination changes than gray-level values normally used with eigenimages. Binary features (square <b>subtemplates)</b> are automatically chosen on each training image. Using features rather than whole templates makes the algorithm more robust to background clutter and partial occlusions. Instead of representing the features with real-valued eigenvector principle components, we use binary vector quantization to avoid floating point computations. The object is detected in the image using a simple geometric hash table and Hough transform. On a test o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new mesh conversion template, called HEXHOOP, that fully automates a conversion from a hex-dominant mesh to an all-hex mesh. A HEXHOOP template subdivides a hex/prism/pyramid element {{to a set}} of smaller hex elements while maintaining the topological conformity with neighboring elements. A HEXHOOP template is constructed by assembling <b>subtemplates,</b> cores and caps. A dicing template for a hex and a prism is constructed by choosing the appropriate combination of a core and caps. A template that dices a pyramid without losing conformity to the adjacent element is derived from a HEXHOOP template. Some experimental results show that the HEXHOOP templates successfully convert a hex-dominant mesh to an all-hex mesh...|$|R

In this paper, we present a context sensitive grammar in an And-Or graph representation which will produce a large set of composite graphical templates {{to account for the}} wide variabilities of cloth configurations, such as T-shirts, jackets, etc. In a supervised learning phase, we ask an artist to draw sketches on a set of dressed people, and we decompose the sketches into categories of cloth and body components: collars, shoulders, cuff, hands, pants, shoes etc. Each component has a number of distinct <b>subtemplates</b> (sub-graphs). These sub-templates serve as leafnodes in a big And-Or graph where an And-node represents a decomposition of the graph into sub-configurations with Markov relations for context and constraints (soft or hard), and an Or-node is a switch for choosing one out of a set of alternative And-nodes (sub-configurations) – similar to a node in stochastic context free grammar (SCFG). This representation integrates the SCFG for structural variability and the Markov (graphical) model for context. An algorithm which integrates the bottom-up proposals and the topdown information is proposed to infer the composite cloth template from the image. 1...|$|R
