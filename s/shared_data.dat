The former is represented by its state-level counterpart, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), which has <b>shared</b> <b>data</b> with it, participated in the planning process and works with local communities to protect wildlife habitat. Among the latter, the local and state Audubon Society chapters advocated strongly for the area's protection, since the society had declared the airport site an Important Bird Area in 1998. Other organizations have played supporting roles by helping to perform management tasks and raising awareness. There is a Friends of Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge, which was formed in 2017. This refuge is staffed by two FWS volunteers.|$|E
25|$|SQL Server allows {{multiple}} {{clients to}} use the same database concurrently. As such, it needs to control concurrent access to <b>shared</b> <b>data,</b> to ensure data integrity—when multiple clients update the same data, or clients attempt to read data that {{is in the process of}} being changed by another client. SQL Server provides two modes of concurrency control: pessimistic concurrency and optimistic concurrency. When pessimistic concurrency control is being used, SQL Server controls concurrent access by using locks. Locks can be either shared or exclusive. Exclusive lock grants the user exclusive access to the data—no other user can access the data as long as the lock is held. Shared locks are used when some data is being read—multiple users can read from data locked with a shared lock, but not acquire an exclusive lock. The latter would have to wait for all shared locks to be released.|$|E

2500|$|Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates {{under the}} name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison took {{inspiration}} from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named [...] "A Relational Model of Data for Large <b>Shared</b> <b>Data</b> Banks." [...] He heard about the IBM System R database from {{an article in the}} IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Also derived from Codd's theories, Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982, to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. At this stage Bob Miner served as the company's senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering. In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company. Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems (most of which support C).|$|E

40|$|For several decades, the intensifying {{trend of}} {{researchers}} {{to believe that}} <b>sharing</b> research <b>data</b> is “good” has overshadowed the belief that <b>sharing</b> <b>data</b> is “bad. ” However, <b>sharing</b> <b>data</b> is difficult even though an impressive effort {{has been made to}} solve <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> issues within the research community, but relatively little is known about <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> beyond the research community. This dissertation aims to address this gap by investigating how <b>data</b> are <b>shared</b> effectively across research and public communities. The practices of <b>sharing</b> <b>data</b> with both researchers and non-professionals in two comparative case studies, Encyclopedia of Life and CyberSEES, were examined by triangulating multiple qualitative data sources (i. e., artifacts, documentation, participant observation, and interviews). The two cases represent the creation of biodiversity data, the beginning of the <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> process in a home repository, {{and the end of the}} <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> process in an aggregator repository. Three research questions are asked in each case: •	Who are the data providers? •	Who are the <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> mediators? •	What are the <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> processes? The findings reveal the <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> contexts and processes across research and public communities. <b>Data</b> <b>sharing</b> contexts are reflected by the cross-level data providers and human mediators rooted in different groups, whereas <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> processes are reflected by the dynamic and sustainable collaborative efforts made by different levels of human mediators with the support of technology mediators. This dissertation provides theoretical and practical contributions. Its findings refine and develop a new <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> framework of knowledge infrastructure for different-level <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> across different communities. Both human and technology infrastructure are made visible in the framework. The findings also provide insight for <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> practitioners (i. e., data providers, data mediators, data managers, and data contributors) and information system developers and designers to better conduct and support open and sustainable <b>data</b> <b>sharing</b> across research and public communities...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{technology}} platforms that bring benefits only when users <b>share</b> <b>data.</b> In healthcare, {{this is a}} key policy issue, {{because of the potential}} cost savings and quality improvements from ‘big data’ in the form of <b>sharing</b> electronic patient <b>data</b> across medical providers. Indeed, one criterion used for federal subsidies for healthcare information technology is whether the software has the capability to <b>share</b> <b>data.</b> We find empirically that larger hospital systems are more likely to exchange electronic patient information internally, but are less likely to exchange patient information externally with other hospitals. This pattern is driven by instances where there may be a commercial cost to <b>sharing</b> <b>data</b> with other hospitals. Our results suggest that the common strategy of using ‘marquee’ large users to kick-start a platform technology has an important drawback of potentially creating information silos. This suggests that federal subsidies for health data technologies based on ‘meaningful use’ criteria, that are based simply on the capability to <b>share</b> <b>data</b> rather than actual <b>sharing</b> of <b>data,</b> may be misplaced...|$|R

In shared-memory systems, processes communicate by accessing <b>shared</b> <b>data</b> structures. A shared (read-write) register, sometimes just called a register, is a fundamental type of <b>shared</b> <b>data</b> structure which stores a value and has two operations: Read, which returns the value stored in the register, and Write, which updates the value stored. Other types of <b>shared</b> <b>data</b> structures include read-modify-write, test-and-set, compare-and-swap etc. The memory location which is concurrently accessed is sometimes called a register.|$|E

The {{plans are}} comparable to other carriers <b>Shared</b> <b>Data</b> options, but still include all of the same free calling features. A further enhancement to the <b>Shared</b> <b>Data</b> plans was unveiled during Q2 2014, where customers could opt to purchase devices under no-interest [...] "installment agreements" [...] {{in lieu of a}} device subsidy. The installment plans are based on the full device cost spread out over 24 equal monthly installment payments, in addition to the cellular service cost. Customers who purchase equipment on installment plans receive discounts on their [...] "connection charges" [...] to their <b>shared</b> <b>data</b> plans, and pay lower activation fees on devices. There is also no penalty for early payoff for devices on installment plans. Customers who purchase devices under installment payments on <b>shared</b> <b>data</b> plans also have an [...] "early upgrade" [...] option to trade-in their devices after 18 payments in order to upgrade to a new device superseded by another installment agreement on the new device. In November, 2015, an enhancement was made to allow customers who purchase devices on installment plans to be able to [...] "pay down" [...] their devices in multiples of the device's monthly installment cost at any time. Thus, customers can now either pay off their devices in full at any time or make extra payments towards their devices.|$|E
