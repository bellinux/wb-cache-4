In the qualification day she had a weak performance, grabbing the beam on her <b>switch</b> <b>ring</b> and falling on her double layout dismount on uneven bars, failing to make the event finals. However, in the team finals competition she helped Romania place fourth by receiving the highest marks on beam (15.300) and uneven bars (14.066) among her team. Individually, she managed a good performance in the all-around final, but she only placed sixth due to small mistakes on floor and the low difficulty of her vault exercise.

40|$|Abstract—Photonic {{integration}} of an all-optical packet switch (AOPS) {{is a crucial}} issue since it leads to a great reduction of volume, power consumption, and costs. Recently, a 1 4 AOPS was successfully demonstrated by using an all-optical label ex-tractor/eraser. The label extractor/eraser was implemented by means of fiber Bragg gratings and optical circulators that prevent the photonic {{integration of}} the AOPS. Here, we demonstrate a passive and asynchronous photonic integrated all-optical label extractor/eraser by using narrowband silicon–nitride add–drop ring-resonators. By exploiting the narrow bandwidth of the drop port and pass-through port error-free simultaneous sep-aration/erasing of the in-band labels from the 160 -Gb/s packet payload was demonstrated without noticeable pulse-shape distor-tions.

50|$|In 2014, Millousi {{began her}} season by once again {{competing}} at the Cottbus World Cup. She {{failed to make}} any of the event finals after errors on bars and beam in qualifications thus breaking her medal streak at that World Cup. Next, Millousi went to help out the Union Haguenau team at the French Championships Team Final by competing on bars, beam and floor. She made mistakes on all three events and therefore her team failed to medal. After two unsuccessful competitions, Millousi competed at the Korea Cup where she rearranged her beam routine and (most notably) downgraded her risky double pike dismount to a double tuck. She {{won the gold medal}} on beam with a routine that included a layout step-out mount, a switch split leap to split ring leap and a stuck double tuck dismount for a 14.325. At the 2014 Nanning World Championships, Millousi rearranged her beam routine again adding in connections like aerial cartwheel to switch split leap to back tuck and <b>switch</b> <b>ring</b> leap to split ring leap, which she debuted in podium training. In qualifications, Millousi had an incredible performance scoring a 53.933 all-around - just missing out on the all-around final by 0.309 - and becoming 1st reserve for the all-around final.

40|$|Bacteria {{control their}} {{swimming}} direction by signalling from chemoreceptors via a small protein, CheY, to the rotary flagellar motor. Rhodobacter sphaeroides has a complex chemosensory network with two pathways, including three different CheYs controlling a stop-start motor. Deletions of these che Ys {{result in a}} non-chemotactic phenotype. CheY 6 is essential for chemotaxis, whereas CheY 3 and CheY 4 have some functional redundancies. Although CheY 6 alone can stop the motor, the presence of either CheY 3 or CheY 4 is required for a chemotactic phenotype. To date, {{little is known about}} how these three CheY proteins interact with the flagellar motor, or the switch mechanism used between the inactive and active states. Structural studies of CheY 6 using NMR experiments, highlighted a flexible loop region (residues S 109 -K 118) that is not present in CheY 3, CheY 4 or CheYs in other bacterial species. This elongated loop region was deleted (CheY 6 -ÎLoop), and in vivo studies were used to investigate its function. CheY 6 ÎLoop is folded, retains the ability to be phosphorylated by CheA 3, localises at the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor cluster, but appears unable to stop the flagellar motor. Circular dichroism and NMR data suggest that CheY 6 -ÎLoop is a folded protein that shows similar peak shifts to wild type CheY 6 upon activation. In wild type CheY 6, residues in this loop show chemical shift changes upon addition of the phosphoryl mimic BeF 3 -, suggesting that the loop is involved in the activation mechanism. The switch mechanism of CheY 6 was probed using multidimensional NMR studies. The active state was mimicked using BeF 3 -. Wild type CheY 6 was shown to undergo structural changes upon addition of BeF 3 -. In particular, the Î² 4 Î± 4 -loop and residues located near the phosphorylatable D 56 show large changes in chemical shift. Superposition of this loop region revealed possible steric clashes with the N-terminus of FliM. S 83 shows evidence of involvement in the switch mechanism. Residual dipolar coupling experiments suggest that the published crystal of CheY 6 in complex with CheA 3, is more like the inactive conformation in solution. CheY has been shown to interact with the motor switch protein FliM in other bacterial species. CheY 6 -FliM interactions were probed using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies. Bacterial two hybrid assays and NMR studies suggest that CheY 6 cannot interact with monomeric FliM. Single molecule total internal reflection microscopy revealed CheY 6 does interact with the motor in vivo. The data in combination suggests a model in which CheY 6 -P only interacts with FliM when {{it is part of the}} <b>switch</b> <b>ring,</b> and structural changes involved in stopping the motor depend on the large conformational changes in the Î² 4 -Î± 4 -loop. </p...|$|E

50|$|In Transport {{communication}} networks {{two methods}} were developed and introduced for restoration and recovery, {{one was a}} ring-based protection {{and the other was}} mesh restoration. The ring based protection offered a quick recovery time at the expense of higher capacity redundancy, while the mesh restoration offered better capacity-efficiency at the expense of slower recovery times. In 1998 the p-Cycle became a promising technique for recovery in mesh networks because of the combined benefits of ring network recovery speed and mesh like capacity efficiency. In a mesh network, the spare capacity is used to create the ring like structures as shown in Figure 1.

40|$|International audienceOptical packet {{switching}} {{is known to}} leverage the statistical multiplexing in optical networks, but in turn it may cause stability issues at the input queues containing packets waiting for transmission. Stability issues {{need to be addressed}} by a proper scheduling of the packet transmissions and dimensioningof the network. This paper aims {{to address the problem of}} dimensioning an optical packet <b>switched</b> <b>ring</b> with stability guarantees. In such a ring, the stability issues occur because a single tunable transmitter can insert the locally generated packets on different wavelengths. The necessary and sufficient stability conditions derived for a class of scheduling policy are identified, linearized and included in the mixed linear programming formulation that models the dimensioning problem. Optimal results show that neglecting the stability conditions may lead to more than 50 % of the design to be unstable. To guarantee stability in such design, a 20 % increase of the network cost may be required mainly for the additional wavelengths...|$|R

This paper focuses on the latency aspect. We investigate the impact of a timer that can be used to upper bound the slot insertion time on the medium.
