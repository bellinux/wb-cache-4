However, there is a growing divergence between how social capital is commonly measured in the study of ICTs and how it is measured in other fields.

40|$|A major {{trend in}} current {{building}} practice {{is to reduce}} the weight of structures. The main incentives for this trend are the scarcity of materials and the rising costs of labor and materials. This is {{one of the goals of}} IFD (Industrial, Flexible and Demountable) way of building which is the prevalent Dutch approach to sustainable building. One of the heaviest and most complex parts of a building is the floor. Therefore the focus of this research is to develop a lightweight floor system. However, these lightweight floor systems are sensitive to vibrations and are therefore, without taking measures, regarded less comfortable than heavier, more traditional floor systems. This paper describes <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> to increase vibration comfort. A quality measure, based on the velocity of the vibration, is used to compare the comfort value of a structure subjected to vibrations.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decades, {{settlement}} activities increased in European mountain regions. Due to the scarceness of areas suitable for development, residential estates were extended into areas endangered by natural hazards such as mass movements. These settlements generally show a considerable vulnerability to tangible assets. Integral risk management strategies {{to reduce the}} vulnerability to tangible assets are presented {{for the assessment of}} such endangered areas. Conventional mitigation and local <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> are discussed with respect to the necessary delimitation of endangered areas, the preparedness of people and possible financial prevention.

Thereby, different local <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> are classified and recommended according to a possible implementation for newly-erected buildings and for upgrading existing buildings, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is an {{extensive}} reference terminology with an attendant amount of complexity. It has been updated continuously and revisions {{have been released}} semi-annually to meet users’ needs and to reflect the results of quality assurance (QA) activities. Two measures based on structural features are proposed to track the effects of both natural terminology growth and QA activities based on aspects {{of the complexity of}} SNOMED CT. These two measures, called the structural density measure and accumulated <b>structural</b> <b>measure,</b> are derived based on two abstraction networks, the area taxonomy and the partial-area taxonomy. The measures derive from attribute relationship distributions and various concept groupings that are associated with the abstraction networks. They are used to track the trends in the complexity of structures as SNOMED CT changes over time. The measures were calculated for consecutive releases of five SNOMED CT hierarchies, including the Specimen hierarchy. The structural density measure shows that natural growth tends to move a hierarchy’s structure toward a more complex state, whereas the accumulated <b>structural</b> <b>measure</b> shows that QA processes tend to move a hierarchy’s structure toward a less complex state. It is also observed that both the structural density and accumulated structural measures are useful tools to track the evolution of an entire SNOMED CT hierarchy and reveal internal concept migration within it...|$|E

40|$|We try {{to better}} {{understand}} the comparative advantages of structural and behavioral measures of deregulation in electricity markets, an eminent policy issue for which the experimental evidence is scant and problematic. In the present paper we investigate theoretically and experimentally the effects of the introduction of a forward market on competition in electricity markets. We compare this scenario with the best alternative, reducing concentration by adding one more competitor by divestiture. Our work contributes to the literature by introducing more realistic cost configurations, teasing apart number and asset effect, and studying numbers of competitors that reflect better the market concentration in the European electricity industries. Our experimental data suggest that introducing a forward market has a positive effect on the aggregate supply in markets with two or three major competitors, configurations typical for both the newly accessed and the old European Union member states. Introducing a forward market also increases efficiency. Our data furthermore suggest, in contrast to previous findings, that the effects of introducing a forward market is stronger than adding one more competitor both in markets with two, and particularly three, producers. Our data thus suggest that the behavioral measure of introducing a forward market is more effective than the <b>structural</b> <b>measure</b> of adding one more competitor by divestiture. Thus competition authorities should, in line with EU law, focus on the behavioral measure of introducing, or at least facilitating the emergence of, forward markets rather than on the <b>structural</b> <b>measure</b> of lowering market concentration by divestiture. economics experiments; market power; competition; forward markets; EU electricity market...|$|E
40|$|Mahanadi is an {{important}} river in India. At its delta head at Mundali, it has branched into several rivers and drains its water to the Bay of Bengal. The deltaic region is affected by flood, drainage and salinity problems almost every year due to presence of low level escapes [...] These escapes start functioning with a flood of 17000 cumecs of undivided flood in Mahanadi at Naraj. Some part of the deltaic region is safe up to a flood of 28300 cumecs due to presence of double continuos embankments. The flood at the delta head has crossed 28300 cumecs eight times between 1958 - 1998 and made serious problem to entire delta command area.

That means, it remains often unclear whether a particular measure is useful and feasible to solve a particular problem in network biology. Exemplarily, the classification of complex biological networks can be named, for which <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> are used leading to a minimal classification error. Hence, there is a strong need to provide freely available software packages to calculate and demonstrate the appropriate usage of <b>structural</b> graph <b>measures</b> in network biology. Results Here, we discuss topological network descriptors that are implemented in the R-package QuACN and demonstrate their behavior and characteristics by applying them to a set of example graphs. Moreover, we show a representative application to illustrate their capabilities for classifying biological networks. In particular, we infer gene regulatory networks from microarray data and classify them by methods provided by QuACN. Note that QuACN is the first freely available software written in R containing a large number of <b>structural</b> graph <b>measures.</b> Conclusion The R package QuACN is under ongoing development and we add promising groups of topological network descriptors continuously. The package can be used to answer intriguing research questions in network biology, e. g., classifying biological data or identifying meaningful biological features, by analyzing the topology of biological networks. </p...|$|R

The {{aim is to}} extrapolate and predict the bone loss, to provide test objects for newly developed <b>structural</b> <b>measures,</b> and to understand the physical mechanisms behind the bone alteration. Our bone model approach differs from those already {{reported in the literature}} by two features. First, we work with original bone images, obtained by computed tomography (CT); second, we use <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> of complexity to evaluate bone resorption and to compare it with the data provided by CT.

For 2 -dimensional images we suggest two algorithms, a threshold algorithm and a virtual slicing algorithm. The threshold algorithm simulates bone resorption on a boundary between bone and marrow, representing an activity of osteoclasts.
