The objective {{of the study is}} to develop an energy-dissipating rear <b>underride</b> <b>protection</b> device (RUPD) for diminishing the hazard imposed on the passenger car and the occupants. The new RUPD which has energy-dissipating structure is designed. It is modeled in virtual environment together with a moving barrier (MB) and a contrastive common RUPD. Finite element simulation is performed for comparative analysis on the performance of the two RUPDs in LS-DYNA. In the virtual test, the MB crashes into the two RUPDs respectively according to the national standard GB 11567. 2 - 2001. The conditions of 54 km/h crash speed and offset collision form are added to the virtual test for further test. The results show that under the national standard condition, the new RUPD dissipates 77 % of the total crash energy and the MB's acceleration peak in the test of the new RUPD is 22. 8 g, which is 40 % lower than that in the test of the common one.

5000|$|An {{extremely}} dangerous situation occurs during [...] "underride collisions", {{in which a}} passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a rear underride guard, or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a <b>side</b> <b>underride</b> guard. [...] The platform bed of a typical trailer is approximately at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means that {{there may not be}} much between a head and the edge of the trailer platform, except a glass windshield. [...] In an underride collision, the car's crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed, and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the windshield and roof pillars have already impacted the trailer bed. [...] Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space, leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low speed collisions. Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards, which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.|$|R

This project has been studied by the NEDECD and it appeared that the bottom <b>protection</b> <b>length</b> of 30 meter, designed by the Koreans is not sufficient according to Dutch design rules. In this thesis study, the bottom <b>protection</b> <b>length</b> has been determined according to Dutch design standards.

This model is described in the sub report on the preliminary model investigation on the closure of the Shiwa tidal basin. With the model, several closure methods have been simulated. With the thus obtained local hydraulic data, the decisive D 50 of the closure dam, depending on the closure method has been determined.

In many cases, these tragedies are consequences of not having effective underride guards mounted to the rear, side and front of the heavy vehicles. Lack of effective underride guards brings less compatibility making heavy vehicles more aggressive on roads. Several designs have been designed for energy absorbing underride guards. A new underride guard is developed based on the mechanical principle of simple pliers tool was conceived by Louis Otto Faber Schmutzler, SAE BRAZIL 1995. This research work describes nature of underrides, the design and analysis of two new guards for rear and side, vehicle behavior at different speeds and prevention of passenger compartment intrusion. With the advance in computer simulations, full finite element validated vehicle models are being analyzed for different impact scenarios. The main purpose of building the simulation models {{is to reduce the}} real time tests which are associated with significant cost.

40|$|The Ku {{heterodimer}} {{associates with}} the Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomere, where it impacts {{several aspects of}} telomere structure and function. Although Ku avidly binds DNA ends via a preformed channel, its ability to associate with telomeres via this mechanism could be challenged by factors known to bind directly to the chromosome terminus. This has led to uncertainty as to whether Ku itself binds directly to telomeric ends and whether end association is crucial for Ku’s telomeric functions. To address these questions, we constructed DNA end binding–defective Ku heterodimers by altering amino acid residues in Ku 70 and Ku 80 that were predicted to contact DNA. These mutants continued to associate with their known telomere-related partners, such as Sir 4, a factor required for telomeric silencing, and TLC 1, the RNA component of telomerase. Despite these interactions, {{we found that the}} Ku mutants had markedly reduced association with telomeric chromatin and null-like deficiencies for telomere end <b>protection,</b> <b>length</b> regulation, and silencing functions. In contrast to Ku null strains, the DNA end binding defective Ku mutants resulted in increased, rather than markedly decreased, imprecise end-joining proficiency at an induced double-strand break. This result further supports that it was the specific loss of Ku’s telomere end binding that resulted in telomeric defects rather than global loss of Ku’s functions. The extensive telomere defects observed in these mutants lead us to propose that Ku is an integral component of the terminal telomeric cap, wher...|$|R

Much less is known about the ability of oligosaccharides to protect dry membranes. However, it has been shown that different structural families of oligosaccharides have different efficacies to interact with and protect membranes during drying.

40|$|Abstract—Reed-Solomon erasure {{codes are}} {{commonly}} studied {{as a method}} to protect the video streams when transmitted over unreliable networks. As a block-based error correcting code, on one hand, enlarging the block size can enhance {{the performance of the}} Reed-Solomon codes; on the other hand, large block size leads to long delay which is not tolerable for real-time video applica-tions. In this paper a novel Dynamic Sub-GOP FEC (DSGF) ap-proach is proposed to improve the performance of Reed-Solomon codes for video applications. With the proposed approach, the Sub-GOP, which contains more than one video frame, is dynamically tuned and used as the RS coding block, yet no delay is introduced.

40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural river banks have been {{transformed}} into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion. Important river features for flora and fauna have disappeared and the ecological quality of the river reduced dramatically. Recently, the importance of the ecological function of rivers has been getting more attention. One river restoration measure is the removal of man-made bank protections to increase habitat diversity and biodiversity of riparian areas and the river basin. The river morphology may change due to the freely eroding banks in the restored section. Reference projects show that the removal of bank protection along rivers may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Schirmer et al., 2014). Bars increase morphological diversity, providing specific habitats for flora and fauna (Kurth and Schirmer, 2014). There is a lack of knowledge about the formation of bars related to the length and location of the removal of bank <b>protection.</b> The <b>length</b> of river bank protection removal is usually limited, due to human activities along the riversides.

40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural riverbanks have been {{transformed}} into banks with artificial revetments or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion, which led to disappearance of important river features for flora and fauna. River restoration projects show that the removal of man-made bank protections may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Van den Berghe et al., 2012; Schirmer et al., 2014). Habitat diversity in rivers may be enhanced through the formation of river bars with preferably diversity in bar height, size and location. This research aims at gaining knowledge into the effects of removing riverbank protections on bar formation to enhance habitat diversity. Mobile-bed flume experiments were performed in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. The experiments were focussed on bar formation related to three variables of a bank <b>protection</b> removal; <b>length,</b> location and flow asymmetry. Geometrical and morphodynamic characteristics were selected for the experiment having a bar mode of one to obtain a system with alternate bars (Crosato and Mosselman, 2009) and showed gravel-bed river similarity based on bankfull river characteristics of Parker (2004). The experimental flume consisted of a 6. 2 metre long and 0. 2 metre wide straight channel with 0. 5 metre wide floodplains on the sides. On both sides of the channel, bank protection could be removed over a limited length with optionally a groyne upstream. After seven hours {{at the end of each}} test, photos of the bed topography were taken and the longitudinal bed profile was measured. Bar wavelengths and bar heights in each experimental test were determined from detrended bed profiles. The bar height was divided in two classes: low and high. The areas of low bars, high bars, floodplains and the deep channel were determined from photos of the final bed topographies. Bar types were indicated with terminology from Duró et al. (2015) as forced, free or hybrid. Removal of bank protections resulted in lateral erosion of channel banks over a limited length. The eroded bank line moved in downstream direction, which agrees with the downstream meander migration observed in field and laboratory investigations by many authors (e. g. Odgaard, 1987). Scour holes developed downstream of the widened section, due to turbulent eddies forced by the channel geometry. In the widened reach, flow decelerated which resulted in a lower sediment transport. Consequently, sediment was deposited in the widened reach and caused rising of the mean bed level along with formation of bars. In areas with higher flow velocities an increased sediment transport deepened the channel. When the riverbanks were fixed, relatively low, small, side bars were formed in the channel. In general, the total bar area and bar height increased for an increase in channel widening, due to the removal of bank protection. An increased bank <b>protection</b> removal <b>length</b> up to nine times the channel width or an upstream asymmetrical flow forcing, i. e. groyne, increased the total bar area, whereas a bank protection removal at three different locations with a total length of nine times the channel width did not significantly increased the total bar area. It is recommended to remove riverbank <b>protections</b> over a <b>length</b> of at least nine times the river width on both sides of the river with optionally a groyne upstream as a measure to enhance habitat diversity. It is also valuable to remove the bank protection on one side of the river only. It is advised to construct a groyne upstream of the bank protection removal to increase habitat diversity. This research led to results that can be used in further research. It is advised to conduct larger scale experiments and eventually move to the field.

Many studies have been devoted to “fix” the copyright problems, which include reconceptualization of copyright law (Jessica Litman and Pamela Samuelson), shortening protection term (Neil Netanel), reclaiming fair use (Patricia Aufderheide and Peter Jaszi), perfecting licensing scheme (William Fisher, David Lange, etc.), and employing Creative Commons and open source project [...] . postprin...|$|R
50|$|Padlock seals {{are usually}} {{supplied}} as a completely plastic seal, shaped {{as a standard}} padlock would be. Technically, they can be classed as a fixed length seal. They feature {{the same types of}} tamper-evident <b>protection</b> as variable <b>length</b> and fixed length have available - numbering, bar-coding and branding - but fit some different applications. The most common use for these seals is for airline duty-free trolleys. One {{reason for this is that}} plastic padlocks can be placed over a locking part as any metal padlock would be to secure, but do not require keys to open, they simply break off at their built in break point using hands or a small pair of wire cutters. They are secure due to the audit trail available as a result of the sequential numbering.|$|R
40|$|The six human {{telomeric}} proteins TRF 1, TRF 2, RAP 1, TIN 2, POT 1, and TPP 1 {{can form}} a complex called the telosome/shelterin, which {{is required for}} telomere <b>protection</b> and <b>length</b> control. TPP 1 {{has been shown to}} regulate both POT 1 telomere localization and telosome assembly through its binding to TIN 2. It remains to be determined where such interactions take place and whether cellular compartmentalization of telomeric proteins is important for telomere maintenance. We systematically investigated here the cellular localization and interactions of human telomeric proteins. Interestingly, we found TIN 2, TPP 1, and POT 1 to localize and interact with each other in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Unexpectedly, TPP 1 contains a functional nuclear export signal that directly controls the amount of TPP 1 and POT 1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, binding of TIN 2 to TPP 1 promotes the nuclear localization of TPP 1 and POT 1. We also found that disrupting TPP 1 nuclear export could result in telomeric DNA damage response and telomere length disregulation. Our findings highlight how the coordinated interactions between TIN 2, TPP 1, and POT 1 in the cytoplasm regulate the assembly and function of the telosome in the nucleus and indicate {{for the first time the}} importance of nuclear export and spatial control of telomeric proteins in telomere maintenance...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} linear {{convolutional}} codes for compound channels (i. e., channels on which burst and random errors occur) is given. It is shown that for any rate and burst length {{there exists a}} linear convolutional code of that rate that can correct almost all bursts of errors of that length and that requires a much smaller guard space than any code that can correct all possible bursts of errors {{less than or equal}} to that <b>length.</b> <b>Protection</b> against random errors can be obtained at the expense of the burst-error-correction capability. Explicit formulas are given for the number of bursts and random errors that can be corrected. A particular scheme to construct some codes is given. It is noted that these codes exhibit limited error propagation. A technique for constructing codes that can correct random errors within the guard space is also given...|$|R
