25|$|Although {{the atomic}} {{structure}} of glass shares {{characteristics of the}} structure in a <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquid,</b> glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature. A <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquid</b> behaves as a liquid, but it is below the freezing point of the material, {{and in some cases}} will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of acoustic wave propagation in <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> {{is not yet}} fully understood since the vibrational dynamics of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> are strongly affected by their amorphous inherent structures. In this paper, the acoustic wave propagation in a <b>supercooled</b> model <b>liquid</b> is studied by using normal mode analysis. Due to the highly disordered inherent structure, a single acoustic wave is decomposed into many normal modes in broad frequency range. This causes the rapid decay of the acoustic wave and results in anomalous wavenumber dependency of the dispersion relation {{and the rate of}} attenuation. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures (color...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the relationship between}} the temperature at which averaged energy landscape properties change sharply ($T_{o}$), and the breakdown of mean-field treatments of the dynamics of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids.</b> First, we show that the solution of the wavevector dependent mode-coupling equations undergoes an ergodic-nonergodic transition consistently close to $T_{o}$. Generalizing the landscape concept to include hard-sphere systems, we show that the property of inherent structures that changes near $T_{o}$ is governed more fundamentally by packing and free volume than potential energy. Lastly, we study the finite-size Random Orthogonal Model (ROM), and show that the onset of noticeable corrections to mean-field behavior occurs at $T_{o}$. These results highlight new connections between the energy landscape and mode-coupling approach to <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids,</b> and identify what features of the relaxation of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> are properly captured by mode-coupling theory.

Fresh honey is a supersaturated liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures.

40|$|A broad {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the mechanisms underlying the phenomenology of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> has remained elusive, despite decades of intense exploration. When supercooled beneath its characteristic melting temperature, a liquid sees a sharp rise in its viscosity over a narrow temperature range, eventually becoming frozen on laboratory timescales. Explaining this immense increase in viscosity {{is one of the}} principle goals of condensed matter physicists. To that end, numerous theoretical frameworks have been proposed which explain and reproduce the temperature dependence of the viscosity of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids.</b> Each of these frameworks appears only applicable to specific classes of glassformers and each possess a number of variable parameters. Here we describe a classical framework for explaining the dynamical behavior of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> based on statistical mechanical considerations, and possessing only a single variable parameter. This parameter varies weakly from liquid to liquid. Furthermore, as predicted by this new classical theory and its earlier quantum counterpart, we find {{with the aid of a}} small dimensionless constant that varies in size from ∼ 0. 05 - 0. 12, a universal (16 decade) collapse of the viscosity data as a function of temperature. The collapse appears in all known types of glass forming <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> (silicates, metallic alloys, organic systems, chalcogenide, sugars, and water).

40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} that Heisenberg spin glasses may {{belong to the}} same universality class than structural glasses. Indeed, finding a lattice equivalent for <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> would probably allow easier numerical and analytical studies, that may help to answer long-standing questions on the glass transition. <b>Supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> have many peculiar behaviors that should be found in the paramagnetic phase of Heisenberg spin glasses if the analogy between the two systems holds. It is with this motivation that we undertake a study of the paramagnetic phase of Heisenberg spin glasses. We shall emphasize the role of the energy landscape, with a detailed study of the properties of the inherent structures (by analogy with <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids,</b> we name inherent structure the local minimum of the energy function which is closest to the current spin configuration). Finding inherent structures will require {{the development of a new}} search algorithm. We shall investigate as well the existence of a dynamic transition in the paramagnetic phase. As a matter of fact, both the existence of a complex energy landscape, as well as the existence of a dynamic transition, are distinguished features of the Physics of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids.</b> Comment: Tesi di laurea specialistica in fisica, Sapienza, Università di Rom...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{dynamics}} of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> {{and the formation of}} glasses can be understood from the existence of a zero temperature dynamical critical point. To support our proposal, we derive from simple physical assumptions a dynamic field theory for <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids,</b> which we study using the renormalization group (RG). Its long time behaviour is dominated by a zero temperature critical point, which for dimensions d > 2 belongs to the directed percolation universality class.

25|$|In physics, the {{standard}} {{definition of a}} glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass {{is often used to}} describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of the <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquid</b> is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.|$|E
25|$|Glass is in {{widespread}} use {{largely due to}} the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light {{in the same manner as}} a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquid</b> are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored.|$|E

50|$|Metastable {{states of}} matter range from melting solids (or {{freezing}} liquids), boiling liquids (or condensing gases) and sublimating solids to <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> or superheated liquid-gas mixtures.

40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} {{and dynamics}} of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> correlate with their elasticity. In particular for covalent networks, the jump of specific heat {{is small and}} the liquid is strong near the threshold valence where the network acquires rigidity. By contrast, the jump of specific heat and the fragility are large away from this threshold valence. In a previous work [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 110, 6307 (2013) ], we could explain these behaviors by introducing a model of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> in which local rearrangements interact via elasticity. However, in that model the disorder characterizing elasticity was frozen, whereas it is itself a dynamic variable in <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids.</b> Here we study numerically and theoretically adaptive elastic network models where polydisperse springs can move on a lattice, thus allowing for the geometry of the elastic network to fluctuate and evolve with temperature. We show numerically that our previous results {{on the relationship between}} structure and thermodynamics hold in these models. We introduce an approximation where redundant constraints (highly coordinated regions where the frustration is large) are treated as an ideal gas, leading to analytical predictions that are accurate in the range of parameters relevant for real materials. Overall, these results lead to a description of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids,</b> in which the distance to the rigidity transition controls the number of directions in phase space that cost energy and the specific heat.

40|$|Breakdown of Stokes-Einstein {{relation}} in <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> {{is believed}} {{to be one of the}} hallmarks of glass transition. The phenomena is studied in depth over many years to understand the microscopic mechanism without much success. Recently it was found that violation of Stokes-Einstein relation in <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> can be tuned very systematically by pinning randomly a set of particles in their equilibrium positions. This observation suggested a possible framework where breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in the dynamics of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> can be studied with precise control. We have done extensive molecular dynamics simulations to understand this phenomena by analyzing the structure of appropriately defined set of dynamically slow and fast particles clusters. We have shown that the Stokes-Einstein breakdown actually become predominant once the cluster formed by the slow particles percolate the entire system size. Finally we proposed a possible close connection between fractal dimensions of these clusters and the exponents associated with the fractional Stokes-Einstein relation.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} two Kinetically Constrained Models of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> we {{show that}} the anomalous transport of a driven tracer observed in <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> is another facet of the phenomenon of dynamical heterogeneity. We focus on the Fredrickson-Andersen and the Bertin-Bouchaud-Lequeux models. By numerical simulations and analytical arguments we demonstrate that the violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation and the observed field-induced superdiffusion have the same physical origin: while a fraction of probes do not move, others jump repeatedly because they are close to local mobile regions.

50|$|Below the {{transition}} temperature range, the glassy structure does not relax {{in accordance with}} the cooling rate used. The expansion coefficient for the glassy state is roughly equivalent to that of the crystalline solid.

40|$|When we {{lower the}} {{temperature}} of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions {{it is possible to}} keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the <b>supercooled</b> phase. <b>Supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is {{the problem of how to}} prevent crystallization and how deeply the <b>liquid</b> can be <b>supercooled</b> before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of <b>supercooled</b> <b>liquids</b> is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order?
