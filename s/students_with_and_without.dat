Our study explored the relationship between CF and academic skills in 27 college <b>students</b> <b>with</b> (n= 10) <b>and</b> <b>without</b> (n= 17) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who completed the Conner 2 ̆ 7 s Adult ADHD Rating Scale, two tests of CF—the Cognitive Flexibility Rating Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test—and the twelve standard subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement. We hypothesized that college <b>students</b> <b>with</b> ADHD would be less cognitively flexible than their non-ADHD peers and that CF would positively correlate with academic achievement, with the strength of this relationship varying across specific academic areas. Overall, our results supported our hypotheses. Although we failed to find group differences in self-reported or objective CF, we successfully documented a significant relationship between ADHD symptomatology and CF regardless of diagnosis. Additionally, CF predicted many areas of academic achievement in our students such as reading, oral comprehension, and mathematical abilities, but not writing skills.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} a {{comparison}} of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> learning problems in Greek secondary education. In general, self-concept of students and their perceived social support {{was found to be}} of importance for achievement {{in the first years of}} secondary education. In literature, less evidence is to be found on the differential effects of these factors for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> learning problems. Based on results of two secondary schools in Athens we found significant differences between <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> learning problems in self-concept (academic, social self-concept) and perceived social support. A differential effect was found for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> learning problems and academic versus social self-concept. Literature achievement in secondary schools was predicted significantly by academic self-concept in students without learning problems, while social self-concept was the best predictor for students with learning problems. Social support did not predict literature achievement on top of self-concept in either of these two groups of students. These results suggest that educators should have in mind that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> learning problems differ in how they perceive school experiences. For the former, enhancing their social self-concept by socializing and assisting them to make strong friendships, is of crucial value on their literature achievement.

40|$|Reducing {{dropout rates}} for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> disabilities {{represents}} {{a major challenge}} for public schools. According to national statistics, students continue {{to drop out of}} school at an alarming rate, and students with disabilities are of particular concern. It is difficult to determine the precise extent of dropouts because individual schools, school districts, and State Departments of Education often use different definitional criteria and calculation methods. These disparities result in contradictory interpretations of how many students drop out of school. Nevertheless, there is consensus that many students are dropping out of school; although specific reasons for them doing so remains elusive. Finally, there is minimal research validating dropout prevention programs that decrease dropout rates for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> disabilities. ^ This purpose of this study was to survey Nebraska secondary school principals (n = 293) to examine how they calculated dropout rates, risk factors associated with students who dropout of school, and prevention strategies used to decrease dropout rates. This information was gathered for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> disabilities who drop out of school. ^ Results indicated that most principals used the event method to calculate dropout rates. Academic failure, lack of involvement in extracurricular activities, and excessive absenteeism were major predictors that influenced a student 2 ̆ 7 s decision {{to drop out of school}}. These results were the same for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> disabilities; however, the impact they had on each population was slightly different.

With {{changes in}} {{educational}} reform {{and a greater}} push toward inclusion, educators are increasingly required to provide support <b>and</b> educate <b>students</b> <b>with</b> disabilities in an inclusive general education setting. This requires that general education teachers have knowledge of special education laws and of inclusive practices, <b>and</b> collaborate <b>with</b> special education teachers to achieve an inclusive general education setting that supports <b>student</b> <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> disabilities. Research literature indicates that general education teachers view {{lack of knowledge of}} special education laws and practices, lack of knowledge and support of inclusive practices, and lack of how to collaborate effectively to be the most influential barriers to their use of successful inclusive practices. The research recommends that general education teachers receive professional development on special education laws and practices, common philosophies needed for inclusive education to be successful, and collaborative practices in order to increase educators??? knowledge and abilities to support students in a general education setting. The purpose of this project was to create a professional development series for school staff members at one elementary school in the greater Sacramento area, which would increase their understanding of inclusive and collaborative practices. This professional development included providing knowledge on the use of inclusive practices, the use of collaboration practices, and the use of interventions and accommodations, as well as providing a broader understanding of special education laws and practice. The conclusions reached after presenting the professional development series are that the general education staff needs more professional development opportunities, and continued support and time to address the need for knowledge and skills in the areas of collaboration and inclusion. Furthermore, additional research is needed to add to the literature base to determine the long term effectiveness of using professional development to mediate lack of knowledge of special education laws, and inclusive and collaborative practices.

For {{effective}} learning through reading, {{it is important to}} use reading-to-learn strategies that assist students in achieving their learning objectives. Students who are aware of this, possess highly developed metacognitive strategies and control their learning process. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> specific learning difficulties (hereinafter SLD) and deficiencies in specific learning areas (DSLA) have difficulties with their metacognitive skills, they find it harder to focus on reading-to-learn strategies in the learning process and can, as a result, be less successful than their peers. In this thesis we examined reading-to-learn strategies of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> SLD <b>and</b> compared them to their peers without SLD. This description of <b>students</b> includes <b>students</b> <b>with</b> SLD as well as <b>students</b> <b>with</b> DSLA, who have significant difficulties and are enrolled into the adapted educational program with additional professional assistance. In the introductory part, we defined specific learning strategies, identified the reading process and reading strategies, and also indicated the various modes of teaching reading strategies. In the study part, we determined the differences between the frequency of using reading strategies in <b>students</b> <b>with</b> SLD <b>and</b> <b>students</b> <b>without</b> SLD, while also comparing their views on the importance of reading strategies. We wanted to know whether the frequent use of reading-to-learn strategies has an effect on the children's academic achievement in school and if it is also linked to using various learning resources. We also looked at the frequency of using reading strategies by gender. 105 students from Year 7 in primary school were included in the study, 45 <b>with</b> SLD <b>and</b> 60 <b>without</b> SLD. We collected data via a questionnaire on learning strategies. We applied the descriptive statistical method in the statistical analysis of data, the Mann-Whitney U test and linear regression.

In the domain of mouth and tooth the girls had healthier behaviors than boys. In the domain of physical activity the boys had better health behaviors than girls, having educator or not. Conclusion: Overall, there was no significant difference between health behaviors of <b>students</b> in schools <b>with</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> health educators. Formation of healthy behaviors is a multifactorial issue and survey of all factors and variables affecting health behaviors can provide clearer measures for planning the health education programs and optimum usage of resources, manpower, budget and time to promote awareness and performance of health behaviors in schools...|$|R
