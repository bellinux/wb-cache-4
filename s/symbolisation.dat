In certain instances, the women use nudity and urinating and defecating in public as key aspects of their protest. Showing their vaginas or {{threatening}} to do so provide a unique power for the women and these tactics are quite effective in preventing troops or security forces from intervening in the protests. Historian Henry Kam Kah explains that [...] "The <b>symbolisation</b> in this threat of the vagina shows the central role of women in matters of procreation. Reverence for the vagina is reverence for the woman and her creator. A woman can lose all else but not her vagina which is representative of her entire womanhood. Women do not expose them carelessly and when this happens or threats are made to this effect, men take to their heels for they cannot abuse the part of the body that brought them to mother earth. In fact, in contemporary Cameroon, the Takembeng women of Mankon, Bamenda, used the vagina as a weapon to lend support to the Social Democratic Front (SDF) party and dispel the gun trotting [...] military men." [...] Similarly, Susan Diduk explains that “it is less that female nakedness affronts onlookers, and more that displaying female genitalia is a powerful act of moral censure embodying widely shared assumptions about mystical power and pollution.” These more direct forms of activism are not undertaken without great care being taken. Younger women are not included in these practices and are kept a good distance away from these demonstrations and soldiers and security forces are warned before they occur.|$|E

It may not be of prime importance; but in a matter like this, where all is unknown, we must take it that {{everything}} is important. I cannot think that in a matter worked out with such extraordinary scrupulosity such a thing should be overlooked. As you may see by the ground-plan of the tomb the sarcophagus stands near the north wall, with the Magic Coffer {{to the south of}} it. The space covered by the former is left quite bare of symbol or ornamentation of any kind. At the first glance this would seem to imply that the drawings had been made after the sarcophagus had been put into its place. But a more minute examination will show that the <b>symbolisation</b> on the floor is so arranged that a definite effect is produced. See, here the writings run in correct order as though they had jumped across the gap. It is only from certain effects that it becomes clear that there is a meaning of some kind. What that meaning may be is what we want to know. Look at {{the top and bottom of}} the vacant space, which lies West and East corresponding to the head and foot of the sarcophagus. In both are duplications of the same <b>symbolisation,</b> but so arranged that the parts of each one of them are integral portions of some other writing running crosswise. It is only when we get a coup d'oeil from either the head or the foot that you recognise that there are symbolisations. See! they are in triplicate at the corners and the centre of both top and bottom. In every case there is a sun cut in half by the line of the sarcophagus, as by the horizon. Close behind each of these and faced away from it, as though in some way dependent on it, is the vase which in hieroglyphic writing symbolises the heart--'Ab' the Egyptians called it. Beyond each of these again is the figure of a pair of widespread arms turned upwards from the elbow; this is the determinative of the 'Ka' or 'Double'. But its relative position is different at top and bottom. At the head of the sarcophagus the top of the 'Ka' is turned towards the mouth of the vase, but at the foot the extended arms point away from it.|$|E
6000|$|... § VI. One {{main cause}} of it, the {{necessity}} of throwing off snow in the north, has been a thousand times alluded to: another I do not remember having seen noticed, namely, that rooms in a roof are comfortably habitable in the north, which are painful sotto piombi in Italy; {{and that there is}} in wet climates a natural tendency in all men to live as high as possible, out of the damp and mist. These two causes, together with accessible quantities of good timber, have induced in the north a general steep pitch of gable, which, when rounded or squared above a tower, becomes a spire or turret; and this feature, worked out with elaborate decoration, is the key-note of the whole system of aspiration, so called, which the German critics have so ingeniously and falsely ascribed to a devotional sentiment pervading the Northern Gothic: I entirely and boldly deny the whole theory; our cathedrals were for the most part built by worldly people, who loved the world, and would have gladly staid in it for ever; whose best hope was the escaping hell, which they thought to do by building cathedrals, but who had very vague conceptions of Heaven in general, and very feeble desires respecting their entrance therein; and the form of the spired cathedral has no more intentional reference to Heaven, as distinguished from the flattened slope of the Greek pediment, than the steep gable of a Norman house has, as distinguished from the flat roof of a Syrian one. We may now, with ingenious pleasure, trace such symbolic characters in the form; we may now use it with such definite meaning; but we only prevent ourselves from all right understanding of history, by attributing much influence to these poetical symbolisms in the formation of a national style. The human race are, for the most part, not to be moved by such silken cords; and the chances of damp in the cellar, or of loose tiles in the roof, have, unhappily, much {{more to do with the}} fashions of a man's house building than his ideas of celestial happiness or angelic virtue. Associations of affection have far higher power, and forms which can be no otherwise accounted for may often be explained by reference to the natural features of the country, or to anything which habit must have rendered familiar, and therefore delightful; but the direct <b>symbolisation</b> of a sentiment is a weak motive with all men, and far more so in the practical minds of the north than among the early Christians, who were assuredly quite as heavenly-minded, when they built basilicas, or cut conchas out of the catacombs, as were ever the Norman barons or monks.|$|E
6000|$|VII. In public {{buildings}} the historical purpose should be still more definite. It {{is one of}} the advantages of Gothic architecture,--I use the word Gothic in the most extended sense as broadly opposed to classical,--that it admits of a richness of record altogether unlimited. Its minute and multitudinous sculptural decorations afford means of expressing, either symbolically or literally, all that need be known of national feeling or achievement. More decoration will, indeed, be usually required than can take so elevated a character; and much, even in the most thoughtful periods, has been left to the freedom of fancy, or suffered to consist of mere repetitions of some national bearing or symbol. It is, however, generally unwise, even in mere surface ornament, to surrender the power and privilege of variety which the spirit of Gothic architecture admits; much more in important features--capitals of columns or bosses, and string-courses, as of course in all confessed bas-reliefs. Better the rudest work that tells a story or records a fact, than the richest without meaning. There should not be a single ornament put upon great civic buildings, without some intellectual intention. Actual representation of history has in modern times been checked by a difficulty, mean indeed, but steadfast: that of unmanageable costume; nevertheless, by a sufficiently bold imaginative treatment, and frank use of symbols, all such obstacles may be vanquished; not perhaps in the degree necessary to produce sculpture in itself satisfactory, but at all events so as to enable it to become a grand and expressive element of architectural composition. Take, for example, the management of the capitals of the ducal palace at Venice. History, as such, was indeed entrusted to the painters of its interior, but every capital of its arcades was filled with meaning. The large one, the corner stone of the whole, next the entrance, was devoted to the <b>symbolisation</b> of Abstract Justice; above it is a sculpture of the Judgment of Solomon, remarkable for a beautiful subjection in its treatment to its decorative purpose. The figures, if the subject had been entirely composed of them, would have awkwardly interrupted the line of the angle, and diminished its apparent strength; and therefore in the midst of them, entirely without relation to them, and indeed actually between the executioner and interceding mother, there rises the ribbed trunk of a massy tree, which supports and continues the shaft of the angle, and whose leaves above overshadow and enrich the whole. The capital below bears among its leafage a throned figure of Justice, Trajan doing justice to the widow, Aristotle [...] "che die legge," [...] and one or two other subjects now unintelligible from decay. The capitals next in order represent the virtues and vices in succession, as preservative or destructive of national peace and power, concluding with Faith, with the inscription [...] "Fides optima in Deo est." [...] A figure is seen on the opposite side of the capital, worshipping the sun. After these, one or two capitals are fancifully decorated with birds (Plate V.), and then come a series representing, first the various fruits, then the national costumes, and then the animals of the various countries subject to Venetian rule.|$|E

The module design synthesises ideas about creativity and creative spaces, in particular Boden’s notion of creativity {{as a process of}} transforming conceptual spaces and Jankowska and Atlay’s development of purposely-designed spaces to enhance creativity in learning. A matrix of creative spaces, incorporating physical, imaginal, digital and conceptual spaces, underpinned the course activities and participants’ explorations.

The paper engages with the issues involved in presenting the diverse range of data which emerged from this inquiry, suggesting a quilting metaphor to represent the complexity. While the study focused on in-service teachers, its findings are applied to developing awareness about creativity in participants in initial teacher education programmes.

In her recent essay Körper 2. 0 the professor for cultural studies at the University of arts in Linz, Karin Harrasser, gets to the bottom of enhanced, optimised and marketed bodies that witness the symbiotic coexisting of technology and/on the human body. Karin Harrasser only at first glance seems to follow the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, who recognises these body modifications and optimisations as “anthropotechnics ” differentiated in strategies of immunisation and enhancement. Whereas the former serve the viability of deficient beings, and the latter meet a “vertical tension ” and longing for self-transformation and perfection, both interpretations of anthropotechnics for Karin Harrasser are obliged to a “too strongly modernistic ” narrative of loss (p. 11). She in contrast tries to situate current entanglements of logics of improvement, technologies and human bodies as consequences of historical, epistemological and political highly pre-conditionally dependent assemblages. By portraying two athletes, the world record holder and currently in media present Oscar Pistorius and the athlete, actress and fashion model Aimee Mullins, who both have been amputated their legs lower the knees in childhood due to a genetic malformation, Karin Harrasser illustrates her thesis: the development in anthropotechnics corporated here, exemplified by those, who the British TV broadcaster “Channel 4 ” promoted as “the Superhumans ” at the Paralympic Games in London 2012, not merely reveals an “expression of...|$|R
40|$|Although {{narration}} {{has always}} been a sort of exclusive of research and psychological intervention, only {{in the last two decades}} has the narrative method taken on an explicit, pregnant identity, putting forward a conceptual and methodological alternative which, despite obvious differences, has appeared as a ‘turning point’ in several areas of the discipline. This paper stems from a socio-constructivist epistemological paradigm that emphasises the categorial and semiotic value of the mind as well as the symbolic processes of reality construction which the actors of the social relation perform intersubjectively. Based on this perspective the paper explores the construct of narrative thought as the link between the operative, conscious functioning of the mind and its emotional, unconscious one. Starting from this hypothesis, the paper investigates the construct of narration as a symbolic process – the output of narrative thought – placed midway between the affective <b>symbolisations</b> produced by the unconscious nature of the mind and the operative categories produced by rational and scientific thought. The analysis is carried out by working on the comparison/integration of models of cultural psychology and psychodynamics. The paper and its focus on the device of narration are based on the idea that a comparison between socio-constructivism and psychodynamics could translate into an increased understanding of the symbolic dynamics of meaning construction and thus of the links that are established between subjectivity, cultural models and cultural practices and of the symbolic models which may aid their transformation. The author also believes that, in carrying out this comparison, the contribution of semiotics – viewed as a new cross-disciplinary science of sense-making processes, of the ways in which a sense is given to the world through narration – can constitute a major expansion for psychology and in particular for the connection between meaning construction processes and intervention...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} implications which digitisation bears upon scholarly film historiography. It addresses a deficit in our critical understanding of knowledge production with digital methods and their representational practices in film historical research, attending in particular data visualisations and their uses in GIS mapping, scholarly DVD editions and audiovisual essays. The research project argues {{that if we}} do not shed light on the underlying assumptions, procedures and representations of digital scholarship we risk losing our ability to critically navigate in contemporary film historiography and evaluate its results. From this point of departure, the project develops a meta-historical framework which accounts for such practices to further the critical analysis and conceptualisation of digital archive-based scholarship. To this end the dissertation contends {{that it is necessary to}} elucidate how film archives, scholarly research traditions and scientific visual analytics condition emerging digital methods and stresses that film historians need to develop strategies for reflecting the humanities’ critical, hermeneutical legacy in digital scholarship. The dissertation answers the following research questions: • How do film heritage institutions, their restoration and preservation deontologies and in particular their digitisation work, condition film historical research with digital techniques and methods? • How have digital methods travelled from other disciplines into the film historian's toolkit and which disciplinary negotiations do they undergo in this process? • How may digital tools allow for expressing reflexivity, ambiguity and multiple viewpoints in historical interpretation? To answer these questions, the dissertation’s meta-historical framework draws on theory of history, media theory and visual studies to analyse how visualisations function as <b>symbolisations</b> of historical data in digital research formats. Using the dispositif concept to combine theoretical insights from these fields, the dissertation elucidates how digital research formats amalgamate variegated techniques and imply procedural human-machinery interactions to produce graphic representations of data, interfaces and inscription devices to think with, analyse and reason from...|$|R

40|$|Museum based {{learning}} and cultural (un) consciousness What do we keep stuff for? In particular what lies behind the cultural inclination to select, collect, conserve and display objects {{and keep them}} expensively in museums for public benefit? The regional Harris Museum local to the university where I work in Preston in the North West of England {{is home to a}} permanent collection and runs temporary exhibition programmes housed in a late 19 th century building, resplendent with neo-classical portico and pediment of self-conscious grandeur, raised above the main city square on what appears from the front aspect to be a massive plinth. In fact the portico is for the birds. A side entrance allows access to human visitors via a gloomy, atrium tucked away underneath. Once inside, the museum offers a monumental setting, with rotunda and grand staircase from of four stories rising 120 feet to the lantern that surmounts the roof; the walls are embellished with stucco friezes. It is as if the visitor must be chastened and over-awed, the better to abase her before the high culture she is about to receive. Following Adorno (2002) we might consider that the import of the cultural institution lies less in its overt function than in what it reveals of societal contradictions by virtue of its own dynamic relation to the social and political context, and the public it ostensibly serves. This changes over time and in its current form The Harris has become a site of struggle between modernisers who want to put culture at the heart of local regeneration, so transforming the museum into a civic hub, and conservationists who hope to preserve an emblem of Victorian civic pride intact for the edification of future citizens. In the febrile political climate of Brexit, the museum is also enmeshed in tensions between cosmopolitanism and provincial retranchement, and between sentimental nostalgia and the manic optimism of populism. There is much in museum curation and education, as well, as in the contents of institutions such as The Harris that enables us to reflect on what we unconsciously value as a society, what we repudiate, and how these change through processes which at the time are themselves socially unconscious. I became interested in how cultural institutions relate to their publics, when {{it occurred to me that}} part of what they do is offer a space for the contemplation of what we might tacitly know, but have not yet conceived – or what we might call the ‘unthought knowns’ of cultural life (Bollas 1987). The function of the museum is as much to hold the line against a collective forgetting through memorialization (Mack 2003) as it is a repository for the evolving symbolic life of city, region or nation. Museum collections may literally ‘hold’ tacit or disavowed cultural knowledge until there is an interpretive community ready and willing to receive it. Such is arguably the case with historical records of slavery or the subjugation of aboriginal peoples. Over time, and in the particular quality of setting the museum can provide, we encounter objects that stimulate associations, thoughts and feelings whereby the unthought known can find symbolic form in material culture and be recognized. In this respect the educational function of the museum is not so much to inform us of culture as to hold up a mirror to it so that, as Winnicott (1971) would have put it, each generation discovers for themselves what is there to be found. As individuals when we visit a museum we encounter an array of objects into which we can project self states and aspects of our habitual relations to people and things. They may become objects of identification and identity formation (Newman and Maclean 2006). They may also offer an aesthetic third (Froggett and Trustram 2014) around which we can elaborate new <b>symbolisations.</b> In this article, rather than approach the knowing and learning that takes place in museums from the field of museology, I take a psycho-societal perspective drawing on a psychoanalytically informed tradition of thinking on culture from British and Continental traditions that converges on the problem of our relation to the sensible world. The question of interest here is how what is socially unconscious, or in the hinterland of consciousness, can be apprehended through the collections that a museum houses. Museology in general has been more concerned with what we can ‘see’ than with what is ‘hidden’, although the accent on visual display has begun to change as the ‘post-museum’ seeks out new opportunities for encounter and communication with its audiences (Barrett 2011). This opens the door to a psycho-societal perspective that asks what emerges in the space of interaction between museum going publics, the museum contents (including its personnel), and the society on whose behalf this work is done. I shall give an example of the interpretive potentials of material objects followed by a brief overview of the educational function of the museum in its instructional and interactive modes. This will help to clarify the museum’s epistemic role (Born & Barry 2010, Muller et al 2006, Miettinen and Virkkunen 2005) in enabling an interaction with its objects that produces reflexive cultural knowledge...|$|R
