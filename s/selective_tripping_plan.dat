The objective {{of this study was}} twofold: (1) to develop a model to determine the effect of personalized information provision through smartphones on user ability to <b>plan</b> multi-destination <b>trips,</b> and (2) to understand user perception of riding public transport aided by real-time, multi-destination trip-planning smartphone applications. Auckland Pioneer was developed for multi-destination <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> and integrates real-time public transport services with search functions for places of interest. A test trial was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand, and the findings show the effects of the application on multi-destination <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> in comparison to traditional information sources such as Google Transit. This research contributes to existing literature by demonstrating the importance of personalized information en-route for user multi-destination <b>trip</b> <b>planning.</b> With information to assist <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> and provide step-by-step guidance en-route, users tend to feel more confident to ride public transport...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{planning}} {{research has}} been fundamentally transformed by the advancement of spatial cyberinfrastructure (CI) and other planning information technologies. This is no better exemplified than by the evolution of online transit <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems. This paper describes the progression of online transit <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems {{as a result of}} innovations in cyberinfrastructure, from the perspective of ontology, middleware-based system interoperability and service-oriented design. Online transit <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems are widely used by transit agencies to disseminate transit scheduling, routing and itinerary information, in order to help transit users to make better informed decisions. It can not only improve customer service, but also could attract new transit riders, particularly young riders who are primarily technologically savvy, therefore increasing transit ridership numbers. The online transit <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems have evolved as web technology and CI continue to advance, from the initial proprietary system to open and interoperable systems, and from independent systems for each single transit agency, to an inter-dependent inter-jurisdictional system. The initial transit <b>trip</b> itinerary <b>planning</b> systems were develope...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Trip {{planning}} is among important and complex problems in tourism industry. <b>Trip</b> <b>plan</b> preparation requires data analyzing from {{a substantial number}} of services. Usually, service or standalone application provides limited functionality, which can be used only in trip preparation and for basic scenarios. This paper provides an approach to creating Smart Space-based <b>Trip</b> <b>planning</b> service. The Smart Space technology allows to create proactive services with context-based scenarios and multi-service usage. The paper describes <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> problem as a list of possible tasks and presents mathematical model for common task. The presented approach includes high-level architecture of Smart Space-based service, scenarios usage and possible data sources from existing third party services and used algorithms for data transformation.

The goal of the study presented in this paper was to apply the decision-making style instrument to the context of advance <b>trip</b> <b>planning.</b> The results suggest that an intuitive decision-making style influences the extent of <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> while a spontaneous style influences the length of the advance planning period; however, the relationships found were not very strong. Also, no significant relationships were found for dependent decision-making style, lack of innovativeness and sensation seeking. The findings indicate that decision-making styles are less influential with respect to advance <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> than expected.

40|$|Travel {{and tourism}} {{activities}} and <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> decisions involving the interoperability complexities and interdependencies introduced by inter-modal and interurban transportation networks constitute an ample opportunity area for deploying the state-of-the-art mobile Internet technologies. It {{is becoming increasingly}} necessary to provide travelers with real-time information {{to assist them in}} preplanning or replanning their transport and travel activities or particular trip elements during their trip, while being on the move. <b>Trip</b> <b>planning</b> decisions, either before or during the trip realization constitute a derived demand, pushed by demand for tourism activities. However, they represent the most critical chain of the decision-making process {{on the grounds that they}} eventually determine the feasibility and the realization of the whole travel activity. From a different perspective, terminal operators, regional authorities, and other transport and tourism organizations show a vast interest and actively pursue alternative ways of dealing with the requirements of the demand for travel and tourism services. An integrated system providing value added logistical services related to travel and tourism, the World in your H@nds on the Move-WH@M system, has been implemented to support and optimize the <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> process. A study had three objectives: to discuss the way that intermodality can be supported by such a technological application; to present the architecture, operations, and the solution approach governing the <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> modules; and to provide a brief demonstration of the relevant <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> modules of the system...|$|R
40|$|Ad-hoc shared-ride <b>trip</b> <b>{{planning}}</b> is {{a planning}} task on a non-deterministic transportation network. We propose {{to solve this}} task in a mobile geosensor network, which consists of transportation clients and hosts. In a mobile geosensor network the communication costs are a critical factor. <b>Trip</b> <b>planning</b> agents need communication to collect knowledge about the current network, and any way to limit this need reduces the costs of a solution. This paper introduces a theoretical model based on time geography, where clients, as <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> agents, can actively identify relevant transportation hosts before communication starts, and hosts can identify whether their route is relevant for a specific planning task before responding to any request. This model reduces the communication costs significantly, which is at first derived theoretically, and then confirmed by an example. 1...|$|R
40|$|This report reviews current {{information}} provision in all modes of transport and assesses the needs for {{and benefits of}} <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems. The feasibility of <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems is discussed given {{the current state of}} technology and information availability and supply. The review was stimulated by technological developments in telecommunications and information technology which are providing the possibility of a greatly enhanced quality of information to aid <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> decisions. Amongst the conclusions reached were the following: Current {{information provision}} is considered deficient in many respects. Travellers are often unaware of alternative routes or services and many are unable to acquire adequate information from one source especially for multi-modal journeys. In addition, {{there is a lack of}} providing real time information where it is required (bus stops and train stations) and of effective interaction of static and real time information. Most of the projects, which integrate static and dynamic data, are single mode systems. Therefore there is a need for an integrated <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> system which can inform and guide on all aspects of transport. <b>Trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems can provide assistance in <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> (before and during the journey) using one or a number of modes of travel, taking into account travellers preferences and constraints, and effectively integrating static and dynamic data. <b>Trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems could adversely affect traffic demand as people who become aware of new opportunities might be encouraged to make more journeys. It could also affect travellers choice as a result of over-saturation of information, over-reaction to predictive information, and concentration on the same 'best' routes. However, it can be argued, based on existing evidence, that such a system can benefit travellers, and transport operators as well as the public sector responsible for executing transport policies. Travellers can benefit by obtaining adequate information to help them in making optimal decisions and reducing uncertainty and stress associated with travel. Public transport operators can benefit by making their services known to customers, leading to increased patronage. Public transport authorities can use the supply of information to execute their transport policies and exercise more control over traffic management...|$|R

40|$|An {{object model}} of {{multi-modal}} transport networks is developed with {{particular emphasis on}} applications in <b>trip</b> <b>planning.</b> The model caters for {{both public and private}} transport modes, and incorporates spatial and temporal data.

The multi-modal network is spatially ordered using a quadtree storage object for efficient storage and access. Introduction <b>Trip</b> <b>planning</b> systems can be defined as systems for assisting travellers or potential travellers with all aspects of their journeys including decisions on such issues as how to travel, when to travel and what route or routes to travel on. Travel decisions may be based on static information such as physical transport networks and public transport timetables, and dynamic information such as data on delays, congestion and cancellations.

40|$|The {{rail freight}} carload service segment enables the {{distribution}} of freight volumes down to the unit of single rail cars, and stand as an important alternative to road transportation. However, this service segment {{is often associated with}} significant uncertainties and variations in daily freight volumes. Such uncertainties are challenging to manage since operating plans generally are established long in advance of operations. Flexibility can instead be found in the way <b>trip</b> <b>plans</b> are generated. Previous research has shown that a commonly used <b>trip</b> <b>plan</b> generation policy does not exploit the available flexibility to the full extent. In this paper, we therefore suggest an optimization-based freight routing and scheduling (OFRS) policy to address the rail freight <b>trip</b> <b>plan</b> generation problem. This OFRS-policy generates <b>trip</b> <b>plans</b> for rail cars while still restricted by the customer commitments. The policy involves a MIP formulation with a continuous time representation and is solved by commercial software. We apply the OFRS-policy on a case built on real data provided by the Swedish rail freight operator, Green Cargo, and assess the performance of the policy comparing the current industry practice. The results show that by using the OFRS policy, we can achieve a reduction in the total transportation times, number of shunting activities and potentially also a reduction in the service frequency given the considered transport demand.

40|$|<b>Trip</b> <b>planning</b> and {{in-vehicle}} navigation {{are crucial}} tasks for easier and safer driving. The existing navigation systems {{are based on}} machine intelligence without allowing human knowledge incorporation. These systems give turn guidance with abstract visual instruction and have not reached the potential of minimizing driver’s cognitive load, which {{is the amount of}} mental processing power required. In this paper, we describe the development of a multimedia system that makes driving and navigation safer and easier by offering tools for route sharing in <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> and video-based route guidance during driving. The system provides a multimodal interface for a user to share his/her route with others by drawing on a digital map, naturally incorporating human knowledge into the <b>trip</b> <b>planning</b> process. The system gives driving instructions by overlaying navigational arrows onto live video and providing synthesized voice to reduce the driver’s cognitive load, in addition to presenting landmark images for key maneuvers. We describe our observations which had motivated the development of the system, detailed architecture and user interfaces, and finally discuss our initial test findings in the real-road driving context. 1...|$|R
