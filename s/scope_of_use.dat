Therefore, this article analyzes the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> this form <b>of</b> promotion in the period that preceded the 2012 European Football Championship.

On the Polish market, owners of many brands performed actions that aimed at “stealing ” image effects which should be achieved only by official sponsors who support such huge tournament (which is considered {{to be one of the}} three greatest sports events all around the world – apart from the Summer Olympic Games and the Football World Cup). The article has two objectives. First, it describes a concept of promoting selected brands (based on relation to the EURO 2012), identifying the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> ambush marketing forms in relation to Polish consumers.

50|$|Further, in the United States, {{searches}} and arrests {{must be made}} on grounds of reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. This means that officers {{must be able to}} “point to specific and articulable facts” that “warrant the intrusion”, or make a predictive judgment that the person is in possession of an item that related to the commission of an offence. Similar protections, though not constitutionally based, exist in Australia, as well as the UK. The latter was confirmed as binding by the European Court of Human Rights on a number of European nations, which includes civil law states. The ability to formulate such “reasonable suspicion” on the basis of big data algorithms is controversial, with some critics arguing that in the absence of active police corroboration of predictive forecasts, there are insufficient grounds to warrant an arrest. Further, the general nature of predictive forecasts is arguably incompatible with the acceptable standards outlined by the United States Supreme Court with respect to specific individuals. Patterns of crime generated through data analytics are unlikely to generate the level of accurate predictive detail required for police officers to effect an arrest, when compared to informed tip offs. While in the US, courts have allowed profiling to be used in stopping and searching persons in the right context, notable judicial dissents and academic research highlight that profiling lacks probative value. In the UK, a House of Lords Report recommended that such technology be prohibited from use by local authorities, unless they were tied to the investigation of serious criminal offenses. In addition, a major factor in Europe is that predictive policing technology must be exercised in accordance with legislation that is sufficiently clear on the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> (foreseeability) and affords persons adequate legal protection from arbitrary uses of predictive data algorithms.|$|E
