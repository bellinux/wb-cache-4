The spear would be thrown at the opponent, after which the <b>soldier</b> <b>would</b> attack with his sword.|$|R

Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe issued a proclamation, reciting the riot act and ordering the crowds to disperse, but to no effect. He later sent correspondence to the governor, asking that the garrison not be taken from the city given {{the current state of}} affairs.

5|$|The {{rejection}} of their protest greatly upset the German forces, {{because they believed}} they were treated unjustly in the war. Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats that they would punish all captured American soldiers that {{were found to be}} armed with a shotgun. This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> lead to an equal act by the United States on captured German soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Through {{a mutual}} {{reflection}} on their past, it is revealed that Sarah and Andrew were on holiday {{at the time}} of their meeting with Little Bee. The trip was an attempt to salvage their marriage after Andrew discovered Sarah had been unfaithful to him, embarking on an affair with Home Office employee Lawrence Osborn. While walking on the beach one morning, they were approached by a then 14-year-old Little Bee, and her older sister Nkiruka. The girls were being pursued by soldiers who had burned down their village and intended for there to be no witnesses left alive. The soldiers arrived and murdered a guard from the O'Rourkes' hotel, but offered to spare the lives of the girls if Andrew would amputate his own middle finger with a machete. Afraid, and believing the <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> murder the girls anyway, Andrew refused, but Sarah complied in his place. The soldiers took both girls away, leaving the couple in doubt as to whether the <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> leave one girl alive in response, as they promised.|$|E
5|$|With the {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, designed to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower due to wars against Jugurtha, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Now <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as heavy infantry with the same, state purchased equipment.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E

5|$|The British Army {{negotiated}} {{the release of}} six of the eleven men on the patrol, but {{were not able to}} gain the freedom of their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer and the other men before the West Side Boys' demands became increasingly unrealistic. Negotiators concluded that these were delaying tactics rather than an effort to resolve the crisis; by 9 September, the soldiers had been held for over a fortnight. Fearing that the <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> be killed or moved to a location from which it would be more difficult to extract them, the British government authorised an assault on the West Side Boys' base, to take place at dawn the following day, 10 September.|$|E
5|$|The Franciscan friar Jacobo de Testera {{arrived in}} Champoton in 1535 to attempt the {{peaceful}} incorporation of Yucatán into the Spanish Empire. Testera had been assured by the Spanish authorities that no military activity would be undertaken in Yucatán, {{while he was}} attempting its conversion to the Roman Catholic faith, and that no <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> be permitted to enter the peninsula. His initial efforts were proving successful when Captain Lorenzo de Godoy arrived in Champoton at the command of soldiers despatched there by Montejo the Younger. Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champoton and return to central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|With {{the formal}} {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Instead, it was decreed that <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> join the legion as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as medium infantry with the same state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.|$|E
5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory {{was not simply a}} matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money in one of two outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{minister}} of war Matías de Irigoyen ordered once more {{the return of the}} Army of the Andes, and appointed Francisco Fernández de la Cruz as its leader, displacing San Martín. San Martín resigned again, and observed that the Army {{would not be able to}} cross the Andes from Chile to Buenos Aires because the winter snow was blocking the trails. All the leaders of the military units of the Army of the Andes refused to go to Buenos Aires, as their <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> mutiny or desert. Facing both the resignation of San Martín and the refusals to obey the orders, the Supreme Director canceled the orders, and the Army of the Andes stayed in Chile. With the sanction of the Argentine Constitution of 1819, Pueyrredón ended his mandate as Supreme Director, replaced by José Rondeau.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Khrushchev {{was on the}} Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko {{proposed}} a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved {{only part of the}} plan, but 640,000Red Army <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000soldiers, including more than 200,000men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 20 June, two armed Protestant corps coming from Montbéliard and Neuchâtel were {{travelling}} to Besançon. However, some of the troops from the Neuchâtel group decided to abandon the battle, as their request for extra pay had been denied. The other soldiers continued upstream. The remaining soldiers from Neuchâtel {{got into a fight}} with the inhabitants of Morteau; after a fierce battle, they were forced to retreat. After waiting for the group from Neuchâtel, which could not be found, Capitaine Paul de Beaujeu decided to continue with the plan. By midnight, the soldiers had reached Palente, and they hid in the forests of Chalezeule while establishing a plan of attack. With the help of a dozen small boats laid end-to-end, the soldiers crossed the Doubs. To continue the attack, the <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> need the help of the townspeople.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation, {{and ordered}} the military to control the crowd and enforce {{the resolution of the}} previous day. The commanders pointed out that if they did so, their <b>soldiers</b> <b>would</b> mutiny. As the demonstration overran some sections of the cabildo, Cisneros' resignation was finally accepted. The members of the new Junta were the result of a document with hundreds of signatures, drafted among the people in the plaza. Cornelio Saavedra was the president of this Junta. He rejected this at first, fearing that he may be suspected of promoting the revolution for personal interest, but finally accepted at Cisneros' request. As the Junta was established on May 25, the other cities were invited to send deputies to a constituent assembly to discuss the type of government; on May 27, they were invited to send deputies to join the Junta. Both invitations were contradictory, but the consequences would take place some months later.|$|E
