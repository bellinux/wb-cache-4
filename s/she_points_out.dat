5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E
5|$|Some {{surviving}} stories regarding Iðunn {{focus on}} her youth-maintaining apples. English scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} 9th-century Oseberg ship burial site in Norway and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe which may have had a symbolic meaning and also that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in Southwest England.|$|E
5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
60|$|The shed was reached, and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the spars. Winterborne {{regarded}} them silently, {{then looked}} at her.|$|R
60|$|She {{was much}} {{interested}} in the women who surrounded them in the stalls. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to Philip those who were painted and those who wore false hair.|$|R
5000|$|Date Masamune's young aunt, {{even she}} hates being call that, and {{is afraid of}} ghosts. She shares the same name as Ashikaga Yoshiteru's daughter, Yoshiaki (which <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out).</b>|$|R
5|$|Desperate to {{save his}} brother, Dean sells his soul to a Crossroads Demon (Ona Grauer) in {{exchange}} for Sam's resurrection, and is given only one year before collection is due. They later conduct research at Bobby's home, hoping to determine Azazel's plan. Ellen Harvelle (Samantha Ferris), owner of the now-destroyed Roadhouse, then arrives, and is forced to drink holy water to prove {{that she is not}} possessed by a demon. After giving them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> five X's that have been marked, representing frontier churches built by Samuel Colt—hunter and creator of the mystical Colt, a gun capable of killing anything. Research also shows that railway lines connect all the churches {{in the form of a}} pentagram, creating a giant devil's trap that demons cannot enter.|$|E
5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{attitude}} angers Nancy. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> {{that life}} is short. She threatens to have adventures on her own. Charlie's attitude changes after Nancy's outburst, and she retreats from her plan a bit. She is content to enjoy the moment.|$|E

60|$|Arthur {{looked at}} the man <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out.</b> He was a small person, with a pate as shining as a billiard-ball, and a pointed beard. He had protruding, {{brilliant}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|For answer <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{over the}} desert. Far away, {{miles on the}} other side of the scene of the fight, a small body of men were riding towards them.|$|R
25|$|Ludwig and {{the court}} spring out at them, dancing a lively can-can. The Princess is shocked and upset when she discovers that Ludwig already has three Grand Duchesses. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> however, that her claim predates the others', and Ludwig is {{therefore}} obliged to marry her.|$|E
25|$|The actions moves {{ahead to}} 1989, where Selena y Los Dinos {{are playing a}} concert at a fair. Abraham is shocked when Selena peels off her jacket and {{performs}} in a beaded bra. He confronts Selena on the band's bus, but <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that her mother helped her make it, and that other fashionable female musicians such as Madonna and Janet Jackson are wearing bustiers too. Abraham relents, and Selena begins to design {{more and more of}} her band's attire.|$|E
25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that {{the quickest way to}} get more male warriors would have been to have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E
50|$|In an old interview, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that <b>she</b> {{has split}} {{broadcast}} personalities - TobeDaDiva and Tobe Nneji, the ‘’serious-minded one who casts {{the news and}} handles current affairs and politics”.|$|R

25|$|Lois {{hands her}} exposé {{in and the}} {{government}} is after her for treason. With agents on her tail, she makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the Daily Planet under cover of night and explains all to Perry. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the Daily Planet, as Lois gets her edge back. It was later revealed she never really quit the Daily Planet.|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{of racism}} and {{segregation}} also permeate the episode. Sara Gwenllian-Jones in her book Cult Television argues that, throughout the entry, [...] "the blacks are equated with aliens," [...] turning them into {{a certain type of}} [...] "other" [...] that is [...] "never allowed to fit in or feel safe". Gwenllian-Jones highlights the scene in which Dales, late one night on the team bus, wakes to see Exley's sleeping body being reflected as an alien in a window {{as an example of the}} racial comparison. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that, despite coming to Earth, Exley has moved from one segregated society—that of the aliens—into another. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that Exley, after revealing his true form to Dales, says that [...] "my people guard their privacy zealously. They don't want our people to intermingle with your people". This quote expresses a similar sentiment to the segregated mentality of the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Isabella Acres as Rose Crisp: Rose is Ted's preteen daughter. She {{attends the}} Veridian Dynamics daycare program when her nanny is not available, but prefers {{to stay at}} home. According to Ted, [...] "her mom ran off to Africa to go save the world." [...] She is often the voice of reason on the show. When Ted talks with her about work <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> the terrible choices the company makes, and often helps Ted focus on {{what needs to be}} done to set things straight. She attends Eugene Debs Elementary School.|$|E
2500|$|B Häcker, ‘Rescission of Contract and Revesting of Title: A Reply to Mr Swadling’ [...] RLR 106, {{responds}} to Swadling's argument. <b>She</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> flaws in Swadling's (1) historical analysis; and (2) conceptual analysis.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, the {{gangways}} {{are going}} down," [...] <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out.</b> [...] "I can see {{many of my}} friends waiting. Remember, with your new life begins our new alliance. Good luck to you, dear friend!" ...|$|R

500|$|Christopher Ondaatje {{writes in}} The Independent that the {{existence}} of a Hemingway industry tends to overshadow his posthumous work. He considers Hemingway's African stories to be among his best although the posthumous work about Africa has been disregarded or overlooked. In her piece for Nation, [...] Brenda Wineapple describes the book as [...] "poignant but not particularly good". However, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that it [...] "reminds us of Hemingway's writing at its most touching, acute and beautiful best". The review in Publishers Weekly is much the same saying the [...] "old Hemingway magic flashes sporadically, like lightning, but not often enough".|$|E
500|$|Kutzer {{thinks the}} two sequels {{not up to}} Potter's usual {{narrative}} standards because both sprang from a public demand for more [...] "bunny books" [...] rather than from any desire on Potter's part to continue the rabbit stories. Neither of the tales spoke to Potter emotionally {{in the manner of}} Peter Rabbit, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> and speculates that Potter associated rabbits with the less than happy life she passed in her parents' London home. Kutzer believes that once Potter gained a life of her own and freed herself from domineering parents, she was reluctant to return to material which evoked unpleasant memories.|$|E
500|$|Lu Caixia, a {{researcher}} at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, states in the newsletter of the International Institute for Asian Studies, Leiden, Netherlands, that “the excavation of the Belitung has been acknowledged as an admirable example of what can be achieved under difficult conditions in Southeast Asia.” <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that unlike some other commercial operators, Walterfang’s company ensured that “the ship structure itself was properly recorded, the cargo was kept together rather than dispersed, and the finds were well conserved, studied, catalogued, and published." [...] Lu ends by highlighting the efficacy of the public-private arrangement: “It is difficult to imagine how this particular project could have been financed or organized without commercial involvement.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Professor Ethel Johnson {{worked with}} bishop Dabale for years, {{and helped him}} {{organized}} UMCN into a conference. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "church has really, really grown, and this has primarily been due to Bishop Dabale’s leadership." ...|$|R
5000|$|... (**) Bianca Kappler {{was awarded}} joint bronze medal as final jump was {{incorrectly}} measured. The jump was misread, putting her in first place, but <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the mistake and {{was awarded the}} medal for fair play.|$|R
25|$|Germain {{published}} her prize-winning essay at her {{own expense}} in 1821, mostly {{because she wanted to}} present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> some of the errors in her method.|$|R
500|$|Feature films made in {{the west}} during the war were subject to {{censorship}} and were not always realistic. One {{of the first to}} attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for [...] "gritty realism", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the [...] "worst image for stark violence" [...] when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.|$|E
500|$|In {{many ways}} the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world, as is its direct {{predecessor}} the Rights of Men. Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the [...] "most natural state". She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, {{were associated with the}} middle class. From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> the [...] "false-refinement, immorality, and vanity" [...] of the rich, calling them [...] "weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [...] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society".|$|E
500|$|Mercury informs Thespis {{that the}} {{substitute}} gods have received many complaints from mortals because {{some are not}} performing their functions, and others' ill-judged experiments have wreaked havoc in the world below. [...] For instance, Timidon, the replacement for Mars, is a pacifist and a coward; the substitute for Hymen refuses to marry anyone; and the ersatz Pluto is too tenderhearted to let anyone die. [...] Daphne, who plays the muse Calliope, comes to Thespis and claims, based on a bowdlerised edition of the Greek myths, that Calliope was married to Apollo. [...] <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that Apollo, played by Sparkeion, is the brother of Diana (played by Sparkeion's wife, Nicemis). [...] Thespis decides that Sparkeion is married to Daphne while they are gods, but his marriage to Nicemis will resume when they are mortals once again.|$|E
5000|$|Women's {{activist and}} CPM party leader Kavita Krishnan termed {{the killing of}} Burhan Wani an [...] "extrajudicial killing." [...] <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the Supreme Court decree that {{required}} every single encounter {{to be followed by}} a FIR and a magisterial enquiry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so? Well, she did not, neither did I. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{that this was}} her trouble. Among the great of the earth she knew no such man, and, if she sought lower, then would come jealousies and war." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{where the}} boat must come in; and thither the Earl {{directed}} his steps, {{feeling as if}} he were going to place himself under a nutmeg-grater, as he thought how James Frost would receive the implied distrust of his guardianship.|$|R
