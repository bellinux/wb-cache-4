5|$|An oak made pulpit <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choir {{facing the}} nave. It {{originated}} {{in the north of}} France, probably in the mid-1500s.

It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution.

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judges {{for as long as}} he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Ion Heliade Rădulescu, sculpted by the Italian artist Ettore Ferrari, <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University building in central Bucharest. In addition to naming a lecture room after him, the Romanian Academy has instituted the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award—in 1880, it {{was awarded to}} Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, for his Cuvinte den bătrâni, and worth 5,000 gold lei. Ten years after, the prize {{was the center of}} a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the National Liberal Party, including Hasdeu and Dimitrie Sturdza. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal stance and his association with Junimea, as well as to his anti-nationalism, dislike of didacticism, and alleged cosmopolitanism. They thus refused to grant him the prize.|$|E
5|$|The video then cuts {{to a shot}} of {{the band}} playing the game before {{returning}} to the map screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes. The second level begins {{in much the same way}} as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right. The villain again <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players, laughing before disappearing. A boat/submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{buildings}} {{have been named}} in Robinson's honor. The UCLA Bruins baseball team plays in Jackie Robinson Stadium, which, because of the efforts of Jackie's brother Mack, features a memorial statue of Robinson by sculptor Richard H. Ellis. The stadium also unveiled a new mural of Robinson by Mike Sullivan on April 14, 2013. City Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach, Florida was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark in 1990 and a statue of Robinson with two children <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ballpark. His wife Rachel was present for the dedication on September 15. 1990. A number of facilities at Pasadena City College (successor to PJC) are named in Robinson's honor, including Robinson Field, a football/soccer/track facility named jointly for Robinson and his brother Mack. The New York Public School system has named a middle school after Robinson, and Dorsey High School plays at a Los Angeles football stadium named after him. In 1976, his home in Brooklyn, the Jackie Robinson House, was declared a National Historic Landmark. Brooklyn residents want to turn his home into a city landmark. Robinson also has an asteroid named after him, 4319 Jackierobinson. In 1997, the United States Mint issued a Jackie Robinson commemorative silver dollar, and five-dollar gold coin. That same year, New York City renamed the Interboro Parkway in his honor.|$|E
