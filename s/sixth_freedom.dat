50|$|The {{unofficial}} <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> {{combines the}} third and fourth freedoms and is the right to carry passengers or cargo from a second country to a third country by stopping in one's own country. It can also be characterized as a form of the fifth freedom with an intermediate stop in the operating airline's home market. This characterization is often invoked as protectionist policy as the traffic, like fifth freedom traffic, is secondary in nature to third and fourth freedom traffic. Consequently, some nations seek to regulate <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic as though it were fifth freedom traffic. China {{is an example of a}} country that restricts <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic from third party countries. Specifically, it is difficult for airlines to obtain permission from China to serve the country via codeshare flights from intermediate countries.|$|E

50|$|Fifth freedom {{traffic rights}} are sought by {{airlines}} wishing {{to take up}} unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the second freedom. Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth freedom traffic {{as a way of}} promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing traffic rights too much in order to protect a flag carrier's commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth freedom traffic rights stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers' service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous with regard to granting fifth freedom traffic rights, while <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic has grown in importance for Asian airlines.|$|E
50|$|The Japan-United States {{bilateral}} {{air transport}} agreement of 1952 {{has been viewed}} as being particularly contentious, because unlimited fifth freedom traffic rights have been granted to designated US air carriers serving destinations in the Asia Pacific region west of Japan. For example, in the early 1990s, the Japanese government's refusal to permit flights on the New York City—Osaka—Sydney route led to protests by the US government and the airlines that applied to serve that route. The Japanese government countered that about 10% of the traffic on the Japan - Australia sector was third and fourth freedom traffic {{to and from the}} US, while the bilateral agreement specified that primary justification for unlimited fifth freedom traffic was to fill up aircraft carrying a majority of US-originated or US-destined traffic under third and fourth freedom rights. Japan had held many unused fifth freedom traffic rights beyond the USA. However, these were seen as being less valuable than the fifth freedom traffic rights enjoyed by US air carriers via Japan, because of the higher operating costs of Japanese airlines and geographical circumstances. Japan serves as a useful gateway to Asia for North American travelers. The US contended that Japan's favourable geographical location and its flag airlines' carriage of a sizeable volume of <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic via gateway cities in Japan helped to level the playing field. In 1995, the air transport agreement was updated by way of liberalizing Japanese carriers' access to US destinations, while placing selected restrictions on US air carriers.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{hub-and-spoke}} network configurations {{are more and}} more developed in the Asia/Pacific region. In this paper, it is argued that the measurement of network performance in hub-and-spoke systems should take into account {{the quantity and quality of}} both direct and indirect connections. The NetScan Model, which quantifies an indirect connection and scales it into a theoretical direct connection, is applied to analyze the competitive position of airports or airlines in an integrated way. Measuring and comparing the network performance and the hub connectivity potential of selected seventeen primary airports in the Asia/Pacific region between 2001 and 2007 will be elaborated in this paper. The results revealed that Tokyo/Narita has the largest network performance and hub connectivity potential. The most striking growth of network developments can be found at Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The number of both direct and indirect/onward connectivity at these airports increased at a much higher rate between these years than at other airports. On the contrary, Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland experienced deteriorating network performance. This region also showed stronger position of One World and Star Alliance.

40|$|Human {{well-being}} {{has several}} key components: the basic material needs {{for a good}} life, freedom and choice, health, good social relations, and personal security. Well-being exists on a continuum with poverty, which has been defined as"pronounced deprivation in well-being. " ■ How well-being and ill-being, or poverty, are expressed and experienced is context- and situation-dependent, reflecting local social and personal factors such as geography, ecology, age, gender,and culture. These concepts are complex and value-laden. ■ Ecosystems are essential for human well-being through their provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Evidence in recent decades of escalating human impacts. on ecological systems worldwide raises concerns {{about the consequences of}} ecosystem changes for human well-being. ■ Human well-being can be enhanced through sustainable human interaction with ecosystems with the support of appropriate instruments, institutions, organizations, and technology. creation of these through participation and transparency may contribute to people 2 ̆ 7 s freedoms and choices and to increased economic, social,and ecological security. ■ Some believe that the problems from the depletion and degradation of ecological capital can be largely overcome by the substitution of physical and human capital. Others believe that there are more significant limits to such substitutions. The scope for substitutions varies by socioeconomic status. ■ We identify direct and indirect pathways between ecosystem change and human well-being,whether it be positive or negative. lndirect effects are characterized by more complex webs of causation, involving social, economic, and political threads. Threshold points exist beyond which rapid changes to human well-being can occur. ■ Indigent poorly resourced, and otherwise disadvantaged communities are generally the most vulnerable to adverse ecosystem change. Spirals, both positive and negative, can occur for any population, but the poor are more vulnerable.        ■ Functioning institutions are vital to enable equitable access to ecosystem services. lnstitutions sometimes fail or remain undeveloped because of powerful individuals or groups. Bodies that mediate the distribution of goods and services may also be appropriated for the benefit of powerful minorities. ■ For poor people, the greatest gains in well-being will occur through more equitable and secure access to ecosystem services. In the long run, the rich can contribute greatly to human well-being by reducing their substantial impacts on ecosystems and by facilitating greater access to ecosystem services by the poor. ■ We argue ecological security warrants recognition as a <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> of equal weight with participative freedom, economic   facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. <br /...|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} {{that so far}} has received relatively little attention in the germane literature {{is that of the}} changes at various airports {{as a result of the}} EU liberalization policies. That is, presently, most major European airports still benefit from the so-called home-carrier phenomenon where the country's publicly or semi-publicly owned carrier uses the country's main airport as its gateway hub and, consequently, the home-carrier is also the principal user of this airport (in terms of proportion of total aircraft movements, number of passengers transported, connections, slots ownership, etc.). The country's main airport has substantially benefited from these monopoly conditions of airline captivity, strongly determined by the bilateral system of international air transport regulation. Therefore, European major airports were used to operate in essentially different markets, compared to the increasingly competitive markets of their home based carriers. This partly explains relative stability of transport volumes and financial results of European major airports compared to the relatively volatile financial results of most European national airlines. However, the liberalization of European aviation is likely to change this situation. Market access is open now to all community carriers, i. e. carriers with majority ownership and effective control in the hands of EU citizens. Ticket prices are free, governments can only intervene in case of dumping or excessive pricing. A community airline can choose its seat in any of the 15 member states. Licensing procedures are harmonized between member states. In the last few months community carriers have had unrestricted route access within the EU. Most probably this development will be extended to countries inside and outside Europe. Last year the European Commission got the mandate to start negotiations with 10 other European countries. In the meantime the EC has also started negotiations with the USA on so-called soft rights. In the meantime, open skies agreements have been concluded between the USA and most of the EU member states to facilitate strategic alliances between airlines of the states involved. As a result of this on-going liberalization the model of the single 'national' carrier using the national home base as its single hub for the designated third, fourth and <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> operations will stepwise disappear. Within the EU the concept of the national carrier has already been replaced by that of the community carrier. State ownership in more and more European carriers is reduced. On the longer run mergers or even bankruptcy will further undermine the "single national carrier - single national hub" model in Europe. In the meantime, strategic alliances between national carriers in Europe will already reduce the airlines' loyalty to a single airport. Profit maximization and accountability to share holders will supersede the loyalty of these newly emerging alliances, probably looking for the opportunities of a multiple hub network to adequately cover the whole European market. As a consequence, some European airports might see a substantial decline in arriving, departing and transfer traffic, thus in revenues and financial solvency, as well as in their connection to other inter-continental and intra-European destinations. At the same time, other airports might realize a significant increase in traffic as they will be sought after by the profit maximizing airlines as their major gateway hubs. Which will be the losing airports and which will be the winning ones? Can airports anticipate the actions of airlines in deregulated markets and utilize policies which will improve their relative position? If so, what should be these anticipatory policies? These questions become the more urgent, since an increasing number of major European airports will be privatized in the near future. Although increasing airport congestion in Europe will also be reflected in a growing demand pressure for airport slots, this is not a guarantee for a stable transport volume growth of individual airports. The more volatile the market is, the more vulnerable privatized airports become. Therefore, the main issue of this study is the analysis of the opportunities of major European airports to become a central hub as a result of the network choices made by the new European airlines in a completely liberalized market. In a previous study (Berechman and de Wit, 1996), we already explored the potential of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol of becoming the major West-European hub, once European aviation markets are deregulated. A major hindrance of that study was the use of a single hub-and-spoke network. For example that model could not analyze the viability of different combinations of European hubs within a multiple hub network of alternative airline alliances. In this study, we have formulated the model of a multi-hub network where two West-European airports are used for inter-continental and intra-European travel to enable a more realistic analysis of hub choice. Like the previous one also this multi-hub model is primarily used to assess the potential ability of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for becoming a major West-European hub. Thus, in particular, the policy tests focus on this airport in a double hub network...|$|E

40|$|The VentrAssist implantable rotary blood pump, {{intended}} for long term ventricular assist, is under development {{and is currently}} being tested for its rotor-dynamic stability. The pump consists of a shaftless impeller, which also acts as the rotor of the brushless DC motor. The impeller remains passively suspended in the pump cavity by hydrodynamic forces, which result from the smalI clearances between the outside surfaces of the impelIer and the pump cavity. These small clearances range from approximately 50 J. 1 mto 230 J. 1 min size. This paper presents experimental investigation of the displacement of the impelIer within the cavity. Displacement of the impeller was measured using eddy-current proximity sensors and laser displacement proximity sensors, located at different positions on the pump, under different pump-operating conditions. All transducers have been calibrated prior to any experimental. Voltage output from the transducers were converted into impeller movement in five independant physical coordinates (x, y, z, 8 x and 8 y).

While previous algorithms for calibration exist, we found that improvements were needed to give reasonable results for our data, especially in {{the determination of the}} relative scale of translations between the cylinders. One approach to determining camera motion is from corresponding elements in the images, for example points or lines. One class of solutions is based on finding a transformation that yields coplanarity of certain vectors. This type of solution is not limited to any particular form of camera. This algorithm adapts to omnidirectional imagers with minor modifications in the constraint matrices. But the algorithm can only determine five degrees of freedom. A scale arbitration algorithm must determine the <b>sixth</b> degree of <b>freedom,</b> the relative lengths of the translation. While robust algorithms have been proposed for determining the relative scale, we found that standard robust statistics were insufficient for registering our cylindrical camera locations. Thus we introduce a new scale arbitration algorithm that takes into account the confidence with which a point has been triangulated using a previous camera pair. It then decides how to use the point to determine scaling for future camera pairs. This issue arises in standard rectilinear images as well, and our confidence metric adapts to any imager and other solution methods. We also address consistent illumination of cylindrical images and an ambiguity that can arise in the rotation and translation direction computations...|$|R
