40|$|A draw wire sensor is {{considered}} as a contact measurement method. It is normally {{used to measure the}} speed and position of a system. A draw wire sensor is convenient especially when a low cost solution and a small sensor dimension are desired. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the application of draw wire sensor in control tracking of electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system. This research started with the modelling of electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system by using system identification approach. During the data taking process, an experiment is conducted using electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> test bed. A draw wire sensor is attached to the load of electro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> system to measure the output displacement when the system is injected with the desired input signal.

30|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> {{have high}} power-to-weight ratios, making them {{suitable}} for high-power robotic {{applications such as}} in walking robots and construction machines. However, large frictional forces in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators,</b> rotary <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> in particular, degrade the control performance. To suppress frictional forces and increase robustness against modeling errors, this study considered the integration of feedback modulators (with minimum control inputs exceeding static frictional forces) with disturbance observers. In the proposed controller, nonlinear static frictional forces are suppressed by the feedback modulators and linear disturbances are suppressed by the disturbance observers. The validity was experimentally verified in this study.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> {{consists}} of cylinder or fluid motor that uses hydraulic power to facilitate mechanical operation. The mechanical motion gives an output {{in terms of}} linear, rotatory or oscillatory motion. As liquids are nearly impossible to compress, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> can exert a large force. The drawback {{of this approach is}} its limited acceleration.|$|R
40|$|Linear Incremental <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Actuators</b> combine {{one or more}} short-stroke cylinders, and two or more engaging/disengaging {{mechanisms}} {{into one}} actuator with long, medium, or even unlimited stroke length. The motion of each single short-stroke actuator concatenated by the engaging/disengaging mechanisms forms {{the motion of the}} linear incremental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator.</b> The patterns of how these motions are concatenated form the gaits of a specific linear incremental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator.</b> Linear incremental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> may have more than one gait. In an application, the gaits may be combined to achieve optimal performance at various operating points. The distinguishing characteristic of linear incremental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> is the incremental motion. The term incremental actuator is seen as analogous to the incremental versus absolute position sensor. Incremental actuators realize naturally relative positioning. Incremental motion means also that the behavior does not depend on an absolute position but only on the relative position within a cycle or step. Incremental actuators may realize discrete incremental or continuous incremental motion. Discrete incremental actuators can only approach discrete positions, whereby stepper drives are one prominent example. In contrast, continuous incremental actuators may approach any position. Linear electric motors are one example of continuous incremental actuators. The actuator has no inherent limitation in stroke length, as every step or cycle adds only to the state {{at the beginning of the}} step or cycle and does not depend on the absolute position. This led to the alternative working title <b>Hydraulic</b> Infinite Linear <b>Actuator.</b> Linear incremental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> provides long stroke, high force, and linear motion and has the potential to decrease the necessary resource usage, minimize environmental impact, e. g. from potential oil spillage, extend the range of feasible products: longer, stiffer, better, etc. This thesis presents an analysis of the characteristics and properties of linear incremental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> as well as the gaits and possible realizations of some gaits. The gait for continuous, smooth motion with two cylinders is comprehensively studied and a control concept for the tracking problem is proposed. The control concept encapsulates the complexity of the linear incremental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuator</b> so that an application does not have to deal with it. One other gait, the ballistic gait, which realizes fast, energy-efficient motion, enabling energy recuperation is studied...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} a wide range of {{actuation}} technologies, none currently rivals the overall performance (power density, bandwidth, stress, stroke) of conventional hydraulic actuation. It is well known in the actuation community that the power-to-weight ratios and the power-to-volume ratios of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> are, respectively, around 5 times and 10 to 20 times larger than comparable electric motors. Due to fundamental limitations in the magnetic flux density in the supporting structures and limitations in the heat transfer out of electric actuators, significant changes in these ratios are not likely in the near future. Thermal limitations associated with electric motors do no apply to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> since the <b>hydraulic</b> fluid cools and lubricates the system. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> are capable of holding a load without any energy expenditure, resilient to high impact loads, and typically do no need a transmission system. However, with all of these virtues, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> have serious practical implementation problems. Typically, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> have moderate to poor reliability when compared to electric actuators, leaky (at least in reputation), poor energy efficiencies and poor controllability due to either overlapping or underlapping in the spool of the control valves.

Their purpose is also to raise control system survivability by eliminating the long pipeline communications and their replacing for the electro-conductive power supply system, thus reducing the vulnerability of systems. The main reason for a delayed application of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> in the cutting-edge aircrafts was that such aircrafts require <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> of considerably higher power with considerable heat releases, which caused an unacceptable overheat of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators.</b> Positive and negative sides of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators,</b> their alternative options of increased reliability and survivability, local hydraulic systems as an advanced alternative to independent <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> are considered.
