2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{and tell you that}} that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, lovey, the Mill--my mill--YOUR mill--the house I {{built for}} you, dear. I'd <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now, but you see, Sade, I'm out here standin' guard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{should be}} quite indifferent. Mr. Kennedy would hold us harmless. We're straightforward. My <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> would prove that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{ought to}} have known better than <b>to</b> have <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you!</b> You are always {{laughing}} at her and me all over the house--and now--' ...|$|R
50|$|For {{indirect}} object (also {{written as}} a separate word except in third person), compare me hyacóhot 'I <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> (sg. or pl.)', cohyacóhot 'I <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him/her/them'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said John Gayther, [...] "that was all. I {{have the}} ancient gold piece {{in my room}} now, and some day I will <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{rose and}} opened a closet door. [...] "Because the proper time had not come. Before I <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I want you to promise to wear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't wait to <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Honora--to {{see you in}} it," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I have so long pictured you there, and {{our life}} as it will be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True! I didn't {{know but}} Dan had <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{as soon as}} you met. He seemed to be in such a hurry to let us all know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] I answered, [...] "I will <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> if <b>it</b> {{still be}} there, when thou hast sworn that thou wilt use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> defend Egypt from this Roman Antony {{and for the}} welfare of her people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{is in the}} air {{five days}} on the way over," [...] he {{answered}} indifferently. [...] "It is necessary that one's surroundings should be agreeable. Perhaps some day I may have the honour of <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> In the darkness, and when she is docked, there is little to be seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got it at home," [...] said Mara, in a faint voice; [...] "I'll <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> if {{you want}} to see it; there are such {{beautiful}} things in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{one reason}} why I sent for you," [...] was the {{agitated}} reply. [...] "Not long ago I spoke of a little volume, a diary which I have been keeping of my work in this country. I promised to <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You have asked me for it several times lately. I am going to <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now. It is written up to yesterday. It will tell you of all my efforts and how they were foiled. It is an absolutely faithful narrative of my work here, and the English response to it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have tried}} my hand at turning into literal Italian prose (only marking the lines) a lyric on Rome sent lately to America; and I may <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{one of these}} days.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{should like}} {{him to know that}} I have <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I should think it a liberty for an American to write to me in that way after such a short acquaintance, and I don't see why I should {{tolerate}} it from a foreigner, though I suppose their customs are different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wrote; but I didn't send it. I {{would not}} send any letter till I had <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{as you are}} my confessor and adviser. There; read it. Nothing, I think, could be more courteous or less humble." [...] He took the letter and read it. Clara had simply {{expressed}} herself willing to accept Lady Aylmer's invitation, and asked her ladyship to fix a day. There {{was no mention of}} Captain Aylmer's name in the note.|$|R
6000|$|His face never altered for {{a moment}} as he replied, with the same bland and {{innocent}} smile as ever, [...] "My darling, I have broken <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> little pieces. I saw it annoyed you in some way when I <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> yesterday, and this morning I took it out accidentally in the lower courtyard. The sight of it put me in a violent temper. 'Cursed thing,' I said, 'you shall never again step in so cruelly between me and my darling. There, take that, and that, and that, rascal!' and I stamped <b>it</b> <b>to</b> pieces underfoot in the courtyard." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated, doubting whether Alexander would scorn {{him for an}} {{acquaintance}} with Albert Durer, but Beatrice added, [...] "Yes, {{it was an old}} promise that I would <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> There now, look, admire, or be pronounced insensible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{found the}} bottle," [...] Mr. Engelman resumed. [...] "I can <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> if you like. She has herself {{requested}} {{me to keep}} it under lock and key, {{so long as it}} is wanted in this house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{venture to}} think that no private library {{contains}} so complete a collection, but I dare not <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{in the presence of}} our friend Arthur. He is too polite to accuse me of foolishness, but his sarcastic smile would betray him.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Joe if <b>you</b> want to--I {{saw some}} of his friends here.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am as {{sure of it}} as I am that I have a head on my shoulders," [...] said he, [...] "although when I was diving {{down into}} that pile I was not quite sure of that. No one would ever put {{anything}} but gold in such a hiding-place. And then, anybody can see it is gold. Look here: I scraped that spot with my knife. I wanted <b>to</b> test <b>it</b> before I <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> See how <b>it</b> shines! I could easily cut into it. I believe it is virgin gold, not hardened with any alloy." ...|$|R
6000|$|The dew at {{once was}} in the mother's eyes, as she sprang up and kissed the boy's brow, saying, 'Felix, dear, don't <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me. <b>You</b> were meant <b>to</b> be happy with it. Go and be so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "it {{still remains}} there. When we are round the next curve, I think I can <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But every one has forgotten, I think, that it doesn't belong to Mr. Fentolin still. He uses it himself very often." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am," [...] she replied. [...] "I've {{the loveliest}} pearl {{necklace}} you ever saw. Come {{in the house}} and I'll <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> And I've nine leg bracelets and a diamond pin for each wing. But I only wear them on state occasions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is one here," [...] said Rollo, {{his face}} {{brightening}} up very luminously as he spoke. [...] "I saw it hanging {{up in the}} gallery, and I {{did not know what}} it was. It must be that. I'll go and <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> after breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hawbury's color rose. [...] "Pray don't <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me, if <b>you</b> {{feel the}} least unwillingness," [...] he said, with the {{elaborate}} politeness of an offended man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet," [...] said Mr. Templeton, frowning, perplexed, [...] "this {{does not}} make you what <b>you</b> claim <b>to</b> be. Rather does <b>it</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be his late lordship's--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I believe--nay, I see, it is {{your present}} object to undeceive me. I do not doubt {{anything}} you tell me, Lucy. I wish I could see that locket, however; <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me, if <b>you</b> have it on your person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{goes up to}} {{the very}} top," [...] said Lena, [...] "to look for ships. I would never do that; I'd rather never see a ship than to {{climb to the top}} of such a tree. I'll <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in a minute; we're almost there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne {{rose from}} her chair, and {{answered}} by putting the letter into Sir Patrick's hands. [...] "Remember what he has done, since I wrote that," [...] she said. [...] "And try to excuse me, if I own that I am ashamed to <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See, we were mending {{that just}} before we got the news you were so near us. Come, I'll <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Tim Lumpy and I made it all by ourselves, and I think you'll call it a {{first-class}} article. By the way, how came you to travel first-class?" ...|$|E
50|$|The XCOM {{universe}} is expanding. In {{the coming days}} the world will get {{a fresh look at}} the long-awaited squad-based tactical shooter in development at 2K Marin. Announced back in 2010, the game has undergone an evolution since we last <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at E3 2011. Firaxis' critically acclaimed turn-based strategy title, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, has reignited the classic franchise and we feel that the time is right to deliver a new experience within the world of XCOM. The creative development of this game has been a collaborative process of discovery and iteration. 2K's culture allows our studios the freedom to refine their visions, to explore new ideas, and to deliver the best possible experiences for players. Through this exploration, 2K Marin has refined their vision, and as a result the game has evolved into a high-stakes narrative experience imbued with core XCOM concepts. The wait is nearly over and we can't wait to share more details with you about the game in only a matter of days.|$|R
60|$|No, indeed, dearest Mrs. Martin. If I {{do not say}} oftener that I have {{a strong}} and {{grateful}} trust in your affection for me, and therefore in your interest in all that concerns me, {{it is not that}} it is less strong and grateful. What I said or sang of Miss Martineau's letter was no consequence of a distrust of you, but of a feeling within myself that for me to show about such a letter was scarcely becoming, and, in the matter of modesty, nowise discreet. I suppose I was writing excuses <b>to</b> myself for <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I cannot otherwise account for the saying and singing. And, for the rest, nobody can say or sing that I am not frank enough to you--to the extent of telling all manner of nonsense about myself which can only be supposed to be interesting on the ground of your being presupposed to care a little for the person concerned. Now am I not frank enough? And by the way, I send you 'The Seraphim'[127] at last, by this day's railroad.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have meant}} so much to me," [...] she continued, [...] "you have been so much. In our earlier days, too, {{especially}} during that year when we travelled, you were such a wonderful mentor. It was your fine taste, Reginald, which enabled me {{to make the best of}} those months in Florence and Rome. You knew the best, and <b>you</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me. <b>You</b> never tried <b>to</b> understand why <b>it</b> was the best, but you never made a mistake." ...|$|R
