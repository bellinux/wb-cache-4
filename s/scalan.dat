The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh reaches a climax in [...] "18 Miles Out", {{in which the two}} men get into a heated argument, ultimately engaging in a physical confrontation. Gimple conceived and wrote the scene into the episode's script. In the fight scene, the moves were choreographed. Dickerson collaborated with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who served as the stunt coordinator. Smith cast two stuntmen to demonstrate and act out the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could duplicate the choreography. Jeremy Connors portrayed Rick, while Trent Bry played the role of Shane. In the fight sequence, Shane topples a motorcycle onto Rick's legs, temporarily immobilizing him. The motorcycle weighed an estimated 800 pounds; in order to decrease the weight of the vehicle, Dickerson and his team emptied the gas tank. This was rehearsed at the series' production studios. <b>Scalan</b> Backus, The Walking Deads special effects technician, rigged the vehicle's footpeg to prevent it from sliding and making contact with the actors' legs. Backus also added a rod with a secure stable so it would give further clearance to the actors and increase the motorcycle's height from the ground.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the scyphozoan Nausitoe punctata and the horny sponges Cacospongia <b>scalans,</b> Dysidea avara and D. fragdis was analyzed. Evidence was found for utilization of the thecae of N. punctata {{as a substitute for}} skeletal fibres. Consequently some metabolic costs associated with skeleton-buildng may be reduced for the sponge. Further potential benefits for the scyphozoan, e. g. protection against predation and mechanical disturbance, and trophic advantages, are discussed This association is suggested to be non-parasitic and mutualistic, and widely distributed among 6 orders and 8 families of the Demospongiae which occur throughout the Northwestern Mediterranean.

50|$|The <b>Scalan</b> {{was once}} a seminary {{and was one of}} the few places in Scotland where the Roman Catholic faith was kept alive during the troubled times of the 18th century.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} at Rathven, Banffshire, of Roman Catholic parentage, and educated for the priesthood at the local seminary of <b>Scalan,</b> and at Paris; he became a priest in his native county.|$|E
50|$|The Pope {{appointed}} Thomas Nicolson as {{the first}} Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694. The country was organised into districts and by 1703 there were thirty-three Catholic clergy. In 1733 it was divided into two vicariates, one for the Highland {{and one for the}} Lowland, each under a bishop. A Catholic seminary in <b>Scalan</b> in Glenlivet was the preliminary centre of education for Catholic priests in the area. It was illegal, and it was burned to the ground on several occasions by soldiers sent from beyond The Highlands. Beyond <b>Scalan</b> there were six attempts to found a seminary in the Highlands between 1732 and 1838, all suffering financially under Catholicism's illegal status. Clergy entered the country secretly and although services were illegal they were maintained.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in <b>Scalan,</b> Aberdeenshire on 4 March 1756. At the age of thirteen, he {{travelled}} to the Scots College in Rome to study for the priesthood. Owing to illness {{he was sent to}} Royal Scots College, Valladolid in Spain where he was ordained on Easter Monday 1779.|$|E
5000|$|For {{much of the}} 18th century, {{the college}} at <b>Scalan</b> in the Braes of Glenlivet {{was the only place}} in Scotland where young men were trained to be priests, the {{so-called}} [...] "heather priests". From 1717 to 1799, over a hundred were trained despite numerous attacks by Hanoverian soldiers.|$|E
50|$|Originally, priests for {{the east}} part of Scotland, or the Vicariate Apostolic of the Lowland District were trained at <b>Scalan</b> college from 1717 to 1799. The house was very small and could {{accommodate}} just over six students, with one priest in charge. As numbers rose, a larger and less remote site was sought.|$|E
50|$|In 1799, Bishop George Hay {{moved the}} college from <b>Scalan</b> to Aquhorthies. In fact, {{he died at}} the college on 15 October 1811. The college {{continued}} until 1829, when it was merged with the Catholic seminary in Lismore, and they were both closed and the students were transferred to the larger Blairs College which continued as a seminary until 1986.

Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation:At the end of this week's episode, Rick is of the mind that they're square; they've got everything out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.While returning to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker in an abandoned field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. [...] "We're really just trying to show that that kind of thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and more}} populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart of this began and as and crew moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization and fungicide application on yield, grain protein concentration and kernel plumpness on malting barley. Eleven experiments were replicated in Buenos Aires province, Argentina, during years 2012 and 2013. Treatments were: 1. Control; 2. 80 kg N ha- 1 applied at tillering; 3. treatment 2 plus a foliar application of 20 kg N ha- 1 at Z 38; 4. treatment 3 plus a foliar application of fungicide at Z 38; and 5. treatment 4 plus a foliar application of fungicide at second detectable node. Nitrogen applied at tillering increased yields at the sites where soil N availability was below 100 kg N ha- 1, increased grain protein and decreased kernel plumpness on sites where kernel plumpness in the control plots was < 75 %. An extra foliar N fertilization did not affect yield or kernel plumpness, but increased grain protein concentration significantly 0. 82 percentage points in 45 % of the studied site-years. Fungicide application at Z 38 increased yield and kernel plumpness in 2012, when high moisture conditions promoted fungal diseases. An extra fungicide application at second node stage had no consistent effect on the studied variablesFil: Daverede, Inés. Universidad Católica Argentina. Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias; Argentina.

40|$|The small {{cemetery}} is {{all that}} remains ofthe Snow Kirk! in Old Aberdeen. The church itself fell into ruin {{in the eighteenth century}} having been used bythe Catholic community since the Reformation? The churchyard, however, continued to be used ' for Catholic burials into the twentieth century. Two wall plaques record the burial there ofthe brothers, John and James Sharp both priests who had worked on the mission in Scotland for many years? The funeral monuments attest to their piety and in John's case state that he hadbeen educated at the colleges at <b>Scalan</b> in Upper Glenlivet and Valhido'lid in Spain. 4 Praise follows for his great learning and for his personal culture and manners:s the implicatIOn being that he owed these qualities to [...] his education at the colleges. It is particularly charming that,the epitaph pllẽs equal emphasis on learning and urbanity. He had been trained at a Scots College abroad in the penal times when it was illegal to receive such an education in Scotland. While his.. memorial tablet commemorates his achievements the majority of Scots Catholics who attended the colleges abroad during the penal times have gone unrecorded. 6 This dissertation will attempt to identify those students who through their contributions to cultural life of Scotland and elsewhere deserve greater academic attention. Historians have written on aspects of Catholic history during these times. Alphons Bellesheim 7, J F S Gordon 8 and William Forbes-Leith 9 have produced histories ofthe Catho. ic Church in Scotland. Their accounts, though ofgreat value, are more than a century old with consequent short-comings. Bellesheim, the German historian, wrote his four volumes on the history ofthe Church in Scotland from the earliest times. Volume 4 deals with post-Reformation history and concentrates on missionary work, particularly that of the Jesuits, in Scotland. The style is anecdotal and his approach is hagiographical. Gordon wrote his history in anticipation of the reestablishment ofthe Scottish hierarchy in 1878. The main part of his text is devoted to ', supporting this and the Penal Times are covered only in an extensive foreword in which he attempts a broad sweep ofthe subject and like Bellesheim relies heavily on unreferenced source material. Both ofForbes-Leith's major works are heavily dependent on the accounts ofthe troubles of Catholic individuals from the late sixteenth to the eighteenth century. In nature they are family histories dominated by a small number ofnorthern families including:tJordon, Forbes and Leith. In all these histories passing reference is made to the Scots colleges abroad but no asse mentof their impact is attempted. More recently Mark DilworthlO, Maurice Taylorll and Brian M Halloranl 2 have produced histories of individual Scots colleges and an anthology ofessays on the Pontifical Scots College in Rome was produced to' celebrate its 400 th anniversary. 13 The Innes Review continues to produce scholarly articles on many aspects of Scottish CathoIicism. 14 However, the vast majority ofthese accounts are focused exclusively on religious matters as is unsurprising since almost all ofthe historians involved are ordained priests, secular and regular, and therefore writing from a professional or vocational perspective. IS The impact ofthe Scots Catholic colleges in Europe during,' this period has not yet been addressed as a whole, either in terms ofsecular history or ofthe wider influence ofthe alumni ofthe colleges. This dissertation has two foci. The first is a statistical analysis ofthe prosopographical information contained in the college registers ofstudents. Together with other archival material this gives a view ofpatterns of attendance and trends sustained over time. The main details covered with regard to the students are age, family background (social and occupational), geographical origin and relationships with wider Catholic and Scottish networks. This is all original work based on primary sources. 16 The last comprehensive review ofthis college material was organised by P J Anderson 17 {{more than a century ago}} and consisted ofthe assembly ofprimary material without translation or analysis. More recent attempts at prosopography have been those ofHalloran (a partial reconstruction ofthe missing Paris college records). and Dilworth (a listing ofthe known members ofthe Wiirzburg Schottenkloster). In neither case was any analysis ofthe data attempted. My data base ofstudents was produced after rigorous examination or re-examination of original college archival material surviving in Scotland and on the continent. Wherever possible corroborative cross referencing was made with other archives - particularly those ofthe Society of Jesus 18 and the Congregation ofPropaganth'FideJ 9 in Rome - and therefore represents a significant advance on any earlier work attempted in the field. Ã‚Â•, A second focus ofthe dissertation is on the cultural impact that the colleges achieved through their alumni. In the compass of a doctoral dissertation it is simply impossible to give a full account of the cultural or political activities ofso many individuals active over such a geographical area and a span ofcenturies. The overview attempted is only indicative ofthe scope and degree of influence achieved and in no way intended to be comprehensive or definitive. It is supported quantitatively, however, by the statistical analysis ofthe data base which establishes the minimum numbers of Scottish alumni active in various fields such as the Church, military and state service, commerce, academic research, humanities, art and architecture A number ofthe most famous students ofthe colleges have been evaluated. already as contributors to their own field of endeavour either in biographies 21 or within general histories. 22 In each case they have been treated as individuals with little suggestion that they belonged to a corpus ofalumni that benefited from the unique privileges which attendance at a Scots college conferred. This omission becomes more regrettable when an assessment is made ofthe other students ofthe colleges in more than two centuries who have escaped the attention of historians or have received only the most peremptory ofaccounts. In a preliminary way this dissertation attempts to sketch some ofthe connections which emerge when these individuals are viewed in context. Again the constraints of space have limited the background which I have been able to provide. What is offered is inte. tfded only to aid the reader in having some. A sense ofthe world in which the Scots alumni existed. It is in. no way. primar;:. to the dissertation or fundamental to its purpose or claims. In my researches I have had access to a number of archives of primary materials. As well as those ofthe Jesuits and Propaganda Fide already mentioned were the MadridlValladolid College (now in Salamanca) and the Roman College: also the Archivio Segreto Vaticano and Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana were examined for relevant material. The University of WUrzburg kindly allowed me access to surviving manuscripts from that city's Schottenkloster. I have made extensive use ofthe Scottish Catholic Archives in Edinburgh and found valuable material in the Special Collections ofthe University ofAberdeen and in the City ofAberdeen's archives [...] ,. The methodology which I have adopted in constructing this dissertation is to have discussed in order the following: the founding ofthe colleges; the basis oftheir academic success; the numbers and backgrounds ofstudents who attended; their contributions to the Catholic mission in Scotland; further contributions to the wider Catholic Church; those alumni who took up significant positions in Military or State service; those who were prominent in scholarly or academic life; and those noted for scientific, business or. artistic excellence. In all cases, where relevant, statistical analysis ofthe data base has been used to support any conclusions drawn. One more point requires to be made in this preface: to declare my personal viewpoint. By confession I am a Catholic, Scottish but ofIrish ancestry. This has driven much ofmy interest in this research but I have striven to avoid it colouring my objectivity. I sta ed the research in a state of almost complete ignorance and was driven by curiosity which only intensified the more I learned. If! have weighed evidence more lightly or exaggerated outcomes more than a totally objective commentator from a wholly secular background might have done then in my defence I might claim that I have done no more than partially to rectify the imbalance shown by past historians in their almost total neglect or denial ofthe substantial contributions to cultural developments achieved by the Scots Colleges abroad.
