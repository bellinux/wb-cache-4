In February, Schmidt and Landrith had two new competitors thrown into the foray. Tom Haller and John Orsino were originally considered threats to <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> the depth chart order.

Tom's impressive play continued through mid-April, earning him the opening day starting job over Schmidt and Landrith.
