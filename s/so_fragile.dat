5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{invariant}} core residues G5, G8, G12 and C3 in {{the minimal}} hammerhead ribozyme were each observed to be <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> that changing {{even a single}} exocyclic functional group on {{any one of these}} nucleotides results in a dramatic reduction or abolition of catalytic activity, yet few of these appeared to form hydrogen bonds involving the Watson-Crick faces of these nucleotide bases in any of the minimal hammerhead structures, apart from a G-5 interaction in the product structure.|$|E
25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E

It's about these guys whose world is so tenuous and <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> that they can't stand to have any of their beliefs shattered", referring to John and Tom's views of their lives, Brandon's aspirations and his biological sex. Along with other turn-of-the-millennium films such as [...] In the Company of Men (1997), American Beauty (1999), Fight Club (1999), and American Psycho (2000), Vincent Hausmann said Boys Don't Cry [...] "raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis". Jason Wood said the film, together with Patty Jenkins's Monster (2003), is an exploration of [...] "social problems".|$|E
500|$|During the {{surrender}} ceremony, {{the deck of}} Missouri was decorated with a 31-star American flag that had been taken ashore by Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 after his squadron of [...] "Black Ships" [...] sailed into Tokyo Bay to force the opening of Japan's ports to foreign trade. This flag was actually displayed with the reverse side showing, i.e., stars in the upper right corner: the historic flag was <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> that the conservator at the Naval Academy Museum had sewn a protective linen backing to one side to help secure the fabric from deteriorating, leaving its [...] "wrong side" [...] visible. The flag was displayed in a wood-framed case secured to the bulkhead overlooking {{the surrender}} ceremony. Another U.S. flag was raised and flown during the occasion, a flag that some sources have indicated was in fact that flag which had flown over the U.S. Capitol on 7 December 1941. This is not true; it was a flag taken from the ship's stock, according to Missouris commanding officer, Captain Stuart [...] "Sunshine" [...] Murray, and it was [...] "...just a plain ordinary GI-issue flag".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene was}} also a pivotal point in the {{development}} of Elsa's character and was initially planned to depict her becoming evil. Robert Lopez, who composed the song with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, explained, [...] "Elsa was going to go from being this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality down her whole life to saying, 'Screw it. I'm gonna be me.'" [...] They had wanted to use the song as a way {{to gain a better understanding}} of the character and what she would be like if she was no longer living in fear, which ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex. The final lyrics and Menzel's [...] "ability to be <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> and vulnerable and then break into this powerhouse voice" [...] turned the plot around and led to Elsa being revised as a [...] "good" [...] character. She initially attempts to suppress her powers in order to avoid hurting others, particularly Anna, and when she is no longer able to do so, she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those around her. Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed. [...] "The strength of the family bond is what makes this story so powerful," [...] he explained, [...] "because it's her sibling who's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that's what it takes." ...|$|E

500|$|Hu's {{most notable}} {{work is the}} Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, [...] ), an {{anthology}} of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well {{as a collection of}} artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the [...] "butterfly binding" [...] (hudie zhuang, [...] ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, [...] "The binding is <b>so</b> <b>fragile,</b> and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we {{have never been able to}} let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{replica of}} Perry's US flag {{is on display}} on board the [...] {{memorial}} in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, attached to the bulkhead just inboard of the Japanese surrender signing site on the starboard side of the ship. The original flag was brought from the U.S. Naval Academy Museum to Japan for the Japan surrender ceremony and was displayed on that occasion {{at the request of}} Douglas MacArthur, who was himself a blood-relative of Perry. Photographs of the signing ceremony show that this flag was displayed properly as all flags on vessels (known as ensigns) on the starboard side are, with the stars in the upper right corner. The cloth of the historic flag was <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> that the conservator at the Museum directed that a protective backing be sewn on it. [...] Today, the flag is preserved and on display at the Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland.|$|E
2500|$|A twelfth-century scroll, the Genji Monogatari Emaki, {{contains}} illustrated {{scenes from}} the Genji together with handwritten sōgana text. [...] This scroll is the earliest extant example of a Japanese [...] "picture scroll": collected illustrations and calligraphy of a single work. [...] The original scroll {{is believed to have}} comprised 10-20 rolls and covered all 54 chapters. [...] The extant pieces include only 19 illustrations and 65 pages of text, plus nine pages of fragments. [...] This is estimated at roughly 15% of the envisioned original. [...] The Tokugawa Art Museum in Nagoya has three of the scrolls handed down in the Owari branch of the Tokugawa clan and one scroll held by the Hachisuka family is now in the Gotoh Museum in Tokyo. The scrolls are designated National Treasures of Japan. The scrolls are <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> that they normally are not shown in public. The original scrolls in the Tokugawa Museum were shown from November 21 to November 29 in 2009. Since Heisei 13, they have been displayed in the Tokugawa Museum always for around one week in November. An oversize English photoreproduction and translation was printed in limited edition by Kodansha International (Tale of Genji Scroll, [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Ken Barrington {{started as}} a free-scoring {{off-side}} player, but – determined to regain {{his place in the}} England Test team – he opened his stance and became a defensive leg-side player. In the 1960s he was the backbone of the England team, whose batting had proved <b>so</b> <b>fragile</b> to the Australian bowling in the 1958-59 Ashes series, but he was a match-saver rather than a match-winner, always best in a crisis. The selectors, press and public thought that he surrendered the initiative too much to the bowlers, but a batsman of his calibre could not be ignored. He was a great worrier and had trouble sleeping during a Test match or if he was not out overnight, which led in turn to exhaustion. As a batsman he was a nervous waiter in the dressing room and preferred to bat at number three to reduce the tension. He would smoke cigarettes to calm himself down and would watch closely to see how the wicket was playing. Barrington took his time walking out to the crease and the Australian wicket-keeper Wally Grout said [...] "Whenever I saw Ken coming to the wicket, I thought the Union Jack was trailing behind him". Once there he would inspect the pitch and subject it to [...] "incessant prodding", and would hold up play if the captain changed the field so that he could inspect it. A nervous starter he would make 20–30 runs quickly enough, but gave chances to the bowlers, who tried to take advantage of this. Once settled he would slow down and would sink into lethargy until he neared his century, which four times in Tests he brought up with a massive pull for six. Yet there was method even in this, fielding captains tended to add close-fielders in the 'nervous nineties', so Barrington just hit the ball over their heads into the outfield.|$|E

60|$|I left him, {{and soon}} found {{myself at the}} Palazzo Aste, where Donna Giulia was waiting for me. I had been to see her nearly every day since my arrival in Forli, for I really liked her. Naturally, I was {{not in love with}} her as Matteo suggested, and I had no {{intention}} of entering into that miserable state. I had found her charmingly simple, very different from the monster of dissipation she was supposed to be. She must have been three or four-and-twenty, but in all her ways she was quite girlish, merry and thoughtless, full of laughter at one moment, and then some trifling thing would happen to discompose her and she would be brought to the verge of tears; but a word or caress, even a compliment, would make her forget the unhappiness which had appeared so terrible, and in an instant she would be wreathed in smiles. She seemed <b>so</b> delightfully <b>fragile,</b> <b>so</b> delicate, so weak, that one felt it necessary to be very gentle with her. I could not imagine how anyone could use a hard word to her face.|$|R
6000|$|He put {{his head}} {{on one side and}} tilted his brows, as if to say [...] "What are you to do?" [...] And the smile on his mouth was sad, fine, and charming.
