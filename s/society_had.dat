5|$|In 2010, {{though the}} Chinese Medical <b>Society</b> <b>had</b> stated that organ transplants from {{executed}} prisoners must cease, {{and changes in}} Chinese regulations prohibited transplant tourism, {{a meeting of the}} Transplantation Society received over 30 papers containing data from several hundred transplants, where the donor source was likely executed prisoners.|$|E
50|$|The Debate <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> {{gone through}} several periods of {{relative}} inactivity and subsequent revival. During these periods the <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> ranged from 5 students to {{as large as}} 40 with most years having between 15-20 active debating members. Despite its relatively small size the <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> produced several nationally ranked members and has been consistently ranked nationally.|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>society</b> <b>has</b> {{traditionally}} {{been viewed as}} comprising of three sectors; government, market and civil society. The theoretical base of three pillars of government (or polity), commerce (or market) and civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> historically been {{assumed to be a}} comprehensive structure of <b>society.</b> Many theorists <b>have</b> proposed different characteristics for the sectors but until recently none have proposed fundamental change to the structure. Debate over civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> been a central element of political analysis for hundreds of years. Civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> been variously theorised as subversive and detrimental to society at large, as the site of social action and as a category into which all human activity that is not market or government can be placed. In the late twentieth century civil <b>society</b> <b>has</b> been viewed as the site of social and community activity and more recently the activities of formal community organisations that have become increasingly involved in the delivery of human services...|$|R
50|$|The Law <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> a proud {{record in}} {{competitive}} debating. The <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> won {{a number of}} international debating competitions and has enjoyed victory in The Irish Times and Mace debating competitions as well as international and national intervarsities. The <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> sent delegates to the World Universities Debating Championship annually and the European Universities Debating Championship, often reaching quarter finals in both competitions. In 1987 & 2006, UCD hosted the World Universities Debating Championship.|$|R

5|$|The group finally disbanded in 1930 when Virginia Moore died of cancer. After her death, the {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Spirit Fruit Society dispersed to various homes of friends and family. Despite the small membership, the <b>society</b> <b>had</b> been in existence for almost 30 years– 20 years beyond the death of its founder.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim indigenous population. They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the Netherlands Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the Netherlands Missionary <b>Society</b> <b>had</b> had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, {{sent a letter to the}} Netherlands asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the catechism and some prayer books.|$|E
50|$|The <b>society</b> <b>has</b> a Junior and Senior Group and was Opened in July 2001 and {{has been}} the Fortress of Belvoir ever since. The Junior <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> a massive 176 members with a waiting list to gain membership.|$|R

5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK's first co-operative societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families. The Sheerness Economical Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. By the middle of the 20th century, the <b>society</b> <b>had</b> spread across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society.|$|E
5|$|Finnish <b>society</b> <b>had</b> {{experienced}} {{rapid population}} growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Nazi <b>society</b> <b>had</b> {{elements}} {{supportive of}} animal rights {{and many people}} were fond of zoos and wildlife. The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. However, the law was only loosely enforced {{and in spite of}} a ban on vivisection the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>societies</b> <b>have</b> {{a formal}} hierarchic {{structure}} patterned upon the socio-economic structure of colonial <b>society.</b> Each <b>society</b> <b>has</b> a king and a queen, {{as well as}} princes, princesses, and many other symbolic legal, military and professional roles, such as judges, policemen, nurses, soldiers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>society</b> <b>has</b> always claimed an 1837 {{foundation}} for itself, for reasons understood to the members, although no {{advocate of the}} <b>society</b> <b>has</b> contravened {{the fact that the}} founding meeting was in late 1838. Eclectic was Wesleyans second fraternity, after the Mystical 7.|$|R
50|$|The <b>society</b> <b>has</b> {{supported}} {{a number of}} exchange programs and offers opportunities for British and Japanese members to become acquainted with each other, including seasonal events and lectures.

5|$|The Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was set up}} in 1894 at {{a meeting}} in January at the temperance hall in Hardman Street. A <b>society</b> <b>had</b> been {{proposed}} a month earlier by Emily Hornby at a public meeting and after a unanimous vote, was founded by Edith Allan Bright, Lydia Allen Booth and Nessie Stewart-Brown and initially had twenty four members. The society set up headquarters at 6 Lord Street. Millicent Fawcett, leader of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, attended the first meeting as a guest speaker.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit Fruit Society was a communitarian {{group in}} the United States that was {{organized}} {{after a period of}} repeated business depressions during the 1890s. The <b>society</b> <b>had</b> its beginnings in Lisbon, Ohio and, over the years of its existence moved to Ingleside, Illinois and, finally, to California. Plagued by rumor, suspicion, and attacks in the press during its early years, the group remained active until 1930. Although it never numbered {{more than a handful of}} adherents, the Spirit Fruit Society existed longer and more successfully than any other American utopian group.|$|E
5|$|Three roads with {{residential}} housing—Manor Way, Windmill Way, and Park Way—were completed {{before the}} outbreak of the First World War. All construction work was halted, and did not resume until 1919. The Ruislip Manor Cottage <b>Society</b> <b>had</b> been set up in 1911 to facilitate the construction of cottages and small housing in the area, though it did not manage to build as much as had been planned. As the council took on several plots in Eastcote, only four houses could be built by the society there. In Northwood, eighteen cottages were later built in 1926.|$|E
5000|$|The North House {{has also}} housed the Lewisburg Seminary and Conservatory of Music. [...] However, since 1976 the Greenbrier Historical <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> {{operated}} the North House Museum {{out of the}} home, and the Historical <b>Society</b> <b>has</b> officially owned the building since 1992.|$|R

5|$|Turck {{had become}} a member of the Holland Society of New York in 1917 and was active in their events and affairs. As early as 1887, the Holland <b>Society</b> <b>had</b> sought to install a {{prominent}} monument in New York City to celebrate the city’s Dutch heritage. The society agreed on William the Silent as the monument's subject in 1892 and was urged to install the monument in the city's Central Park. In the following years, the society considered commissioning the work from prominent American sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848–1907) and Daniel Chester French (1850–1931). In 1913, Tunis Bergen, a physician chairing the Holland Society's committee investigating options for a monument, visited the Netherlands and enquired whether a copy of the Royer's statue in the Hague could be made and took measurements and photographs of the work. Subsequently, World War I delayed the society's plans. Throughout the 1920s, the Holland <b>Society</b> <b>had</b> proposed to install Turck's statue in several locations in New York City, in Albany, New York, and other locations along the Hudson Valley.|$|E
5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman <b>society</b> <b>had</b> become.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great <b>Society</b> <b>had</b> been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency). According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through {{the first year of}} his presidency.|$|E
