5|$|The Byzantine {{sources have}} not {{recorded}} {{the aftermath of}} the battle but, according to the accounts of the contemporary Arab historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, the Bulgarians marched towards Constantinople. Leo VI was in such a panic that he considered arming Arab prisoners of war and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> against the Bulgarians in return for their freedom, but eventually abandoned the idea. Further negotiations followed until the Byzantines agreed to the Bulgarian demands.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the war with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for {{internment}} of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E
5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E

5|$|Grameen Bank is {{best known}} for its system of {{solidarity}} lending. The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions. At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1682 {{assembly}} of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible {{part of the new}} Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> abroad to study.|$|E

5|$|The {{implementation}} of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the struggle {{of the new government}} to acquire centralized authority, further complicated by the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945. In 1947 Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored Marshall Plan, and to join the Soviet Union-dominated Comecon in 1949. The Soviet forces present engaged in plunder of the former eastern territories of Germany which were being transferred to Poland, stripping it of valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and factories and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to the Soviet Union.|$|E

At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to Nicholas Pocock {{to be used}} for Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|According to Swedish legend, Charles XI {{travelled}} {{around the}} country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he {{is referred to as}} the Greycoat (Swedish: Gråkappan). This was done to discover and identify corruption and oppression against the populace. There are many stories about him arriving in villages looking for corrupt church officials and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to the gallows. However, Charles XI never travelled alone. He was always followed by a military cortège but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this era that travelled the most throughout the country. The stories of the Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E

5|$|By {{the year}} 737, Emperor Xuanzong {{discarded}} {{the policy of}} conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided {{to them in the}} equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Claiming {{that not}} all prisoners had been released, Simeon once again invaded Byzantium {{in the summer of}} 896, heading {{directly}} to Constantinople. He was met in Thrace by a hastily assembled Byzantine army, but annihilated the Byzantine forces in the Battle of Bulgarophygon (at modern Babaeski, Turkey). Arming Arab captives and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to fight with the Bulgarians as a desperate measure, Leo VI managed to repel the Bulgarians from Constantinople, which they had besieged. The war ended with a peace treaty which formally lasted until around Leo VI's death in 912 and under which Byzantium was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and Strandža to the Bulgarian Empire. Meanwhile, Simeon had also imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as their ruler.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E
