50|$|A <b>spoon</b> <b>lure,</b> {{in sport}} fishing, is an oblong, usually concave lure, usually made of metal or a shell, shaped like {{the bowl of}} a spoon. The <b>spoon</b> <b>lure</b> is mainly used to attract fish by {{reflecting}} light and moving randomly.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{use their}} lateral line system {{to follow the}} {{vortices}} produced by fleeing prey, and the oscillating movements of the <b>spoon</b> <b>lure</b> {{can be a good}} way to imitate these. Spoon lures with mirror finishes can be additionally effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings, cause a glint of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey fish. Different color variations and materials can be added to the classic <b>spoon</b> <b>lure</b> may also help catch fish. Silver- or gold-plated or dyed finishes can give the lure a more vibrant or brilliant appearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the <b>spoon</b> <b>lure</b> is simple: an oblong, concave metal piece with a shiny chrome or paint finish and a single or treble hook on the end. While the basic {{principle}} of design has stayed the same over the years, application and use have changed somewhat. In its beginning, the spoon was used simply to cast and retrieve. However, as trolling motors have become popular on most fishing boats, {{a new version of}} the classic was invented.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spoon</b> <b>lures</b> {{resemble}} {{the inside of}} a table spoon. They flash in the light while randomly wobbling or darting due to their shape.|$|R
50|$|In {{some areas}} of little to no fishing pressure, black bullheads {{have been found to}} be more {{aggressive}} and have been caught while casting and retrieving metal <b>spoon</b> <b>lures.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spoon</b> <b>lures</b> usually {{look like}} a spoon, with a wide rounded end and a {{narrower}} pointed end, similar n shape to a concave spearhead. They flash in the light while wobbling and darting due to their shape, which attracts fish.|$|R
50|$|The Little Cleo {{is a small}} <b>spoon</b> <b>lure</b> made by the Acme Tackle Company {{which comes}} in nine sizes from 1⁄16 oz to 1&thinsp;1⁄4 oz, and in many {{different}} color combinations. Its wiggling action creates the illusion of an injured baitfish acting erratically, and often instigates reactionary strikes in predatory fish. The Little Cleo, which has been widely available for {{over a quarter of}} a century, {{is one of the most}} popular lures in use today and according to Field & Stream is one of the 50 greatest lures of all time.|$|E
50|$|Fly rods {{are used}} to catch {{riverine}} brown trout. Medium-sized, wet and dry flies are thrown into streams with a rod of AFTMA Class 4-6 and are intended to mimic an emerging or egg-laying insect.A spinning rod {{can also be used}} in some waters. For this purpose, a light spinning rod and various artificial <b>lures,</b> such as <b>spoon</b> <b>lures</b> and spinners are used. In using wobblers and rubber fish care should be taken because they are banned on some waterbodies or may only be used with restrictions.|$|R
50|$|Mormyshka (or Mormishka, or Marmooska, мормышка) {{is a sort}} {{of fishing}} lure or a jig. The word is derived from Russian word Mormysh (мормыш) - that means Freshwater Shrimp (Gammarus). Mormyshka was invented in the 19th century in Russia. The prototypes were big <b>spoon</b> <b>lures</b> used for ice fishing. Trying to imitate shrimps, anglers made lures smaller and changed the way of fixing them on the line. As a result, {{efficient}} lures appeared and were spread quickly among ice fishermen all around Russia and Scandinavia.|$|R
50|$|Acme Tackle Company is an American fishing {{supplies}} store, {{specializing in}} <b>spoon</b> <b>lures.</b> Acme has 16 different lures in over 1200 different types, sizes and color combinations, {{many of which}} are designed for specific types of fish, such as trout, bass, pike, or walleye. Acme's lures use steel split rings and Mustad hooks to hold fish. The company has been making the popular Little Cleo and Sidewinder spoons since 1980. The Little Cleo has been deemed by Field & Stream {{to be one of the}} 50 greatest lures of all time.|$|R
50|$|This {{new breed}} of lure {{was nothing more than}} a {{duplicate}} of the traditional casting spoon, but made with thinner material. Using a trolling motor, fishermen could cover a wider expanse of water, increasing the chances for a successful day. Using split shots or other forms of weights, fishermen could easily zero into their fishing lures' depth while running at the proper speed. Armed with the ability to cover more area, average fishermen could take their <b>spoon</b> <b>lures</b> to any body of water, without full knowledge of the underwater geography that is key to catching some species of fish. The regular casting spoon (heavier version) is used primarily by fishermen who already know the water and what lies beneath. The angler, anchoring the boat 10 to 20 feet behind the area where the fish are believed to be, can cast the spoon beyond this point and retrieve through the given strike zone.|$|R
25|$|Blue runner is also of high {{importance}} to recreational fisheries, with anglers often taking the species both {{for food and}} to use as bait. The blue runner {{has a reputation as}} an excellent gamefish on light tackle, taking both fish baits, as well a variety of lures including hard-bodied bibbed <b>lures,</b> <b>spoons,</b> metal jigs and soft plastic jigs. The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including billfish, cobia and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|R
50|$|It is colored blue to violet above, with {{metallic}} luster becoming silvery ventrally. It has ten or eleven {{stripes on}} its back running obliquely from the dorsum forward, and fifteen or more rakers below the angle on the first gill. The first dorsal fin is contiguous with the second and longer than the head. The caudal peduncle is slender, and the body entirely scaled. It has no teeth on the vomer. It has a small keel {{on either side of}} the median keel on the sides of the caudal peduncle, and six to eight finlets on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the caudal peduncle. The maximum length is about 40 inches and weight 25 pounds. It is found anywhere from inshore to about 100 miles offshore from northern Vancouver Island to Mexico, though it is not normally found north of Point Conception. It usually travels in schools. Fish and squid are its main diet. It is caught by trolling and still fishing, using feather <b>lures,</b> <b>spoons,</b> or live bait.|$|R
