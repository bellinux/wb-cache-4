40|$|The {{successful}} {{nomination of}} Waverley Park to the Victorian Historic Register proved as controversial as the stadium was during its thirty-year existence. The nomination was accepted {{primarily on the}} grounds of the social historical value of the site, rather than its architectural or engineering qualities, but in fact a range of different <b>social</b> <b>histories</b> were in conflict during the registration process. Four of the <b>social</b> <b>histories</b> involved are outlined and their influence on the outcome assessed.

5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century.

5|$|For a {{property}} {{to be eligible}} for the National Register, it must meet {{at least one of the}} four National Register main criteria.

Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following.|$|E
5|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} history, religion, and social movements. The {{historical}} narrative is guided more by <b>social</b> <b>history</b> than political or military history.

40|$|Ethnic {{groups have}} {{frequently}} functioned as {{building blocks for}} the narration of Surinamese and, more generally, Caribbean <b>social</b> <b>histories.</b> This focus on ethnicity {{may lead to the}} portrayal of society as made up exclusively of racial/ethnic groups with primordial loyalties and attachments and pure, distinct cultures. Such an approach makes it impossible to understand social life but through an ethnic lens, while barring us from asking how ethnicity has been construed, deployed and contested. This article attempts to formulate an alternative vantage point and methodology for narrating Surinamese and Caribbean <b>social</b> <b>histories.</b> It argues for historical narratives that take differentiated geographies, rather than naturalized ethnic groupings as their vantage point...|$|R

5|$|The <b>social</b> <b>history</b> {{of viruses}} {{describes}} {{the influence of}} viruses and viral infections on human history. Epidemics caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the Neolithic period, around 12,000 years ago, when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities. This allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become endemic. Viruses of plants and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as potyviruses of potatoes and rinderpest of cattle had devastating consequences.|$|E
5|$|According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, {{author of}} A <b>Social</b> <b>History</b> of the Deccan, Vithoba was first worshipped as a {{pastoral}} god {{as early as}} the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo iconography is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now also associated with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, like most other pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and <b>social</b> <b>history</b> of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E

5|$|Crewkerne and District Museum {{is part of}} a wider {{heritage}} centre {{which includes}} local archives and a meeting room. The museum opened in 2000 in an old house with an 18th-century frontage. It was restored with the help of grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council and Crewkerne Town Council. The development of Crewkerne during the 18th and 19th centuries, with particular emphasis on the flax and linen industry is illustrated with a permanent display. Other collections relate to local archaeology, Coins and Medals, Costume and Textiles, Fine Art, Music, Personalities, Science and Technology, <b>Social</b> <b>History,</b> Weapons and War.|$|E
5|$|For {{narrative}} {{history the}} principal sources are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Irish annals. The evidence from charters {{created in the}} Kingdom of England provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain. While Scandinavian sagas describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of <b>social</b> <b>history,</b> is disputed. Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint Cathróe of Metz, a work of hagiography written in Germany {{at the end of}} the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.|$|E
5|$|Panofsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's {{attempts}} at attribution, but focused more on <b>social</b> <b>history</b> and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical <b>social</b> <b>history</b> of America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, {{the evolution of}} jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} <b>social</b> <b>history.</b> The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to <b>social</b> <b>history,</b> with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E
