The route is marked by archeological findings, especially the characteristic bronze crown-shaped necklaces.|$|E

5|$|Though Favre {{lived in}} Hancock County in West Florida, {{and died in}} Mobile, Mississippi Territory, {{documents}} concerning his estate were also filed in New Orleans, Louisiana, probably by his Hancock County attorney, Rutillius Pray of Pearlington.

5|$|As {{part of the}} restructuring, 3G {{also moved}} to change many aspects of {{corporate}} operations throughout 2011-2012. One of the first moves was to terminate Burger King's relationship with ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, replacing it with McGarryBowen. 3G also began a menu restructuring, with the first product being a revamped version of BK's Chicken Tenders product. Other new or reformulated products would follow. In terms of its franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors Subway and KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants {{in order to become}} an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure.

5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west.

By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land <b>settled</b> <b>and</b> the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made, a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} routine of the {{battalion}} became more <b>settled</b> <b>and</b> time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand. The war with Japan continued however, {{and at the time}} it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.|$|E

5|$|Of Irish descent, O'Reilly's {{paternal}} grandfather Peter {{emigrated from}} Co Cavan, Ulster in 1865. Arriving in Sydney, {{he had been}} a policeman for four years in Ireland and continued in this line of work in New South Wales. After a period, he was sent to Deniliquin in the Riverina, where he <b>settled</b> <b>and</b> married another Irish immigrant Bridget O'Donoghue from Ballinasloe, Co. Galway. O'Reilly's father, Ernest, was a schoolteacher and moved around the areas surrounding the Murray River to study and teach. O'Reilly's mother Mina (née Welsh) was of mixed Irish and English descent, of a third generation family from Adelaide. O'Reilly was born in the opal mining town of White Cliffs, New South Wales. Ernest had been appointed to open the first school in the town, and had helped to build the school and its furniture himself. Bill was the fourth child in the family, with two elder brothers and a sister.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 2007, it was {{announced}} that production rights to the Terminator series had passed from the feuding Vajna and Kassar to the Halcyon Company. The producers hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise. The purchase was financed with a loan by Pacificor, a hedge fund from Santa Monica. By July 19, the project was in legal limbo due to a lawsuit between MGM and Halcyon subsidiary T Asset. MGM had an exclusive window of 30 days to negotiate for distribution of the Terminator films. When negotiating for Terminator 4, Halcyon rejected their initial proposal, and MGM suspended negotiations. After the 30 days were over, MGM claimed that the period during which negotiations were suspended did not count and their exclusive period was still open. Halcyon asked a court for an injunction allowing them to approach other distributors. Later, the lawsuit was <b>settled</b> <b>and</b> MGM got a 30-day right of first refusal to finance and distribute the fifth Terminator film.|$|E
5|$|Sawmills and gristmills {{were built}} in the {{watershed}} in the early 1800s and there was a mill on the creek by 1788. A large number of small mills producing grist, cider, woolens, and lumber were once on North Branch Buffalo Creek. There was a log school on Buffalo Creek in the 1830s. By the late 1800s, there was a significant lumbering industry. This also caused railroads to be built in the watershed. The lumbering industry became less prominent in the early 1900s. In the late 1800s, the area along North Branch Buffalo Creek was heavily <b>settled</b> <b>and</b> known as Jonestown. A county road paralleled the creek here. In the late 1800s or early 1900s, a locomotive crashed into Buffalo Creek while crossing it.|$|E

In some undisturbed areas there is Poa labillardierei (silver tussock) grassland and Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass). Glycine latrobeana (clover glycine) was recorded south of the town in 1984. Discaria pubescens (Hairy Anchor Plant or Australian Anchor Plant), which appears on the states endangered species list, was recorded north-east in 2001 on the South Esk River's floodplain. Apart from introduced brown trout the Liffey River is home to platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). Platypus in the river have, in common with in other rivers nearby, been found with the potentially lethal fungal infection Mucor amphiborum.|$|E
