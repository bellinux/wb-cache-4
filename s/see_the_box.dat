His hands hovered above it; and he talked to us ironically, but his face became as grave as though he were pronouncing a {{powerful}} incantation over the things inside.|$|R

[...] And then Dave worked {{his way over to}} a corner under the eaves, and from behind a broken rocking-chair and a dilapidated couch, dragged forth a small wooden box, painted blue. He threw back the cover, exposing to view thirty or forty books, covered with dust and yellow with age.|$|E
60|$|So a {{compromise}} had been compounded. Tommy was {{to hide the}} snuff-box. It was to be somewhere {{in the room and}} to be accessible, but that was all. Peter, when self-control had reached the breaking-point, might try and find it. Occasionally, luck helping Peter, he would find it early in the day, when he would earn his own bitter self-reproaches by indulging in quite an orgie. But more often Tommy's artfulness was such that he would be compelled, by want of time, to abandon the search. Tommy always knew when he had failed by the air of indignant resignation with which he would greet her on her return. Then perhaps towards evening, Peter, looking up, would <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> open before his nose, above it, a pair of reproving black eyes, their severity counterbalanced by a pair of full red lips trying not to smile. And Peter, knowing that only one pinch would be permitted, would dip deeply.|$|E
60|$|He didn't fly {{straight}} there. Oh, my, no! Blacky is too clever to {{do anything}} like that. He flew toward the Green Forest. When {{he knew that he}} was out of sight of those in the cornfield, he turned and flew over to the Old Orchard, and from the top of one of the old apple-trees he studied the henyard and the barnyard and Farmer Brown's house and the barn, to make absolutely sure that there was no danger near. When he was quite sure, he silently flew down into the henyard as he had done many times before. He pretended to be looking for scattered grains of corn, but all the time he was edging nearer and nearer to the open door of the henhouse. At last he could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> with the hay in it. He walked right up to the open door and peered inside. There was nothing to be afraid of that he could see. Still he hesitated. He did hate to go inside that door, even for a minute, and that is all it would take to fly up to that nest and get one of those eggs.|$|E

25|$|The {{counter to}} this view comes from Marc Gabolde, who offers {{political}} necessity {{as the reason for}} Meritaten's demotion.

60|$|The {{room was}} a commodious one, and the {{richness}} of the covering of the divan, and the handsome rugs spread on the floor, were satisfactory signs that the chamberlain considered them prime favourites of <b>the</b> sultan.
