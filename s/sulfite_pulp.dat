2500|$|A {{major upgrade}} {{to the plant}} {{took place in the}} period after 1950, {{following}} General Director O. T. Jarlsby's ten-year plan. Production was eased throughout the period by increased access to lumber and higher demand. The Anker Mill was rebuilt to produce paperboard. A new lumber cleaning mill opened in 1951, followed by a new central furnace the following year, a pyrite roaster and lumber chopper in 1953 and a new beater in 1954. Tistedalsfoss II Power Station and a spirit factory with an annual production of [...] opened in 1955. A hydrocyclone facility for the <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> mill, new 10,000 tonne oil tanks and a calcium carbonate management facility for the paper mill were taken into use two years later. A new warehouse was completed in 1958 and the bleaching site expanded the year after. The ten-year plan ended with the expansion of the conditioning facility for the paper mill and expansion of the <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> mill in 1960. In addition a series of minor upgrades and modernizations were carried out throughout the 1950s, such as extending the paper machines. From 1956 operations ran around-the-clock.|$|E
2500|$|Paper {{was made}} one sheet {{at a time}} by hand until {{development}} of the Fourdrinier paper machine (c. 1801) which made a continuous sheet. [...] Paper making was severely limited by the supply of cotton and linen rags {{from the time of}} the invention of the printing press until the development of wood pulp (c. 1850s)in response to a shortage of rags. [...] The sulfite process for making wood pulp started operation in Sweden in 1874. Paper made from <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> had superior strength properties than the previously used ground wood pulp (c. 1840). The kraft (Swedish for strong) pulping process was commercialized in the 1930s. [...] Pulping chemicals are recovered and internally recycled in the kraft process, also saving energy and reducing pollution. [...] Kraft paperboard is the material that the outer layers of corrugated boxes are made of. [...] Until Kraft corrugated boxes were available, packaging consisted of poor quality paper and paperboard boxes along with wood boxes and crates. Corrugated boxes require much less labor to manufacture than wooden boxes and offer good protection to their contents. [...] Shipping containers reduce the need for packaging.|$|E
50|$|The sulfite {{process is}} acidic {{and one of}} the {{drawbacks}} is that the acidic conditions hydrolyze some of the cellulose, which means that <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> fibers are not as strong as kraft pulp fibers. The yield of pulp (based on wood used) is higher than for kraft pulping and <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> is easier to bleach.|$|E

50|$|Bleached {{kraft pulp}} and {{bleached}} <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> {{are used to}} make high quality, white printing paper. One of the most visible uses for unbleached kraft pulp is to make brown paper shopping bags and wrapping paper where strength is particularly important. A special grade of bleached <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp,</b> known as dissolving pulp, is used to make cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose which are used {{in a wide range}} of everyday products from laxatives to baked goods to wallpaper paste.|$|E
50|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} also developed during these years. The <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> process developed in the US in 1866 became the basis for the Canadian industry. The first <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulp</b> mill in Canada, the Halifax Wood Fibre Company, was established in Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia in 1885. Others followed including plants in Cornwall, Ontario, 1888, Hull, Quebec, 1889, Chatham, Quebec, 1889, the biggest, the Riordon Company in Merritton, Ontario in 1890 and in Hawkesbury, Ontario in 1898.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} ionic {{substances}} in seven industrial filtrates from kraft pulping, mechanical <b>pulping,</b> and <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping</b> on {{the activity of}} oxalate oxidase from barley were investigated by pre-treatment of the filtrates with ion-exchange resins prior to enzymatic degradation of the oxalic acid in the filtrates. The pre-treatment resulted in increased oxalic acid degradation rates in all filtrates, except for one that was obtained from <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping.</b> The possibility that lignosulfonates, which {{were present in the}} filtrate from <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping,</b> could affect oxalate oxidase was investigated in a separate set of experiments involving four different preparations of lignosulfonates. At a lignosulfonate concentration of 50 mg/mL and a pH of 3. 8, only 2 - 16 % of the activity of oxalate oxidase remained. The results show the effects of anionic and cationic substances in bleaching filtrates on oxalate oxidase and indicate that there is an interaction between the enzyme, which has a positive net charge at pH 3. 8, and the polymeric anionic lignosulfonates...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{delignification}} in <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping</b> involves acidic cleavage of ether bonds, which connect many of {{the constituents}} of lignin. The electrophilic carbocations produced during ether cleavage react with bisulfite ions (HSO3−) to give sulfonates.|$|R
50|$|The 90-92% {{cellulose}} content <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulps</b> {{are used}} mostly to make textiles (like rayon) and cellophane.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{chemical}} pulping {{is used to}} chemically disband the lignin found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the cellulose fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical pulping can be characterized by two main methods: sulfate (Kraft process) <b>pulping</b> and <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping,</b> and these two methods have different benefits. Sulfate pulping can be performed {{on a wide range}} of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping</b> results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, sulfate pulping is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.|$|R

Permeability of ash turn higher with the increasing of volume reduction at the operating condition of 200 kPa and 25 ℃, and retentate was concentrated when volume reduced. Influences of ultrafiltration on physical properties of ammonia <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping</b> liquor and its retentate after ultrafiltration were studied. Results showed that retentate had better performances as surfactant, concrete additive and dispersant. Surface tension of 1 % lignin solution of retentate was 54. 7 mN/m, which was lower than that of the untreated original lignosulfonate by 2. 2 mN/m. Dispersing effect of retentate on cement was also investigated, it was found that flowability of neat cement paste improved from 70 mm to 102 mm...|$|R
50|$|The spent cooking liquor from <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping</b> {{is usually}} called brown liquor, but the terms red liquor, thick liquor and sulfite liquor {{are also used}} (compared to black liquor in the kraft process). Pulp washers, using countercurrent flow, remove the spent cooking {{chemicals}} and degraded lignin and hemicellulose. The extracted brown liquor is concentrated, in multiple effect evaporators. The concentrated brown liquor can be burned in the recovery boiler to generate steam and recover the inorganic chemicals for reuse in the pulping process {{or it can be}} neutralized to recover the useful byproducts of pulping. Recent developments in Chemrec's black liquor gasification process, adapting the technology to use in the <b>sulfite</b> <b>pulping</b> process, could make second generation biofuels production an alternative to the conventional recovery boiler technology. Around 1906 Gösta Ekström a Swedish engineer patented a process of ethanol generation from the residual 2-2.5% fermentable sugars in the spent liquor.|$|R
