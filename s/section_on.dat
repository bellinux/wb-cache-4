5|$|Most of the {{accounts}} of ancient versions were rewritten by distinguished scholars, who were leaders in their several departments. The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “Greek and Latin Palaeography”, by Edward Maunde Thompson. Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced in different places throughout the book. H. J. White rewrote the chapter on Latin versions. G. H. Gwilliam, editor of the Peshitta, helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version. H. Deane made an additions {{to the treatment of}} the Harkleian Version. A. C. Headlam made a revision of the long chapter on the Egyptian versions; F. C. Conybeare, rewrote the sections on the Armenian and Georgian versions; Margoliouth rewrote the sections on the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; J. M. Bebb rewrote the <b>section</b> <b>on</b> the Slavonic version; James W. Bright rewrote the <b>section</b> <b>on</b> the Anglo-Saxon Version.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} between figs and fig wasps is especially well-known (see <b>section</b> <b>on</b> reproduction, above).

These include gallers, inquilines and kleptoparasites as well as parasitoids of both the pollinating and non-pollinating wasps.|$|E

5|$|A Sanskrit scholar Vijnaneshwara {{became famous}} {{in the field of}} legal {{literature}} for his Mitakshara, in the court of Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the most acknowledged work in that field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on Yajnavalkya) based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of modern India. An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the <b>section</b> <b>on</b> inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system. Some important literary works of the time related to music and musical instruments were Sangita Chudamani, Sangita Samayasara and Sangita Ratnakara.|$|E

5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see <b>section</b> <b>on</b> physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above in the <b>section</b> <b>on</b> balance, one effect {{of turning the}} front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession.

5|$|Because of {{high demand}} and limited {{availability}} of the reserved tickets, some people planned to offer their tickets for sale through ticket brokers, Internet auctions and classified listing services.
