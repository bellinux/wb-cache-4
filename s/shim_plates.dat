40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the behavior of an innovative post-tensioned (PT) top-and-seat-angle wide flange (WF) beam-to-column moment connection for steel moment resisting frames subjected to seismic loading conditions. Nine large-scale specimens were tested. Each specimen represented an interior connection and consisted of two WF beams attached to a column. The parameters investigated in the study include the angle size, angle gage length, beam flange reinforcing plates, connection <b>shim</b> <b>plates,</b> and post-tensioning force. The results of the test program demonstrate that post-tensioned connections possess exceptional cyclic strength and ductility. Energy dissipation occurs in the angles while other structural members remain elastic. The initial elastic stiffness is {{comparable to that of}} a welded connection, and following severe inelastic cycles of drift the connection has little permanent deformation...|$|E
30|$|In this study, outriggers, {{which are}} {{horizontal}} structures connecting a building core to distant columns {{to increase the}} lateral stiffness of a tall building, are proposed to reduce DAS. Conventionally, the permanent connection of outriggers to perimeter columns is delayed until {{the completion of the}} structure to avoid the development of shear forces that could be caused by DAS because the outriggers have been conventionally designed to reduce the lateral displacement caused by wind or earthquake loads. Special construction methods, such as delayed joints and adjustment joints with <b>shim</b> <b>plates</b> or oil jacks, have been proposed or used to minimize the impact of DAS during construction (Choi and Joseph 2012; Park et al. 2010). Although the main purpose of the outriggers is to limit the lateral drift of a tall building within an acceptable level (Wu and Li 2003; Hoenderkamp 2008; Lee and Tovar 2014), it is proposed that outriggers can also function as a measure to reduce DAS between core walls and perimeter columns. If the outriggers are designed to reduce DAS and lateral displacement, the additional stresses caused by DAS should be evaluated and considered during the design phase of a tall building.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the Isfahan Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) {{is first}} {{simulated}} using the WIMSD code, and its fuel burn-up after 7 years of operation (when the reactor was revived {{by adding a}} 1. 5 mm thick beryllium <b>shim</b> <b>plate</b> {{to the top of}} its core) and also after 14 years of operation (total operation time of the reactor) is calculated. The reactor is then simulated using the MCNP code, and its reactivity variation due to adding a 1. 5 mm thick beryllium <b>shim</b> <b>plate</b> {{to the top of the}} reactor core, after 7 years of operation, is calculated. The results show good agreement with the available data collected at the revival time. Exess reactivity of the reactor at present time (after 14 years of operation and after 7 years of the the reactor revival time) is also determined both experimentally and by calculation, which show good agreement, and indicate that at the present time there is no need to add any further beryllium <b>shim</b> <b>plate</b> to the top of the reactor core. Furthermore, by adding more beryllium layers with various thicknesses to the top of the reactor core, in the input program of the MCNP program, reactivity value of these layers is calculated. From these results, one can predict the necessary beryllium thickness needed to reach a desired reactivity in the MNSR reactor...|$|R

40|$|Laminated {{rubber bearing}} is a {{significant}} device found in structures such as bridges and buildings. It is used to isolate the foundation and the superstructure from seismic loads. Since it is made up {{from a combination of}} rubbers and steel <b>shim</b> <b>plates</b> in alternate layers which make the laminated rubber bearing a complex material, the measurements of damping of the laminated rubber bearing is difficult in practice. Damping is a dissipation of energy or energy losses in the vibration of the structure when the structures are excited with external dynamic loading. An accurate value of damping is very important as damping plays a crucial role in fixing the borderline between stability and instability in many structural systems. A small amount of damping will have a big influence on the systems. Therefore, it is essential to determine the accurate value of damping in structural analysis especially in finite element analysis. Modal analysis is one of the methods {{that can be used to}} determine dynamic properties including damping in any structures. Hence, the main objectives of this research are to determine the Rayleigh's damping coefficients, α andβ and to evaluate the performance of the laminated rubber bearing using modal analysis. There are two methods of modal analysis which are the finite element modal analysis and the experimental modal analysis. Initially, the natural frequencies and mode shapes from both methods are compared and validated. When the natural frequencies and mode shapes are well correlated, the damping ratio values from the experimental modal analysis are used to determine the Rayleigh's damping coefficients α and β. The Rayleigh's damping coefficients that have been determined by experiment are then inserted in the finite element modal analysis to evaluate the performance of the laminated rubber bearing in term of natural frequencies, mode shapes, minimum displacement and maximum displacement with the addition of Rayleigh's damping coefficient. Based on the finding, the finite element modal analysis with the added Rayleigh's damping coefficients α and β shows a good agreement with the experimental modal analysis in term of natural frequencies and mode shapes. The value of natural frequencies reduces after the Rayleigh's damping coefficients are added into the finite element modal analysis and the minimum and maximum displacement are found to be unaffected by the Rayleigh's damping coefficients. It can be concluded that modal analysis method can be used to estimate the accurate values of damping ratio and to determine the Rayleigh's damping coefficients α and β as well. The damping ratio of the first mode from the experimental modal analysis can also be used to determine the Rayleigh's damping coefficients α and β...|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{society has}} become reliant of fossil energy based {{transportation}} fuels which are unsustainable and produce {{significant amounts of}} pollutants. With diminishing fossil energy reserves, an increased focus on renewable energy and growing fuel demands an alternative is required. A potential solution to this {{is to use a}} small scale Fischer-Tropsch synthesis system to produce hydrocarbon fuels as part of a biomass to liquids process. This research investigated various cobalt catalyst formations and Fischer-Tropsch reactor designs to identify the most suitable combination to for a small scale system to convert 10 SL∙min- 1 of synthesis gas to hydrocarbons. Catalysts were created using washcoating, electrochemical deposition and solution combustion synthesis methods and tested in {{one or both of the}} two reactor designs. The first reactor design utilised a 2 mm x 20 mm channel which held a catalyst support structure made from wire mesh or metal foam which also created microchannel type flow spaces. The second reactor design consisted of various numbers of 0. 3 - 3 mm wide wire-cut microchannels in a thin stainless steel <b>shim</b> <b>plate.</b> Catalysts formed in the first reactor design using washcoating or solution combustion synthesis methods were found to agglomerate forming large particles which presented no detectable activity for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Forming the catalysts for this reactor ex-situ using electrochemical deposition was successful in producing fine microstructures of catalyst which were initially active for the reaction. This activity did not last however with a complete loss after a few hours on stream. Using the microchannel reactor design, the results were much more successful. Micro-structured catalysts were able to be created using both the washcoating and solution combustion synthesis methods. However for wider channels only the solution combustion synthesis method could produce suitable catalysts with 0. 9 mm found to be the optimum channel width. The solution combustion synthesis catalyst achieved a higher average CO conversions of 40 ± 2 % than the washcoat (20 ± 3 %) when run in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis conditions. Analysing the hydrocarbon product from the solution combustion synthesis catalyst run yielded an ASF α value of 0. 795 and a C 5 + selectivity of 73 % which are very comparable to the literature. This combination was utilised to design a larger system which with the addition of a heat exchange system can be scaled up to run in the biomass to liquids system...|$|R
40|$|The Nigeria Research Reactor- 1 (NIRR- 1) is a {{low power}} {{miniature}} neutron source reactor (MNSR) located at the Centre for Energy Research and Training, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria Nigeria. The reactor went critical with initial core excess reactivity of 3. 77 Â mk. The NIRR- 1 cold excess reactivity measured {{at the time of}} commissioning was determined to be 4. 97 Â mk, which is more than the licensed range of 3. 5 â 4 Â mk. Hence some cadmium poison worth â 1. 2 Â mk was inserted into one of the inner irradiation sites which act as reactivity regulating device {{in order to reduce the}} core excess reactivity to 3. 77 Â mk, which is within recommended licensed range of 3. 5 Â mk and 4. 0 Â mk. In this present study, the burn-up calculations of the NIRR- 1 fuel and the estimation of the core life time expectancy after 10 Â years (the reactor core expected cycle) have been conducted using the codes WIMS and CITATION. The burn-up analyses carried out indicated that the excess reactivity of NIRR- 1 follows a linear decreasing trend having 216 Effective Full Power Days (EFPD) operations. The reactivity worth of top beryllium <b>shim</b> data <b>plates</b> was calculated to be 19. 072 Â mk. The result of depletion analysis for NIRR- 1 core shows that (7. 9947 Â Â±Â  0. 0008) g of U- 235 was consumed for the period of 12 Â years of operating time.

40|$|The {{cross flow}} from channel to channel through gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) under the land could {{play an important}} role for water removal in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL have been investigated experimentally, through measuring unsteady pressure drop in a cell which has the GDL initially wet with liquid water. The thickness of GDL is carefully controlled by inserting various thicknesses of metal <b>shims</b> between the <b>plates.</b> It has been found that severe compression of GDL could result in excessive pressure drop from channel inlet to channel outlet. Removing liquid water from GDL by cross flow is difficult for GDL with high compression levels and for low inlet air flow rates. However, effective water removal can still be achieved at high compression levels of GDL if the inlet air flow rate is high. Based on different compressed GDL thicknesses, different GDL porosities and permeabilities were calculated and their effects on the characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL were evaluated. Visualization of liquid water transport has been conducted by using transparent flow channel, and liquid water removal from GDL under the land was observed for all the tested inlet air flow rates, which confirms that cross flow is practically effective to remove the liquid water accumulated in GDL under the land area.

30|$|Fourar et al. (1993) {{conducted}} air–water flow {{experiments in}} three horizontal rough-walled fractures. In {{one of the}} models, the two surfaces (plates) were in contact whereas in the other two, the surfaces were separated using a spacer (gasket). The surface roughness was established by applying a 0.3 -mm-thick layer of epoxy cement and gluing a layer of 1  mm in diameter glass beads on both glass plates. The water saturation was calculated using the volume balance method. They found that the experimental relative permeability to air and water is not linearly dependent on the saturation. The best data fit to the experimental data was obtained by the homogenous single-phase model (HSPM). The HSPM approximates two-phase flow by a single-phase approximation where the single-phase effective properties are determined from {{the properties of the}} two phases. Similar to flow in pipes, a correlation between the friction factor and average Reynolds number was used to predict the pressure drop in each model configuration. Persoff and Pruess (1995) evaluated the flow of gas and water through a natural rough-walled rock fracture and three transparent epoxy resin replica models. Relative permeability measurements indicated phase interference between the two phases. This was counter to the view (which is adapted in some reservoir engineering and numerical simulation applications) that relative permeability of each phase is equal to its saturation, that is, the relative permeability curves are straight with no immobile phase saturations. Diomampo (2001) conducted a study on the relative permeability of nitrogen–water system in a rough-walled fracture. A smooth-walled model was roughened by inserting a wire mesh between glass (top) and aluminum (bottom) plates. Similar to the smooth-walled fracture, each phase traveled through the fracture in a localized continuous flow path, however, the stability of the path heavily depended on the nitrogen–water flow rate ratio. At low gas–water ratios, invading water blocked the gas path, leaving behind discontinuous gas bubbles. In contrast to this, more stable and wide flow paths of gas were formed at high gas–water flow rate ratios. The data fit obtained using the homogeneous single-phase model did not provide a satisfactory representation of nitrogen–water flow in the fracture. However, she observed similar flow structures on both the smooth- and rough-walled fractures, which differ from the flow structures suggested by Fourar and Bories (1995). Chen and Horne (2004), and Chen (2005) found that the flow structures of gas and water flow in rough-walled fracture is more scattered and tortuous compared to the ones observed with the smooth-walled fracture. Also, they observed phase trapping of gas and water due to fracture aperture variations and to capillary pressure effects. Steam and water flow in smooth-walled fracture demonstrated multiple unstable flow patterns whereas in the nitrogen and water system, each phase tended to form its own flow path with blocking and unblocking by the other phase. Chen and Horne (2006) defined channel tortuosity to quantify the flow paths created by each phase in rough-walled fractures. They found that the magnitude of the flow channel tortuosity increases when the heterogeneity of the fracture increases. Pan (1999) studied oil–water flow in rough-walled fractures. His apparatus consisted of two plates of roughened Plexiglas. The roughness was created by gluing glass beads of known mesh size on both inner faces of the two <b>plates.</b> <b>Shim</b> stock of varying thickness was inserted at the periphery for fracture aperture adjustment. Over all of the conditions of his experimental runs, he observed a dispersed flow regime and found that the relative permeability of oil is a function of oil saturation, viscosity ratio, and flow pattern whereas the relative permeability to water depends mostly on water saturation. The effects of surface roughness on relative permeability to oil and water were more pronounced for smaller fracture aperture and at higher pressure gradient, i.e., the relative permeabilities and flow patterns observed in the rough-walled fracture with larger aperture were similar to the ones observed with the smooth-walled fracture. The results of previous experimental studies of multiphase flow in roughened model fracture demonstrates that the flow structure is complex and that capillary pressure effects and flow path tortuosity affect phase trapping and, consequently, relative permeability, that is, phase flow interference occurs.|$|R
