40|$|In {{the last}} lecture, we {{analyzed}} the Move-To-Front heuristic for searching in a self-organizing linkedlist. In particular, {{we showed that}} Move-To-Front is both statically and dynamically optimal (as good as any dynamic list) up to a factor of 2, provided we work under Sleator & Tarjan’s cost model. We also introduced an omniscient algorithm called Order-By-Next-Request [Mun 00], and proved that it is exponentially faster than Move-To-Front or any other online algorithm for a particular request <b>sequence</b> (<b>listing</b> the elements in order). In this lecture, we will continue our discussion of self-organizing lists by showing that Munro’s Order-By-Next-Request strategy is not only better than all online algorithms, but amortized it achieves the “entropy ” bound, {{which is the best}} possible performance for any comparison-based search structure in the stochastic model. Then, we will move on to a new topic: trees. First, we will discuss optimal binary search trees; then, we will cover self-organizing trees and splay trees, explain how they work, and describe some of the bounds known about them. 2 Self-Organizing Lists (continued) We finish our discussion of Munro’s Order-By-Next-Request (ONR) strategy [Mun 00] by showing that the amortized cost of the algorithm achieves the entropy bound.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{proposes a}} new fast {{algorithm}} named MFISS-FG (maximal frequent item sequence sets fast generating) finding maximal frequent item sequences from relational database. It adapts to datasets with few attributes and large instances. Itemset {{is defined as}} IS (item sequence) for mining. Two lists called ISL (Item <b>Sequence</b> <b>List)</b> and FISL (Frequent Item <b>Sequence</b> <b>List)</b> are created by scanning database once for dividing n-IS into two categories {{depending on whether the}} IS to achieve minimum support number (n is the number of attributes). SIS (Sub item sequences) whose n-superset is in ISL are generated by recursion to make sure that each k-SIS appeared before its (k+ 1) -superset (k range from 1 to n- 1). As current k-SIS being joined to FISL, its (k- 1) -SIS are pruned (k range from 2 to n- 1). At last, all SISs whose n-superset is in FISL are pruned from FISL to hold all maximal frequent item sequences. We compare our MFISS-FG and FP-Growth by a set of time-consuming experiments to prove the superiority of MFISS-FG both not only with increasing datasets but also with changing mini-support...|$|R
