50|$|Squegging is an {{oscillation}} {{that builds}} up and dies {{down with a}} much longer time constant than the fundamental frequency of the oscillation. A <b>self-quenching</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuit oscillates at two or more frequencies at the same time.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and the electric field gradient is described. Expressions {{for the energy}} levels (I = 1), the nuclear quadrupolar resonance, NQR, transition frequencies and line shape are derived. The general equations to obtain the inverse line width parameter, T$ sb 2 sp star,$ from the <b>self-quenched</b> super-regenerative <b>oscillator,</b> SRO, NQR spectra are derived and tested. The construction and operation of the $ sp{ 14 }$N Sullivan and Dean SRO spectrometers are described. Limits in {{the sensitivity of the}} SRO to yield T$ sb 2 sp star$ data are discussed. The operation and the constraints in obtaining line width data from a pulsed-FT spectrometer are given. The temperature dependence of $ sp{ 14 }$N NQR frequencies, T$ sb 2 sp star$ and line widths of series of anilines and hexamethylenetetramine are reported. The NQR frequency and the contribution of static and dynamic effects to the line width are discussed as a function of temperature. The observed phase transitions are discussed...|$|R
