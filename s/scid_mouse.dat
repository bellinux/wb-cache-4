40|$|Mice {{with severe}} {{combined}} immunodeficiency (<b>SCID</b> <b>mice)</b> lack functional B and T cells. Egg laying by Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum was delayed in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice,</b> but {{in a matter of}} weeks worm fecundity was equivalent to that in intact <b>mice.</b> <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> formed smaller hepatic granulomas and showed less fibrosis than did intact mice. The reduction in egg-associated pathology in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> correlated with marked reductions in interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 5, IL- 13, and gamma interferon mRNA expression in the liver. S. mansoni infections were frequently lethal for <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> infected for more than 9 weeks, while S. japonicum-infected <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> died at the same rate as infected intact mice. We were unable to affect hepatic granuloma formation or egg laying by worms in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> by administration of recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In fact, <b>SCID</b> and BALB/c <b>mice</b> appeared to express nearly equivalent levels of TNF-α mRNA in their granulomatous tissues, suggesting that there is little or no deficit in TNF-α expression in infected <b>SCID</b> <b>mice.</b> The data indicate that TNF-α may be in large part derived from a non-T-cell source. Together, these findings provide little evidence that TNF-α alone can reconstitute early fecundity, granuloma formation, or hepatic fibrosis in schistosome-infected <b>SCID</b> <b>mice...</b>|$|R
40|$|The lactic {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) {{level in}} plasma and the clearance of LDH in C. B- 17 scid (severe combined immunodeficiency; <b>SCID)</b> <b>mice</b> {{were compared with}} those in C. B- 17 or BALB/cCrSlc mice with or without lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV) infection. The resting enzyme level in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> showed little difference from that in C. B- 17 or BALB/cCrSlc mice. The degree of increased plasma LDH level in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> was lower than that in C. B- 17 and BALB/cCrSlc mice after LDV infection. To assess the mechanisms of decrease in LDH elevation in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> infected with LDV, virus replication was compared in <b>SCID</b> and BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> The infectivity titre of plasma in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> was higher (more than 10 times) than that in BALB/cCrSlc mice. Moreover, the percentage of virus antigen positive Kupffer cells was higher in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> than that in BALB/cCrSlc mice. The level of endogenous LDH release {{as a result of}} carbon tetrachloride treatment was similar in the <b>SCID</b> and BALB/cCrSlc <b>mice.</b> The clearance rate of endogenous LDH was greater in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> than in BALB/cCrSlc mice with or without LDV infection. The rate of clearance of intravenously injected porcine LDH- 5, but not porcine LDH- 1, was enhanced in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> as compared with that in BALB/cCrSlc mice. Furthermore, carbon clearance was higher in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> than that in BALB/cCrSlc mice. These results suggest that the smaller increase of plasma LDH after infection might be due, at least in part, to the enhanced LDH- 5 clearance function by macrophages in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} model of human thymus growth in vivo, we have {{implanted}} postnatal human thymus under the renal capsule of severe combined immune deficient (<b>SCID)</b> <b>mice</b> and assayed for graft survival and graft characteristics 1 - 3 mo after engraftment. Three groups of <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> were engrafted with postnatal human thymus: untreated <b>SCID</b> <b>mice,</b> <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> pretreated with 400 cGy of gamma irradiation 1 - 5 d before engraftment, and <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> treated with intraperitoneal anti-asialo GM- 1 antiserum every 4 - 5 d during engraftment. In the untreated group of <b>SCID</b> <b>mice,</b> only 37 % of grafts survived and consisted of human thymic microenvironment components and human immature thymocytes. Irradiation of <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> before engraftment improved survival of human thymic grafts to 83 %, but these grafts were largely devoid of thymocytes and contained only thymic microenvironment components {{with large numbers of}} thymic macrophages. Treatment of <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> with anti-asialo GM- 1 antiserum throughout the engraftment period also promoted human thymus engraftment (70 %) and induced SCID B cell Ig production (SCID[Ig+]) in 38 % of animals. In SCID(Ig-) anti-asialo GM- 1 -treated mice, the human thymic grafts were similar in content to those in untreated <b>SCID</b> <b>mice.</b> However, in anti-asialo GM- 1 -treated animals with grafts that became SCID(Ig+), all animals were found to have mouse-human chimeric grafts in that the human thymic microenvironment (human fibroblasts, thymic epithelium, vessels) was colonized by murine T cells. These data demonstrate that human postnatal thymus will grow as xenografts in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice,</b> and that the components of human thymus that engraft are dependent on the immunosuppressive regimen used in recipient mice. A striking finding in this study was the induction of T and B lymphopoiesis in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> by abrogation of NK cell activity with in vivo anti-asialo GM- 1 treatment. These data strongly suggest that asialo GM- 1 + NK cells and/or macrophages play a role in mediation of suppression of lymphopoiesis in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice...</b>|$|R

40|$|Oestrogen has the {{capacity}} to suppress T cell-dependent DTH. To explore the mechanisms whereby oestrogen exerts its effects on the immune system we have used <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> which are largely devoid of functional T and B lymphocytes, hence being unable to raise DTH, but display intact antigen-presenting capacity. Transfer of lymphocytes to <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> restores the DTH capacity. In order to analyse if oestrogen down-regulates DTH by a direct action on T cells we reconstituted <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> with either splenocytes or thymocytes from congenic C. B- 17 or allogeneic B 6 donor mice. Either donor or recipient mice were exposed to estradiol before cell transfer. DTH response was registered in recipient <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> 1 and 3 weeks after challenge with oxazolone (OXA). <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> receiving estradiol-exposed spleen cells from congenic or allogeneic donor mice displayed lower DTH responses compared with control <b>mice.</b> In contrast, <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> receiving estradiol-exposed thymocytes from congenic donor mice showed no significant difference in DTH response compared with control <b>mice.</b> Estradiol-treated <b>SCID</b> <b>mice,</b> transferred with either spleen cells or thymocytes from congenic, hormonally non-treated donors, displayed a significantly lower DTH response compared with control mice. In contrast, estradiol-treated <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> receiving hormonally non-treated allogeneic spleen cells showed no difference in DTH response compared with control mice. The results show that T lymphocytes are not the target cell population for estradiol-mediated suppression of DTH in reconstituted female <b>SCID</b> <b>mice...</b>|$|R

After development of nonulcerative nodules, <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> were inoculated with splenocytes from either Leishmania-infected or naive immunocompetent mice, resulting in ulceration in all mice. When naive splenocytes were depleted of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, or B 220 + cell populations and the remaining cells were injected into Leishmania-infected <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> after the development of nodules, only <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> inoculated with splenocytes depleted of CD 4 + cells did not show ulceration.

50|$|A humanized mouse is a mouse {{carrying}} functioning human genes, cells, tissues, and/or organs. Humanized mice {{are commonly}} used as small animal models in biological and medical research for human therapeutics. Immunodeficient mice are often used as recipients for human cells or tissues, because they can relatively easily accept heterologous cells {{due to lack of}} host immunity. Traditionally, the nude mouse and severe combined immunodeficiency (<b>SCID)</b> <b>mouse</b> have been used for this purpose, but recently the NOG mouse and the NSG mouse have been shown to engraft human cells and tissues more efficiently than other models.Two mouse strains, called MITRG and MISTRG, were described in which human versions of four genes encoding cytokines important for innate immune cell development are knocked into their respective mouse loci. Such humanized mouse models may be used to model the human immune system in scenarios of health and pathology, and may enable evaluation of therapeutic candidates in an in vivo setting relevant to human physiology.|$|E

5000|$|The coding ends are {{processed}} further {{prior to their}} ligation by several events that ultimately lead to junctional diversity. Processing begins when DNA-PK binds to each broken DNA end and recruits several other proteins including Artemis, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, Cernunnos, and several DNA polymerases. DNA-PK forms a complex that leads to its autophosphorylation, resulting in activation of Artemis. The coding end hairpins are opened by the activity of Artemis. If they are opened at the center, a blunt DNA end will result; however in many cases, the opening is [...] "off-center" [...] and results in extra bases remaining on one strand (an overhang). These are known as palindromic (P) nucleotides due to the palindromic nature of the sequence produced when DNA repair enzymes resolve the overhang.

However, CI-immunized or non-immunized DBA/ 1 J mice cells did not induce arthritis in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice.</b> <b>SCID</b> recipients of pre-arthritic CIA lymphocytes presented increase in CII antibody, but showed no clinical signs of arthritis, suggesting that antibodies to CII {{alone can not}} induce CIA.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of lymphocytes into {{severe combined immunodeficiency}} (<b>SCID)</b> <b>mice</b> induces a series of histological changes in the spleen, including the appearance of mature follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Studies were undertaken to clarify the role of lymphotoxin (LT) in this process. The results show that <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> have a small and partially differentiated white pulp containing marginal zone and interdigitating dendritic cells, but lacking FDCs. Transferred spleen cells can segregate into T and B cell areas shortly after their injection to <b>SCID</b> <b>mice.</b> This ability is dependent on signaling through LT- � receptor (LT-�R), since blocking ligand–receptor interaction in recipient <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> ablates {{the capacity of the}} transferred cells to segregate. A week after lymphocyte transfer, host-derived FDCs appeared in the reconstituted <b>SCID</b> <b>mice.</b> This induction of FDCs is dependent on LT-�R signaling by B cells since LT- � �/ � B cells are incapable of inducing development of FDCs in <b>SCID</b> <b>mice,</b> even after co{{transfer of}} LT- � �/ � T cells.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of <b>SCID</b> <b>mouse</b> P. carinii gpA subclones derived from the PCR products identified two isoforms, which were 89 % identical {{to each other in}} the amplified region and 73 and 54 % identical to the rat- and ferret-derived P. carinii gpA genes, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of mouse, ferret, and rat P. carinii gpAs revealed striking similarity in residues adjacent to and including the conserved cysteines. Furthermore, the spacing of two proline residues is invariant, and a potential N-linked glycosylation site is found at a similar position in all of the gpAs. Despite the heterogeneity observed in P. carinii gpAs, the conservation of cysteine residues and adjacent sequences implies similar secondary structure and, most likely, similar function for the gpAs of P. carinii isolated from different host species...|$|E
40|$|Coxiella burnetii is an acidophilic, {{intracellular}} bacterium {{that causes}} the human disease Q fever. In some studies, {{it is important to}} distinguish between viable and nonviable C. burnetii. We compared four methods for detecting and measuring viable C. burnetii in biological samples as follows: growth in two different cell culture lines, infection of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (leading to death) and infection of SCID mice with detection of C. burnetii in their spleen (after euthanasia at day 50 postinfection). Two isolates of C. burnetii were used (Henzerling and Arandale). Our in-house qPCR assay for C. burnetii DNA was used as a control. <b>SCID</b> <b>mouse</b> inoculation was more sensitive than cell culture. The assay that detected C. burnetii in <b>SCID</b> <b>mouse</b> spleens was slightly more sensitive than SCID mice deaths alone. Approximately one viable C. burnetii cell could be detected by this method, making it suitable for determining the viability of C. burnetii in a sample...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of CD 4 + cells and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) {{in the resolution}} of established Cryptosporidium parvum infection was investigated with a murine model of cryptosporidiosis in severe combined immunodeficient (<b>SCID)</b> <b>mice.</b> C. parvum-infected <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> were reconstituted with spleen cells from immunocompetent donors. The recipients were able to resolve their C. parvum infection by 17 days postreconstitution. Treatment of reconstituted <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> with either anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibodies to deplete them of CD 4 + cells or with anti-IFN-gamma to neutralize IFN-gamma activity reduced or eliminated their ability to resolve C. parvum infection whereas treatment with either anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibodies or anti-asialo-GM 1 antibodies had no effect. We also found C. parvum-specific antibodies in serum samples from two of four reconstituted <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> killed on postreconstitution day 17 but not in unreconstituted <b>SCID</b> <b>mice.</b> Moreover, anti-CD 4 -treated mice had no detectable specific antibodies to C. parvum, whereas all mice treated with either anti-CD 8 or anti-asialo-GM 1 had substantial levels of specific antibodies in their serum. Although {{the role of the}} specific antibody is not known, these findings clearly indicate that resolution of an established C. parvum infection in immunologically reconstituted <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> is dependent on both CD 4 + cells and IFN-gamma...|$|R
40|$|Parenteral strobilation of Echinococcus multilocularis was {{observed}} in scid (severe combined immuno-deficient) mice after intracerebral, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal inoculation with protoscoleces. Evaginated protoscoleces and segmented worms were obtained at the inoculated sites. Most worms recovered from peritoneal cavity of <b>scid</b> <b>mice</b> were encapsulated by connective tissue and granulocytes but showed a maximum of 3 proglottids, elongation of genital primordia and vesiculation. Viability of worms recovered from the subcutaneous tissue and peritoneal cavity of <b>scid</b> <b>mice</b> were higher (69. 1 - 91. 4 %) than those from the immunologically normal C. B- 17 (4. 0 - 48. 0 %) control mice. However, viabilities of worms from the cerebrum of both scid and C. B- 17 were almost the same (87. 7 - 94. 4 %). Worms recovered from <b>scid</b> <b>mice</b> showed further develop-ment of reproductive organs when transplanted into the small intestine of pred-nisolone treated golden hamster. These {{findings suggest that the}} parenteral milieu of <b>scid</b> <b>mice</b> allows adult development of E. multilocularis protoscoleces.

40|$|Background: Both {{the role}} of {{inducible}} nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) {{in the development of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as the molecular details governing its mucosal induction remain unclear. Methods: In the present study we evaluated {{the role of}} the residing intestinal microflora in the induction of epithelial iNOS upon transfer of CD 45 RB(high) CD 4 (+) T cells to <b>SCID</b> <b>mice.</b> CB- 17 <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> were reared with conventional flora (CNV) or germfree CB- 17 <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> were monoassociated with Helicobacter muridarum, act A(-) mutant Listeria monocytogenes, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), or Ochrobactrum anthropi. Results: Within 2 weeks CNV <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> injected with CD 45 RB high CD 4 + T cells showed a focal, epithelial iNOS expression on the apical site of villi that preceded the infiltration of CD 4 (+) T cells and cytokine production followed by extension of this expression to the entire surface along the whole crypt axis as the colitis progressed. <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> monoassociated with H. muridarum developed a severe colitis and showed high epithelial iNOS expression. CNV-SCID mice without T cells and <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> monoassociated with SFB did not show any iNOS expression, whereas <b>SCID</b> <b>mice</b> monoassociated with act A(-) mutant L. monocytogenes and O. anthropi showed some scattered epithelial iNOS staining on the apical site of a few villi, but none of these mice developed colitis. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the expression of epithelial iNOS is highly bacterium-specific and correlates with the severity of disease, suggesting an important role for this enzyme in the development of IBD...|$|R
