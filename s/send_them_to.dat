5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The division’s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength. Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, {{the division}} {{was sent to the}} Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{combined}} operations {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols were again {{made for the}} following winter offensives, in 1301 and 1302. But in mid-1301 the island of Ruad was attacked by the Egyptian Mamluks. After a lengthy siege, the island surrendered in 1302 or 1303. The Mamluks slaughtered many of the inhabitants, and captured the surviving Templars to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> prison in Cairo. In late 1301, Ghazan sent letters to the pope asking him to send troops, priests, and peasants, to make the Holy Land a Frank state again.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the {{military}} leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Grisons as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to a pause in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} Baldassare Ceola, the police {{commissioner}} of Palermo, {{concluded that the}} crime had probably been carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascioferro's direction. Evidence was thin, however, and the case was effectively closed when in July 1911 the Palermo Court of Appeals discharged Cascioferro, as well as Costantino and Passananti, due to insufficient evidence to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> trial. Petrosino's murder was never solved. Nevertheless, Costantino and Passananti were identified as the most likely assassins. Costantino died in the late 1930s and Passananti, in March 1969. In 2014, {{more than a century}} after the assassination, the Italian police overheard a tapped phone conversation in which a sibling claimed that Paolo Palazzotto had been the killer on the orders of Cascioferro. Palazzotto had been arrested after the shooting, but had been released for lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Raglan wished to {{reinforce}} the Turks and British infantry, and ordered Lucan to detach {{four of the five}} Heavy Brigade cavalry regiments and <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the defensive line. This further angered Lucan, since splitting the force in half merely reduced the cavalry's overall effectiveness, but he again complied. The result was that the first fork of the Russian cavalry attack encountered The Thin Red Line and were driven off, while the second fork, crossing the heights above the plain, encountered four regiments of the Heavy Brigade. The Russians – with between 1,500 and 2,000 men – were initially surprised to see the 800 British cavalry approaching, allowing Scarlett, the commander of the Heavy Brigades, to charge the Russians uphill. By this point Lucan had left Lord Cardigan in charge of the Light Brigade and raced over to the Heavies, later claiming that his duty trumpeter had ordered the British charge, which eventually forced the Russians to flee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wild}} card round of the playoffs, the Giants hosted Atlanta Falcons and won 24–2, with the Falcons' only score from a safety due to Eli Manning being flagged for {{grounding}} in the end zone. In the divisional round, the Giants were forced to play the defending champion Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field. The Packers had finished the regular season with a league-best 15-1 record, including a 38-35 win against the Giants in Week 13. In addition, the Packers received a first-round bye, and thus this was their first playoff match. Despite these obstacles, the Giants handily defeated the Packers 37-20 {{to qualify for the}} NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers. With the score tied 17-17 in regulation, the Giants moved into field goal range in overtime and Lawrence Tynes, the hero of the 2007 postseason, kicked a 20-yard field goal to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Super Bowl XLVI, a rematch against the New England Patriots.|$|E

5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June 1952, Bleak {{was part}} of a patrol of the 2nd Battalion, 223rd Infantry, sent north to probe Chinese forward {{positions}} and attempt to obtain Chinese prisoners of war for interrogation. Bleak volunteered to accompany the 20-man patrol of an I Platoon on this mission, which was to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a sparsely vegetated feature called Hill 499, where Chinese forces were known to be operating. The patrol left United Nations lines at 04:30 Korea Standard Time on 14 June, under cover of darkness. It was preceded by an attack by F Company, 223rd Infantry, to the west which was intended to distract Chinese forces. However, as the patrol ascended the hill, it came under heavy Chinese automatic weapons fire which struck the lead elements, injuring several soldiers. Bleak, {{at the rear of the}} formation, rushed forward and treated and stabilized several soldiers hit in the initial volley, then followed the remainder of the patrol as it continued its mission.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} news of the change of government, former viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{prepared}} a counter-revolution from the city of Córdoba, but Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo routed his militia and captured all the leaders {{in just a couple of}} skirmishes. The initial orders were to <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Buenos Aires, but after their capture the Junta decided to execute them. This decision was taken in a resolution signed by all members of the Junta, excepting Manuel Alberti, because as a priest, he could not give consent to the death penalty. The measure found strong popular resistance in Córdoba, as Liniers and the governor Juan Gutierrez de la Concha were popular and the execution of a priest (Rodrigo de Orellana, another leader of the counter-revolution) was rejected as heretical. Ocampo and Chiclana decided to carry on with the original orders, and transferred the prisoners to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for {{one or another of}} the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after the Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E
5|$|Cornelio Saavedra {{was aware}} that the Junta would be {{resisted}} by factions still loyal to the old authorities. It was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at Córdoba. During this early period, the Junta worked united against the royalist threats. Mariano Moreno, the secretary of war, drafted the decrees and regulations to deal with royalists. First, a decree ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes, and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people. The Royal Audiencia swore loyalty to the Regency Council, in defiance to the Junta, so they were summoned, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno organized as well the Paraguay campaign and the First Upper Peru campaign, to the plazas that resisted the Junta. The second one, headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, would move to Córdoba and attack the counter-revolution; before marching to Upper Peru. Ocampo's initial orders were to capture the counter-revolutionary leaders and <b>send</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Buenos Aires, so that they could be judged. When the counter-revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot {{as soon as they were}} captured instead of brought to trial. The new orders were carried out by Juan José Castelli. Cornelio Saavedra supported all these measures.|$|E
