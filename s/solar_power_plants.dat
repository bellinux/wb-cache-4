40|$|An on-grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> will {{distribute}} {{electric power}} to the grid in normal conditions. But when the supply of grid outages (islanding), on-grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> also can’t operate because {{the loss of the}} reference signal that is used as a reference for the inverter in the synchronization process. So there is potential loss of <b>power</b> when <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> {{can be used as a}} substitute source of electrical energy while PLN can’t serve consumers. In this r esearch developed a simulation model that refers to the off grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> 500 Wp in the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Udayana and can operate on-grid and off grid when islanding in matlab simulink. In this model made operation scenario where <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> operates on grid at the beginning of the simulation and after that operate off-grid (not connected to the grid and supply the local load). The simulation results show the model off grid <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> has been able to generate a voltage of 220 V and a frequency of 50 Hz in accordance with the <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> at the research site.

5|$|Some <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{with power}} tower designs in the Mojave Desert {{have come under}} {{scrutiny}} for bird mortality. In general, these facilities are fenced off to help keep terrestrial wildlife out.

5|$|There {{are several}} <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in the Mojave Desert which supply {{power to the}} {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> may use {{thermal storage}} to store solar energy, {{such as in}} {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating {{solar plants}} in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use, because concentrating <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> with wet-cooling systems have high water-consumption intensities {{compared}} to other types of electric power plants; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> with wet cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210). A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.|$|E

5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E
5|$|Solar panels produce {{direct current}} (DC) electricity, so solar parks need {{conversion}} equipment to convert this to alternating current (AC), {{which is the}} form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by inverters. To maximise their efficiency, <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> also incorporate maximum power point trackers, either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point.|$|E

5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and the Mojave Desert {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, {{engineer}} and solar energy pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, {{which has a}} lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company {{with the intent of}} building larger <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.|$|E
