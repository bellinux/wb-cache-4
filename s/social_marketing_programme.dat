40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure for society {{to move towards}} more sustainable use of its resources, and calls in the literature {{have been made to}} reassess marketing’s role in achieving such goals. This research examines how key behavioural factors influence household water use, {{in the context of a}} <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme</b> to reduce household water consumption. A model of the key drivers of household water consumption is developed and tested using a sample of 909 households in a regional city in Australia. The findings from this study support the model developed and show that in the absence of price as a rationing mechanism, the <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme</b> significantly reduces household water consumption. Statement of contribution: This is the first study to develop a comprehensive and empirically tested model of the non-price drivers of household water consumption, within the context of a social marketing intervention. The findings make a contribution to the field of consumer behaviour and social marketing by illustrating key behavioural drivers of water consumption.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis was to map the {{reception}} context of <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> communication programs that is expressed in individual’s beliefs and interpretation of <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> projects and organisation’s social responsibility. I assumed that these beliefs and interpretations are used also in reception of concrete social campaigns. For now the main emphasise in Estonia is laid on communication programmes {{that are based on}} influencing individual behaviour. But what perspectives do <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes</b> have that are based on networks and which have gained popularity in Western societies. This master thesis is a pilot research, as <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> has not been studied from the position of the consumers. The empirical material is based on ten interviews with consumers and also two expert interviews with the leaders of Estonian biggest children’s funds were made for collecting background information. The research showed that the interpretation of <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes</b> depends largely on individual’s values. More individualistic individuals are motivated by their own benefit and find that with wide and long-term communication <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes</b> can change the norms in society and influence individual behaviour. More collectivistic respondents interpret social responsibility as a moral duty that an organisation will have when it reaches to certain stadium in its development. The social campaigns that are directed to the development of social networks are more understandable for them. The main conclusion of the thesis is that in Estonia there is output to short-term individual behaviour based social communication as well as to social campaigns that are directed to building networks and producing social capital. Which kind <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> to use depends on individual’s collectivistic-individualistic values. As the younger and with higher social status generation (that usually have lauder “voice” in the society) values mostly individualistic values, the interpretation that is oriented in short-term individual behaviour and that emphasises organisation’s position may dominate {{for a long time in}} <b>social</b> <b>marketing.</b> But at the same time network-based approach has more potential in the groups that are older, less secured and that have more collectivistic values...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>marketing</b> is {{receiving}} unprecedented focus {{and support from}} government, {{the private sector and}} charities internationally. <b>Social</b> <b>marketing</b> attempts to educate people in the hope that they will make ‘informed’(i. e. healthy) choices regarding diet, lifestyle and health related issues. The effective application of <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> principles can be complex and controversial. <b>Social</b> <b>marketing</b> planning cannot be reduced to a simple set of actions on a checklist; there is no single strategy for success and strategies that have proved successful with one population may not transfer to other populations.

Uniformly high coverage of ITNs characterized these trials and this resulted in some protection of nearby non-users of ITNs. We have now assessed the coverage, distribution pattern and resultant spatial effects in one village in Tanzania where ITNs were distributed in a <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme.</b> The prevalence of parasitaemia, mild anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl) and moderate/severe anaemia (Hb < 8 g/dl) in children under five was assessed cross-sectionally. Data on ownership of ITNs were collected and inhabitants' houses were mapped. One year after the start of the <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme,</b> 52 % of the children were using a net which had been treated at least once. The ITNs were rather homogeneously distributed throughout the village at an average density of about 118 ITNs per thousand population. There was no evidence of a pattern in the distribution of parasitaemia and anaemia cases, but children living in areas of moderately high ITN coverage were about half as likely to have moderate/severe anaemia (OR 0. 5, 95 % CI: 0. 2, 0. 9) and had lower prevalence of splenomegaly, irrespective of their net use. No protective effects of coverage were found for prevalence of mild anaemia nor for parasitaemia. The use of untreated nets had neither coverage nor short distance effects.

40|$|In Ghana, data on HIV {{prevalence}} {{in the ten}} regions indicates that, {{the country}} has failed to realise a consistent decline of HIV new infections. This has resulted in Government spending huge sums of money on HIV/AIDS-related activities instead of the other productive sectors of the economy. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research sought to understand how theories of behaviour change could be employed to design effective <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> intervention <b>programmes</b> for HIV/AIDS preventions in Ghana. The study employs both qualitative and quantitative research approaches and a stratified sampling method to achieve the aims and objectives of the study. A total of 487 respondents provided information for both qualitative and quantitative studies. The results reveal among others that implementers of <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> intervention <b>programmes</b> on HIV/AIDS in Ghana do not utilise behavioural change theories/models in planning their interventions and the main challenges facing implementers include inadequate financing, health system barriers, procurement delays and lack of human resources. The research further found that majority of Ghanaians have seen or heard <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> interventions on HIV/AIDS, know what they can do to prevent HIV/AIDS new infection, and have seen or heard interventions on HIV/AIDS {{for a long period of}} time. However, <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> intervention <b>programmes</b> designed to change HIV/AIDS related behaviours of Ghanaians have, generally, been ineffective. Therefore, the study recommends that, implementers of <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> intervention <b>programmes</b> on HIV/AIDS in Ghana should ascertain why most Ghanaians have not adopted HIV/AIDS protective behaviours. This can be done by utilising research findings and application of an integrative behaviour model to design intervention programmes on HIV/AIDS to convert increased awareness and attitude change into behaviour change.

40|$|Social {{marketing}} {{is the latest}} public health strategy deployed against {{a wide range of}} health imperatives, especially ones associated with people’s behaviour. This investigation examines the ‘social’ in such social marketing, by focusing on the relationships between the people, communities, organizations, institutions and material of one such initiative. Most studies determine the ‘effectiveness’ of a <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme</b> according to measurable outcomes. However, this has created a gap in knowledge about what actually happens as a programme is initiated at a local level, how constantly-changing social contexts influence its delivery, and how social marketing impacts people, especially marginalised populations. Rather than viewing social marketing as a form of ‘intervention’, which is typical of the ‘conventional’ approach, this investigation examines social marketing as an iterative and social process. Launched in 2008, Change 4 Life (C 4 L) is the English Department of Health’s first anti-obesity <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme.</b> C 4 L multimedia advertising is found throughout the English landscape, converting the built and virtual environment into a moral space. However, a key characteristic is the way such a national remit is converted into a wide range of specific initiatives at local levels. This investigation considers four case studies within one region of the UK to explore the varied ways in which a general social marketing venture is translated and implemented. By building up ethnographic accounts using participant observation, in-depth interviews, and interpretative analysis, these case studies illustrate how local health officials responded to the local tensions created by the national all-encompassing C 4 L programme, particularly in their attempts to relate C 4 L to ‘hard-to-reach’ communities. The diversity of their efforts highlights the limited applicability of the ‘conventional’ approach to social marketing. This investigation therefore suggests an approach for developing a more ‘social’ form of social marketing and contributes to the greater discussion on how to develop public health strategies that actively solve the underlying social problems of public health...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to propose}} a new {{ecological}} systems-driven framework, underpinned by a relational marketplace lens, for <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> practitioners to consider when planning and designing programs. The authors contend that behavioural change does not occur in a vacuum and, as such, point to an ecology {{in which the individual}} is but one participant in a broader scope of social change activities. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual and presents the Indicators for Social Change Framework. Findings: The Indicators for Social Change Framework puts forward a series of “must-have” indicators to consider when designing and planning <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes.</b> Across identified indicators, the Framework delineates types of marketing actions to consider when planning for individual-oriented change and those required for wider systems-oriented change. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the broadening and deepening of the <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> argument that reliance on individual behaviour change perspectives is not sufficient to resolve complex social problems that are inherently influenced by wider social forces. In transforming social change design, this paper transitions towards a logic view of <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> that encourages and supports social change planners to be inclusive of interactions, processes and outcomes of value creation across the wider <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> system.

The study was conducted {{during the early stages}} of a <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme.</b> A pragmatic paradigm was applied to address three research questions using mixed methods. The qualitative investigation formed the primary component of the study and interviewed 14 customers who were selected to receive micro-finance loans to purchase the ecological toilet.

The study identified that 'first movers' only partially displayed characteristics of 'innovators' and the product met three of five characteristics associated with successful rates of diffusion. Improving the trialability and simplicity of the product, through field-testing, human-centred or participatory design approaches could improve the likelihood of the product attaining the characteristics that support successful diffusion. Organisations that apply social marketing approaches to improve urban sanitation coverage may improve their efficacy, equity and cost-effectiveness by utilising diffusion theory as the theoretical framework to design, implement and evaluate their programmes...|$|E

40|$|Complex social {{problems}} (the continued rise in chronic disease; resource depletion, inequality etc.) call for new <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> frameworks to accommodate midstream and upstream action which requires collaborations with multiple actors (government, {{public and private}} sector). Service-dominant logic (SDL) (Vargo and Lusch, 2004) theoretical developments (systems thinking, value creation, networks etc.) suggest a good compatibility with the collaborative approaches required by midstream and upstream social change (Russell-Bennett, Wood and Previte, 2013). This thesis interrogates the applicability of SDL concepts (value creation and actor engagement) to <b>social</b> <b>marketing.</b> This study focuses on examining the factors influencing engagement, actor motivation and perceived value in a health <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> context. The study adopts a case study approach and draws upon interviews, observation and document analysis to examine a Smokefree homes and cars programme (‘Smokefree’) in a city in England. Key findings of this research indicate that adopting a service orientation facilitates contextualising <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes,</b> building capacity at the community level and adopting a long-term approach which suits better the realities of individuals. However, it also reflects that understanding and addressing contextual factors means considering the fluidity of individuals’ goals and the subjective dimension of value which might challenge pre-set programme objectives. The study indicates that a collaborative approach to value creation poses challenges {{in addition to the}} benefits. This study {{is one of the few}} (Domegan et al., 2013; Lefebvre, 2012; Russell-Bennett, Wood and Previte, 2013) to contribute to the efforts to examine the implications of a service perspective for extending <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> theory. One of the main contributions of this study is illustrated by the articulation of service dominant benchmarks for social change programmes. A key implication for policy is that building collaborations with community services is essential to understanding individuals in context, customising offerings and supporting skill development...|$|R

The study illustrates that the service interaction allowed for customer centred cues for action which took into account their context and the existence/lack of resources for value creation.

40|$|Abstract Health {{interventions}} vary {{substantially in}} the degree of effort required to implement them. To some extent this is apparent in their financial cost, but the nature and availability of non-financial resources is often of similar importance. In particular, human resource requirements are frequently a major constraint. We propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of interventions according to their degree of technical complexity; this complements the notion of institutional capacity in considering the feasibility of implementing an intervention. Interventions are categorized into four dimensions: characteristics of the basic intervention; characteristics of delivery; requirements on government capacity; and usage characteristics. The analysis of intervention complexity should lead {{to a better understanding of}} supply- and demand-side constraints to scaling up, indicate priorities for further research and development, and can point to potential areas for improvement of specific aspects of each intervention to close the gap between the complexity of an intervention and the capacity to implement it. The framework is illustrated using the examples of scaling up condom <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes,</b> and the DOTS strategy for tuberculosis control in highly resource-constrained countries. The framework could be used as a tool for policy-makers, planners and programme managers when considering the expansion of existing projects or the introduction of new interventions. Intervention complexity thus complements the considerations of burden of disease, cost-effectiveness, affordability and political feasibility in health policy decision-making.

40|$|Purpose – The {{image of}} cyclists has been {{increasingly}} recognised {{as an important}} factor in <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes</b> aimed at increasing cycling. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present findings from a multi‐stage research project exploring image incongruencies between cyclists and non‐cyclists in the UK. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical framework of self‐image congruency was used to explore a possible “image gap” between the current image(s) of cyclists and the self concept of the GB population. The first stage of the research was a quantitative nationally representative survey of 3, 855 British adults. The second phase involved a qualitative study involving ten in‐depth interviews and nine focus groups (n= 60) exploring the image of cyclists with groups of non‐cyclists, lapsed cyclists, occasional cyclists, sports cyclists and utility cyclists. Findings – Quantitative findings indicated that a gap exists between the perceived image of cyclists by GB adults and their collective self concept. Qualitative findings suggested that cyclists images were frequently viewed as negative or sometimes “out of reach” for non‐cyclists. Research limitations/implications – Social marketers have a role to play in overcoming self‐image incongruencies of this type. The authors' intention was to enable social marketers to encourage non‐cyclists to view cycling in a more positive light by encouraging a perceptual shift in their image of cyclists in the UK. The implication is that this would form a bridging mechanism that narrows the gap between non‐cyclists' current image of cyclists and their image of themselves. Originality/value – This work prompts reflections on the nature of self‐image congruency within the <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> field.

This book adds new insights about how marketing can and is being used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of social programmes in areas such as Health, Environment, Governance and Public Policy. It does this through an international lens, placing Strategic <b>Social</b> <b>Marketing</b> analysis and application in a global context and illustrating how it can be applied, giving examples and case studies from around the world.

40|$|Purpose – In this paper, {{the authors}} aim to {{contend that the}} 4 Ps of social {{marketing}} have been stretched beyond breaking point. Originally designed for social marketing mixes that contained products and prices, the social marketing 4 Ps are no longer fit for purpose in an age where social marketing interventions are so wide ranging. There is an urgent need for a replacement – a model that helps social marketers {{with the process of}} choosing an appropriate intervention design to fit the particular behaviour change problem faced. Here, the authors propose a model, the COM-SM framework, that connects <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme</b> types with the “capability, opportunity, motivation” model of behaviour. Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on critical review of the efficacy of the 4 Ps model in helping managers design social marketing programmes, followed by the conceptual development of an alternative. Findings – Using some typical scenarios, it is contended that the COM-SM model better enables the marketer to adapt their designs to fit the behavioural challenges that they face. Originality/value – The COM-SM model reworks the association between behaviour change insights and the social marketing mix, proposing a new way of designing social marketing interventions...|$|E
40|$|The {{insights}} in {{this document}} were produced {{as part of a}} project to design a <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme</b> that would support people with long term conditions to positively manage their health. The project was led by innovate change for Counties Manukau Health and East Health Trust. The first version of this document, Insights on Long Term Conditions in Counties Manukau, summarised existing knowledge about long term conditions, population health, self-management, social marketing and behaviour change.  This final document brings together those insights with key findings from field research with people with long term conditions in Counties Manukau (South Auckland). summary of insights 1. Long term conditions are a major cause of death and disease in Counties Manukau  2. Long term conditions are increasing and are felt most by Māori, Pacific and older people  3. People often experience multiple conditions and mental health challenges 4. The impacts of long term conditions are felt by individuals, whānau and the wider community  5. There are lots of things individuals can do to manage their health  6. Taking control and changing health behaviours can be challenging 7.

40|$|Whilst some {{populations have}} {{recently}} experienced dramatic declines in malaria, {{the majority of}} those most at risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria still lack access to effective treatment with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and others are already facing parasites resistant to artemisinins. In this context, there is a crucial need to improve both access to and targeting of ACT through greater availability of good quality ACT and parasitological diagnosis. This is an issue of increasing urgency notably in the private commercial sector, which, in many countries, {{plays an important role in}} the provision of malaria treatment. The Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria (AMFm) is a recent initiative that aims to increase the provision of affordable ACT in public, private and NGO sectors through a manufacturer-level subsidy. However, to date, there is little documented experience in the programmatic implementation of subsidized ACT in the private sector. Cambodia is in the unique position of having more than 10 years of experience not only in implementing subsidized ACT, but also rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) as part of a nationwide <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programme.</b> The programme includes behaviour change communication and the training of private providers as well as the sale and distribution of Malarine, the recommended ACT, and Malacheck, the RDT. This paper describes and evaluates this experience by drawing on the results of household and provider surveys conducted since the start of th...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} young female consumers' motivations and perceptions of their alcohol consumption in the context of the changing drinking culture among women. Design/methodology/approach - All the data were collected on a university campus in Poland. The research was conducted in two phases, using two research methods: consumer diaries and consumer collages. In Phase 1, purposive sampling was used to establish a group of five female students, all aged 22, who were asked to keep individual written diaries. In Phase 2, consumer collages were prepared and interpreted by four groups consisting of 24 female students. Findings - Both sets of data were thematically analysed, and the emerging themes were divided into two major issues: drinking motives and control and limits. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited by a small sample recruited from one university, and the indicative findings should be used in further research. Practical implications - Better understanding of female students' drinking culture will help to develop more targeted and effective policies and <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes</b> to prevent further rise in alcohol consumption among female students. Originality/value - This research contributes to the existing literature by deepening our understanding of the unique characteristics of female undergraduate students' drinking, and identifying the areas of convergence between male and female alcohol consumption. It also explores the motivations behind these convergence processes and highlights areas in which differences between genders are still strong.

40|$|Health {{interventions}} vary {{substantially in}} the degree of effort required to implement them. To some extent this is apparent in their financial cost, but the nature and availability of non-financial resources is often of similar importance. In particular, human resource requirements are frequently a major constraint. We propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of interventions according to their degree of technical complexity; this complements the notion of institutional capacity in considering the feasibility of implementing an intervention. Interventions are categorized into four dimensions: characteristics of the basic intervention; characteristics of delivery; requirements on government capacity; and usage characteristics. The analysis of intervention complexity should lead {{to a better understanding of}} supply- and demand-side constraints to scaling up, indicate priorities for further research and development, and can point to potential areas for improvement of specific aspects of each intervention to close the gap between the complexity of an intervention and the capacity to implement it. The framework is illustrated using the examples of scaling up condom <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes,</b> and the DOTS strategy for tuberculosis control in highly resource-constrained countries. The framework could be used as a tool for policy-makers, planners and programme managers when considering the expansion of existing projects or the introduction of new interventions. Intervention complexity thus complements the considerations of burden of disease, cost-effectiveness, affordability and political feasibility in health policy decision-making. Reducing the technical complexity of interventions will be crucial to meeting the health-related Millennium Development Goals...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Relationship {{marketing}} {{provides a}} new foundation for thinking, genuine change in values and ethics {{and a new}} logic that sees consumers as the prime drivers of the value creation process. It {{seems to have a}} lot to offer to <b>social</b> <b>marketing,</b> however, despite its potential, the <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> field is responding slowly to relational thinking. This research demonstrates that relationship <b>marketing</b> helps <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> and that its absence seriously undermines the field. Our examination is critical because it de-constructs the transactional paradigm and shows how its logic is incapable of responding to the complexities of contemporary pluralist societies. From the literature, we have identified the principles, processes and constructs of relationship marketing that are transferable to <b>social</b> <b>marketing.</b> Further, we have identified the challenges and implications of that transference, given the particular characteristics of <b>social</b> <b>marketing.</b> To empirically examine the potential of relationship <b>marketing</b> in <b>social</b> <b>marketing,</b> we have conducted a process evaluation and developed a specific framework that incorporates and reflects relationship marketing principles, processes and constructs. This research makes an important methodological contribution because it goes beyond current frameworks and suggests alternative evaluation components. The process evaluation was applied through an explanatory, holistic and single case-study design. The case was a parent drugs prevention programme and to examine it we have predominantly used a mix of qualitative methods and a research design which enabled triangulation. Through the application of process evaluation to the case we have de-constructed the dominant paradigm of the programme and examined its consequences. The findings indicate that the programme did not widely applied the principles, processes and constructs of relationship marketing. Despite having successfully applied relationship marketing in specific parts of the programme, these correspond to technical rather than strategic aspects of relationship marketing and worked as isolated parts rather than as a whole. More fundamentally, rather than seeing consumers as partners, the programme saw consumers as targets, not recognizing them as the main drivers of the value creation process. The programme was therefore shaped by a transactional perspective which affected its assumptions and undermined its design and implementation. The main conclusion is that, despite its theoretical potential, it is challenging and difficult to transfer relationship marketing to real live <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programmes.</b> In particular, <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> needs to be more reflexive and self-critical in order to de-construct its prevailing paradigm and start re-constructing an alternative. This demands not only a new attitude, new values and new assumptions but also a focus on resources, competences and new and more flexible organizational structures...|$|R
