5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|The <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> is a fast, active swimmer that {{sometimes}} forms large schools, segregated {{by age and}} sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures than adults. Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round while males only appear during the summer. Smaller spinner sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> include the copepods Kroyeria deetsi, Nemesis pilosus, and N. atlantica, which infest the shark's gills, Alebion carchariae, which infests the skin, Nesippus orientalis, which infests the mouth and gill arches, and Perissopus dentatus, which infests the nares and the rear margins of the fins.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{with the}} <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and the finetooth shark (C. isodon). Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore and colleagues reported in 2011 that this species {{is closely related}} to the graceful shark, the blacktip shark, and the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni).|$|E
5|$|<b>Spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of <b>spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, <b>spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|R
50|$|Off Madagascar, <b>spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> follow {{migrating}} {{schools of}} mackerel. Bryde's whales feed on mackerel {{when they can}} find them. They use several feeding methods, including skimming the surface, lunging, and bubble nets.|$|R

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the blacktip shark were originally {{thought to be the}} graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), due to similarities in morphology and behavior. However, this interpretation has not been borne out by studies of mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA, which instead suggest affinity with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). More work is required to fully resolve the relationship between the blacktip shark and other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark,</b> none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Like the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark,</b> the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
50|$|The {{aquarium}} {{is home to}} shark {{species such}} as ragged-tooth <b>sharks,</b> <b>spinner</b> <b>sharks,</b> hammerhead sharks, and local catsharks, large rays including eagle rays, local moray species including honeycomb morays and geometric morays, local gamefish, and large fish species including giant groupers, potato bass, kingfish, and cobia. uShaka also housed a Manta ray {{for a short period}} of time before it was moved to the Georgia Aquarium in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The length {{at birth}} is 66 - 77 cm {{in the northwestern}} Atlantic, 61 - 69 cm off Tunisia, and 60 cm off South Africa. <b>Spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{relatively}} fast-growing sharks: 30 cm per year for newborns, 25 cm per year for one-year-olds, 10 cm per year for adolescents, and 5 cm per year for adults. In the northwestern Atlantic, males mature at 1.3 m long and females at 1.5 - 1.6 m long, corresponding to ages of 4 - 5 years and 7 - 8 years, respectively. Off South Africa, males mature at 1.8 m and females at 2.1 m. <b>Spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> generally do not reproduce until they are 12 - 14 years old.

25|$|Swordfish {{charge at}} high speeds through forage fish schools, {{slashing}} with their swords to kill or stun prey. They then turn and return to consume their catch. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes. <b>Spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> charge vertically through schools, spinning on their axis with their mouths open and snapping all around.

5|$|The <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> was {{originally}} described as Carcharias (Aprion) brevipinna by Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, {{based on the}} mounted skin of a 79-cm-long specimen collected off Java. This species was subsequently moved to the genera Aprion, Squalus, and Aprionodon before being placed within the genus Carcharhinus. The tooth shape and coloration of this species varies significantly with age and between geographical regions, which caused much taxonomic confusion. Other common names include blacktipped shark, great blacktip shark, inkytail shark, large blacktip shark, long-nose grey shark, longnose grey whaler, and smoothfang shark.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Carcharhinus species, {{attempts}} to analyze the finetooth shark's phylogenetic relationships have yielded variable results. In 1988, Leonard Compagno grouped this species with the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), blacktip shark (C. limbatus), graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and smooth tooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon), on the basis of morphological characters. Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found that the finetooth shark is the second-most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Mine Dosay-Akbulut's 2008 study, based on ribosomal DNA, suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth shark is the smalltail shark (C. porosus), and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Some {{uncertainty}} {{exists in}} the distribution data for the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> due to confusion with the blacktip shark. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from North Carolina to the northern Gulf of Mexico, including the Bahamas and Cuba, and from southern Brazil to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs from off North Africa to Namibia. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from South Africa and Madagascar, to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, to India and nearby islands, to Java and Sumatra. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and possibly the Philippines. Parasitological evidence suggests that Indian Ocean spinner sharks have passed through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, becoming Lessepsian migrants.|$|E
5|$|In North American waters, the finetooth shark {{is common}} and found from North Carolina to the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and very occasionally straying {{as far north as}} New York. In Central and South American waters, it is rare, but may occur more widely than presently known, having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana, infrequently from the Caribbean Sea, and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina. The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, but these likely represent misidentifications of <b>spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> (C. brevipinna).|$|R
5|$|Superficially, the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{resembles the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus). It is rather robust in build, with a short and blunt snout. The large {{nostrils}} are preceded by well-developed, triangular flaps of skin. The small, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a wide arch and has very short furrows at the corners. There are 16 upper and 14–15 lower tooth rows on either side, along with two to three small teeth at the symphysis (center) of either jaw. The teeth are distinctive in shape, having narrow, upright cusps without serrations; finetooth <b>sharks</b> and juvenile <b>spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> are the only other members of Carcharhinus with similar teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|R
2500|$|The predators often {{cooperate}} in groups, using different techniques to panic or herd {{a school of}} herring into a tight bait ball.

Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun the shoaling fish.

They then strike them sharply with the upper lobe of their tails to stun them. <b>Spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> charge vertically through the school, spinning on their axes with their mouths open and snapping all around. The sharks' momentum at the end of these spiraling runs often carries them into the air.|$|R
5|$|Spinner {{sharks are}} swift and gregarious predators that feed {{on a wide}} variety of small bony fishes and cephalopods. When feeding on schools of forage fish, they will speed {{vertically}} through the school while spinning on their axis, erupting from the water at the end. Like other members of its family, the <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous, with females bearing litters of three to 20 young every other year. The newborns are born in shallow nursery areas near the coast, and are relatively fast-growing. This species is not usually dangerous to humans, but may become belligerent when excited by food. Spinner sharks are valued by commercial fisheries across their range for their meat, fins, liver oil, and skin. They are also esteemed as strong fighters by recreational fishers. The IUCN has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} Carcharhinus species, the {{evolutionary}} relationships of the graceful shark are poorly resolved. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick concluded in 1982 that its closest relative was the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), {{and that the}} two were {{closely related to the}} <b>spinner</b> <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna). Leonard Compagno, in his 1988 phenetic study, also grouped those species together, along with the smoothtooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon) and the finetooth shark (C. isodon). However, molecular phylogenetic techniques have since found this interpretation to be invalid for the spinner, blacktip, and finetooth sharks.|$|E

40|$|Background: Quantifying genetic {{diversity}} and metapopulation structure provides {{insights into the}} evolutionary history of a species and helps develop appropriate management strategies. We provide the first assessment of genetic structure in <b>spinner</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus brevipinna), a large cosmopolitan carcharhinid, sampled from eastern and northern Australia and South Africa. Methods and Findings: Sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene for 430 individuals revealed 37 haplotypes and moderately high haplotype diversity (h = 0. 6770 ± 0. 025). While two metrics of genetic divergence (Φ(ST) and F(ST)) revealed somewhat different results, subdivision was detected between South Africa and all Australian locations (pairwise Φ(ST), range 0. 02717 – 0. 03508, p values ≤ 0. 0013; pairwise F(ST) South Africa vs New South Wales = 0. 04056, p = 0. 0008). Evidence for fine-scale genetic structuring was also detected along Australia's east coast (pairwise Φ(ST) = 0. 01328, p < 0. 015), and between south-eastern and northern locations (pairwise Φ(ST) = 0. 00669, p < 0. 04). Conclusions: The Indian Ocean represents a robust barrier to contemporary gene flow in C. brevipinna between Australia and South Africa. Gene flow also appears restricted along a continuous continental margin in this species, with data tentatively suggesting the delineation of two management units within Australian waters. Further sampling, however, is required for a more robust evaluation of the latter finding.

The removal of large predatory sharks from the world’s oceans poses profound threats to marine community structure and species conservation over a range of spatial scales. In a context of increased harvest pressure worldwide, the effective management of exploited shark populations relies on a sound understanding of target species’ life histories, genetic diversities and metapopulation structures. Molecular genetic techniques and vertebral ageing analysis were employed here in conjunction with accurate fishery-observer catch data to investigate the genetic diversity and structure, growth dynamics and reproductive characteristics of dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus), spinner (Carcharhinus brevipinna) and sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) sharks in temperate eastern Australian waters, where they support a demersal longline fishery. We also establish basic estimates of scientific observer accuracy {{in the identification of}} these species within the fishery. These data were used to qualitatively evaluate the susceptibility of these species, and the fishery as a whole, to stock decline and to recommend appropriate spatial scales of managementGenetic analyses revealed varying levels of diversity among the three study species. Carcharhinus obscurus and C. plumbeus demonstrated a range of similarities in their genetic structures that were in contrast to that of C. brevipinna; the latter appearing to have been shaped by a very different evolutionary history in the sampling area. Genetic differentiation, albeit weak, was detected in C. obscurus between eastern and western Australian waters, suggesting the delineation of two independent populations. For C. brevipinna, the Indian Ocean was found to be a reasonably robust barrier to contemporary gene flow between Australia and South Africa, and we detected weak evidence for restricted gene flow on a finescale along a continuous continental margin within Australian waters. Limitations inherent in our genetic analyses, however, highlighted the need for further sampling to achieve greater population structure resolution for these species. Examination of the life histories of the three target species revealed a range of both contrasts and consistencies in their age, growth and reproductive characteristics off Australia’s temperate east coast. Nevertheless, all three were characterised by low productivity (i. e. long-lived, relatively slow-growing, late-maturing species of low fecundity and lengthy gestation), highlighting their vulnerability to stock depletion. Interestingly, many aspects of their life histories in New South Wales waters appeared to challenge findings emanating from conspecific populations {{in other parts of the}} world. Comparison of biological parameters between studies, however, must be treated with some caution given potentially confounding factors. We also demonstrated micro-computed tomography to be a valid and repeatable alternative means of shark ageing that offers several distinct advantages over more traditional methods. In spite of this, it is not sufficiently cost effective at present to be widely applied. This thesis, via comprehensive assessments of demographic parameters and genetic population structure, raises important implications relating to the resilience of C. obscurus, C. brevipinna and C. plumbeus to fishing-induced population decline in the region and, in turn, the sustainability of the local fishery. It also provides valuable information pertaining to the allocation of management units for these species in Australian and surrounding waters.
