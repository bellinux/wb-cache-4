The following models, although very important for the investigations of laser-matter interactions and the relevant laser materials processing applications, have been rarely reported in literature, and have been developed and described in this dissertation: 1. A complete and <b>self-closed</b> model for laser shock peening. 2. A low-fluence nanosecond laser ablation model with both rigorous boundary conditions at the liquid-vapor interface and plasma formation considerations. 3. A one-dimensional hydrodynamic model for the early-stage evolution of high-fluecne laser-induced metal plasma in air. 4. A two-stage and <b>self-closed</b> model for high-fluence nanosecond laser-induced metal plasma in vacuum. The model can simulate both the early stage evolution and the long-term behavior of the laser-induced plasma. 5. A simplified model for ultrashort laser ablation that is easy to apply and computationally efficient, while can still reflect the dominant physics in the process and produce reasonably accurate predictions. ^ The above developed models have been compared with experimental measurements, and the agreements are reasonably good compared with the typical accuracy of models in literature for short and ultrashort pulsed laser-matter interactions. ^ Preliminary experimental work has also been performed for laser shock peening and picosecond laser micromachining using a developed nanosecond laser processing system and a picosecond laser processing system, respectively. ...|$|R

This is proved for a generic case of static or axially-symmetrical rotating spacetimes. Comment: 12 pages, REVTeX, no figures.

30|$|The {{best results}} {{reported}} {{so far in}} human therapy are probably liposomes as carriers foramphotericin B in antifungal therapies. This is the drug of choice in dispersed fungal infections which often in parallel work together with chemotherapy, immune system, or AIDS, and is frequently fatal. Unfortunately, the drug itself is very toxic and its dosage is limited due to its ionosphere and neurotoxicity. These toxicities are normally related {{with the size of}} the drug molecule or its complex. Obviously, liposome encapsulation inhibits the accumulation of drug in these organs and radically reduces toxicity[53]. Furthermore, often, the fungus exists in the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system; therefore, the encapsulation results in reduced toxicity and passive targeting. These benefits, however, can be associated with any colloidal drug carrier. Certainly, similar improvements in therapy were observed with stable mixed micellar formulations and micro-emulsions[54]. Additionally, it seems that many of the early liposomal preparations were in actual fact liquid crystalline colloidal particles rather than <b>self-closed</b> MLV. Since the lives of the first terminally ill patients (who did not rely to all the conventional therapies) were saved[53], many patients were very effectively treated with diverse of amphotericin B formulations.|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} time-dependent {{model of}} polar cap arcs has been developed. The electrodynamics {{of the polar}} cap arcs are treated self-consistently {{in the frame of}} the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The focus {{of this paper is to}} introduce the physics and mathematical formulation of the model and describe the features of the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the polar cap arcs. The modeling results indicate that the time constant for the formation of the polar cap arcs is around 10 min. It is found that an initial single-arc precipitation pattern associated with a polar cap arc tends to split into multiple precipitation regions and leads to a multiple structure of the polar cap arcs. It is also found that strong downward field-aligned currents can develop near the intensive upward field-aligned currents and form a pair structure of the field-aligned current in the polar cap arcs. The model predicts the existence of plasma flow crossing the polar cap arcs, but the amplitude of such a flow is small, and the characteristic time scale of it is much larger than the time constant for the formation of the polar cap arcs. Our results also show that while polar cap arcs are developing, the associated current system tends to become further localized and at steady state the current system in the narrow regions around the arcs is locally <b>self-closed...</b>|$|R
