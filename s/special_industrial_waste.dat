40|$|Investigations on Reaction Technology of Continuous Anaerobic Digestion, Shown by the Purification of an Acetic Acid Containig Waste Water with Methanogenic Bacteria This thesis {{deals with}} the {{reaction}} technology and application of anaerobic digestion in order to purify a waste water from pulp industries. A synthetic waste water, whose composition corresponded to the condenser water of sulfite waste liquor, was used for experiments. Acetic acid as the main waste load was the only carbon source. It was decomposed to biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, by methanogenic bacteria of the species Methanosarcina barkeri. Thebacterial culture was handled without sterile procedures and it did contain sulfate reducing bacteria that provided a favourable concentration of sulfide. In reaction engineering terms, the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor {{was found to be}} the optimal reactor for this process. The pH-shift during decomposition of acetic acid was calcula ted by a Fortran program and resul ted in a concept for controlling a continuous biogas reactor. The process of anaerobic digestion was transferred from bench scale to pilot scale and the reaction volume was enlarged to 135 l. For this scale a fermentation plant was projected, constructed by an engineering firm, and started in operation. Strong emphasis was put on the measuring and control equipment and on the coupling of this equipment to a process control computer. The software for the registration of experimental values and the control of the plant was developed and mainly usedfor the optimal operation of the plant. The generation time of the cul ture was minimized by maximizing the selection pressure in order to get maximal biogas produc ti vi ty. The computer was used {{in such a way that}} the plant was brought to maximal biogas production automatically. A considerable decrease of the retention time - in connection with the increase of biomass concentration in the fermenter- was achieved by use of a rotating filter for biomass retention. The applicability of anaerobic digestion to the treatment of <b>special</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> waters was shown by the operation of the plant. The fundamentals for the use of this process in a technical scale were worked out. Economic advantages can be expected as well as ecological ones...|$|E

Indicators that a <b>waste</b> is <b>industrial</b> include the following: Waste type. Certain types of waste are known to be classified as <b>industrial</b> <b>waste,</b> such as treated wood; soils contaminated with non-hazardous or low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and petroleum hydrocarbons; non-friable asbestos waste; and oil filters. In many cases, these wastes result from construction-related projects under the purview of the Facilities Division. Such operations include excavations, the removal of fencing or cooling towers, and building demolition. Waste generation history. The waste generator’s process knowledge of the waste stream can help identify the proper waste category. Sampling and analysis.

40|$|Material flow {{analysis}} (MFA) {{is an excellent}} tool in supporting decision making regarding waste management problems. MFA allows the calculation of the amount and composition of wastes by balancing the process of waste generation {{and the process of}} waste treatment.

The <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> management system in Thailand is still lacking comprehensive data on <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> generation and flow.

In this complex, production process is hot rolling steel and the product is rebar. Material and Method: The preset study was conducted in Kavir Steel Complex. Following survey of production process and sources of waste, the type and volume of produced waste were identified and measured during 3 months. Then, the classification of wastes was done according to the Bazel Convention and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and finally new industrial & health solid waste management program was presented. Result: Considering the volume, <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> of production process in Kavir Steel Complex was between 130 to 180 grams per each ton of rebar. Main <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> included oxide of steel billet, industrial sludge, used oil and lubricant which were classified according to the RCRA: 8 materials with T code, 1 with C code, 5 with I code and 3 materials with C code.
