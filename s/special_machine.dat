5|$|The series {{production}} of the T-26, equipped with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets {{proved to be more}} suitable for mass production. The {{production of the}} T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10mm thick instead of the planned 13mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the Bolshevik Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from mild steel. Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of armour plate as well as to mount engines of better quality. The business plan for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the Bolshevik Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor production planning of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of <b>Special</b> <b>Machine</b> Industry, consisting of four factories, was established {{to solve the problem of}} tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45mm gun was launched in mid-1933.|$|E

Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside. New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a [...] "mega mural" [...] painter. He said of the process: I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it.

500|$|The {{album cover}} for The Velvet Underground & Nico is {{recognizable}} for featuring a Warhol print of a banana. Early {{copies of the}} album invited the owner to [...] "Peel slowly and see"; peeling back the banana skin revealed a flesh-colored banana underneath. A <b>special</b> <b>machine</b> was needed to manufacture these covers (one {{of the causes of}} the album's delayed release), but MGM paid for costs figuring that any ties to Warhol would boost sales of the album. Most reissued vinyl editions of the album do not feature the peel-off sticker; original copies of the album with the peel-sticker feature are now rare collector's items. A Japanese re-issue LP in the early 1980s was the only re-issue version to include the banana sticker for many years. On the 1996 CD reissue, the banana image is on the front cover while the image of the peeled banana is {{on the inside of the}} jewel case, beneath the CD itself. The album was re-pressed onto heavyweight vinyl in 2008, featuring a banana sticker.|$|E
500|$|Blyth Memorial Arena was the {{centerpiece}} of the Games. It hosted the opening and closing ceremonies jointly with Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink, and also hosted the figure skating competition, a few of the speed skating events, as well as most of the games in the hockey tournament. [...] All three of the sports were held indoors on artificial ice {{for the first time in}} Olympic history. [...] At full capacity, the arena accommodated 11,000 people, 8,500 of whom were seated. [...] One end of the stadium could be opened and closed, depending on the event. During the ceremonies it was open to allow for the entrance of the athletes; during the competitions it was closed to accommodate more spectators. A <b>special</b> <b>machine</b> was created to resurface the ice for all three competitions. It could lay a new ice surface on the 400-meter speed skating track in 45minutes. In addition to resurfacing the ice, the machine created the snow dividers that delineated the racing lanes. [...] The roof was designed on a suspension principle, using cables rather than vertical supports; this removed any visual impediments for the audience, but it weakened the strength of the roof. Given the amount of annual snowfall designers planned on using heat generated by the refrigeration plant to melt the snow. [...] There were flaws in the design and miscalculations in the load the roof could bear, and during a particularly heavy snowfall in 1983, a portion of the roof collapsed and the building was subsequently demolished.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Multics {{system had}} eight rings, but many modern systems have fewer. The hardware remains {{aware of the}} current ring of the executing instruction thread at all times, {{with the help of}} a <b>special</b> <b>machine</b> register. In some systems, areas of virtual memory are instead assigned ring numbers in hardware. [...] One example is the Data General Eclipse MV/8000, in which the top three bits of the program counter (PC) served as the ring register. Thus code executing with the virtual PC set to 0xE200000, for example, would automatically be in ring 7, and calling a subroutine in a different section of memory would automatically cause a ring transfer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{demise of}} the EV1 {{is the subject of}} a 2006 {{documentary}} film entitled Who Killed the Electric Car?. Much of the film accounts for GM's efforts to demonstrate to California that there was no demand for their product and then to reclaim and dispose of every EV1 manufactured. A few vehicles were disabled and given to museums and universities, but almost all were found to have been crushed, or shredded using a <b>special</b> <b>machine,</b> as seen in the documentary. However, apparently one or more EV1s did remain in private hands: director Francis Ford Coppola showed off his EV1 on [...] "Jay Leno's Garage," [...] though whether it is driveable is unclear. One theory on why GM destroyed the cars discussed is that the EV1 program was eliminated because it threatened the oil industry.|$|E
2500|$|The Turbo-Hydramatic {{heavy-duty}} three-speed {{automatic transmission}} became available during {{development of the}} Toronado. Called the TH425 in FWD form, the transmission's torque converter was separated from its planetary gearset, with the torque converter driving the gearset through a [...] wide silent chain-drive called Hy-Vo, riding on two [...] sprockets. The Hy-Vo chain drive was developed by GM's Hydra-Matic Division and Morse Chain Division of Borg-Warner. The chains were made from a very strong hardened steel and required no tensioners or idler pulleys because they were pre-stretched on a <b>special</b> <b>machine</b> at the factory. Although the rotation direction of the transmission's gearing had to be reversed, {{a large number of}} components were shared with the conventional TH400. Use of the automatic also obviated the need to devise a workable manual-shift linkage; no manual transmission was ever contemplated, as engineers deemed performance to be adequate with the automatic transmission and because virtually all U.S.-built luxury cars during this period came with automatic transmissions as standard equipment. With this, the [...] time was clocked in 9.5seconds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{names of}} University of Arkansas students, {{starting}} with the first senior class of 1876, are carved {{into one of the}} concrete walkways or sidewalks on campus. This tradition was started by the 1905 graduating class of students, who drew their names into the walkway in front of Old Main, the oldest building on campus. Following classes added their names {{for more than a decade}} and then the university took over responsibility for adding new classes, as well as adding the names of students who graduated prior to 1905. Through most of the 20th century, the names were impressed in wet cement using brass letters. As the campus grew, and the graduating classes got bigger, the operation became unduly time-consuming. In 1986, the university's physical plant developed a <b>special</b> <b>machine</b> called the [...] "Senior Sand Hog" [...] to engrave the thousands of names required each year. School superstition states that it is bad luck to step on the Class of 1900; additionally it is said that if one steps on the name of the first graduating class, you will never graduate from the University of Arkansas.|$|E

Labeled as Apple Jacks Adventures in print advertising, the commercials focus on CinnaMon upstaging Bad Apple by reaching {{a bowl of}} Apple Jacks before he can, {{in spite of the}} apple's attempts to stop him. Bad Apple's antagonistic nature was latter dropped; Apple and CinnaMon were then portrayed as highly competitive friends, both getting into the bowl. The campaign was slated to be retired in 2007, and replaced by a retread of the 1990s campaign focused on children, but fan response to Apple and CinnaMon helped them remain as the mascots. [...] In 2007, Apple and Cinnamon were fused together with Cinnamon sticking through the center of Apple with both of their legs at the bottom of their body. [...] They remained this way for a few of the commercials until they became unstuck by a <b>special</b> <b>machine.</b> In 2009, Apple and Cinnamon were transported out of their cartoon world to the real world of New York City, where they continue to race each other to the bowl where they would enter the bowl at the same time. In 2010 Kellogg planned to have Apple and Cinnamon race across the country to see who would enter the bowl first, but the production team saw no real need to change their New York City commercial.|$|E
