25|$|In {{electromechanical}} regulators, {{voltage regulation}} is easily accomplished by coiling the sensing wire {{to make an}} electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, so does the current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a mechanical power switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As voltage decreases, so does the current, releasing <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> or {{the weight of the}} core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more.|$|E
25|$|Planer {{boards are}} trolled devices {{designed}} to spread fishing lures out {{away from the}} fishing vessel. They allow multiple lines to be trolled. They come in dual board and inline board designs. Dual board designs consist of two boards that are spaced apart and attached by a line to a mast {{near the front of}} the boat with a separate fishing line in a <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> release clip that separates when the fishing line is set. Inline boards are attached directly to the fishing line and a <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> clip that releases upon setting or tripping the planer board so it slides down the fishing line to a swivel tied several feet in front of the lure. Inlines are popular with walleye fishermen. Once tripped they offer much less resistance when reeling in a fish.|$|E
25|$|Double-action {{triggers}} {{provide the}} ability to fire the gun whether the hammer is cocked or uncocked. This feature is desirable for military, police, or self-defense pistols. The primary disadvantage of any double-action trigger is the extra length the trigger must be pulled and the extra weight required to overcome the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> of the hammer or striker.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} how an iso-elastic system works, {{we must first}} {{understand how}} <b>springs</b> work. The <b>tension</b> (elastic force) in a spring is proportional to its extension according to Hooke's law. This means that if a weight is hung on a spring it will oscillate with simple harmonic motion. This is because when the weight is above the balance point, the <b>spring's</b> <b>tension</b> is reduced so the weight falls due to gravity, and when the weight is below the balance point the <b>spring's</b> <b>tension</b> will pull it back upwards.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} in using an air-powered pogo stick, ranging from adjustable <b>spring</b> <b>tensions</b> to overall weight to power ratio.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, an {{electromechanical}} {{protective relay}} converts the voltages and currents to magnetic and electric forces and torques that press against <b>spring</b> <b>tensions</b> in the relay. The <b>tension</b> of the <b>spring</b> and taps on the electromagnetic coils in the relay {{are the main}} processes by which a user sets such a relay.|$|R
25|$|Balbus and Hawley (1991) {{proposed}} a mechanism which involves magnetic fields {{to generate the}} angular momentum transport. A simple system displaying this mechanism is a gas disk {{in the presence of}} a weak axial magnetic field. Two radially neighboring fluid elements will behave as two mass points connected by a massless spring, the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> playing the role of the magnetic tension. In a Keplerian disk the inner fluid element would be orbiting more rapidly than the outer, causing the spring to stretch. The inner fluid element is then forced by the spring to slow down, reduce correspondingly its angular momentum causing it to move to a lower orbit. The outer fluid element being pulled forward will speed up, increasing its angular momentum and move to a larger radius orbit. The <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> will increase as the two fluid elements move further apart and the process runs away.|$|E
25|$|Free-flow: Either of {{the stages}} may {{get stuck in}} the open position, causing a {{continuous}} flow of gas from the regulator known as a free-flow. This can be triggered by a range of causes, some {{of which can be}} easily remedied, others not. Possible causes include incorrect interstage pressure setting, incorrect second stage valve <b>spring</b> <b>tension,</b> damaged or sticking valve poppet, damaged valve seat, valve freezing, wrong sensitivity setting at the surface and in Poseidon servo-assisted second stages, low interstage pressure.|$|E
25|$|Dump valves {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a screw-in quick change system, and the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> may be adjustable.|$|E
30|$|<b>Tension</b> <b>springs</b> {{instead of}} {{compression}} springs embedded in vertical slider eliminate possible force from friction. <b>Spring</b> <b>tensioning</b> mechanism is not implemented in {{this version of}} the prototype. In this prototype, the upper body is manually compressed and locked in place to prepare the robot in a jump-ready state. A servo activated latch controls the locking and releasing of the upper body. Weights ranging from 0.5 to 1  kg are attached to the upper body to test their effect on the jumping ability.|$|R
40|$|Loop of flexible, small diameter, nickel wire protects {{metal oxide}} silicon /MOS/ {{transistors}} from a damaging electrostatic potential. The wire {{is attached to}} a music-wire spring, slipped over the MOS transistor case, and released so the <b>spring</b> <b>tensions</b> the wire loop around all the transistor leads, shorting them together. This allows handling without danger of damage...|$|R
50|$|Folmer and Schwing (USA) was {{the most}} famous proponent of single curtain FP {{shutters}}, with their large format sheet film Graflex single-lens reflex and Graphic press cameras using them from 1905 to 1973. Their most common 4×5 inch shutters had four slit widths ranging from 1½ to ⅛ inch and up to six <b>spring</b> <b>tensions</b> for a speed range of 1/10 to 1/1000 second.|$|R
25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|E
500|$|Tracker {{action has}} been used from antiquity to modern times. Despite the extra effort needed in playing, many organists prefer tracker action because of a feel and a control of the pipe valve operation. Before the pallet opens, wind {{pressure}} augments tension of the pallet spring, but once the pallet opens, only the <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> is felt at the key. This provides a [...] "breakaway" [...] feel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1912, Harley-Davidson {{introduced}} their patented [...] "Ful-Floteing Seat", {{which was}} suspended by {{a coil spring}} inside the seat tube.

2500|$|The Lewis gun used a pan {{magazine}} holding 47 or 97 rounds. Pan magazines {{hold the}} rounds, bullet-noses [...] inwards toward the center, in a radial fan. Unlike {{the more common}} drum magazines, which hold the rounds parallel to the axis and are fed by <b>spring</b> <b>tension,</b> pan magazines are mechanically indexed. The Lewis magazine was driven by a cam {{on top of the}} bolt which operated a pawl mechanism via a lever.|$|E
2500|$|The {{potential}} energy at maximum axle yaw {{may be increased}} by including an elastic constraint on the yaw motion of the axle, {{so that there is}} a contribution arising from <b>spring</b> <b>tension.</b> [...] Arranging wheels in bogies to increase the constraint on the yaw motion of wheelsets and applying elastic constraints to the bogie also raises the critical speed. [...] Introducing elastic forces into the equation permits suspension designs which are limited only by the onset of gross slippage, rather than classical hunting. The penalty to be paid for the virtual elimination of hunting is a straight track, with an attendant right-of-way problem and incompatibility with legacy infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|High quality 1911s are {{manufactured}} by many different companies and tolerances vary with each manufacturer. It {{is necessary to}} adjust recoil <b>spring</b> <b>tensions</b> and to identify specific magazines that work best in each gun. This must be done when converting a 1911 to fire the [...]460 Rowland cartridge. The company says a properly designed conversion requires an effective compensator to momentarily delay slide action and allow very high pressures and volumes of gas to dissipate to manageable levels before slide action may begin. Without this compensation, slide or frame failure will likely result over time and reliability will suffer in the short term.|$|R
40|$|We discuss further {{development}} of a modified force-directed graph drawing placement algorithm for reducing wire length while placing flexible blocks during the floorplanning stage of computer chip design. An effective repelling perimeter allows floorplanning blocks and to pass through each other during early stages of a run in response to <b>spring</b> <b>tensions</b> on the edges, yet repel just enough to avoid overlap in later stages. Pressure equalization equations permit flexible blocks to reshape dynamically in reaction to penetration from neighboring blocks. We present a number of experimental results demonstrating the feasibility of this approach, achieving up to 31 % wirelength improvement over commercial tools...|$|R

2500|$|Langley {{attempted}} to make a working piloted heavier-than-air aircraft. His models flew, but his two attempts at piloted flight were not successful. Langley began experimenting with rubber-band powered models and gliders in 1887. [...] (According to one book, {{he was not able}} to reproduce Alphonse Pénaud's time aloft with rubber power but persisted anyway.) He built a rotating arm (functioning like a wind tunnel) and made larger flying models powered by miniature steam engines. Langley realised that sustained powered flight was possible when he found that a 1lb. brass plate suspended from the rotating arm by a spring, could be kept aloft by a <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> of less than 1 oz.|$|E
2500|$|Cams {{that have}} {{excessive}} valve lift, running at high rpm, can cause {{what is called}} [...] "valve float", where the valve <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex. This {{could also be a}} result of a very steep rise of the lobe, where the valve is effectively shot off the end of the cam rather than following the cams’ profile. [...] This is typically what happens when a motor over revs. [...] This is where the engine rpm exceeds the maximum design rpm. [...] The valve train is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily. [...] Sometimes an over rev can cause engine failure when the valves become bent as a result of colliding with the piston crowns.|$|E
2500|$|All {{forms of}} energy are either {{potential}} energy (e.g. Chemical, gravitational, electrical energy, temperature differential, latent heat, etc.) or kinetic energy (e.g. momentum). Some technologies provide only short-term energy storage, and others can be very long-term such as power to gas using hydrogen or methane and the storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons in deep aquifers or bedrock. [...] A wind-up clock stores potential energy (in this case mechanical, in the <b>spring</b> <b>tension),</b> a battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone, and a hydroelectric dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy. Ice storage tanks store ice (thermal {{energy in the form}} of latent heat) at night to meet peak demand for cooling. Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. Even food (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in chemical form.|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>spring</b> <b>tensioned</b> wire cradle {{arrangement}} {{has been}} developed to hold the target rod lightly but firmly in place when performing rod-on-rod (symmetric Taylor) impact in a vacuum. In addition, a soft capture system has been designed and used to decelerate both rods while reducing the chance of them colliding a second time. High-speed photography was used to obtain {{the profile of a}} pure aluminium target rod as a function of time. Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) was also deployed to record the velocity of the rear of the target rod as a function of time. Voiding in the interior of recovered rods was investigated non-destructively using X-ray tomography. The data provides comprehensive validation information for predictive constitutive models...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{example of}} a {{rotating}} device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified {{used to describe the}} system behavior is the centrifugal clutch. [...] A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. [...] At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the <b>spring</b> <b>tension,</b> due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. [...] The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the centrifugal clutch illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern demand valves use a {{downstream}} {{rather than}} an upstream valve mechanism. In a downstream valve, the moving part of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the actuating lever goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which crosses the regulator body and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a <b>spring</b> <b>tension</b> adjustment screw may be fitted for limited diver control of the cracking pressure. This arrangement also allows relatively simple pressure balancing of the second stage.|$|E

50|$|The {{flap type}} meter {{includes}} a spring which returns the internal flap {{to the initial}} position. Sometimes if the <b>spring</b> is <b>tensioned</b> too tightly, it can restrict the incoming air and it would cause the intake air speed to increase when not opened fully.|$|R

The standard demonstration configuration has a <b>spring</b> <b>tensioned</b> with 40 lb of force installed on the control stick as to allow the pilot minimal room for uncommanded movement. The Blues do not wear G-suits, because the air bladders inside them would repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with the control stick between the pilot's legs. Instead, Blue Angel pilots tense their muscles to prevent blood from rushing from their heads and rendering them unconscious.|$|R
