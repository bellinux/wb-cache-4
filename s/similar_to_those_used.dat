5|$|In 2014, a {{team from}} the University of Cambridge began {{conducting}} a study in a short, double track section of unused tunnel near the platforms where a newly built tunnel for Crossrail is situated almost two metres beneath. The study is to establish how the original cast-iron lining sections, which are <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> for many miles of railway under London, resist possible deformation and soil movement caused by the developments.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} with medications <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while atypical antipsychotic drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.|$|E
5|$|To prevent injuries, boulderers {{position}} crash pads {{near the}} boulder {{to provide a}} softer landing, {{as well as one}} or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures, and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|Cannon also {{transformed}} naval warfare: the Royal Navy, in particular, {{took advantage}} of their firepower. As rifling became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon are <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> in the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, which are now significantly smaller in caliber.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains {{on one of the}} platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E

5|$|Population {{declined}} {{in the first half}} of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50. Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa. Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer. Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses.|$|E
5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down {{and needs to be}} reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{needed more}} ships as war approached. The 'Ocean' design was revised and {{simplified}} to allow mass production. This new design {{was the basis}} for the Liberty ship. On December 7, 1941 Japan attacked the military bases at Hawaii, Guam, and a few days later, the Philippines. Liberty ships carried weapons, ammunition, food, tools, hardware, vehicles, and other things for the war effort. They could also be equipped to carry a large number of troops by rigging bunks in the holds <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> by the armed guard. Liberty ships began taking troops and materials wherever they were needed, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Like other Liberty Ships, John Burke transported war materials between the United States and the rear areas of the Pacific War, often calling at Pearl Harbor, Australia, Guadalcanal, Hollandia and Manaus.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (<b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{encounter}} battle, {{the action}} had been fought between two forces of roughly equal {{size in the}} heavy monsoon rain at close quarters. Both companies had deployed to the high ground at {{around the same time}} in a bid to outflank the other, with the Australian infantry skilfully using their supporting artillery while the Viet Cong had attempted to nullify the Australian tactics by remaining in close contact. Ultimately, the artillery had decided the outcome in favour of the Australians however, and the Viet Cong had been forced to withdraw with heavy casualties. In this way the fighting bore many similarities to the victory twelve months earlier at Long Tan, yet it remained largely unheralded in Australia. Eight Australian soldiers received gallantry awards for their actions, including Military Crosses to O'Donnell, Ross and Clark, while Sutherland was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. A number of awards were also made to the RAAF pilots and aircrew, including Cox who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Meanwhile, the bravery evident by the Viet Cong during the battle had also made an impression on the Australians, who later acknowledged their tight fire discipline and the skilfulness of their battle drills and tactics which they found to be <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> by the Australians themselves.|$|E
5|$|It {{was known}} the game needed to use 3D {{graphics}} with hardware acceleration {{to keep up}} with trends. The goal was to have a 3D renderer good enough for deathmatch. The team was also aiming to have a software renderer for lower-end computers. The team used Direct X to improve the lighting effects. The audio was implemented by five team members. The music was composed by Mark Knight, and Nick Laviers was head of audio. The methods used was <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> by the BBC for their radio effects. David Armor and Shintaro Kanaoya headed the level design, working with the flow of the tweaked user interface created to reduce ambiguity when looking after the dungeon. In fact, the interface was redesigned more than ten times due to feedback from various groups because the team wanted the public to understand it. Testers played levels without any invading forces, which {{led to the development of}} My Pet Dungeon. An important feature to improve was the multiplayer, and great deal of effort was put into it.|$|E

5|$|As in Final Fantasy XII, {{enemies are}} {{integrated}} into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>used</b> in previous Final Fantasy titles. A maximum of three characters {{may be used in}} battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.|$|E

The experimental results demonstrate that the electron-hole exchange interaction energy (j) in AlN is j= 6. 8 meV, {{which is the largest}} value for typical III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors. We propose the effective interatomic distance as the criterion of the electron-hole exchange interaction energy, revealing a universal rule. This study should encourage potential applications of excitonic optoelectronic devices in nitride semiconductors <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>using</b> II-VI compound semiconductors...|$|R
