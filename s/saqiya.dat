50|$|Complex <b>saqiyas</b> {{consisting}} {{of more than}} 200 separate components were used extensively by Muslim inventors and engineers in the medieval Islamic world. The mechanical flywheel, used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine and, essentially, to allow lifting water from far greater depths (up to 200 metres), was first employed by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038-1075), of Islamic Spain.|$|R

50|$|The {{first known}} {{use of a}} {{crankshaft}} in a <b>saqiya</b> was featured in another one of al-Jazari's machines. The concept of minimising the intermittence is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's <b>saqiya</b> devices, which was to maximise {{the efficiency of the}} <b>saqiya.</b> Al-Jazari also constructed a water-raising device that was run by hydropower, though the Chinese had been using hydropower for the same purpose before him. Animal-powered saqiyas and water-powered norias similar to the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century, and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.|$|E
50|$|A sakia or <b>saqiya</b> {{differs from}} a noria in two {{substantial}} ways. First, {{by the way}} it is powered, namely by animal power or rarely by wind, in modern versions also by engines, but never by hydropower. The other difference is that a <b>saqiya</b> is lifting the water out of a well or a body of standing water, while the noria is placed on the bank of a river.|$|E
5000|$|The {{built up}} area of two Palestinian Muslim villages Kafr 'Ana in the east, and <b>Saqiya</b> [...] to the west are located within the current Or Yehuda city limits. Both villages date back to at least the 16th century. In the 1931 census of Palestine {{conducted}} by the British Mandate authorities, Kafr 'Ana had a population of 1,824 in 449 houses and <b>Saqiya</b> 663 inhabitants in 142 houses.|$|E
50|$|An Ottoman village list {{of about}} 1870 showed that <b>Saqiya</b> had 53 houses and a {{population}} of 168, though the population count included men only.|$|E

50|$|In 1206, Al-Jazari's Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices {{described}} many hydraulic machines. Of {{particular importance}} were his water-raising pumps. The first known {{use of a}} crankshaft in a chain pump {{was in one of}} al-Jazari's <b>saqiya</b> machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's <b>saqiya</b> chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the <b>saqiya</b> chain pump. Al-Jazari also invented a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump, which included the first suction pipes, suction pumping, double-action pumping, and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism. This pump is remarkable for three reasons: the first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum) in a pump, the first application of the double-acting principle, and the conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion, via the crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, {{immigrants}} from Libya and Turkey {{settled in the}} ruins buildings of the villages of <b>Saqiya</b> and Kafr 'Ana, which did not have water or sewage infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|According to Israeli sources {{the village}} was {{attacked}} and occupied on 25 April 1948. But according to the Palestinians and a telegram sent to the Associated Press noted {{that it was a}} few days later on 27-28 April, along with the Khayriya and Kafr Ana villages. Whatever was the case, <b>Saqiya</b> was among the villages targeted in the process of Operation Hametz. The [...] "History of Hagannah" [...] mention that the occupation of <b>Saqiya</b> and the surrounding villages have been done (without fighting) without mentioning anything about the population number at that time.|$|E
5000|$|During the Islamic Golden Age, norias {{were adopted}} from the {{classical}} World by Muslim engineers, who made {{improvements to the}} noria. For example, the flywheel mechanism used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine, was invented by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038-1075) of al-Andalus, who pioneered {{the use of the}} flywheel in the noria and <b>saqiya.</b> In 1206, Al-Jazari introduced the use of the crankshaft in the noria and <b>saqiya,</b> and the concept of minimizing [...] was implied for the purpose of maximising their efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{historical}} Middle-Eastern device {{known in}} Arabic as <b>saqiya</b> usually had its buckets {{attached to a}} double chain, creating a so-called [...] "pot garland". This allowed scooping water out of a much deeper well.|$|E
50|$|He {{used the}} {{crankshaft}} with a connecting rod {{in two of}} his water-raising machines: the crank-driven <b>saqiya</b> chain pump and the double-action reciprocating piston suction pump. His water pump also employed the first known crank-slider mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The Syrian Sufi {{teacher and}} {{traveller}} Mustafa al-Bakri al-Siddiqi (1688-1748/9), who toured {{the region in}} the first half of the eighteenth century, wrote that he passed through <b>Saqiya</b> while he was on his way to Jaffa.|$|E
50|$|In 1950-1953 the Ma'abarot <b>Saqiya</b> A, <b>Saqiya</b> B, Kafr 'Ana A, and Kafr 'Ana B were {{established}} {{on the previous}} village lands. These Ma'abarot housed mainly immigrants from Iraq who arrived as part of Operation Ezra and Nehemiah. Ma'abarot {{at the time were}} treated by authorities as temporary accommodations until permanent resettlement could occur on-site or elsewhere. Attempts to induce neighboring Tel-Aviv and Ramat Gan to extend their municipal borders to cover these Ma'abarot failed, and the Ma'abarot residents resisted relocation to development towns in the north and south. In 1952 the religious settlement of Ramat Pinkas (also known as Givat Hemed, and Givat Mordechi) was established for some of the Ma'abarot residents.|$|E
50|$|A {{manuscript}} by Al-Jazari featured {{an intricate}} device {{based on a}} <b>saqiya,</b> powered {{in part by the}} pull of an ox walking on the roof of an upper-level reservoir, but also by water falling onto the spoon-shaped pallets of a water-wheel placed in a lower-level reservoir.|$|E
50|$|On 23 September 1948 General Avner named Kafr 'Ana as a {{suitable}} village for resettlement for new Jewish immigrants ("olim") to Israel. Today, the modern Israeli city, Or Yehuda, is built upon the lands formerly belonging to Kafr 'Ana and <b>Saqiya</b> village and Kheiriya village. Or Yehuda {{was founded in}} 1950, on village land, south of the village site.|$|E
50|$|A sakia, {{alternative}} spelling sakieh or <b>saqiya</b> (from ساقية, <b>sāqīya),</b> {{also called}} Persian wheel, tablia, and in Latin tympanum is a mechanical water lifting device which uses buckets, jars, or scoops fastened either {{directly to a}} vertical wheel, or to an endless belt activated by such a wheel. The vertical wheel is itself attached by a drive shaft to a horizontal wheel, which is traditionally {{set in motion by}} animal power (oxen, donkeys, etc.) Because it is not using the power of flowing water, the sakia is different from a noria and any other type of water-wheel. It is still used in India, Egypt {{and other parts of the}} Middle East, and in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. It may have been invented in Hellenistic Egypt, Persia or India. The sakia was mainly used for irrigation, but not exclusively, as the example of Qusayr Amra shows, where it was used at least in part to provide water for a royal bathhouse.|$|E
50|$|In {{the end of}} April 1948, the Haganah {{launched}} {{military operation}} Hametz which aimed to conquer several villages inland from Jaffa to isolate it from the Arab hinterland. The fate awaiting the inhabitants was not made explicit, other than stating the inhabitants {{would be allowed to}} leave, but a general order envisaged 'cleansing the area' (tihur hashetah) and the villages of Kafr 'Ana and <b>Saqiya</b> were depopulated.|$|E
50|$|The noria {{performs}} {{the function of}} moving water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation. In this it {{is similar to the}} <b>saqiya</b> and other pumps, but those are generally powered by other means, not by a water wheel. Its concept is similar to the modern hydraulic ram, which also uses the power of flowing water to pump some of the water out of the river.|$|E
5000|$|Although Philo of Byzantium {{described}} the <b>saqiya</b> chain pump {{in the early}} 2nd century BC, the square-pallet chain pump was innovated in China during this century, mentioned first by the philosopher Wang Chong around AD 80. Wang Chong also accurately {{described the}} water cycle in meteorology, and argued against the mainstream 'radiating influence' theory for solar eclipses, the latter of which was accepted by many, including Zhang Heng.|$|E
50|$|In 1596, under Ottoman rule, <b>Saqiya</b> was {{a village}} in the nahiya of Ramla (liwa´ of Gaza), with a {{population}} of 49 households, an estimated 270 people, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, fruit and sesame, as well as on other types of property, such as goats, beehives and vineyards; a total of 14,300 Akçe. 10/24 parts of the revenue went to a Waqf.|$|E
5000|$|The terms {{referring}} to traditional water-raising devices {{used in the}} Middle East, India, Spain and other areas are sometimes used rather loosely. The term noria is commonly used for devices using the power of moving water.

50|$|Having {{been built}} in an arid region of strong winds and blowing sand, the Fossatum quickly eroded and only traces remain. During the Middle Ages, Arab nomads of the Banu Hilal {{occupied}} much of the area and noticed southwest of Biskra a ditch which they called a <b>saqiya</b> (irrigation canal) and attributed it to a legendary Arab queen Bint al-Khass (or al-Krass), {{who was supposed to}} have built it to supply pilgrims to Mecca with water. Elsewhere the remains ofa wall associated with the Fossatum was attributed to al-Fara'un (Pharaoh).|$|E

50|$|The main {{economic}} activity in Makuria was agriculture, with farmers growing several crops a year of barley, millet, and dates. The methods used were generally the same {{that had been used}} for millennia. Small plots of well irrigated land were lined {{along the banks of the}} Nile, which would be fertilized by the river's annual flooding. One important technological advance was the <b>saqiya,</b> an oxen-powered water wheel, that was introduced in the Roman period and helped increase yields and population density. Settlement patterns indicate that land was divided into individual plots rather than as in a manorial system. The peasants lived in small villages composed of clustered houses of sun-dried brick.|$|E

50|$|A Jewish {{attack on}} the base took place on November 29, 1947, when the Palmach stole {{explosives}} and 75 rifles. Towards {{of the end of}} the British Mandate of Palestine, Arabs under the command of Hasan Salama began smuggling in arms and personnel disguised as laborers into the camp. The Haganah command saw this as a threat and on April 15, 1948, two companies for the 32nd and 33rd Battalions of the Alexandroni Brigade entered and captured the base. Arab forces counterattacked from al-Khayriyya, Kafr 'Ana, al-'Abbasiyya and <b>Saqiya,</b> but the Jewish forces reinforced and pushed them back to a small salient in the south of the camp, which was captured later in Operation Hametz. The Alexandroni Brigade lost three soldiers, while the Arab losses were estimated at about 50.|$|E
50|$|Hammam as-Sarah is an Umayyad bathhouse {{located in}} Jordan, and built in {{connection}} with the complex of Qasr al-Hallabat, which stands some 2 kilometres to the west. Qasr al-Hallabat is one of the Umayyad buildings collectively known as the desert castles. The design of Hammam as-Sarah shows similarities to the design of Qusayr 'Amra, another one of the desert castles. The design consists of a rectangular audience hall as well as the actual baths. The baths comprise an apodyterium (undressing room), tepidarium (warm room) and caldarium (hot room), with attached furnace, water well, water lifting device (<b>saqiya),</b> and raised water tank. The remains of a roofless mosque next to the furnace are of recent date. As of 2007 or earlier, most of the bath complex as well as the accompanying mosaics and sculpture were being conserved.|$|E
50|$|The {{engineers}} of the Islamic world developed several {{solutions to}} achieve the maximum output from a water wheel. One solution was to mount them to piers of bridges {{to take advantage of}} the increased flow. Another solution was the shipmill, a type of water mill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships moored in midstream. This technique was employed along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in 10th-century Iraq, where large shipmills made of teak and iron could produce 10 tons of flour from corn every day for the granary in Baghdad. The flywheel mechanism, which is used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine, was invented by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038-1075) of Al-Andalus; he pioneered the use of the flywheel in the <b>saqiya</b> (chain pump) and noria. The engineers Al-Jazari in the 13th century and Taqi al-Din in the 16th century described many inventive water-raising machines in their technological treatises. They also employed water wheels to power a variety of devices, including various water clocks and automata.|$|E
