2500|$|Hirsh {{had good}} leverage, pitched down to hitters, {{and had a}} refined {{repertoire}} of pitches. [...] He had a [...] "plus" [...] 2-seam fastball that had sink and good movement at 91–94mph, and threw a [...] "filthy" [...] hard-breaking slider that was consistently precise, and had bite at 80–86mph (managers rated it the best breaking ball in the Texas League). [...] Hirsh continued to refine his moderate changeup, which had fair deception and movement in the low-80s. [...] He also threw a 4-seam fastball in the 94–96mph range. [...] He was not afraid to pitch inside, and threw strikes to {{both sides of the}} plate. [...] "I'm 6-foot-8 and I keep a high three-quarters arm angle," [...] noted Hirsh. [...] "You figure the mound is a foot and a half, and my arm may be another two, three, four feet. [...] It makes the batter have to look up instead of <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and he may have a difficult time adjusting." [...] During the 2007 season, Hirsh had trouble throwing his fastball enough. Pitching coach Bob Apodaca gave this assessment of Hirsh before 2008: [...] "All Jason has to do is trust his stuff. [...] He has the type of fastball you work off, but he was using his fastball the way you'd use an off-speed pitch —- to try and trick hitters." ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} {{unwashed}} finger {{went up and}} pointed <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] echoed Chatellerault, his ferocity {{welling up}} again. Then, {{swinging}} round, he came <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as a bull makes a charge.|$|E
60|$|Her anger had evaporated. There stood my {{familiar}} Fanny again, slim as a mast, {{her light}} eyes coldly shining, her bearing, even {{the set of}} her foot showing already a faint gilding of Mrs Monnerie. She laughed--looking <b>straight</b> across <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as if with a challenge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{was just}} passing along, minding mah own business, when Ah {{heard a noise}} {{up on the hill}} behind me," [...] said Unc' Billy, [...] "and when Ah looked up, there was {{something}} coming <b>straight</b> down <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and Ah couldn't see any legs or head or tail." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{heard her}} speaking, and I knew by {{the tone of}} her voice that she was comforting me--I, who {{deserved}} nothing but the reproach of her silence! How long it was before I mastered the absorbing misery of my own thoughts, I cannot tell. I was first conscious that she was kissing me, and then my eyes seemed to wake on a sudden to their sense of outward things, and I knew that I was looking mechanically <b>straight</b> before <b>me</b> <b>at</b> {{the prospect of the}} lake.|$|R
6000|$|Ariel {{clapped her}} great shapeless hands. [...] "He always laughs at me!" [...] she said, with a proud look of superiority {{directed}} <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Sit {{down against}} that pillar,’ said Nance. ‘Don’t you be afraid; I won’t leave you, and don’t look up or down: look <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> How white you are!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit {{down against}} that pillar," [...] said Nance. [...] "Don't you be afraid; I won't leave you, and don't look up or down: look <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> How white you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity {{you were}} not quite <b>straight</b> with <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the beginning, Gladwyne; it would have saved you trouble," [...] he remarked at length. [...] "I took a {{sporting}} risk at pretty long odds--I have to do so now and then and I pay up when I lose. But if I'd known the money {{was to go to}} Miss Gladwyne and you would only get the land, I'd never have kept you supplied; and in particular I wouldn't have made the last big loan shortly before you and your cousin sailed for Canada." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fire scene {{inside the}} house/Plato's cave. Virginia is ironing Cordelia's nightgown (she wears {{it in the}} Joan of Arc {{sequence}} at 01:07:00). NO THING (inter-title). Music starts slowly. Edgar lights a little bonfire with sticks and paper he gathered up on the way in. Will Jr: [...] "It is born, and it is burnt. It begins from the thing it ends. At the same time." [...] Music accelerates to nearly full speed. [...] "Then what is it? (Looking <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> Virginia) TELL <b>ME</b> THE NAME! Look, no names, no lines. No lines, no story!" [...] Virginia: [...] "To name things makes the Professor pee." [...] (or just 'P') Edgar: [...] "Poor things. Who are they, to need a name? To exist?" [...] Discussion of colour. Red and yellow tulips.|$|R
60|$|Señor Villaverde {{listened and}} bowed towards me, {{but with no}} {{softening}} in his stern, calm face, while his cold grey eyes seemed to look <b>straight</b> through <b>me</b> <b>at</b> something beyond. His manner towards me made me feel a kind of despair, for how strong must have been his disapproval of my conduct in running off with his friend's daughter--how great his indignation against me, when it prevented him from bestowing one smile or one kind word on me to thank me for all I had done for his kinswoman! Yet this was only the reflected indignation of my father-in-law.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, be good children! Look <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and listen!" [...] And {{lifting up}} her finger, {{she began to}} sing the first song of which she could think, [...] "The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] he said softly, [...] "is where I found Jimmy. He {{was sitting}} there with his rifle on his knee, looking <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as though {{there were lots of}} things he could tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{great thing}} is to prevent Jasper {{becoming}} unreasonable," [...] she said; and I could see real concern lurking in the quiet depths of her frank eyes gazing <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You will help to keep him quiet, won't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|When next I awoke, {{a sickly}} yellow light was {{filtering}} in on me. It was {{dawn of the}} second day. I crept {{to the front of}} the store. A smoke pall, shot through with lurid gleams, filled the sky. Down the opposite side of the street tottered a wretched slave. One hand he held tightly against his side, and behind him he left a bloody trail. His eyes roved everywhere, and they were filled with apprehension and dread. Once he looked <b>straight</b> across <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and in his face was all the dumb pathos of the wounded and hunted animal. He saw me, but there was no kinship between us, and with him, at least, no sympathy of understanding; for he cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on. He could expect no aid in all God's world. He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the masters were making. All he could hope for, all he sought, was some hole to crawl away in and hide like any animal. The sharp clang of a passing ambulance at the corner gave him a start. Ambulances were not for such as he. With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway. A minute later he was out again and desperately hobbling on.|$|R
6000|$|... "She sat up <b>straight</b> {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and then she}} said, 'I'm in love,'" [...] Katharine mused, trying to set the whole scene in motion. It was a scene to dwell on with so much wonder that not a grain of pity {{occurred}} to her; it was a flame blazing suddenly in the dark; by its light Katharine perceived far too vividly for her comfort the mediocrity, indeed the entirely fictitious character of her own feelings so far as they pretended to correspond with Mary's feelings. She {{made up her mind}} to act instantly upon the knowledge thus gained, and cast her mind in amazement back to the scene upon the heath, when she had yielded, heaven knows why, for reasons which seemed now imperceptible. So in broad daylight one might revisit the place where one has groped and turned and succumbed to utter bewilderment in a fog.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw her! The consoler of sleepless nights, of weary days; the {{companion}} of troubled years! I saw her! She looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> {{the place where}} I crouched. She was there as I had seen her for years--a faithful wanderer by my side. She looked with sad eyes and had smiling lips; she looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> [...] . Smiling lips! Had I not promised that she should not die! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dat's me!" [...] she cried. [...] "Look <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> an' ye see yer queen. An' how you dar', you misribble Hop-grog, to say I no queen! You 'serve to be killed. Take hole o' him, some uv you fellers! Grab dat Hop-grog!" ...|$|E
60|$|These, who I noted carried axes {{instead of}} assegais, rushed <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the axes raised {{in such a}} fashion that anyone unacquainted with the habits of Zulu warriors of the old school, might have thought that they {{intended}} nothing short of murder.|$|E
6000|$|Somewhat to my {{surprise}} the girl looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as she answered: [...] "Considering the question in the abstract, I agree with you. It {{seems to me the}} duty of every man with talents to take the place he was meant for among his peers instead of frittering them away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> Beatrice, and she <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> We {{seemed to}} have formed an {{alliance}} in that look: she was {{the other half of}} my consciousness, I of hers. Ha! Ha! {{there were a lot of}} white narcissus, and little white hyacinths, Roman hyacinths, in the conservatory. I can see them now, great white stars, and tangles of little ones, among a bank of green; and I can recall the keen, fresh scent on the warm air; and the look of Beatrice ... her great dark eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... “Ah, my dear fellow, he must {{settle it}} himself. He {{has no right}} at any rate to put me such a question. There was a moment, {{just as he was}} going, when he had it on his tongue’s end. He stood there in the doorway, he couldn’t leave me—he was going to plump out with it. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>straight,</b> and I looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> him; we {{remained}} that way for almost a minute. Then he decided not, on the whole, to risk it and took himself off.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was three}} days before I plucked up courage to go again; and then I felt her eyes on <b>me</b> <b>at</b> once--she was making a 'cat's cradle' {{with a bit of}} string, but I could see them {{stealing}} up from her hands to my face. And she went wandering about the room, fingering at everything. When her father called out: 'What's the matter with you, Elie?' she stared at him like a child caught doing wrong. I looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> her then, she tried to look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but she couldn't; and a minute later she went out of the room. God knows what sort of nonsense I talked--I was too happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was meant for my leg," [...] he said. [...] "I hit the fellow once with the thick end of the quirt, but he jumped <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> The horse reared when he felt the knife and I came off before he fell. When I got up again, the fellow had gone." ...|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and his eyes--Celtic-grey, with a {{good deal}} of light in them--stared, wide and fixed, at things beyond me, as only do the eyes of those who have seen much death. There was a sort of burnt-gunpowder look about their rims and lashes, and a fixity that nothing could have stared down.|$|E
60|$|Without an instant's notice he made <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> He had {{a dinner}} {{knife in his}} hand, and as I saw he was dangerous, I {{tried to keep the}} table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however, for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.|$|E
5000|$|... 28 of {{his last}} 29 teams have {{advanced}} to the NCAA Tournament (23 <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> Arizona and 5 <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> Iowa) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{position}} had its drawbacks, however. One wintry, blustering, {{dark night}} in July, as I stood sleepily {{out of the}} rain under the break of the poop something resembling an ostrich dashed up the gangway. I say ostrich because the creature, though it ran on two legs, appeared to help its progress by working a pair of short wings; it was a man, however, only his coat, ripped up the back and flapping in two halves above his shoulders, gave him that weird and fowl-like appearance. At least, I suppose it was his coat, for it was impossible to make him out distinctly. How he managed to come so <b>straight</b> upon <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> speed and without a stumble over a strange deck, I cannot imagine. He must have been able to see in the dark better than any cat. He overwhelmed me with panting entreaties to let him take shelter till morning in our forecastle. Following my strict orders, I refused his request, mildly at first, in a sterner tone as he insisted with growing impudence.|$|R
5000|$|But {{when they}} acted disdainfully, death marched <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> them ...|$|R
60|$|It pleased me greatly that Cotton was {{the first}} upon his feet, and Mackay the next, {{although}} it was but for a second, because, almost simultaneously, a double row of weather-darkened men heaved themselves upright. Cotton's face was flushed, and his eyes shone strangely under the candlelight; but he looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as he solemnly raised the glass in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|The lad looked <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I'm not {{responsible}} for the weather, Ormesby," [...] he said, a trifle stiffly. [...] "Still, since you have put it so, it's my opinion that Miss Lucille Haldane would understand anybody. She has the gift of making you feel it also. To change the subject, however, I was over warning Bryan about his fireguard furrows, and yours hardly seem in accordance with the order." ...|$|E
6000|$|Just then a dim figure {{approached}} {{me from the}} direction of Virginia--a man, evidently. He came <b>straight</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and I stepped aside to let him pass; he stepped in the way and confronted me again. Then I saw that he had a mask on and was holding something in my face--I heard a click-click and recognized a revolver in dim outline. I pushed the barrel aside with my hand and said: ...|$|E
