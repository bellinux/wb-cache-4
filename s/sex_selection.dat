40|$|Sex {{determining}} (SD) {{mechanisms are}} highly variable between different taxonomic groups {{and appear to}} change relatively quickly during evolution. <b>Sex</b> ratio <b>selection</b> could be a dominant force causing such changes. We investigate theoretically the effect of <b>sex</b> ratio <b>selection</b> on the dynamics of a multi-factorial SD system. The system considered resembles the naturally occurring three-locus system of the housefly, which allows for male heterogamety, female heterogamety {{and a variety of}} other mechanisms. <b>Sex</b> ratio <b>selection</b> is modelled by assuming cost differences in the production of sons and daughters, a scenario leading to a strong sex ratio bias in the absence of constraints imposed by the mechanism of sex determination. We show that, despite of the presumed flexibility of the SD system considered, equilibrium sex ratios never deviate strongly from 1 : 1. Even if daughters are very costly, a male-biased sex ratio can never evolve. If sons are more costly, sex ratio can be slightly female biased but even in case of large cost differences the bias is very small (< 10 % from 1 : 1). <b>Sex</b> ratio <b>selection</b> can lead to a shift in the SD mechanism, but cannot be the sole cause of complete switches from one SD system to another. In fact, more than one locus remains polymorphic at equilibrium. We discuss our results in the context of evolution of the variable SD mechanism found in natural housefly populations. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{government}} of India, in a 2011 report, has begun better educating all stakeholders about its MTP and PCPNDT laws.

40|$|Sex {{determination}} is {{a fundamental}} process governed by diverse mechanisms. <b>Sex</b> ratio <b>selection</b> is commonly implicated {{in the evolution of}} sex-determining systems, although formal models are rare. Here, we argue that, although <b>sex</b> ratio <b>selection</b> can induce shifts in sex determination, genomic conflicts between parents and offspring can explain why single-factor systems (e. g. XY/ XX or ZW/ZZ) are common even in species that experience <b>selection</b> for biased <b>sex</b> ratios. Importantly, evolutionary shifts in sex determination do not always result in the biased production of sons and daughters sensu sex ratio theory. Thus, equal sex ratios might be an emergent character of sex-determining systems even when biased sex ratios are favored by selection...|$|R
40|$|Directional {{selection}} was relatively frequent, {{and in some}} instances intense, during a three-year study of a pheasant population. The pheasant is a polygynous species. In addition to weight, tarsus length and wing length, which were studied in both sexes, three beak characters were measured in females, and tail and spur length in males. Both univariate and multivariate techniques were used to estimate selection. Selection associated with survival and reproductive success was detected in both <b>sexes.</b> <b>Selection</b> gradients indicated consistent opposing selection for low weight and long tarsus in association with female survival, while female reproductive success was negatively related to bill length. In males, several phenotypically correlated characters covaried positively with reproductive success, which was measured both as the number of acquired females and the estimated number of sired chicks. However, only the selection gradients for spur length were significant, indicating that spur length is the most important factor for male reproductive success. Male survival was also associated with spur length. This suggests that spur length at the phenotypic level is enhanced by both natural and sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} HIV-AIDS cases among African American women (AAW) {{continues}} to rise. AAW currently {{account for about}} 65 % of AIDS diagno-ses among women in the United States. Furthermore, among AAW living with HIV-AIDS, heterosexual transmission remains {{the leading cause of}} HIV spread. Indeed, examining AAWs <b>sex</b> partner <b>selection</b> patterns will be a key step in understanding how to support HIV prevention for this popula-tion. A grounded-theory study was conducted to examine what factors influence AAW’s alternation between monogamous and nonmonogamous sexual relationships. To explore this phenomenon, we recruited 14 urban AAW between the ages of 18 and 30 for interviews. The findings revealed that AAW’s <b>sex</b> partner <b>selection</b> patterns in consensual sexual relationships were influenced by the “getting-to-know ” process, the male’s relationship preference, a woman’s risk perception, and how the role of sex is defined. The results of this study can provide insights for future interventions seeking to curb HIV rates among AAW from urban communities. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on March 4, 2016 jbs. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R

25|$|The {{impact of}} Indian laws on female {{foeticide}} and its enforcement is unclear. United Nations Population Fund and India's National Human Rights Commission, in 2009, asked the Government of India {{to assess the}} impact of the law. The Public Health Foundation of India, an premier research organization in its 2010 report, claimed a lack of awareness about the Act in parts of India, inactive role of the Appropriate Authorities, ambiguity among some clinics that offer prenatal care services, and the role of a few medical practitioners in disregarding the law. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has targeted education and media advertisements to reach clinics and medical professionals to increase awareness. The Indian Medical Association has undertaken efforts to prevent prenatal <b>sex</b> <b>selection</b> by giving its members Beti Bachao (save the daughter) badges during its meetings and conferences. However, a recent study by Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) argues that the 1994 PNDT Act may have had a small impact by preventing 106,000 female foeticides over one decade.|$|E

However, the overall sex ratio is approximately 0. 73, with otosclerosis being approximately 1. 8 times more frequent in female offspring. These observations are interpreted as the consequence of selection against males carrying the otosclerosis gene. Elimination of such males occurs only in certain sibships.

2500|$|Some bioethicists {{believe that}} <b>sex</b> <b>selection</b> is an ethical problem {{and could be}} {{disruptive}} to society. Charles Lockwood of Yale says, [...] "a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars." [...] According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, <b>sex</b> <b>selection</b> is not a frequent occurrence in the United States {{but it is a}} concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, <b>sex</b> <b>selection</b> has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys. Punjab's Health Minister Ramesh Chander Dogra has said he will take action to ban the test in India.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{value of}} sexed semen due to {{increased}} intensity of selection on cows to produce replacements can be determined from a slight modification of a procedure used to predict net worth of semen of different costs from sires of different transmitting abilities. Table values corresponding to precision of <b>sexing</b> (<b>selection</b> intensity allowed for cows), discount rate, investment period, and conception rate are used in simple equations to determine the economic value of sexed or regular semen. The additional price that can be paid for sexed semen as compared to regular semen also can be determined. For example, sexed semen resulting in 80 % heifers can increase transmitting ability of cows selected to produce heifers by 93 kg of milk or genetic gain by 8 kg per year. However, with a discount rate of 10 %, 10 yr, a conception rate of 50 % for both regular and sexed semen, an added value above feed costs of $. 1005 /kg, and an ampule cost of $ 6 for regular semen, the cost per ampule of sexed semen must be less than $ 15. 67 for use of sexed semen to be profitable. Another example also is given in the text for comparing the expected economic returns for two bulls with different predicted difference milk, conception rates, and price per breeding unit of regular semen...|$|R

2500|$|The Indian {{census data}} {{suggests}} {{there is a}} positive correlation between abnormal sex ratio and better socio-economic status and literacy. This may be connected to the dowry system in India where dowry deaths occur when a girl is seen as a financial burden.

40|$|Sexual traits {{can serve}} as honest {{indicators}} of phenotypic quality when they are costly. Brightly coloured yellow to red traits, which are pigmented by carotenoids, are relatively common in birds, and feature in sexual selection. Carotenoids {{have been linked to}} immune and antioxidant function, and the trade-off between ornamentation and these physiological functions provides a potential mechanism rendering carotenoid based signals costly. Mutual ornamentation is also common in birds and can be maintained by mutual mate choice for this ornament or by a correlated response in one <b>sex</b> to <b>selection</b> on the other <b>sex.</b> When <b>selection</b> pressures differ between the sexes this can cause intralocus sexual conflict. Sexually antagonistic selection pressures have been demonstrated for few sexual traits, and for carotenoid-dependent traits there is a single example: bill redness was found to be positively associated with survival and reproductive output in male zebra finches, but negatively so in females. We retested these associations in our captive zebra finch population without two possible limitations of this earlier study. Contrary to the earlier findings, we found no evidence for sexually antagonistic <b>selection.</b> In both <b>sexes,</b> individuals with redder bills showed higher survival.
