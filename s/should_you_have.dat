6000|$|... 'Then what <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{done with}} the greetings? <b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> kept them in compensation? My {{sentence}} is that you should give back the roubles, and that your comrade gives you a greeting.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't believe you. You {{brought him}} back because this man whom you call Fisher got to know of your plans. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done it because of me? Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> put my {{interests}} before Mrs Ford's? I am nothing to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then said Cleever, [...] "I can't understand. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{seen and}} done {{all these things}} before you have cut your wisdom-teeth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{seen that}} fickle crowd snatch off their hats then. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> heard them cheer, and shout, [...] "Long live the Prince of Wales!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were all}} raw levies, my good fellow. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> seen our militia {{run from the}} Scotch, and be cursed to them. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had some troops with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I begin {{rather to}} wonder, sir," [...] said Lord Menteith, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{continued}} {{so long in}} the Swedish service, than that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> ultimately withdrawn from it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 6th Student. And the bride! Yes, sure enough, our [...] Phene! <b>Should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{known her}} in her clothes? [...] How magnificently pale! ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently Wilmet, by way {{of making}} {{assurance}} sure, went off for her account-book; {{when he looked up}} and said,' How <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> liked this, Cherry?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But who in {{the world}} should want to get your letters?" [...] she asked incredulously. [...] "And why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> them {{addressed}} to the bank?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or {{else that}} what?" [...] she demanded. [...] "Ma foi, it only remains that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> kept your promise to this scum." ...|$|R
60|$|But if {{you would}} come out of that murky electioneering {{atmosphere}} and come to us, you don't know how delighted we <b>should</b> be. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> your own way as completely as though you were at home. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a cheery room, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a Swiss ch√¢let all to yourself to write in. Smoking regarded as a personal favour to the family. Georgina is so insupportably vain on account of being a favourite of yours, that you might find her a drawback; but nothing else would turn out in that way, I hope.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, where <b>should</b> <b>you?</b> We <b>have</b> none, <b>you</b> know, but two {{or three}} French fellows, who, I believe, are little better than garcons apothecaires.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Duke {{dismounted}} {{and stood}} by her side. 'Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been listening {{at this time of}} night, and yet not expecting me?' he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why not? It {{would be}} their fault if they bought a car that wasn't any good. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to worry once you had it sold?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> devoted {{your time}} to her as you have done? It frightens me when I think of the injury we must have done you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>should</b> think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{had enough}} of the sea, Stephen, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> now ample to live ashore in comfort {{for the rest of your}} life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No you won't, father. And why <b>should</b> <b>you?</b> He <b>has</b> {{done nothing}} wrong to you or me. I wouldn't have him if it was ever so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>should</b> think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> succeeded excellently, {{and it is}} a {{very pretty}} fancy. Tell me what some of them mean: will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I spoke {{a little}} abruptly," [...] said the doctor, [...] "but {{you must have}} known the nature of your complaint. Why, otherwise, <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{somewhat}} mollified her. [...] "Oh, Mr. Stanhope," [...] said she, [...] "why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{made me so}} miserable? What {{will you}} have gained by telling me all this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Roderick {{continued}} his work; {{but after a}} moment, turning round with a frown: [...] "If you supposed I had a reason for being silent, pray why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> spoken?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of what {{necessity}} <b>should</b> <b>you?</b> I <b>have</b> said it. That {{should be}} enough for a chivalrous American like you." [...] She again significantly {{looked down at her}} hand.|$|R
60|$|Cobb. Well then, said he, the King then {{commands}} <b>you,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> any private meetings; {{because it}} is against his law, and he is ordained of God, therefore <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> any.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> told me, Anne," [...] Leslie cried passionately. [...] "If I {{had known}} I {{would have gone}} away--I wouldn't have stayed here to meet him. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> told me. It wasn't fair of you, Anne--oh, it wasn't fair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if Mademoiselle Noemie {{has this}} devotion to her art," [...] Newman once observed, [...] "why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> those fears {{for her that}} you spoke of the other day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Again the Judge broke in. [...] "Why, what <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{been doing}} {{there in the}} company of rebels, two of whom--Lord Gildoy and your fellow there--have already {{admitted}} their guilt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait here!" [...] she cried. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} I am waiting for? Nothing {{to say to me}} indeed!--I should think so! What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to say to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are many}} against one," [...] spoke up Tarzan. [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>have</b> your will? Go your way with La to Opar and if Cadj interferes slay him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] said she. [...] "You {{came for}} the medals, {{and here they are}} at your mercy. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>have</b> them? There is no one to prevent you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>should</b> think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a {{right to}} do what you please about it. It's none of the hands' {{business}} if you don't choose to ask them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{wished to}} avoid seeing me to-day? Was it to spare yourself?" [...] she demanded, quite incoherently now. [...] "Or {{did you think}} I should not be equal to the meeting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> felt if that Ezra {{had been}} your brother?" [...] said Deronda, mischievously--a little {{provoked}} {{that she had}} taken kindly at once to people who had caused him so much prospective annoyance on her account.|$|E
6000|$|... "But how {{and where}} were you lodged, madam?" [...] said Lady Peveril; [...] "or why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> kept secret a visit which would, if made, have {{augmented}} tenfold the happiness of every true heart that rejoiced here yesterday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my dear. I {{am sorry}} to give you pain; but I don't like it. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{consulted}} me before you settled it. I have been too easy with you, and I feel as if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> taken advantage of my indulgence. Most decidedly, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> spoken to me first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that {{he should}} have hidden it," [...] said the Hereford attorney, [...] "but that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> found it, and found it without any search;--that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> traced it down to the very book in which the old man must have left it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> said I was in trade, {{and had a}} good business. That's what <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> said. That's what <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> said <b>had</b> <b>you</b> {{been worth}} your salt. But it's blunder, blunder, outside and in (upstairs, down-stairs, and in my lady's chamber). You women! Did he see Smith? ...|$|R
