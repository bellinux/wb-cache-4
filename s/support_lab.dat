50|$|In 2009, the School of Engineering {{embarked}} on a $22,300,000 expansion project to the Albert A. Thornbrough Building. Phase 1 of the project added 50,000 sq.ft. of space with a building connection to the Richards Building. This also includes an L-shaped addition to {{the southeast corner of}} Thornbrough to accommodate the School’s immediate requirement for shop space, labs and design studios for the new Mechanical Engineering program which has already commenced. Phase 1 also includes a four-storey addition connecting Thornbrough with Richards at Branion Square. This addition, supporting all three areas of growth identified above, adds computer labs, student presentation spaces, faculty offices and a unique rooftop sustainability research space complete with an associated <b>support</b> <b>lab</b> below. Phase 2 of the project renovated 52,000 sq.ft. of space in both the Richards and Thornbrough buildings. This achieved the greatest utility of existing facilities by consolidating the dry lab and faculty spaces in the Richards Building, which were to be gutted and retrofitted, while the core of the Thornbrough Building is reconfigured as a unified wet lab area. These major renovations accommodate the accumulating need for research and teaching spaces, design studios, and faculty offices as the expansion of the School of Engineering continues to unfold. In 2011, the expansion project to the Albert A. Thornbrough building is complete.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Manufacturing {{automation}} {{and control}} technologies {{are critical for}} engineering education and essential to our national economic competitiveness. However, education in these subjects is often hindered by high student-to-faculty ratios, limited access to labs, and limited/outdated equipment to <b>support</b> <b>lab</b> assignments. Information technology can not only alleviate equipment access problems, but also make a variety of innovative and effective instructional approaches and technologies available to educators. This paper describes an ongoing effort to establish the feasibility of remote monitoring, operation, and diagnosis of an existing automated assembly system, to identify the issues involved in doing so, and to extend the system {{so that it can}} be used for teletraining. This will allow us to make manufacturing automation and control education available to anyone, anytime, anywhere. This paper focuses on the retrofitting of existing automated system, and integrating technologies include LabView software, a field-point communication module, a web based simulation model, and a Webcam.

40|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} {{offers several}} advantages {{over the use}} of rotating anode sources for biological crystallography, which allow for the collection of higher-resolution data, substantially more rapid data collection, phasing by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) techniques, and time-resolved experiments using polychromatic radiation (Laue diffraction). The use of synchrotron radiation is often necessary to record useful data from crystals which diffract weakly or have very large unit cells. The high brightness and stability characteristics of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, along with the low emittance and long straight sections to accommodate insertion devices present in third generation synchrotrons like the ALS, lead to several advantages in the field of macromolecular crystallography. We are presently constructing macromolecular Crystallography Facility at the ALS which is optimized for user-friendliness and high-throughput data collection, with advanced capabilities for MAD and Laue experiments.

40|$|Abstract: In Europe, one of {{the current}} {{challenges}} is to reach {{a critical mass of}} quality ODL courses, in order to allow for dissemination of best practices in local languages. This article presents two parallel initiatives contributing to that deployment of quality ODL: a research and development project and a post graduate degree. It first proposes a definition of quality in ODL, then underlines the commonalities between those initiatives, presents their strengths and illustrates the pedagogical principles behind them as well as behind the 33 courses developed so far. It finally tackles the challenges faced in enabling the faculty teaching staff to use the web as an instructional tool and platform for learner centred instruction. 1.

In this context, in 1998, the University of Liège has launched the LabSET, <b>Support</b> <b>Lab</b> for Telematic Learning, a 25 people research and development unit.

Following Bates (2000, 66), we consider the current approach in ODL design and production as “too hitand-miss. It wastes resources, ignores the experience and many lessons that have been learned (…) and above all fails to ensure high-quality technology-based teaching in any consistent or widespread form. ” Our paper presents two initiatives aiming at producing a critical mass of quality courses that participate to the dissemination of good practices in ODL, avoiding the “Lone Ranger ” approach described by Bates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We used {{discrete}} choice conjoint {{analysis to}} model the bullying prevention program preferences of educators. Using themes from computerized decision <b>support</b> <b>lab</b> focus groups (n= 45 educators), we composed 20 three-level bullying prevention program design attrib-utes. Each of 1, 176 educators completed 25 choice tasks presenting experimentally varied combinations of the study’s attribute levels. Latent class analysis yielded three segments with different preferences. Decision Sensitive educators (31 %) preferred that individual schools select bullying prevention programs. In contrast, Support Sensi-tive educators (51 %) preferred that local school boards chose bullying prevention programs. This segment pre-ferred more logistical and social support at every stage of the adoption, training, implementation, and long term maintenance processes. Cost Sensitive educators (16 %) showed a stronger preference for programs minimizing costs, training, and implementation time demands. They felt prevention programs were less effective and that the time and space in the curriculum for bullying prevention was less adequate. They {{were less likely to}} believe that bullying prevention was their responsibility and more likely to agree that prevention was the responsibility of parents. All segments preferred programs supported by the anecdotal reports of colleagues from other schools rather than those based on scientific evidence. To ensure that the bullying prevention options available reflect the complex combina-tion of attributes influencing real world adoption decisions, program developers need to accommodate the differing views of the Decision, Support, and Cost Sensitive seg-ments while maximizing the support of parents and students...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondria are {{sub-cellular}} organelles {{that have}} {{a central role in}} energy production and in other metabolic pathways of all eukaryotic respiring cells. In the last few years, with more and more genomes being sequenced, a huge amount of data has been generated providing an unprecedented opportunity to use the comparative analysis approach in studies of evolution and functional genomics with the aim of shedding light on molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. In this context, the problem of the optimal extraction of representative datasets of genomic and proteomic data assumes a crucial importance. Specialised resources for nuclear-encoded mitochondria-related proteins already exist; however, no mitochondrial database is currently available with the same features of MitoRes, which is an update of the MitoNuc database extensively modified in its structure, data sources and graphical interface. It contains data on nuclear-encoded mitochondria-related products for any metazoan species for which this type of data is available and also provides comprehensive sequence datasets (gene, transcript and protein) as well as useful tools for their extraction and export. Description MitoRes [URL] consolidates information from publicly external sources and automatically annotates them into a relational database. Additionally, it also clusters proteins {{on the basis of their}} sequence similarity and interconnects them with genomic data. The search engine and sequence management tools allow the query/retrieval of the database content and the extraction and export of sequences (gene, transcript, protein) and related sub-sequences (intron, exon, UTR, CDS, signal peptide and gene flanking regions) ready to be used for in silico analysis. Conclusion The tool we describe here has been developed to <b>support</b> <b>lab</b> scientists and bioinformaticians alike in the characterization of molecular features and evolution of mitochondrial targeting sequences. The way it provides for the retrieval and extraction of sequences allows the user to overcome the obstacles encountered in the integrative use of different bioinformatic resources and the completeness of the sequence collection allows intra- and interspecies comparison at different biological levels (gene, transcript and protein). </p...|$|E

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have found that coal permeability is strongly inversely proportional to the net stress levels. However, most of the <b>supporting</b> <b>lab</b> data was gathered with hydrostatic/isotropic external stresses, quite unrepresentative of in situ conditions. It is well known that the in situ stress vectors are quite anisotropic, with the maximum principal stress (usually horizontal tectonic) being as much as 50 % greater than the minimum principal stress (whether horizontal or vertical). Also, most coal basins exhibit face cleat orientation parallel to the maximum principal stress. The inferred stress-shear strain relationship poses the question of how would the directional permeability of a coal seam be affected by changing directional external net stresses, when these are parallel, perpendicular or oblique to the face cleats or other directions?
