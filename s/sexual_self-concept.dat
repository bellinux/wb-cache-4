25|$|Developing a <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> is an {{important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. <b>Sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. <b>Sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more about their <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept),</b> they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> and changes and expands through time.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concepts</b> of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|R

Groups consisted of women with late onset disability, early onset disability, and no physical disability. Measures utilized {{in the study were}} the Tennessee <b>Self-Concept</b> Inventory, the <b>Sexual</b> Knowledge and Attitude Test, a nonstandardized extension of the Sexual Interaction Inventory, and questionnaires developed for this study. Results revealed that the early onset group reported fewer current sexual experiences than did the nondisabled group. The early onset group was dissatisfied with the frequency of sexual behavior to a significantly greater degree than the nondisabled group. Also, both disabled groups believed that they could enjoy sexual experiences more than they did at present in contrast with the nondisabled group. Results showed no significant group differences for <b>self-concept,</b> <b>sexual</b> knowledge or attitudes, or satisfaction with parental communication around sexual issues. Women from all three groups reported a high incidence of sexual abuse, although group differences were not statistically significant. Group differences in sexual satisfaction are discussed in terms of functional, emotional, and social implications. Recommendations are made for further research in this area, including the tracing of social development of women with late onset conditions, assessment of social skills of the two disabled groups relative to each other, and assessment of the differences in men who have established intimate relationships with disabled women and those who have not...|$|R

50|$|Sexual {{identity}} {{has been described}} as a component of an individual's identity that reflects their <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept.</b> The integration of the respective identity components (e.g. moral, religious, ethnic, occupational) into a greater overall identity is essential to the process of developing the multi-dimensional construct of identity.|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{identity}} is examined {{in terms of}} three distinct parts: <b>sexual</b> style, <b>self-concept</b> in relational and sexual domains, and concepts of relationships and partners. Sexual style, the first component of sexual identity in this study, is defined operationally to include numerous features of sexual behavior and attitudes about behavior. Self-concept in relational and sexual domains is the second component of sexual identity and includes beliefs about the self in relationships, desire for relationships, personal marriage expectations and gender role beliefs. Concepts of relationships and partners, the third component of sexual identity, includes features of dating relationships in general, beliefs about dating, experience of communication and violence in relationships, and for people in relationships, specific characteristics of the relationship. The data for this project were taken from Wave 7 (age 20 - 21) of the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions (MSALT). Part one of the study utilized hierarchical cluster analysis with split halves of females and males to group individuals into different sexual style clusters. Clusters {{were based on the}} measured variables: Usual frequency of intercourse, importance of regularly having sex, satisfaction with sex life, experience of coercion for sex, and sexual risk reduction. For females, the following five-cluster solution best represented the sample: Satisfied, Moderate, Active Unprotected, Pressured and Comfortably Inactive. For males, the following six-cluster solution best represented the sample: Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Moderate, Active Unprotected, Pressured and Comfortably Inactive. The model to predict sexual style was based on a model of sexual identity, and used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the probability of cluster membership given a certain level of each predictor variable, holding constant the other predictor variables. Using the model of sexual identity, it was possible to correctly classify between 35 [...] 47 % of the females and males into the correct sexual style...|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions (N= 744), this study {{examines}} the connection between academic self-concept, academic achievement and risky sexual behavior in college-aged females over time. The current study investigated three hypotheses: 1) academic achievement at Time 1 will be negatively related to risky sexual behavior Time 2, 2) academic self-concept at Time 1 will be negatively related to risky sexual behavior at Time 2, and 3) academic self-concept will moderate the relationship between academic achievement and risky sexual behavior. The association between academic self-concept, achievement, and risky sexual behavior was tested using a hierarchical regression, controlling for student socioeconomic status and grade level. Risky sexual behavior was measured with three scales: frequency of having unprotected sex, risky sexual behaviors and attitudes and using protection during <b>sexual</b> intercourse. Academic <b>self-concept</b> was assessed via academic ability self-concept and academic dissatisfaction. Results indicated that academic achievement and self-concept were linked to certain risky sexual outcomes.

HOLLIE Cervical cancer {{survivorship}} {{is increasing}} {{as a result}} of improved biomedical science and health care. Due to the nature of cervical cancer treatments most cures are not without consequences. Despite the progress in cancer treatments, associated side-effects persist and it is well established that sexual problems result from most of the available treatment options. Subsequently, cervical cancer treatment alters how women cope and experience their <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> after treatment. Poor coping and a non-adaptive <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> following cervical cancer treatment can result in low sexual satisfaction and low sexual esteem for women. This study, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Exploring Cervical Cancer Treatments, Coping Adaptation, and Women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Sexual</b> <b>Self-Concept</b> after Cervical Cancer 2 ̆ 2 examined associations among cancer treatment, select demographic variables, coping and sexual self-concept; identified predictor variables for <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> and explored the mediating influence of coping. Participants included women, who completed an online survey, were at least 18 years old, understood, spoke and could read English and only had one US treatment occurrence. A descriptive correlation design was used with bivariate correlation, linear and exploratory multiple regression and mediation analysis. This study helped to predict women at risk for <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> problems prior to treatment and helped to understand the impact of coping and cervical cancer treatment(s) on <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept.</b> Additionally, it added to the state of the science and practices related to cervical cancer care to prevent or diminish treatment morbidity and improve women 2 ̆ 7 s sexual health adaptation after cervical cancer treatment...|$|E

It is a cross-sectional study covering a total of 370 adolescents (182 boys and 188 girls) from six higher secondary schools in Kolkata. The data was gathered by way of a semi-structured questionnaire and three standard psychological tests. Findings revealed that 52. 4 %, 25. 1 %, and 12. 7 % adolescents suffered psychological, physical, and sexual violence in the last year. Older adolescents (aged 17 – 18 years) suffered more psychological violence than the younger ones (15 – 16 years) (p < 0. 05). Sixty nine (18. 6 %) adolescent students stood witness to violence between adult members in the family. More than three-fifth (61. 9 %) adolescents experienced at least one type of violence, while one-third (32. 7 %) experienced physical or sexual violence or both.

40|$|Childhood {{sexual abuse}} (CSA) is a {{debilitating}} crime resulting in significant consequences to a survivor’s mind, body, and spirit. Although {{there is much}} awareness of, and a plethora of research regarding the sequelae of CSA for survivors, there is nonetheless a scarcity of research focusing on how this population constructs their <b>sexual</b> self-schemas and <b>self-concepts,</b> and subsequently, how {{they see themselves as}} a sexual being in adulthood. Whereas there is some explanation of sexual self-schemas for survivors of CSA, most of this research combines survivors of extrafamilial and intrafamilial (i. e., incest) CSA into one sexually abused group, typically comparing the findings with persons who have not experienced sexual abuse. This creates difficulty in determining the experiences of different types of survivors. For these reasons, the mental health community is limited in awareness of how to best assist survivors of incest who struggle with developing healthy sexual views of self and identity. ^ To address this gap in the literature and provide practitioners with suggestions of therapeutic strategies when working with survivors of incest, the ambition of this dissertation was to identify the ways incest has influenced the trajectory of adult female survivors’ sexual self-schemas and views of one’s sexual self, using a narrative inquiry approach. The investigation included interviewing nine women who have survived childhood incest, as well as analyzed a picture each submitted that symbolized their current view of how they see themselves as a sexual being. The data was analyzed using a thematic coding approach, presented as a re-storying of each survivors’ experience, as well as in a cross-case analysis of the themes that present the unfolding process of one’s sexual self-schemas as it is threaded through the history of the participants’ abuse and sexual history experiences. The hope in conducting this study is that it may assist in developing further understanding of the survivors’ views of themselves as sexual beings, and assist with the development of theory and practice directions for clinicians, with the ultimate goal of learning how to best aid survivors with attaching a positive healthy meaning to sex and themselves. ...|$|R

40|$|Research on multidimensional sexual perfectionism differentiates four {{forms of}} sexual perfectionism: self-oriented, partner-oriented, partner-prescribed, and {{socially}} prescribed. Self-oriented sexual perfectionism reflects perfectionistic standards people apply {{to themselves as}} sexual partners; partner-oriented sexual perfectionism reflects perfectionistic standards people apply to their sexual partner; partner-prescribed sexual perfectionism reflects people’s beliefs that their sexual partner imposes perfectionistic standards on them; and socially prescribed sexual perfectionism reflects people’s beliefs that society imposes such standards on them. Previous studies found partner-prescribed and socially prescribed sexual perfectionism to be maladaptive forms of sexual perfectionism associated with a negative <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> and problematic sexual behaviors, but only examined cross-sectional relationships. The present article presents the first longitudinal study examining whether multidimensional sexual perfectionism predicts changes in <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> and sexual function over time. A total of 366 women aged 17 - 69 years completed measures of multidimensional sexual perfectionism, sexual esteem, sexual anxiety, sexual problem self-blame, and female sexual function (cross-sectional data).

40|$|Background: Self-esteem is {{the value}} that the {{individuals}} give themselves, and <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> is {{also a part of}} individuality or sexualself. Impairment or disability exists not only in the physical body of disabled people but also in their attitudes. Negative attitudes affect the mental health of disabled people, causing them to have lower self-esteem. Objectives: This study aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} self-esteem and <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> in people with physical-motor disabilities. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 random samples with physical-motor disabilities covered by Isfahan Welfare Organization in 2013. Data collection instruments were the Persian Eysenck self-esteem questionnaire, and five domains (sexual anxiety, sexual self-efficacy, sexual self-esteem, sexual fear and sexual depression) of the Persian multidimensional sexual selfconcept questionnaire. Because of incomplete filling of the questionnaires, the data of 183 people were analyzed by the SPSS 16. 0 software. Data were analyzed using the t-test, Man-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: The mean age was 36. 88 ± 8. 94 years for women and 37. 80 ± 10. 13 for men. The mean scores of self-esteem among women and men were 15. 80 ± 3. 08 and 16. 2 ± 2. 90, respectively and there was no statistically significance difference. Comparison of the mean scores of sexual anxiety, sexual self-efficacy, sexual self-esteem, sexual fear and sexual depression among men and women showed that women scored higher than men in all domains. This difference was statistically significant in other domains except the sexual self-esteem (14. 92 ± 3. 61 vs. 13. 56 ± 4. 52) (P < 0. 05). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that except for sexual anxiety and sexual self-esteem, there was a statistical difference between other domains of people’s <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> and degree of disability (P < 0. 05). Moreover, Spearman coefficient showed that there was only a correlation between men’s sexual anxiety, sexual self-esteem and sexual self-efficacy with their self-esteem. This correlation was positive in sexual anxiety and negative in two other domains. Conclusions: Lack of difference in self-esteem of disabled people in different degrees of disability and in both men and women suggests that disabled people should not be presumed to have low self-esteem, and their different aspects of life should be attended to, just like others. Furthermore, studies should be designed and implemented based on psychological, social and environmental factors that can help disabled people to promote their positive <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> through marriage, and reduce their negative self-concept. © 2015 Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal...|$|E
40|$|Satisfaction {{with sexual}} health {{education}} {{can be seen as}} student evaluation of how effectively the sexual health education curriculum meets its goals. First-year university students completed one questionnaire containing measures concerning satisfaction with high school sexual health education, sexuality-related individual difference variables, and intentions to pursue further sexual health education at the university level. Question 1 was whether students were satisfied with their high school sexual health education. Results were examined for differences by gender and type of school attended (i. e., public or Catholic). Participants rated sexual health topics as very important; believed that most sexual health education should occur between Grade 6 and 8, but that many relevant topics were not covered until Grade 9 to 12; and were generally satisfied with their sexual health education teachers and the sexual health education program in, general. With few exceptions, participant ratings did not differ by gender or type of school attended. In Question 2, comfort with sexuality, past sexual behaviour, and <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> were examined as potential correlates of satisfaction with sexual health education. Results differed by gender of participants: For males, <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> (but not comfort with sexuality or past sexual behaviour) correlated significantly and positively with satisfaction with sexual health education; for females, comfort with sexuality and past sexual behaviour (but not <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept)</b> were significantly and negatively correlated with satisfaction with sexual health education. Question 3 examined whether satisfaction with sexual health education predicted intentions to pursue further sexual health education. It was found that students who were less satisfied with sexual health education were more likely to pursue further sexual health education at the university level. Results suggest that student’s perceive the current sexual health education curriculum in Ontario as satisfactory in delivering sexual health education; however, the results also suggest several potential changes to the sexual health education curriculum: Some topics may need inclusion earlier in the curriculum, different approaches for sexual health education may be appropriate for males and females, and more emphasis may be necessary on the importance of continuing sexual health education...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{health is}} an {{important}} component to overall well-being and quality of life. Yet so much of sexual health research is focused solely on the negative consequences of sexuality, such as unintended pregnancy and transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Recently, the need for a positive, health promotion focused framework for research and understanding sexual health has received attention, including from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This transition of public health research and practice from a disease-based framework to a positive, health promotion framework necessitates exploring what factors are associated with positive sexuality and how it is experienced. This study contributed to fulfilling this need. This study focused on healthy sexuality in young college women. Specifically, this study sought to explore what young women find sexually satisfying in different types of sexual relationships (e. g., casual and committed partners). Next, this study identified variables that are important to the healthy sexuality of young college women, including <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept,</b> communication with sexual partners, sexual satisfaction, and condom use. Lastly, this study aimed to understand the statistical relationship between these variables. This was a two-phase mixed methods study. Phase one consisted of thirty face to face individual interviews with college women aged 18 - 25 years, and took place in the fall semester of 2011 and the spring semester 2012 at a large public urban university located in the southeastern United States. Phase two took place in the spring semester 2012 and consisted of an online quantitative survey measuring <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept,</b> communication with partners, sexual satisfaction and condom use. Analyses for the quantitative data included bivariate correlations and structural equation modeling. Qualitative results indicated that these young college women experienced sexual satisfaction with both committed and casual sexual partners, although they identified different reasons why each type of partnership was satisfying. Specifically, the emotional connection and comfort felt with committed relationship partners made sex satisfaction. With more casual or uncommitted partners, these women identified the benefits of maintaining their freedom and not having an obligation to another person. These young women shared their thoughts on how sex could be more satisfying for women and they indicated that communicating sexual desires and needs to partners {{as one of the most}} important factors. The quantitative portion of this study found that <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> was directly positively associated with communication with sexual partners (B= 1. 45, 95...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the gender differences}} in <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept,</b> personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, and risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with and without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 {{in the first phase}} of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 and 23 years of age (M = 19. 26, SD = 1. 83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64. 6 %) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors and attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p =. 05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p =. 04), and less social support than nonabused participants (p =. 01) and almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p =. 08). However, {{no significant differences were found}} between abused and nonabused participants on <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept,</b> self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/ breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources and engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling and be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This paper studies {{determinants}} {{of participation in}} a peer-led school-based HIV prevention intervention in Rwanda. Methods: A baseline survey among 1071 students (mean age 17 years) assessed potential {{determinants of}} participation, while a follow-up six months in the intervention measured actual participation in the intervention. Statistical models were built using multivariate linear and multinomial regression analysis predicting overall participation, participation in group discussions and individual counseling. Results: Those who recently had sex, had been tested for HIV, feel more susceptible to HIV, have a higher <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept,</b> a more positive future perspective (only for non-sexually active), and boys, {{were more likely to}} participate in group activities. Also students from the same class as the peer educator and boarding school students were more likely to participate in group activities. Older students and those with low external health locus of control participated more in individual counseling. Discussion: Participation could be increased by investing in general well-being of young people, organizing girls-only activities, and diversifying activities...|$|E
40|$|Three {{contexts}} {{that make}} up girls ' sexual health are explored: (1) Individual aspects are investigated using the <b>Sexual</b> <b>Self-Concept</b> Scale; (2) Relational aspects are evaluated using two sets of items created for this study; (3) The sociocultural context of sexual health is described. Working within an ecological model, this research is anchored in a feminist social constructionist analysis. Sexual health {{is defined as the}} ability to know and accept one's own feelings and to make responsible and safe choices. In discussing sexual health and risk of unintended pregnancy, the focus is on attitudinal rather than behavioral factors of risk and health because {{only a small portion of}} this sample had engaged in sexual intercourse at the time of the survey. However, the level of sexual activity is described for the sample, and the relationship of those activities to femininity ideology (controlling for access to information and support around sexuality in their sociocultural context) is examined.

40|$|One {{theoretical}} {{concept that}} has received modest attention in contemporary sexuality research is the sexual self, particularly focusing on <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> (SSC). While research on the sexual self has expanded over the past 20 years, {{there is a lack}} of cohesion within this research that has culminated in a collection of SSC models that, while sharing certain factors, are dissimilar from each other. Therefore a unified conceptual model of SSC needs to be empirically established. Additionally, little research has examined potential differences between genders in how SSC is expressed, as most SSC research focuses exclusively on women. Finally, understanding of human sexuality can be expanded by examining SSC models in a broader sexual context via its relationship with other aspects of sexuality, such as sexual behavior, intentions, and socialization. Using Buzwell and Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 s 1996 sexual selves model as a theoretical basis, a six-factor higher-order latent SSC model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis. Lower-order factors for this model included sexual self-esteem, sexual self-efficacy, arousal, anxiety, exploration, and commitment. A five-factor latent model, after removing commitment and one sexual self-efficacy factors, was the best-fitting model, such that a higher-order SSC latent factor accounted for the correlations between these lower-order factors. This model was then tested for measurement and structural invariance between genders. Results indicated that SSC was similar on a measurement level for both men and women. Finally, a structural equation model was estimated examining the relationship between the five-factor SSC model and previous sexual behavior, intended sexual behavior, and sexual socialization. When the three sexual dimensions were examined separately, all three sexual dimensions related to the latent SSC factor for both men and women. However, when all three sexual dimensions were entered together in the model, only intended sexual behavior was significantly related to a more positive SSC for both genders. Previous sexual behavior was only significantly related to SSC in women, and sexual socialization had no relationship for either gender. These findings have important implications for both <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> research, as well as contributing to better understanding human sexuality. ...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Little {{existing}} research has examined women’s solo masturbation and vibrator usage {{in a way}} that highlights the importance of both sexual agency and the sexual/romantic relationship context. This research evaluates if and how social factors, partnership status and the relationship context, and <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> impact a woman’s behaviors and attitudes toward masturbation and vibrator use. Using cross-sectional survey data from adult women (N= 112), descriptive and bivariate analyses were used to explore a variety of factors. Single and partnered women did not differ significantly on a majority of measures, suggesting that partnership status may play an insignificant role in predicting women’s solo sex attitudes and behaviors. Regarding the relationship context, partner communication and positivity toward masturbation and vibrator use significantly varied together. Finally, greater sexual openness and sexual entitlement were associated with higher masturbation frequency. Results from this study suggest that masturbation and vibrator use are common among adult women, and women are capable of sexual agency in relation to masturbation and vibrator use, whether they are in established partnerships or not...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{have focused}} on {{understanding}} factors such as resiliency, medical concerns, and coping skills {{in the lives of}} transgender and gender-nonconforming people. However, little research has examined how transgender and gender-nonconforming people cognitively evaluate their own lives. Furthermore, many people who identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming also report a sexual minority identity status. In this study, we sought to understand how aspects of <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> (i. e., sexual esteem and sexual anxiety), internalized homonegativity, and level of outness about sexual identity correlated to self-appraisals of satisfaction with life (SWL) in a sample of transgender and gender-nonconforming people who identified as sexual minorities. Participants were recruited at a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender Pride festival and completed a paper-pencil survey. Results indicated that there was a positive relationship between SWL and sexual esteem and a negative relationship between SWL and sexual anxiety. The relationship between SWL and internalized homonegativity approached significance while level of outness {{did not appear to be}} related to SWL. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed...|$|E
40|$|As {{breast cancer}} {{survival}} rates increase, {{quality of life}} issues should be addressed, specifically regarding sexual health. Breast cancer treatment can lead to sexual dysfunction, alterations in <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept,</b> body image, self-esteem, and relationship issues which can cause a depressed quality of life. These sexual health issues can also uniquely affect the intimate partner. It appears that a strong relationship and supportive intimate partner can protect against the stressors due to these sexual problems. Addressing sexual concerns, whether physical, psychological, or relational are a clear necessity in managing the care of patients with breast cancer, regardless of partner status, age, or disease stage. Clinicians and medical professionals should address these issues in patient care plans, examinations, and patient education, focusing {{not only on the}} patient but also on the couple as a unit. However, there are barriers to communication in regards to sexuality on both the part of the physician and the patient that cause a discrepancy between available resources and patients actually receiving them. Developing effective treatment plans and interventions are essential in improving {{the quality of life in}} women suffering from physical, psychological, and relational sexual issues due to the management of breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the correlations between self-image, self-esteem and some unwholesome behavior (alcohol consumption, cigarette and marihuana smoking, overeating at a meal, television watching and computer use in spare time) in Slovenian adolescents. We used Offer Self-image Questionnaire for adolescents, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and Unwholesome behaviour Questionnaire that was made for the purpose of this research. In the research 392 high school students participated, aged around 15 and 18 years, approximately evenly represented by gender and age. Data was attained in class groups. The results showed low, but statistically significant correlations between some self-concept areas and unwholesome behavior. The highest correlations emerged between the sexual attitudes and all unwholesome behavior. Students with more positive <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> behave unhealthier. Family self, morals and vocational-educational goals were significantly negatively correlated with most of unwholesome behavior, which suggests that individuals with better family, moral and academic self-concept behave healthier. Significant negative correlations emerged also with coping self: individuals with better self-concept in mastery of the external world and superior adjustment behaved healthier. None of the unwholesome behavior correlated with self-esteem. Results are mainly consistent with previous studies, but also contribute to new comprehensions in psychological theory and practice...|$|E
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{development}} of an understanding of one's self as a sexual person is an important developmental task for adolescents and young adults. Yet {{little is known about}} how an individual's <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> (SSC) develops, or how the personal sexual experiences impact the {{development of}} SSC and the more global aspects of one's self-worth. Two studies were therefore conducted to examine these issues. The first examined the normative development of SSC from adolescence into young adulthood, and how sexual experiences (such as sexual debut, the number of sexual partners, or involvement in risky and aggressive sexual behaviors) shape the course of development. Three wave data from a longitudinal study conducted over a 11 -year period was used for this purpose. Results indicated that most aspects of SSC (e. g., sexual self-esteem, sexual anxiety and sexual openness) became more positive during adolescence and emerging adulthood and then leveled off after age 25 years. In addition, a reciprocal relation was found between sexual experience and SSC over time: positive SSC predicted more sexual experience; accumulating sexual experiences (e. g., increases in sexual frequency and number of sexual partners), in turn, positively predicted subsequent SSC. The increases in risky sexual practices had negative impact on sexual self-esteem but positive impact on other dimensions of SSC. Study 2 replicated these patterns in a 3 -month longitudinal study among college students and also examined the influence of personal sexual experience on global self-esteem. Results indicated that personal sexual experiences, especially sexual satisfaction, significantly influenced global self-esteem among individuals who staked their global self-worth on the sexual domain. Together, these results highlight the important role individuals' personal sexual experiences may play {{in the development of a}} health SSC and global self-worth...|$|E
40|$|Background: People {{with visual}} {{disability}} have lower self-esteem {{and social skills}} than sighted people. This {{study was designed to}} describe self-esteem and general and sexual self-concepts in blind people. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted in the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2013 - 2014. In this study, 138 visually impaired people participated from Isfahan Province Welfare Organization and were interviewed for measuring of self-esteem and self-concept using Eysenck self-esteem and Rogers’ self-concept questionnaires. The correlation between above two variables was measured using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software by Pearson correlation test. Results: Mean [± standard deviation (SD) ] age of patients was 30. 9 ± 8 years. The mean (±SD) of general self-concept score was 11 ± 5. 83. The mean (±SD) of self-esteem score was 16. 62 ± 2. 85. Pearson correlation results showed a significant positive correlation between self-esteem and general self-concept (r = 0. 19, P = 0. 025). The mean of <b>sexual</b> <b>self-concept</b> scores in five subscales (sexual anxiety, sexual self-efficacy, sexual self-esteem, sexual fear, and sexual depression) were correspondingly 11 ± 4. 41, 19. 53 ± 4. 53, 12. 96 ± 4. 19, 13. 48 ± 1. 76, and 5. 38 ± 2. 36. Self-esteem and self-concept had significant positive correlation with sexual anxiety (r = 0. 49; P < 0. 001) (r =-. 23; P < 0. 001) and sexual fear (r = 0. 25; P = 0. 003) (r = 0. 18; P = 0. 02) and negative correlation with sexual self-efficacy (r =- 0. 26; P = 0. 002) (r =- 0. 28; P = 0. 001) and sexual-esteem (r =- 0. 34; P < 0. 001) (r =- 0. 34; P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Self-esteem and self-concept had significant correlation with sexual anxiety and sexual fear; and negative correlation with sexual self-efficacy and sexual-esteem. © 2015 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences...|$|E
