5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E

25|$|In 1986, Tyrone {{reached their}} very first All-Ireland Final. However, {{they were the}} rank outsiders to beat Kerry, who were going for their third title in a row (and eighth in twelve years). At one stage in the second half, Tyrone had amassed a seven-point lead (a penalty that could have put them nine points ahead was struck over the bar by Kevin McCabe), but two of their leading players on the day, Eugene McKenna, and John Lynch had to be {{replaced}} due to injury, {{and the experience of}} Kerry <b>shone</b> <b>through,</b> going on to win by 2–15 to 1–10 (21 points to 13).|$|E
25|$|Neutral Beam Injection An {{external}} source of hydrogen is ionized and accelerated by an electric field {{to form a}} charged beam which is <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> a source of neutral hydrogen gas towards the plasma which itself is ionized and contained in the reactor by a magnetic field. Some of the intermediate hydrogen gas is accelerated towards the plasma by collisions with the charged beam while remaining neutral: this neutral beam is thus unaffected by the magnetic field and so shines through it into the plasma. Once inside the plasma the neutral beam transmits energy to the plasma by collisions {{as a result of}} which it becomes ionized and thus contained by the magnetic field thereby both heating and refuelling the reactor in one operation. The remainder of the charged beam is diverted by magnetic fields onto cooled beam dumps.|$|E

25|$|The last {{match of}} the day came between two former US Open finalists Vera Zvonareva and Caroline Wozniacki, who has split their former 8 matches in half. Zvonareva, the No.6 seed, was the clear aggressor in the match, going for her big groundstrokes – {{including}} some particularly impressive backhands – {{to take the first}} set in just 35 minutes. Wozniacki broke in the last game of the second set to push the match to a third but Zvonareva came alive again, racing out to a double-break 4–1 lead and barely looking back. The Russian, who just turned 27 last month, won the last seven points of the match to end it 6–2, 4–6, 6–3. Although both Zvonareva and Wozniacki are known for their strong defensive skills, the Russian's offense really <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> at the Sinan Erdem Dome – she had by far the bigger numbers for the day, 49 winners to 49 unforced errors (Wozniacki finished the match with 13 winners to 18 unforced errors).|$|E
25|$|His career skyrocketed when Kido {{magazine}} {{named him}} the Number One Young Player. His power and composure <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> his strong endgame. He barely lost {{out in the}} final of the 22nd Nihon Ki-In Championship to Eio Sakata after making a critical mistake that led to his resignation. This loss fueled him to take the 12th Asahi Pro Best Ten undefeated, which made him look incredibly powerful, as all the opponents were 9-dan. The victory made him the youngest title holder ever in Japan. He lost {{in the second round of}} the 30th Honinbo preliminary to Toshihiro Shimamura 9-dan. Even though he had a second chance to take the match against Masao Kato—due to a triple ko—he still lost. He was on a roll in the 1st Tengen league, until he was defeated by Shuzo Ohira. He didn't get far in the rest of the tournaments that year. His spirits were high after he was promoted to 7 dan in late October, only to be crushed a month later when his teacher, Kitani, died. His record was a formidable 39 wins and 16 losses for the year.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} later William Wordsworth with his brother John and their friend Mr Simpson made a trip up Helvellyn, setting out after breakfast and {{returning}} home at ten that evening. A year later, in October 1801, William and his sister Dorothy rode to Legburthwaite (to the inn at Thirlspot) {{and then to the}} top of Helvellyn before returning the same way. Dorothy recorded that it had been a glorious day. They had mists both above and below them, but the sun <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> and their views extended from the Scottish mountains to the sea at Cartmel. Wordsworth’s poem, Inmate of a mountain dwelling (1816), celebrating the captivating power of the old mountain, was dedicated [...] "To … on her first ascent to the summit of Helvellyn." ...|$|E
500|$|Fear and Desire was a {{commercial}} failure, but garnered several positive reviews upon release. Critics {{such as the}} reviewer from The New York Times believed that Kubrick's professionalism as a photographer <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> in the picture, and that he [...] "artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men, {{as well as their}} bestiality, and in one scene, the wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding". Columbia University scholar Mark Van Doren was highly impressed by the scenes with the girl bound to the tree, remarking that it would live on as a [...] "beautiful, terrifying and weird" [...] sequence which illustrated Kubrick's immense talent and guaranteed his future success. [...] Kubrick himself later expressed embarrassment with Fear and Desire, however, and attempted over the years to keep prints of the film out of circulation.|$|E

Clapp said [...] "Thelma Barlow played , with exceptional delicacy, {{in a variety}} of pastel pinnies, for 26years." [...] She concluded that she had a [...] "tumultuous relationship with her soulmate, Derek". When Barlow quit the role as Mavis in 1997, various Coronation Street stars praised her contribution: Sherrie Hewson (who played Maureen Holdsworth) said [...] "Thelma's a wonderful lady and a superb actress. We'll miss her"; Michael Le Vell (Kevin Webster) said [...] "Thelma's quality as an actress <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> for everyone to see after the death of Derek"; Peter Baldwin (Derek) said [...] "It has made a difference to the programme and the departure of Derek and now Mavis is going to upset a lot of viewers".|$|E

500|$|Cut {{into the}} western wall of the debating chamber are {{laminated}} glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber.

Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by [...] "glass fins" [...] which run down from light spaces in the ceiling. Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles' inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [...] is [...] "an arts and crafts building, designed with high-tech flair.

500|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} story, with one {{reviewer}} saying the characters had a tasteful charm. Karen Chu of 1UP.com said the story <b>shone</b> <b>through,</b> keeping players from burning {{out after the}} battle segments. IGN's Craig Harris called the storytelling [...] "absolutely top-notch, if just a little wordy for comfort", praising the writing for making him care about his characters. David Chapman of GameSpy noted the storyline being rich. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin said that The Sacred Stones had [...] "a well-written, surprisingly sophisticated narrative featuring plenty of endearing heroes and villains". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell called the storytelling [...] "wonderful", positively noting the more exotic narrative when compared to its predecessor. Simon Parkin, writing for NGC Magazine, praised the game's [...] "delightful, uncurling narrative", and positively noted the translation quality as it helped him understand {{the workings of the}} game's world and characters. PALGN reviewer Mark Marrow said the story was a step above its predecessor, calling it [...] "a beautiful narrative featuring plenty of action from villains and heroes, and even some comic relief in-between all of this". Matthew Foster of RPGamer, while noting the quality of the translation, said that the story was the game's weakest point due to its cliched nature. RPGFan's Alan Knight called the plot [...] "light and fairly easy-going", noting its eccentric characters eased players along.|$|E
500|$|The encore was {{identical}} each night {{and consisted of}} [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", [...] "With or Without You", and [...] "Moment of Surrender". [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] featured an elaborate staging wherein Bono wore a suit with embedded with lasers that <b>shone</b> <b>through</b> the violet lighting scheme, while singing to, around, and hanging from, an illuminated steering wheel-shaped microphone dropped from above. Following the band's exit from the stage, Elton John's [...] "Rocket Man" [...] was played. Beginning on the second leg of the tour [...] "One" [...] opened the first encore and was followed by [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", with [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] often used to bridge between them. The second encore remained unchanged until the third leg, when [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" [...] was debuted; U2 rotated it with [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] to open the encore. At the 2 July 2011 show in Nashville, Bono invited a visually impaired fan on-stage to play [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] on guitar for his wife after the normal set closer [...] "Moment of Surrender." [...] After the song, Bono gave the fan his Gretsch Irish Falcon guitar. At the next show on 5 July 2011 in Chicago, the band performed [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] to end the show in honour of New Zealander Greg Carroll, {{an employee of the}} band whose 25th death anniversary was two days prior. The band's first single, [...] "Out of Control", [...] "Bad" [...] and [...] "40" [...] each closed a single show, each of them played after usual closer [...] "Moment of Surrender".|$|E

500|$|The stadium legs of {{the tour}} {{received}} more consistent praise than the arena shows. Critics noted that while the show and its setlist were largely the same as before, the tour mostly benefited from the increased scale. The New York Daily News said that the stage [...] "looked like a city made of television sets—an electronic Oz" [...] and that [...] "glitz was used not as a mere distraction (as it has been by so many video-age artists), but as a determined conceit". [...] Gundersen also made the comparison to Oz, saying {{that even though the}} band was dwarfed by the setting, their adventurous musicianship still <b>shone</b> <b>through.</b> She concluded that the group had [...] "deliver a brilliant high-wire act" [...] between mocking and exploiting rock music clichés, a comparison also made by stage designer Willie Williams. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said of the outdoor American leg, [...] "Zoo TV is the yardstick by which all other stadium shows will be measured." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone said that the band had [...] "regained critical and commercial favor by negotiating an inspired balance between rock's cheap thrills and its own sense of moral burden". He praised the band for [...] "retool themselves as wiseacres with heart and elephant bucks to burn". Fricke noted that the increased visual effects for the [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg increased the shows' [...] "mind-fuck" [...] factor. Many critics described the tour as [...] "post-modern". The writers of Rolling Stone, in a best-of-1992 issue, named U2 co-winners of [...] "Best Band", while awarding the Zoo TV Tour honours for both [...] "Best Tour" [...] and [...] "Worst Tour".|$|E
