5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among those words are sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> religious law.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on {{a deserted}} island and learns {{that the world}} has been devastated by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler. Much of the human {{population}} has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, punctuating humanity's despair. Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find. Celes is only required by the game's story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, in a series of mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. Together, this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka's Tower. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> magical power.|$|E

5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including this color final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer some rest and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of Rublev's art.|$|E

After {{managing}} to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron. With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl {{to clean up the mess}} they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to where they came from.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are {{the sources of the}} major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E

5|$|Samus {{encounters}} heavy {{resistance from}} the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus. Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault {{with the assistance of}} the Galactic Federation navy. As they gain control of a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet create a wormhole and warp to Phaaze—the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Phazon in the galaxy. Samus travels to its core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Eventually, Samus appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished. Samus then takes off for Elysia, where she reflects on her deceased fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.|$|E
5|$|Scott (known then as Norman Josiffe) {{had first}} met Thorpe early in 1961 when the former was a 20-year-old groom working {{for one of}} Thorpe's wealthy friends. The initial meeting was brief, but nearly a year later Scott, by then in London and destitute, called at the House of Commons to ask the MP for help. Thorpe later {{acknowledged}} that a friendship had developed, but denied any physical relationship; Scott, on the other hand, claimed {{that he had been}} seduced by Thorpe on the night following the Commons meeting. Over the following years Thorpe made numerous attempts to help Scott to find accommodation and work, but instead of repaying these favours with gratitude, Scott became increasingly resentful to Thorpe, believing that he was the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> his ills and threatening him with exposure.|$|E
5|$|Isis was {{originally}} a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, {{which did not}} include Greek-style mysteries. Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests, out of public view, but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in. Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology, such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris, {{the god of the}} afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis, that were performed at Abydos. The Greeks interpreted these myth-based rituals as mysteries. The historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BCE, was the first to do so. He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries, likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus he was familiar with in Greece. He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt. Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> mystical wisdom. They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt, including the mystery cults. Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both say there is a grain of truth in these claims, as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, {{at the same time that}} Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture. The imagery of the afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs.|$|E

40|$|Gradient {{crystalline}} structure in surface layer of TC 11 titanium alloy was obtained through ultrasonic impacting and rolling process. Microstructure, work hardening state, residual stress distribution, and surface roughness in modified layer were measured and analyzed {{to get a}} comprehensive knowledge of surface characteristics. The effect of gradient crystalline surface layer on fatigue behavior was then investigated. High-cycle fatigue test results show that a considerable improvement of almost 19. 3 % with respect to untreated fatigue samples under the cycles of 5  ×  106 was obtained. Obvious difference in fatigue crack source region can be found between original samples and treated series. Crack <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the original ones were found in surface or near-surface areas, while crack <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the treated ones distinctly located at near central positions.
