40|$|AbstractAcne {{scarring}} is a {{very common}} and a distressing condition presenting to a dermatologist. The treatment of acne scars is a real therapeutic challenge. No single therapy is effective and it often requires multiple modalities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the efficacy of plain catgut in the tissue augmentation of acne scars. Acne scars of rolling, depressed and atrophic variants over cheeks were taken for study. Plain <b>surgical</b> <b>catgut</b> 3 – 0, cut into small pieces measuring 1 / 2 – 1 cm was used for tissue augmentation. A total of 15 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of 15 patients, 8 patients showed more than 75 % improvement, 4 patients showed 50 % improvement and 3 patients were lost to follow up...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} catgut implantation at acupoints on leptin resistance (LR) and insulin resistance (IR) in the simple obesity rat. MethodsRats were made obese with high-fat diets, after which <b>surgical</b> <b>catgut</b> was implanted at Zusanli (ST 36) and Neiting (ST 44) acupoints {{once a week for}} 4 weeks (implantation group). Rats from the implantation group were compared with normal rats and unoperated obese rats (control group). Gene expression of the leptin receptor (OB-R) was evaluated using RT-PCR and northern blot. Serum and hypothalamus leptin and insulin (INS) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Body weight, Lee's index, body fat, serum and hypothalamus leptin and INS levels, and hypothalamic OB-R gene expression were determined before and after treatment. ResultsBody weights, Lee's index, body fat, and serum leptin and INS levels were significantly higher in obese than in normal rats. Hypothalamic leptin and INS levels and OB-R gene expression were significantly lower in obese rats. Catgut implantation at acupoint promoted weight loss and decreased serum leptin and INS levels. Hypothalamic leptin and INS levels and OB-R gene expression increased significantly. ConclusionsCatgut implantation at acupoint adjusts central and peripheral leptin and promotes hypothalamic OB-R gene expression. This may be an important method for regulation of LR, IR and abnormal endocrinology and metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Development in {{material}} engineering provide {{many kinds of}} suture materials to medical fields. The choice of utilization depends on the surgeons decision, the durability, absorbtion times, tensile strength of the suture, and operation site in means of organ and tissue. In this study we aimed to investigate 7 different suture materials in vivo and in vitro conditions to evaluate the properties and durability. Basal tensile strength (TS) values of all sutures were measured and 168 Wistar albino rats were utilised in vivo groups. The sutures {{were placed in the}} bladder, stomach, intestine and bile duct (after obstructive jaundice). Urine and bile of rat, pH 1 and pH 10 were used as in vitro conditions. Seven different suture materials (Maxon, Vicryl, Plain <b>Catgut,</b> <b>Surgical</b> Silk, Polypropylene, Caprosyn and Biosyn) were investigated in 9 different in vitro and in vivo conditions. All sutures were chosen to be in size 5 / 0. In the following 5 th day the sutures were tested related to durability and stability. Results were compared stastically using the Mann-Whitney U test and p[*]<[*] 0. 05 was considered as stastically significant. Among all the suture materials only polypropylene proved to preserve its stability in vivo and in vitro surveys. Cat-gut and caprosyn lost its TS in all medias. Silk and biosyn lost its TS in all conditions except the stomach and intestines. Maxon also lost its TS in all condition except urine. Utilisation of caprosyn and biosyn in urinary procedures reduces stone formation and infections. The suture of choice in biliary tract should be vicryl, maxon or biosyn since polypropylene preserves its stability that could result in stone formation. In intestinal operations polypropylene, vicryl, and silk could be preferred...|$|R

The choice of the <b>surgical</b> <b>catgut,</b> i. e. the type and diameter, depends on the locality, characteristics and condition of the tissue to be treated. From the standpoint of oral-surgical practice the following clinical parameters are of outstanding importance with respect to the selection of suture material: accumulation of soft deposits on the sutures, score of the adjacent soft tissues and dehiscence of the operative wound. Our prospective clinical study included 150 patients distributed into three groups of 50 subjects. The surgical procedure performed on each patient involved resection (apicotomy) of the tooth root end in the intercanine sector of the upper jaw. The following suture materials were applied: Black Silc 5 - 0, Nylon 5 - 0 and Vicryl 5 - 0. The effects of the selected sutures were evaluated according to the wound dehiscence. The effects of the applied sutures were recorded on Days 2, 5 and 7 after the surgery. The comparison of cited parameters of the investigated materials after suturing the oral mucosa revealed that none of the used material was ideal; however, a certain advantage might be given to the synthetic monofilament suture materials...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Historical data on closing and suturing of {{surgical}} wounds describe {{a wide range}} of various suture materials. The choice of the <b>surgical</b> <b>catgut,</b> i. e. type and diameter, depends on the localization, characteristics and condition of the tissue to be treated. From the stand-point of oral-surgical practice the following clinical parameters are of the outstanding importance regarding the choice of suture material: accumulation of soft deposits on the sutures, decubitus of the adjacent soft tissues and dehiscence of the operative wound. Aim. The aim of this research was to determine the correlation between different types of suture materials and accumulation of soft deposits on the sutures, decubitus of the adjacent soft tissues and dehiscence of the operative wound. Material and methods. Our prospective clinical study included 150 patients distributed into three groups of 50 subjects. The surgical procedure performed on each patient involved resection (apicoectomy) of the tooth root end in the intercanine sector of the upper jaw. The following suture materials were applied: BLACK SILK 5 - 0, NYLON 5 - 0 and VICRYL 5 - 0. The effects of the selected sutures were evaluated by using several parameters: accumulation of soft deposits, wound dehiscence and decubitus of the adjacent soft tissues. The effects of the applied sutures were recorded on days 2, 5 and 7 after the surgery. Conclusion. The comparison of cited parameters of the investigated materials after suture of oral cavity mucosa revealed that none of the used material was ideal; however, a certain preference might be given to the synthetic monofilament suture materials...|$|E
