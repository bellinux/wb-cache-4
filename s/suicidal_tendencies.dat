5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendencies</b> and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E

40|$|Suicide, an {{intended}} self-destructive behavior, has various etiological {{risk factors}} related to social, biochemical, psychological, and even political components. Due to the need of psychological investigations for the multidisciplinary assessment of suicide, the current study was designed to investigate the relationship between attachment and suicide tendency with the mediator, self-discrepancy. A path analysis was utilized in this study to evaluate for the relationship among variables in the model. For the study, the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Short Form (ECR-S), the Integrated Self-Discrepancy Index (ISDI), and the Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation Inventory (PANSI) were employed as assessment instruments. The sample consisted of Korean and Korean-American adults. Data analysis revealed that the suicidal participants among the sample had higher mean scores in all scales than the non-suicidal participants. This finding indicates that the suicidal participants were more insecurely attached and self-discrepant than the non-suicidal participants. The multiple regression analyses revealed that self-discrepancy slightly mediated in the relationship between insecure attachment and <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency.</b> More specifically, actual/ideal self-discrepancy mediated more in the relationship between the insecure anxiety dimension and <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency</b> than actual/ought self-discrepancy; actual/ought self-discrepancy mediated more in the relationship between the insecure avoidance dimension and <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency</b> than actual/ideal self-discrepancy. However, the size of the mediating effect was small...|$|R
5|$|Grandaddy {{was formed}} in 1992 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia and drummer Aaron Burtch. The group was {{initially}} influenced by US punk bands such as <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Tendencies</b> and Bad Brains. Lytle was a former professional skateboarder, who had turned to music after a knee injury forced him to stop skating, working at a sewage treatment works to fund the purchase of equipment, {{and several of the}} band's early live performances were at skateboarding competitions.|$|E
5|$|Skate punk innovators {{also pointed}} in other {{directions:}} Big Boys helped establish funkcore, while Venice, California's <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Tendencies</b> had a formative {{effect on the}} heavy metal–influenced crossover thrash style. Toward {{the middle of the}} decade, D.R.I. spawned the superfast thrashcore genre. Both developed in multiple locations. Sacramento's Tales of Terror, which mixed psychedelic rock into their hardcore sound, were an early influence on the grunge genre. D.C.'s Void {{was one of the first}} punk-metal crossover acts and influenced thrash metal.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{influences}} include HEM, Beastie Boys, Black Sabbath, Bob Marley, Led Zeppelin, Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg, Cypress Hill, Notorious B.I.G. and Rage Against the Machine. Hed PE's second album, Broke, incorporated classic {{rock and}} world music influences, while Back 2 Base X {{was influenced by}} classic punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash, Insomnia was influenced by thrash metal bands such as Slayer, and New World Orphans was influenced by <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Tendencies</b> and Minor Threat.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} {{the relationship between}} psychological distress and <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency</b> of depressed patients. A descriptive correlational design was utilized in this study. A sample of convenience of 100 depressed patients was recruited from the Out-patient Clinic of Tahnasha Psychiatric Hospital in El Minia Governorate. A socio-demographic data sheet, <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Tendency</b> Scale, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) were used to achieve {{the purpose of the}} study. A semi-structured interview method was used to collect data from patients. Results of this study revealed that, almost two third of the subjects were females, married, illiterate, unemployed, residing rural areas, and most of them were in the age group ranged from 20 - 39 years old. More than one third of the subjects were attempting suicide from one to three times or more. A statistically significant correlation was detected between <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency</b> and psychological distress. In conclusion, depressed patients are having multiple stressors, social, environmental, and interpersonal factors that with their personality character can aggravate the symptom of depression and interfere with their productivity, initiation, and prevent the interaction with others. It was recommended that, a training program should be designed for nurses who are dealing with depressed patients and specially those who are at risk for suicide to provide them with knowledge about how to assess those patients, evaluate their needs, and prevent the risk of suicide...|$|R

40|$|Objective Strong {{consensus}} in research literature exists that suicide risk is higher among {{gay and lesbian}} people. Internalization of societal sexual stigma may contribute to increasing the risk for suicidal ideation for sexual minorities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify demographic, social and psychological associated risk factors for suicidal ideation in gay and lesbian young adults and to understand the role of internal sexual stigma on the mental health of sexual minorities. Methods We conducted a sectional study in Italy (N= 260) using snowball sampling in order to recruit gay and lesbian young adults. We used the Multi-Attitude <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Tendency</b> scale (MAST) to assess the <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency</b> and the Measure of Internalized Sexual Stigma Scale for Lesbian and Gay men (MISS-LG) to measure three dimensions of internalized homonegativity: identity, social discomfort, and sexuality. The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) and Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) were used to evaluate the quality of the relationship with parents and peer. Disclosure of Sexual Orientation scale (DSO) provided the level of self-disclosure of sexual orientation with peer and family. Results Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified Sexuality (beta=. 24; p<. 001) and Social Discomfort (beta=. 13; p<. 05) dimensions as the main risk factors for repulsion by life related to the Internalized Sexual Stigma. Good levels of peer (beta= -. 19; p<. 001) and parental attachment (beta=. 02; p<. 001) are protective factors against <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency.</b> The model explains the 38 % of the variance. Conclusion We assume that higher prevalence of suicidal ideation among gay and lesbian young adults should be understood in a stigmatizing and discriminating context of belonging that may lead sexual minorities to internalize a pessimistic consideration of intimate homosexual relationships# quality and duration and a negative conception of gay or lesbian sexual behaviors...|$|R
5|$|Slayer {{returned}} as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, <b>Suicidal</b> <b>Tendencies,</b> and Testament.

40|$|Background: There {{are many}} {{stressors}} that affect student's mental health. Many evidences indicate that individuals of different blood group have different response to same stressor, {{suggesting that the}} genetics of blood type also appear to alter susceptibility to develop neuropsychiatric disease. This study aimed to find out association of blood group with depression so early detection of depression and stress by blood types helps to reduce the overall burden of illness of young students thus improve their academic performance and social life. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 226 medical students. They are interrogated as per MMS scale to assess the psycho-wellbeing of students. ABO and Rh blood groups were determined by Anti sera A, Anti sera B and Anti sera D. Data were analysed with Primer version 6 and Chi-square. Results: In the present study {{it was observed that}} majority of students belong to blood group B (39. 38 %), followed by blood group O (27. 88 %), A (27. 66 %) and AB (7. 08 %) respectively. Blood type A was more in red zone and more prone to PTSD (post traumatic syndrome disorders). Whereas blood type B was more prone to <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency.</b> Proportion of psychomorbidity was found more in Rh+ than Rh (28. 16 % verse 15 %). But these variations were statistically insignificant. Conclusions: Blood type A and Rh+ were more prone to psycho morbidity and and lsquo;B' for <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency,</b> while O had least <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendency</b> but this variation was not found significant. So it can be concluded that there is no association between blood type and psycho wellness of individual. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (8. 000) : 3468 - 3472...|$|R

5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of <b>suicidal</b> <b>tendencies,</b> she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E
