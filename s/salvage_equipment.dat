25|$|The {{remaining}} towing and <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment</b> was retained {{for some}} time after the conversion so that, if necessary, Herakles could perform normal tug duties while not employed as a pusher. However, it appears that they were later removed completely as the towing gear was no longer listed for Herakles on Alfons Håkans's website unlike {{with the rest of}} the tug fleet, making her purely a pusher vessel.|$|E

50|$|Anchoring at Ulithi Atoll on 7 February 1945, Yakutat tended {{seaplanes}} {{there for}} most of February 1945. Highlighting her brief stay there was her going to the vicinity of a crashed Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplane on 10 February 1945. After <b>salvaging</b> <b>equipment</b> from the plane, Yakutat sank the plane with gunfire {{and returned to her}} anchorage in the seaplane operating area.|$|R
25|$|On 10 August the {{engineers}} {{working on the}} Cherbourg quays saw {{a new kind of}} ship steaming into the harbor. She was the Junior N. Van Noy, the first engineer port repair ship sent overseas. A converted Great Lakes steamer displacing only 3,000 tons, the ship had machine shops, storage bins, and heavy <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment</b> aboard. Her decks bristled with derricks and booms for lifting sunken ships and other debris. Manning the ship was the sixty-member 1071st Engineer Port Repair Ship Crew.|$|E
500|$|In April 1880, {{an attempt}} to recover the {{locomotive}} failed when the chains broke. Two days later, a second attempt also failed because the <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment</b> broke after the locomotive {{had been brought to}} the surface. One week later, it was recovered, and stood {{on the bank of the}} Tay until it was sent to Cowlairs on its own wheels for repairs, after which it was returned to traffic. It gained the nickname [...] "The Diver" [...] as a result of its accident and difficult recovery.|$|E
500|$|The navy {{decided to}} convert Asahi into a {{submarine}} salvage ship {{and she began}} {{the first stage of}} her conversion with the installation of specialized <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment</b> from February to August 1925. From 1926 to October 1927, the ship's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four Kanpon Type RO boilers at Kure Naval Arsenal. One of her two funnels was also removed, and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine 0-1 (ex-). In May 1928, Asahi was fitted with a [...] compressed-air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an E2N1 Type 15 seaplane. After repeated accidents, the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder. On the completion of testing in 1928, Asahi was placed in reserve.|$|E
25|$|After the war the Munich factory {{took some}} time to restart {{production}} in any volume. BMW was banned from manufacturing motor vehicles by the Allies. During this ban, BMW used basic secondhand and <b>salvaged</b> <b>equipment</b> to make pots and pans, later expanding to other kitchen supplies and bicycles. Permission to manufacture motorcycles was granted to BMW by United States authorities in 1947, and production of the R24 began in 1948.|$|R
50|$|August 20, 1997- Three {{weeks after}} the flood, KCSU resumes {{broadcasting}} using donated and <b>salvaged</b> <b>equipment.</b> KCSU began broadcasting from an old garage, affectionately called the “bus barn”, and staff dealt with, security issues, DJ and listener dissent, and a hurt public image caused by lower broadcast quality {{as a result of}} the flood-damaged equipment. Despite these setbacks, KCSU won several radio awards and the title of the Fort Collins Coloradoan’s Best of Fort Collins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{narrow gauge}} railway, built from <b>salvaged</b> <b>equipment</b> from the New Pitsligo peat moss railway, was {{proposed}} in 1979 and opened in 1980. Originally it ran for 3 km from Haughton Park station through Murray Park Woods. Then in 1984 another line was run from [...] station, alongside Alford Golf Course, to Haughton Park about 1.35 km away {{where there is}} a platform. However, the original Murray Woods line was then closed.|$|R
500|$|At {{about this}} time, the {{entrepreneur}} Ernest Cox became involved. He bought 26 destroyers from the Admiralty for £250, {{as well as}} [...] and [...] He began operations to refloat the destroyers using an old German dry dock he purchased and subsequently modified. He was able to lift 24 of his 26 destroyers {{over the next year}} and a half, after which he began work on the larger vessels. He developed a new salvage technique whereby divers patched the holes in the submerged hulls, and then pumped air into them so they would rise to the surface, where they could then be towed to the breakers. Using this technique, he refloated several of the ships. His methods were costly, however, and the final cost of raising Hindenburg ran to some £30,000. Industrial action and a coal strike in 1926 nearly brought operations to a halt, but Cox instead dug out the coal in the submerged Seydlitz, using it to power his machines {{until the end of the}} strike. Salvaging Seydlitz also proved difficult, as the ship sank again during the first attempt to raise her, wrecking most of the <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment.</b> Undaunted, Cox tried again, ordering that when she was next raised, news cameras would be there to capture him witnessing the moment. The plan nearly backfired when Seydlitz was accidentally refloated while Cox was holidaying in Switzerland. Cox told the workers to sink her again, then returned to Britain to be present as Seydlitz was duly refloated a second time. Cox's company eventually raised 26 destroyers, two battlecruisers and five battleships.|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{of the ten}} {{ships were}} Maritime Commission type N3-M-A1 cargo vessel hulls of 2,483 gross tons with a length of 291 feet by beam of 42 feet. Number one and two holds were fifty-six feet long with number three being twenty-eight feet in length. The {{conversion}} placed machine, welding and carpenter shops in number two hold along with generators and air compressors supporting engineering work. Number one hold was reserved for construction machinery with number three containing repair stock, portable generators, refrigerated stores and quarters. The ships carried portable <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment,</b> including diver support, five ton capacity crawler crane, other lifting equipment and a pontoon barge. The most notable feature was addition of a forty ton cathead derrick for heavy salvage.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, the nightclub's {{fire alarm}} had activated, and {{although}} there were four possible exits, most people headed {{for the front door}} through which they had entered. The ensuing stampede led to a crush in the narrow hallway leading to that exit, quickly blocking the exit completely and resulting in numerous deaths and injuries among the patrons and staff. A total of 462 people were in attendance, even though the club's official licensed capacity was 404. One hundred lost their lives, and about half of the survivors were injured, either from burns, smoke inhalation, thermal trauma, or trampling. Among those who perished in the fire were Great White's lead guitarist, Ty Longley, and the show's emcee, WHJY DJ Mike [...] "The Doctor" [...] Gonsalves. There is reason to believe that Longley and Gonsalves tried to <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment</b> during the early stage of the fire and lost valuable time to escape before dense, toxic smoke made breathing near impossible at zero visibility. Longley is believed to have initially made it out of the building but then re-entered in an attempt to rescue his guitar. Furthermore, a number of survivors later stated that a bouncer stopped people trying to escape via the stage exit, stating that that door was [...] "for the band only." ...|$|E

50|$|On September 4, 1819, {{she caught}} fire after departing Burlington. Most of the {{passengers}} and crew safely made their escape, but six perished due to the flames or drowning. The ship grounded on Colchester Reef and was burned to the waterline. The company <b>salvaged</b> <b>equipment</b> from the wreck, including the steam engine, and the remnant hulk was dragged off the reef the following spring and allowed to sink. There {{was a great deal}} of speculation at the time that the fire was deliberately set by individuals unhappy with the advent of steam powered ships.|$|R

The ground had been devastated by artillery-fire and was covered in shell holes, trees had been toppled and the stream banks and beds had been smashed and were full of dead mules, making revolting swamps. Carts were strewn {{along the sides of}} plank roads and knocked out tanks {{littered}} the wastes. Shells and all manner of equipment lay around and the II Anzac Corps sent reserve units systematically to <b>salvage</b> <b>equipment.</b> At the beginning of December, the right flank of the New Zealand Division lay on a small rise at the lip of the plateau, at the high Jericho pillbox, beyond which the ground declined to the Scherriabeek. The left flank was at Joppa, a German shelter in the cellar of a demolished house, behind which the ground fell gradually towards a crater field containing the Veldhoek pillboxes. A duckboard track ran through Veldhoek, past the Tower pillbox and up the slopes of the main ridge to the Menin road, which lay almost unrecognisable to the south, diagonal from the New Zealand front line to Gheluvelt and at Veldhoek it was [...] away but on the New Zealand front was {{on the west side of}} the Scherriabeek valley, about [...] distant.|$|E

50|$|The {{radio was}} built by Captain George Parker, Corporal John (Jack) Sargent, Corporal John Donovan, Signaller Max (Joe) Loveless and Signalman Keith Richards. In civil life, Loveless had been a {{technician}} with 7ZL, a radio station in Hobart. The signallers built the radio using <b>salvaged</b> <b>equipment,</b> including the power pack from a Dutch transmitter, 60ft of aerial wire, a broken commercial medium-wave receiving set, and a transmitter from a broken 109 set. To power the equipment, a generator, taken from an old car, charged the batteries. The generator was operated by four natives turning handles attached to a four-foot diameter wheel, which drove a smaller 18-inch wheel connected by a rope loop. The smaller wheel ran the generator, which charged the batteries.|$|R
