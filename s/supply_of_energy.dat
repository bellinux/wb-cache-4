25|$|A star or planet {{often is}} modeled {{as a black}} body, and {{electromagnetic}} radiation emitted from these bodies as black-body radiation. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The photosphere of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature T that is maintained {{over a long period}} of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, former Intel Corporation Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove {{looked to}} energy resilience, arguing that {{complete}} independence is unfeasible given {{the global market}} for energy. He describes energy resilience {{as the ability to}} adjust to interruptions in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> To that end, he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity. Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources. A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is [...] "sticky" [...] – meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas. [...] According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as The Reform Institute have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries.|$|E
