Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for <b>screening</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} medical or <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> {{that can be}} used in diagnosing Tourette's; it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, partly because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely recognized and publicized cases). Coughing, eye blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or <b>screening</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E

40|$|The MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd.), {{a commercially}} available, rapid (20 -min) slide latex {{agglutination}} test for the determination of methicillin resistance by detection of PBP 2 a in Staphylococcus aureus, was compared with the oxacillin agar <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> and PCR detection of the mecA gene. A total of 563 S. aureus isolates were tested. Two hundred ninety-six of the isolates were methicillin-susceptible isolates from cultures of blood from consecutive patients. Also, 267 methicillin-resistant isolates that comprised 248 different phage types were tested. Methicillin resistance {{was defined as the}} presence of the mecA gene. Of the 267 mecA gene-positive isolates, 263 were positive by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (sensitivity, 98. 5 %), and all the mecA-gene negative strains were negative by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (specificity, 100 %). The oxacillin agar <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> detected methicillin resistance in 250 of the mecA gene-positive isolates (sensitivity, 93. 6 %). The sensitivity of the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> was statistically significantly higher than the sensitivity of the oxacillin agar <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 05). The MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> is a highly sensitive and specific test for the detection of methicillin resistance. Also, it offers results within half an hour and is easy to perform, which makes this test a valuable tool in the ongoing battle against methicillin-resistant S. aureus...|$|R
