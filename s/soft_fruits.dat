5|$|The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, {{foraging}} {{in trees}} {{and on the}} ground. The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, and other small plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and <b>soft</b> <b>fruits</b> are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in aloes for nectar, {{but these are not}} important sources of food.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{was introduced}} to Australia by a bird dealer visiting Melbourne in early 1857, and its range has expanded from its initial foothold in Melbourne and Adelaide to include all of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands. The introduced population in Australia is considered a pest because it damages a variety of <b>soft</b> <b>fruits</b> in orchards, parks and gardens including berries, cherries, stone fruit and grapes. It is thought to spread weeds, such as blackberry, and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.|$|E

5|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the spotted}} green pigeon was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on <b>soft</b> <b>fruits.</b>|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} components of most parrots' diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds, and other plant material. A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and <b>soft</b> <b>fruits.</b> Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows (or nest boxes in captivity), and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial (helpless) young.|$|E

25|$|The {{blue jay}} mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as acorns, <b>soft</b> <b>fruits,</b> arthropods, and {{occasionally}} small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes hawks insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays {{are known to}} hide nuts for later consumption. It builds an open cup nest in {{the branches of a}} tree, which both sexes participate in constructing. The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} to follow, various {{national}} and regional initiatives and projects were formed. These include LEAF (Linking Environment And Farming) in the UK, FNL (Fördergemeinschaft Nachhaltige Landwirtschaft e.V.) in Germany, FARRE (Forum des Agriculteurs Responsables Respectueux de l'Environnement) in France, FILL (Fördergemeinschaft Integrierte Landbewirtschaftung Luxemburg) or OiB (Odling i Balans) in Sweden. However, there are few if any figures on the uptake of Integrated Farming in the major crops throughout Europe for example, leading to a recommendation by the European Economic and Social Committee in February 2014, that the EU should carry out an in-depth analysis of integrated production in Europe {{in order to obtain}} insights into the current situation and potential developments. There is evidence, however, that between 60 and 80% of pome, stone and <b>soft</b> <b>fruits</b> were grown, controlled and marketed according to “Integrated Production Guidelines” in 1999 already in Germany for example. In the UK, 22% of fresh fruit and vegetables are grown to Integrated Farm Management standards as recognised by the LEAF Marque.|$|E
500|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater (Caligavis chrysops) is a medium-small {{bird in the}} honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. [...] It takes {{both its}} common name and {{scientific}} name from the distinctive yellow stripes {{on the sides of}} its head. Its loud clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and south eastern Australia, in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants such as Banksia and Grevillea, and <b>soft</b> <b>fruits.</b> It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} a demand for organic <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> in the UK, {{especially}} from processors, these crops are only grown on {{a very small scale}} at present. As the demand for organic fruit continues to grow much of this is therefore currently met by imports. Lack of technical knowledge, information and advice for growers, together with uncertainties over the economics of production are at present major barriers preventing growers becoming involved in this area. The purpose of this project is to address this problem, by collating the knowledge gained on this topic in previous projects (OF 0150), updating it with new developments and produce a technical guide on organic <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> production for growers. The content of the booklet is likely to be based on a booklet on the same topic that has been published by FiBL and this has already been translated to English as part of a previous DEFRA project (OF 0150). The collated information will be available in a user-friendly format as a published booklet and over the Internet. The findings of the project will also be disseminated to growers and other stakeholders within the industry at a seminar dedicated to the topic of Organic <b>Soft</b> <b>Fruit</b> Production and through articles in the horticultural press. The dissemination of this knowledge should have a beneficial effect by contributing to increasing the interest in organic <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> production and giving growers greater confidence to convert to organic production and thus eventually increase the domestic production of organic <b>soft</b> <b>fruit.</b> The project is relevant to DEFRA as it fits in with its overall policy of assisting UK organic farmers to meet the growing demand for organic produce and provide the necessary information to enable farmers to assess whether they should convert to organic production. Objective The overall aim of this project is to provide information for growers on organic <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> production (raspberry, currants and gooseberry). The specific objectives will be to: 1) to update, collect and review information on existing knowledge on, current practice and best practice techniques for organic production of raspberry, currants and gooseberry, building on the findings of OF 0150. 2) to produce a published technical booklet for growers - Organic <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> production (title to be confirmed) 3) to disseminate the information to growers and other stakeholders in the organic fruit industr...|$|R
500|$|On {{the basis}} of radiographs, D. T. Holyoak claimed that the {{mandible}} of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested {{that it would have}} fed on <b>soft</b> <b>fruits</b> rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced, that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. G. A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of [...] "strong jawed" [...] parrots based on radiographs, Cyanorhamphus, Melopsittacus, Neophema and Psephotus, actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the hyacinth macaw, which cracks open palm nuts with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad-billed parrot fed in the same manner.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{about one}} quarter of the land is under {{cultivation}} – mainly in cereals. Barley, wheat and potatoes are grown in eastern parts of Scotland such as Aberdeenshire, Moray, Highland, Fife and the Scottish Borders. The Tayside and Angus area is a centre of production of <b>soft</b> <b>fruits</b> such as strawberries, raspberries and loganberries, owing to the mild climate. [...] Sheep raising is important in the less arable mountainous regions, such as the northwest of Scotland which are used for rough grazing, due to its geographical isolation, poor climate and acidic soils. Parts of the east of Scotland (areas such as Aberdeenshire, Fife and Angus) are major centres of cereal production and general cropping. In such areas, the land is generally flatter, coastal, and the climate less harsh, and more suited to cultivation. The south-west of Scotland – principally Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway – is a centre of dairying. Agriculture, especially cropping in Scotland, is highly mechanised and generally efficient. Farms tend to cover larger areas than their European counterparts. Hill farming is also prominent in the Southern Uplands in the south of Scotland, resulting in the production of wool, lamb and mutton. Cattle-Rearing particularly in the east and south of Scotland results in the production of large amounts of beef. Farming in Scotland was affected by BSE and the European ban on the importation of British beef from 1996. Dairy and Cattle farmers in south-west Scotland were affected by the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth outbreak, which resulted in the destruction of much of their livestock as part of the biosecurity effort to control the spread of the disease.|$|E
