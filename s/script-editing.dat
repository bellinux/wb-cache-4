50|$|The script {{format for}} documentaries and {{audio-visual}} presentations which consist largely of voice-over matched to still or moving pictures is different again {{and uses a}} two-column format which can be particularly difficult to achieve in standard word processors, at least {{when it comes to}} editing or rewriting.

50|$|Dorothy and Hector founded Crawford Productions Pty Ltd (initially called Hector Crawford Productions) in 1945. Dorothy's {{role for}} the company was largely around {{production}} matters including <b>script-editing</b> and casting. She served as producer on numerous radio series including a dramatisation {{of the life of}} Dame Nellie Melba which was broadcast in 1946. The siblings subsidised their productions with The Crawford School of Broadcasting, which taught skills for working in radio, from the 1940s.

50|$|As Nathan-Turner had no {{writing or}} <b>script-editing</b> experience, {{the choice of}} the stories for {{production}} was left largely to Bidmead. This at once led to difficulties, with the second story to enter production, Meglos, suffering from all the problems which Nathan-Turner had identified in the show's scripts under Graham Williams (a lack of realism, an over indulgence in comedy). Nathan-Turner's first major story influence was in bringing back the Master, but the details of this he left to Bidmead. After Nathan-Turner's first season in charge, both Bidmead and Letts left the series, along with stars Tom Baker and Lalla Ward. Letts was never replaced. Bidmead was briefly replaced with Antony Root, then more permanently with Eric Saward: the latter would be script editor for much of Nathan-Turner's remaining time as producer.|$|E

Mort Weisinger, editor of all Superman comic titles during the 1960s, served as script editor for the shorts featuring Kal-El.

He and Cartmel remained on the production team for the twenty-sixth season in 1989. Although the season once again drew praise, the viewing figures were disastrous, starting at around the 3million mark and improving to only around 4.5million by the season's conclusion.

It was very much his era of the show, although by 1977 he felt that he had done all he could for the programme.

A Christmas Special was broadcast in December 2000, after the airing of the second series. Along with The Fast Show, the series is credited with the revival of the sketch show format in BBC comedy. Its influence can be seen on later series, particularly Little Britain (the first series of which was directed by Steve Bendelack and <b>script-edited</b> by Gatiss).|$|R
