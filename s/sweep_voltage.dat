30|$|Further {{performance}} {{improvement is}} necessary for {{resistive random access memory}} (RRAM) to realize its commercialization. In this work, a novel pulse operation method is proposed to improve the performance of RRAM based on Ti/HfO 2 /Pt structure. In the DC <b>voltage</b> <b>sweep</b> of the RRAM device, the SET transition is abrupt under positive bias. If current sweep with positive bias is utilized in SET process, the SET switching will become gradual, so SET is current controlled. In the negative <b>voltage</b> <b>sweep</b> for RESET process, the change of current with applied voltage is gradual, so RESET is <b>voltage</b> controlled. Current <b>sweep</b> SET and <b>voltage</b> <b>sweep</b> RESET shows better controllability on the parameter variation. Considering the SET/RESET characteristics in DC sweep, in the corresponding pulse operation, the width and height of the pulse series can be adjusted to control the SET and RESET process, respectively. Our new method is different from the traditional pulse operation in which both the width and height of program/erase pulse are simply kept constant which would lead to unnecessary damage to the device. In our new method, in each program or erase operation, a series of pulses with the width/height gradually increased are made use of to fully finish the SET/RESET switching but no excessive stress is generated at the same time, so width/height-controlled accurate SET/RESET can be achieved. Through the operation, the uniformity and endurance of the RRAM device has been significantly improved.|$|R

In the DC positive <b>voltage</b> <b>sweep</b> the SET transition is abrupt, but it becomes gradual under current sweep. The RESET process is gradual in negative <b>voltage</b> <b>sweep.</b> So SET and RESET are current and voltage controlled, respectively. Combining positive current sweep SET and corresponding negative <b>voltage</b> <b>sweep</b> RESET operation, stable and uniform distributions of on-state and off-state resistance can be obtained. Gaining inspiration from the DC SET/RESET characteristics, we proposed a novel pulse operation scheme, i.e. the width and height of the pulse series are adjusted to control the SET and RESET process, respectively. Our new method {{is different from the}} traditional pulse operation with single constant program/erase pulse. Thus, accurate SET/RESET controlled by pulse width/height can be achieved through our new method.

Non-equilibrium Green s function simulations indicate that the increase {{in the size of the}} 0. 5 conductance plateau is due to an increased importance, over a larger range of common <b>sweep</b> <b>voltage,</b> of the effects of electron-electron interactions in QPC devices with larger aspect ratio.

30|$|In conclusion, we have {{demonstrated}} the coexistence of filamentary and homogeneous RS mechanisms in single Al/MnO 2 /SS MIM device using a voltage-induced RS effect. Three modes of operation were observed during <b>sweep</b> <b>voltage</b> and sweep rate variations. The first mode represents CCWS (homogeneous RS), the second mode represents CWS (filamentary RS), and simultaneous CCWS and CWS were observed in the third mode. The third mode represents the coexistence of filamentary and homogeneous RS mechanisms in a single device. The accumulation of charge carrier densities beneath the top Al electrode with the application of different voltages {{is responsible for the}} coexistence of filamentary and homogeneous RS effect. The present report confirms that the coexistence of both the RS mechanisms is dependent on input voltage, charge-flux and time. The non-zero I–V crossing locations and crossover hysteresis loops suggested that the developed device has memristive and meminductive properties. The results suggested that the non-zero I–V crossing locations and corresponding current increases as the sweep rate and <b>sweep</b> <b>voltage</b> increases. Furthermore, the crossover hysteresis voltage and current locations tend to decreases as the sweep rate and sweep voltages increases. The memristive and meminductive memory effect is further confirmed by EIS. The results of equivalent circuit fitting suggest that the active cell could be modeled as a series resistor and an inductor with the parallel combination of a resistor and a capacitor. The resistance during OFF state was found to be higher than ON state of the device for each <b>sweep</b> <b>voltage.</b> Similarly, the inductive values during OFF state were found to be higher than the ON state values. These results further confirm that the meminductive behavior was dominant during OFF state due to the percolation channels and winding conductive filaments. The results suggested that the mem-device dynamics and electrochemical kinetics {{play an important role in}} the RS and memelements memory effects. The coexistence of homogeneous and filamentary RS effects could be used to develop scalable and efficient memory cells for resistive memory and neuromorphic applications. Furthermore, adaptive and self-resonating devices and circuits could be easily developed by properly engineering the memristive and meminductive memory effects in the single device.|$|E

First, the data acquisition system (DAS) commanded a direct digital synthesizer to start the FM sweep and then collected all voltage samples. This architecture insured phase coherence between the transmit FM sweep and the sampled voltages, which is critical for the Doppler processing that detects target phase changes over several successive FM sweeps. Second, a 5 -m range resolution was achieved by increasing the FM bandwidth to over 36 MHz and decreasing the DAS sample rate to 500 kHz, enabling the use of an inexpensive DAS. Third, the Doppler processing at each range was achieved using two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), i. e., a range FFT converted FM <b>sweep</b> <b>voltages</b> into in-phase and quadrature voltages I and Q at each range, and a Doppler FFT converted I and Q <b>voltages</b> from consecutive <b>sweeps</b> into the Doppler velocity power spectra.
