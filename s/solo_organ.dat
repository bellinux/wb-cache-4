5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in two parts, four {{movements to}} be performed before the sermon, three after the sermon. Both parts begin with a sinfonia. Bach scored it for an alto soloist and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes (Ob), taille (Ot), obbligato <b>solo</b> <b>organ</b> (Org), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato <b>solo</b> <b>organ</b> in several movements.|$|E
5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the <b>solo</b> <b>organ</b> work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E

500|$|The cantata {{is one of}} few sacred Bach cantatas {{opened by}} an orchestral sinfonia.

500|$|Olivier Eugène Charles Prosper Messiaen ( [...] ; December 10, 1908– April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of {{the major}} composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he {{abstracted}} from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, as well as for <b>solo</b> <b>organ</b> and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime.|$|E
500|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in seven movements in two parts, {{to be performed}} {{before and after the}} sermon. Both parts are opened by an instrumental sinfonia with <b>solo</b> <b>organ,</b> probably derived from concerto music composed earlier in Weimar or Köthen. The alto singer performs a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives, accompanied in all three arias by the organ as an equal partner. The Baroque instrumental ensemble is formed by two oboes, taille, strings and basso continuo. The alto part is demanding and was probably written with a specific singer in mind, as with the two other solo cantatas composed in the same period.|$|E

500|$|Prelude and Fugue on a Theme of Vittoria is a {{work for}} <b>solo</b> <b>organ</b> {{composed}} by Benjamin Britten in 1946. It was commissioned for St Matthew's Church, Northampton and first performed on 21 September 1946, St Matthew's Day, three days after its composition. It uses a theme from a motet by the Spanish composer Vittoria, both in the prelude (where it is played repeatedly on the pedals) and {{as the basis for}} the fugue. The piece, which lasts about five minutes in performance, has had a mixed reception. One writer has noted the difficulty on finding a suitable organ on which to perform the piece, given the difficulties in finding appropriate registration to meet Britten's requirements. A reviewer of a concert performance in the 1960s called it [...] "a contrived attempt to make bricks without straw", although other commentators have been more favourable about the piece.|$|E

2500|$|After 1745 Michael {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his childhood in the care of his aunt and celebrated actress Susannah Maria Cibber due to his mother's frequent illnesses and his father's busy career. It is likely that he received his earliest musical training from his aunt. It was also under her mentorship that he made his stage début as the Page in Thomas Otway’s tragedy The Orphan in the late 1740s. He began his musical career as a singer appearing in Francesco Onofrio Manfredini’s concert on 20 February 1750. This was followed by several singing appearances at the Vauxhall Gardens in the summer of 1750 where his father was the resident composer. However, Michael's career as a vocalist and actor was not prolonged for much longer. Charles Burney wrote that Michael's father [...] "tried to make him a singer, but he was naturally idle and not very quick. However, he acquired a powerful hand on the harpsichord". Michael's obvious lack of enthusiasm for singing pervailed and he focused primarily on music composition and organ and harpsichord performance after the summer of 1750. On 5 February 1751 he gave his first <b>solo</b> <b>organ</b> concert which featured one of his father’s organ concertos; he went on to be the principal exponent of his father's organ works for the next thirty years. Arne also showed an early talent as a composer and his first collection of vocal art songs entitled The Floweret was published in 1750. The collection included the Scottish style song [...] "The Highland Laddie" [...] which became popular and as late as 1775 was adapted by Thomas Linley the elder in The Duenna.|$|E
