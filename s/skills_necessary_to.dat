His experience of administrative matters, including with regard to policing, proved to be useful to Curzon during the government's 1905 partition of Bengal along communal lines. So useful was his knowledge and ability that his term in India was extended for two years beyond the usual retirement age. This was to enable him to provide the summarisation, negotiation and drafting <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> ensure success in administrative reform of the Provincial Councils by Curzon's successor as Viceroy, Lord Minto.|$|E

5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture's {{existence}} (from roughly 3000 BC to 2750 BC), copper traded {{from other}} societies (notably, from the Balkans) began to appear throughout the region, and members of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture began to acquire <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> use it to create various items. Along with the raw copper ore, finished copper tools, hunting weapons and other artefacts were also brought in from other cultures. This marked the transition from the Neolithic to the Eneolithic, also known as the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. Bronze artifacts began to show up in archaeological sites toward {{the very end of the}} culture. The primitive trade network of this society, that had been slowly growing more complex, was supplanted by the more complex trade network of the Proto-Indo-European culture that eventually replaced the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture.|$|E

At the age of eleven she started to play softball in her home town. She later attended Detroit schools, graduating from the High School of Commerce. By then Wisniewski developed the basic <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> compete at a high level. She began playing against the greatest semi-professional softball players of Detroit in the late 1930s, and led the Hudson Motors team to the city championship. Although primarily an infielder Wisniewski became a pitcher in 1941. She quickly learned fundamentals of the position, acquiring good mechanics, location and speed, {{the only way to}} pitch consistently with the minimum effort.

Additional courses include the Battle Manager Instructor Training Course, which teaches air battle managers from different backgrounds the <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> instruct undergraduate students, and the Air Weapons Officer/Weapons Director Initial Qualification Training Course, which teaches previously qualified air battle managers and weapons directors the art and science of controlling live aircraft.

25|$|In 1980, {{the raising}} of the Operational Deployment Force, which {{required}} a battalion of the 3rd Task Force to be maintained at high readiness for deployment to the South West Pacific or Southeast Asia year-round, meant that the Army once again needed to develop <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> operate in tropical or jungle conditions. As a result, a renewed jungle warfare training program was established. Urban development around Canungra had encroached upon the training area, though, so {{the decision was made}} to situate this training in a new establishment called the 1st Division Tropical Training Centre (later redesignated to Battle School), at Tully, Queensland. The Land Warfare Centre therefore continued to focus on individual training rather than collective training and this in part led, in March 1980, to the reduction of LWC's demonstration force, the 10th Independent Rifle Company, to just one platoon of 40 men as its manpower was redirected to meet shortages in the 3rd Task Force.|$|E
25|$|On 9 November 2006, Carrier Strike Group Seven {{departed}} San Diego {{to sustain}} multi-ship warfare skills through carrying out Joint Task Force Exercise 07-1 (JTFEX 07-1). During the exercise, between 12–16 November 2006, Carrier Strike Group Seven combined with Carrier Strike Group Three, to form Carrier Task Force 150 under the overall command of Rear Admiral Kevin Quinn, Commander, Carrier Strike Group Three. This {{was the first}} time the two groups had operated together. JTFEX 07-1 was not a normal pre-deployment exercise; it aimed to sustain multi-ship warfighting skills in the event either strike group had to make an unexpected deployment. To maintain all the <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> fight the entire two-carrier group together, the exercise tested individual ships (in general quarters and usage of weapons), the two carrier air wings, and the ships and aircraft of the strike group(s) fighting as a team. With the two carrier air wings operating together, the normal 12-hour cycle of flight operations could be doubled to a continuous 24-hour cycle.|$|E
25|$|In December 1957, the {{destroyer}} entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard {{for what was}} to have been her decommissioning overhaul. In June 1958, however, a reprieve arrived in the form of orders to shift home port to Seattle, Wash., and become a Naval Reserve training ship as the flagship of Reserve Escort Squadron 1 (ResCortRon 1). Watts served with the reserve training program for almost four years, from June 1958 to March 1962. Throughout the entire period, the Seattle-Tacoma area remained her base of operations. She provided a platform upon which naval reservists could reacquaint themselves with the intricacies of and <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> constructive Navy service. During her more than three years of reserve training cruises, she ranged the length of the western coast of the United States from San Diego, Calif. in the south to the Canada–US border. She also cruised farther north to make goodwill calls at Canadian ports such as Victoria, British Columbia. During the summer of 1959, she became the first Naval Reserve training ship to participate in a regular Fleet exercise with her reserve crew embarked.|$|E
