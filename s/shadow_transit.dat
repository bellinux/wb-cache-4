50|$|Young {{frequently}} lectures {{about his}} work to youth, school, civic, and church groups around the western USA. In 2006 He attended the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) General Assembly 2006 in Prague, Czech Republic. Young gave a presentation on his activities taking astrometric observations of NEOs and comets at Table Mountain Observatory in the S236 Symposium on August 14. Young, and his wife Karen (a HS Science and Math teacher), hold annual star-parties for their local communities as anOutreach Program. The 13th annual event, was held on October 15, 2010. The event was attended by approximately 80 people, with manyschool children, parents, and Boy Scouts present. With six telescopes, many {{from members of the}} High Desert Astronomical Society (HiDAS),participants viewed the moon, and later when the clouds cleared in the east, a <b>shadow</b> <b>transit</b> of Io across Jupiter's cloud surface was seen.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the recurrent image of the clown and the references to the carnivalesque universe in Max Blecher’s fiction, distinctive elements of his writing, placed under {{the sign of the}} tragic. From the perspective of C. G. Jung’s abyssal psychology, focus is laid on the image of the clown, ascated with that of the trickster, an archetype of the authorial <b>shadow</b> <b>transiting</b> through the two worlds, reality/ immediate unreality, conscious/ unconscious. The hermeneutical undertaking attempts to decipher the contextual symbols which point to the duplicitous nature of the character, {{in the sense of a}} schizoid identity on the Ego/ Self axis. The conclusions underline the author’s tendency of substituting himself to this fantastic projection, by dissimulating a mask of absurd happiness as an imaginative exercise against biography...|$|R

Portions of the service <b>shadow</b> the rapid <b>transit</b> and {{commuter}} rail services of BART and Caltrain, which are the major rail services between San Francisco, the East Bay, the Peninsula, and San Jose. BART and Caltrain do not operate owl service so that track maintenance can be performed; the All Nighter network helps fill this service gap. The slogan is, [...] "Now transit stays up as late as you do!" ...|$|R
40|$|The BIRD {{mission is}} a small {{satellite}} project {{carried out by the}} German Aerospace Center (DLR). Launched on October 22, 2001 its major objectives are the test {{of a new generation of}} infrared array sensors as well as the detection and scientific investigation of hot spots, like forest fires or volcanic activities. As a technology satellite, BIRD is equipped with a GPS-based autonomous navigation system which provides real-time onboard orbit determination as well as orbit and event prediction capabilities. The Onboard Navigation System (ONS) supports the BIRD Attitude Control System with real-time attitude information to allow for a nadir pointing of the spacecraft during image sessions and high-rate data downlinks. In addition, precise ONS position data are merged onboard the spacecraft with BIRD image sensor data, thus enabling a geocoding of satellite images on-the-flight. Furthermore, the ONS derives precise timing information from the GPS receiver, which allows a proper synchronization of the BIRD onboard clock based on the measured bias and the determined drift rate. Finally, NORAD twoline elements are autonomously generated onboard from GPS position data, which are downlinked to a relocatable ground terminal for antenna pointing and pass scheduling. An example of the autonomous navigation capabilities of the ONS is the onboard computation of upcoming <b>shadow</b> <b>transits</b> and station contacts, that serves as a demonstration of more fundamental tasks like the support of onboard experiment scheduling or power management. Starting with an introduction to the BIRD satellite mission, a detailed mathematical description of the algorithms applied within the ONS is given. The concept and architectural design of the implemented system is presented with emphasis on the interaction of the ONS threads and their timing characteristics, followed by a description of the ONS software modules. A series of ONS-related software and hardware-in-theloop test cycles has been conducted in the preparation of the mission, which are presented. Based on more than two months of flight experience, the performance of the ONS is analyzed in detail, demonstrating the reliable performance of the system together with an excellent accuracy performance, which provides real-time position accuracy of a few meters on-board the BIRD satellite...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} new {{observations}} of the orbital position of Phobos, {{and use them to}} obtain a new and improved estimate of the rate of secular acceleration in longitude due to tidal dissipation within Mars. Phobos is the inner-most natural satellite of Mars, {{and one of the few}} natural satellites in the solar system with orbital period shorter than the rotation period of its primary. As a result, any departure from a perfect elastic response by Mars in the tides raised on it by Phobos will cause a transfer of angular momentum from the orbit of Phobos to the spin of Mars. Since its discovery in 1877, Phobos has completed over 145, 500 orbits, and has one of the best studied orbits in the solar system, with over 6000 earth-based astrometric observations, and over 300 spacecraft observations. As early as 1945, Sharpless noted that there is a secular acceleration in mean longitude, with rate (1. 88 + 0. 25) 10 (exp - 3) degrees per square year. In preparation for the 1989 Russian spacecraft mission to Phobos, considerable work was done compiling past observations, and refining the orbital model. All of the published estimates from that era are in good agreement. A typical solution (Jacobson et al., 1989) yields (1. 249 + 0. 018) 10 (exp - 3) degrees per square year. The MOLA instrument on MGS is a laser altimeter, and was designed to measure the topography of Mars. However, it has also been used to make {{observations of the}} position of Phobos. In 1998, a direct range measurement was made, which indicated that Phobos was slightly ahead of the predicted position. The MOLA detector views the surface of Mars in a narrow field of view, at 1064 nanometer wavelength, and can detect shadows cast by Phobos on the surface of Mars. We have found 15 such serendipitous <b>shadow</b> <b>transit</b> events over the interval from xx to xx, and all of them show Phobos to be ahead of schedule, and getting progressively farther ahead of the predicted position. In contrast, the cross-track positions are quite close to the predicted values. Assuming that the along-track discrepancy is small enough that we can linearize the corrections, we model the mean orbital longitude as a quadratic function of time, and solve for corrections to the constant, linear, and quadratic terms. The time span of the recent observations is insufficient to properly resolve this issue alone, but when the 127 years of prior observations are added, we find a solution which reduces misfit to the new observations considerably, and makes no significant change to the fit to earlier observations. Our estimate for the secular acceleration term is (1. 367 + 0. 006) degrees per square year. The corresponding rate of energy dissipation is 3. 34 MW. From a geophysical perspective, a more interesting parameter than the secular acceleration itself is the tidal lag angle, or tidal quality factor Q, for Mars. Unfortunately, the limiting error source in that determination is remaining uncertainty in the tidal Love numbers at harmonic degrees 2, 3, and even 4. Until those parameters are better constrained, improvement in the orbital model of Phobos will not provide corresponding benefits for understanding the interior of Mars...|$|E
5000|$|In the anime series Cowboy Bebop, {{in which}} the solar system is settled by {{humanity}} which has abandoned the Earth, interplanetary travel is achieved using [...] "Astral Gates". These enable the delivery of large amounts of material and energy, including sunlight, which simplifies the terraforming of the planets and moons of the Solar System. The gates are shown {{as a series of}} giant rings extending through space, forming the pathways through which the <b>shadow</b> of <b>transiting</b> spaceships can be seen from [...] "real" [...] space. The construction of the first gate, near Earth's moon, ended in a massive accident that somehow destroyed the moon, rendering Earth uninhabitable. Earth is occasionally shown in the series as a wasteland of devastated and deserted cities, still subject to bombardment by the remaining moon fragments, and populated only by a small number of people with strange personality traits. Some were also known to lose the effect of time when exposed to a catastrophic gate failure, and when its energy condensed in space, it became a strange magenta stone that somehow served as an antidote to this effect.|$|R
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, the {{snowmelt}} energy balance is dominated by net solar shortwave radiation. This is the case in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, where clear skies dominate the winter and spring. In mountainous regions, solar irradiance at the snow surface is not only affected by solar angles, atmospheric transmittance, and the slope and aspect of immediate topography, but also by shadows from surrounding terrain. Many hydrological models do not consider such horizon-shadows. The accumulation of errors in estimating solar irradiance by neglecting horizon-shadows can lead to significant errors in calculating the timing and rate of snowmelt due to the seasonal storage of internal energy in the snowpack. A common approach to representing the landscape is through structured meshes. However, such representations introduce errors due to the rigid nature of the mesh, creating artefacts and other constraints. Unstructured triangular meshes are more efficient in their representation of the terrain by allowing for a variable resolution. These meshes do not suffer from the artefact problems of a structured mesh. This thesis demonstrates the increased accuracy of using a horizon-shading model with an unstructured mesh versus standard self-shading algorithms in Marmot Creek Research Basin (MCRB), Alberta, Canada. A systematic basin-wide over-prediction (basin mean expressed as phase change mass: 14 mm, maximum: 200 mm) in net shortwave is observed when only self-shadows are considered. The horizon-shadow model was run at a point scale at three sites throughout MCRB to investigate the effects of scale on the model results. It was found that small triangles were best suited for this topographic region and that shadow patterns were captured accurately. Large triangles were found to be too easily shaded by the model, created many disjointed regions. As well, model results were compared to measurements of mountain shadows by timelapse digital cameras. These images were orthorectified and the shadow regions extracted allowing for a quantitative comparison. It was found that the horizon-model produced results within 10 m of the measured shadows, and properly captured <b>shadow</b> <b>transits.</b> A point-scale energy balance model SNOBAL was run via The Cold Regions Hydrological Model, an HRU based hydrologic model. It was found that in the highly shaded valleys, snowpack ablation could be incorrect by approximately 4 days. Although MCRB was generally not significantly impacted by the over-estimation in irradiance in this study, insight into the horizon-shadowing process was possible {{as a result of the}} existing network of radiometers and other meteorological stations at MCRB. Because down-stream processes such as flooding depend on correct headwater snowmelt predictions, quantitative results demonstrating inaccuracies in a modelled component of the surface energy balance can help improve snowmelt modelling...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of the Doppler <b>shadow</b> of the <b>transiting</b> hot Jupiter CoRoT- 11 b. Our analysis is based on line-profile tomography of time-series, Keck/HIRES high-resolution spectra acquired during the transit of the planet. We measured a sky-projected, spin-orbit angle of 0. 1 +/- 2. 6 degrees, {{which is consistent with}} a very low-inclined orbit with respect to the stellar rotation axis. We refined the physical parameters of the system using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simultaneous fitting of the available photometric and spectroscopic data. An analysis of the tidal evolution of the system shows how the currently measured obliquity and its uncertainty translate into an initial absolute value of less than about 10 degrees on the zero-age main sequence, for an expected average modified tidal quality factor of the star Q'* > 4 x 10 ^ 6. This is indicative of an inward migration scenario that would not have perturbed the primordial low obliquity of CoRoT- 11 b. Taking into account the effective temperature and mass of the planet host star (Teff= 6440 K, M*= 1. 23 MSun), the system can be considered a new telling exception to the recently proposed trend, according to which relatively hot and massive stars (Teff> 6250 K, M*> 1. 2 MSun) seem to be preferentially orbited by hot Jupiters with high obliquity.
