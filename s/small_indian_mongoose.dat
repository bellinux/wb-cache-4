40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the infection with gastrointestinal helminthes in <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestes auropunctatus) and its epidemiologic aspects in Iran. Methods: During June 2012 to July 2013, {{a total of}} 13 <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongooses</b> were caught using live trap boxes in an area located near Shiraz, southern of Iran. Captured animals were euthanized, eviscerated {{and parts of the}} alimentary tract were inspected. Two mongooses showed a nematode attached to the mucosa of the stomach. Results: According to the main morphological characteristics, the specimens belonged to the genus Spirura (Blanchard 1849). This study represents the first evidences of the infection with Spirura sp. in Herpestes auropunctatus in the world. Conclusions: Because the animal can invade and appear in the habitat of the other animal populations including omnivores or carnivores, it seems that mongooses in this area could have a high potential for the transmission of the infection with the spirurid nematodes to a large range of animals. Thus, besides the necessity of conducting the controlling programs, autochthonous dogs, cats and rodents should be included in more epidemiological studies in this region...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} and genetic properties of Bartonella species were investigated in <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongooses</b> and masked palm civets in Japan. Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of cat-scratch disease (CSD) was isolated from 15. 9 % (10 / 63) of the mongooses and 2. 0 % (1 / 50) of the masked palm civets, respectively. The bacteraemic level ranged from 3. 0 × 101 to 8. 9 × 103 CFU/mL in mongooses and was 7. 0 × 103 CFU/mL in the masked palm civet. Multispacer typing (MST) analysis based on nine intergenic spacers {{resulted in the}} detection of five MST genotypes (MSTs 8, 14, 37, 58 and 59) for the isolates, which grouped in lineage 1 with MST genotypes of isolates from all CSD patients {{and most of the}} cats in Japan.

40|$|Critically Endangered Puerto Rican parrots Amazona vittata {{are one of}} {{the rarest}} birds in the world. Several exotic mammal species capable of preying on Puerto Rican parrots cohabit the Caribbean National Forest with the only wild {{population}} of these parrots. We used tracking plates, monitoring blocks and trapping to index black rats, <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongooses</b> and feral cats in parrot habitat and in public-use areas in the same habitat type. We had high trap success for black rats at all sites (42 % of all sites combined), among the highest reported in the world. Rat response to monitoring (nontoxic bait) blocks was universally high, regardless of ground or tree placement. Mongooses were present at all sites, with a greater proportion of plates tracked within the forest than at public-use sites. Cats were present at all forest sites and one of the public-use sites. Presence of the three species {{did not appear to be}} linked to human disturbance. Because only 30 – 40 Puerto Rican parrots survive in the wild, with as few as three pairs nesting in 2002, we concluded that the abundance and pervasiveness of exotic mammalian predators poses a greater threat to the parrots than has been generally acknowledged. This is evidenced by mammalian predation during recent parrot breeding seasons, including six fledglings taken by mongooses and one nest failure from rats during 2000 – 2003...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In western {{parts of}} its native range, the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes javanicus) is {{sympatric}} {{with one or}} both of two slightly larger congeners. In the eastern part of its range, these species are absent. The <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> was introduced, about a century ago, to the West Indies, the Hawaiian islands, Mauritius, the Fijian islands, and Okinawa. All introductions except possibly that to Mauritius were from the region of Calcutta and Bangladesh, where it is sympatric with both congeners. No other mongoose is present on any of these islands. In each instance, the introduced population derived from a small propagule. We examined size variation in the maximum diameter of the upper canine tooth (the prey-killing organ) and skull length. In the eastern (allopatric) part of its native range, males of the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> are much larger in both traits than in the western (sympatric) regions, approaching the size of the smaller of its absent two congeners, Herpestes edwardsii. Females from the allopatric part of the range are also larger than those of the source region. The species is more sexually dimorphic in the region of allopatry. On all islands to which it has been introduced, in 100 – 200 generations the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> has increased in male size and in sexual dimorphism; changes in femal...|$|E
40|$|The Hawaiian islands provide superlative {{examples}} of biological evolution and {{are perhaps the}} best sites {{in the world for}} biological invasions. Introduced invertebrates such as the Argentine ant (Iridomyrmex humilis) and the western yellowjacket wasp (Paravespula pensvlvanica) reduce native insects and plant pollinators and may have been a factor in native bird declines. Management of invertebrates in localized areas through use of chemicals such as Tahara and diazinon is being attempted. Research on the long term effects of alien birds on native ecosystems is under way, but management currently is restricted to preservation of intact and large areas of native ecosystems. Black rats (Rattus rattus), <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestes auropunctatus). and feral cats (Felis catus) are thought to be especially important invaders of natural areas in Hawaii. Research on ecology and control methods for all 3 species is under way, with registration of diphacinone for mongooses by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service nearly complete. Ungulates have been the most prominent alien animals in Hawaii’s ecosystems since shortly after continental man introduced them in the 18 th century. Successful control and even eradication of feral cattle (Bos taunis), feral sheep (Qvisaries), mouflon (Ovismusimon). feral goats (Capra hircus), and feral pigs (Sus scrofa) has been accomplished in many areas to date through systematic, long-term programs with salaried personnel.

40|$|Background and aim: The use of DNA {{barcodes}} {{has been}} proposed as a promising tool for identifying species. The efficacy of this tool for invasive species requires further exploration. The species status of the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose,</b> an exotic invasive in several parts of the world, has been contentious due to morphological similarity with its congeners in its natural habitat. Although the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> is recognized as Herpestes javanicus, this nomenclature has been used interchangeably with Herpestes auropunctatus. Materials and methods: Here, we demonstrate the utility of using DNA barcoding approaches with mtDNA cytochrome b to discriminate between the two species and other sympatric members of the genus Herpestes (Herpestes naso, Herpestes urva, and Herpestes edwardsii). Using the diagnostic DNA positions we obtain, we can identity specimens of nonnative populations of the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> from the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands to their species of origin.

40|$|The <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes auropunctatus) {{is one of}} the world’s 100 worst {{invasive}} species (IUCN 2000). It has negative impacts on several small mammals on islands where it was introduced. We assess the abundance of small mammal populations and the activity time of introduced ship rats (Rattus rattus) on three mongoose-infested and three mongoose-free islands in the Adriatic Sea, Croatia. We set up three transects on each island with a trapping system consisting of 30 small live traps to capture small mammals under 30 grams and 30 larger traps to capture ship rats and mongooses, on each transect. Our results support an already large but mostly speculative literature that suggests inability of the <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongoose</b> to reduce high abundances of introduced R. rattus. Further, we suggest that the low abundance of native small mammals is probably not solely caused by the mongoose but also by high R. rattus populations on all six islands. In addition, we provide evidence that R. rattus has changed its activity time to become more nocturnal on mongoose-infested islands, possibly to avoid predation by the mongoose. As R. rattus became more nocturnal, the diurnal mongoose may have become the main predator on amphibians, reptiles, and poultry...|$|E

Mean body weight for males was 735. 2 ± 75. 9 gm (S. D.) and for females, 487. 4 ± 44. 6 gm (S. D.). The animals were lightly restrained, unanesthesized and in thermoregulatory stability (at Ta less than 45 ˚C) before data collection in an open flow system of rectal temperature, oxygen uptake, total evaporative water loss and respiration rate. Resting body temperature (39. 41 ±. 36 ˚C, S. E.) was maintained at Ta ranging from 13 ˚ to 37 ˚C. Body temperature increased below 10 ˚C and above 35 ˚C. Subjects appeared heat stressed at Ta above 38 ˚C. Total evaporative water loss (TEWL) remained constant below Ta = 37 ˚C with a mean of. 033 ±. 007 mg H 2 O/gm/hr (S. E.). A marked increase in TEWL occurred above Ta = 38 ˚C due to the onset of panting and salivation. The resting metabolic rate was. 66 ±. 18 ml O 2 /gm/hr (S. E.). The lower critical temperature was approximated as 29 ˚C, and the upper critical temperature lay between 35 ˚ and 40 ˚C. At 5 ˚C metabolic rate increased three times the resting level.

Ka'āpahu, Haleakalā National Park was acquired by the National Park Service in 1999. Inventories of vegetation, forest birds, and non-native mammals in this newly acquired area were identified as a priority for the National Park Service. To satisfy the forest bird and non-native mammal inventories, presence or absence and distribution surveys were conducted in 2002. A follow-up forest bird survey was conducted in May 2005. Results of the forest bird surveys showed the presence of four native forest bird species: Maui 'Amakihi (Hemignathus virens wilsoni), Maui 'Alauahio (Paroreomyza montana newtoni), 'I'iwi (Vestiaria coccinea), and 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea sanguinea). Five alien forest bird species were detected: the Japanese Bush-warbler (Cettia diphone), Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea), Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), and Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). No endangered bird species were detected. Results suggest that non-native Japanese Bush-warbler, Hwamei and Japanese White-eye may be expanding their range. Results of the non-native mammals survey showed presence of black rats (Rattus rattus), <b>small</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestes auropunctatus), feral pigs (Sus scrofa), axis deer (Axis axis), and feral goats (Capra hircus) throughout the transect.
