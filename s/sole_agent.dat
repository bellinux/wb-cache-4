25|$|Overdosage {{may result}} in vomiting, sedation, {{disturbances}} in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremor, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions. Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the <b>sole</b> <b>agent.</b> Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 50-400 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000-3000 μg/l in patients who survive acute overdosage and 3–30mg/l in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose.|$|E

Edward Failing, who in 1857 when he was sixteen had first started to work at H.W. Corbett and Co {{when he had finished}} school, and M.B. Millard. Each became a sixth interest partner in H.W. Corbett and Co. Edward had been only ten when he first came out to Portland with his father Josiah Failing and older brother Henry Failing, who was then seventeen and later became Corbett’s brother-in-law. By September 1867 H.W. Corbett & Co. had its own office in New York City and was no longer employing an agent.|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine must not be used as a <b>sole</b> <b>agent</b> in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Brassey {{was educated}} at home {{until the age}} of 12, when he was sent to The King's School in Chester. Aged 16, he became an {{articled}} apprentice to a land surveyor and agent, William Lawton. Lawton was the agent of Francis Richard Price of Overton, Flintshire. During the time Brassey was an apprentice he helped to survey the new Shrewsbury to Holyhead road (this is now the A5), assisting the surveyor of the road. While he was engaged in this work he met the engineer for the road, Thomas Telford. When his apprenticeship ended at the age of 21, Brassey was taken into partnership by Lawton, forming the firm of [...] "Lawton and Brassey". Brassey moved to Birkenhead where their business was established. Birkenhead at that time was a very small place; in 1818 it consisted of only four houses. The business flourished and grew, extending into areas beyond land surveying. At the Birkenhead site a brickworks and lime kilns were built. The business either owned or managed sand and stone quarries in Wirral. Amongst other ventures, the firm supplied the bricks for building the custom house for the port which was developing in the town. Many of the bricks needed for the growing city of Liverpool were supplied by the brickworks and Brassey devised new methods of transporting his materials, including a system similar to the modern method of palletting, and using a gravity train to take materials from the quarry to the port. When Lawton died, Brassey became sole manager of the company and <b>sole</b> <b>agent</b> and representative for Francis Price. It was during these years that he gained the basic experience for his future career.|$|E

His first newspaper advertisement appeared in 1890 where he was noted as the manager of the Conservative Real Estate & Trust Company. By 1892, McKenna was advertising as the <b>sole</b> <b>agent</b> for the University Park neighborhood. In 1894, McKenna constructed a three-story brick building in the heart of University Park. When the Archdiocese of Portland purchased the land of the former Portland University to erect a new University of Portland, they went to McKenna to secure more 23 acres of more land for $20,000 ($ adjusted for inflation). In 1910, McKenna purchased 1,280 acres of land for US$12,800 in a rural area near Chitwood, Oregon where he established a ranch.|$|E

In {{order to}} service the Agency for the Lloyd's of London for the Port of Colombo, Clark Spence & Co. partnered with Britton, Aitken & Co. to open a branch office in Colombo.

In 1876, Aitken Spence & Co. obtained the Lloyds agency from Clark Spence & Co. Aitken Spence had also obtained the local agency of [...] Morgan Crucible Company for trading in plumbago. As Colombo became the commercial capital of Sri Lanka, Aitken Spence & Co became more prominent and subsequently its partner company, Clark Spence & Co. originally based in Galle, became a subsidiary of Aitken Spence & Co.|$|E
