50|$|The term ‘private bankers’ {{is often}} {{confused}} with the term ‘private bank’, which refers more broadly to any bank focusing on private wealth management, {{most of which are}} structured as a limited company. To prevent improper use of the term ‘private banker’ by people or institutions that do not meet the legal definition, the <b>Swiss</b> Private <b>Bankers</b> <b>Association</b> registered ‘private banker’ and its linguistic variations with the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property in 1997. The SPBA has had exclusive control of the ‘private banker’ trademark in Switzerland since that time.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2014, the <b>Swiss</b> Private <b>Bankers</b> <b>Association</b> had lost five of its remaining 12 members: {{to adapt to the}} requirements international financial centres unfamiliar with the traditional Swiss definition of a private banker, some private bankers chose to break with ‘more than 200 years of history’ by changing their structure to limited liability companies. This was the case for Landolt & Cie in January 2013 followed in February 2013 by Pictet & Cie and Lombard Odier & Cie. Several months later, Mirabaud & Cie and La Roche & Cie followed suit. In February 2016, Gonet & Cie abandoned its private banker structure and became a holding company organised as a limited liability company. As a result, these banks no longer met the legal definition of a private banker with unlimited liability for the commitments of the bank. A new organisation, the Association of Swiss Private Banks, was founded on 1 January 2014: its articles of association allow it to admit as members both limited companies and traditional private bankers.|$|R
