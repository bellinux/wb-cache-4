40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} three common methods of endotracheal tube cuff {{inflation}} (sealing pressure, precise standard pressure or finger estimation) regarding the effective tracheal seal and {{the incidence of}} post-intubation airway complications. Methods: Seventy-five adult patients scheduled for N 2 O free general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. After induction of anesthesia, endotracheal tubes size 7. 5 mm for female and 8. 0 mm for male were used. Patients were randomly assigned into one of three groups. Control group (n= 25), the cuff was inflated to a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O; sealing group (n= 25), the cuff was inflated to prevent air leaks at airway pressure of 20 cm H 2 O and finger group (n= 25), the cuff was inflated using finger estimation. Tracheal leaks, incidence of sore throat, hoarseness and dysphagia were tested. Results: Although cuff pressure was significantly low in the sealing group compared to the control group (P< 0. 001), the incidence of sore throat was similar in both groups. On the other hand, cuff pressure {{as well as the}} incidence of sore throat were significantly higher in the finger group compared to both the control and the sealing group (P< 0. 001 and P= 0. 008). The incidence of dysphagia and hoarseness were similar in the three groups. None of the patients in the three groups developed air leak around the endotracheal tube cuff. Conclusions: In N 2 O, free anesthesia <b>sealing</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure is an easy, undemanding and safe alternative to the standard technique, regarding effective sealing and low incidence of sore throat...|$|E

The Sapien 3 device (Edwards Life-sciences) is different than the prior devices released by the same manufacturer in that it has a skirt designed to prevent paravalvular leak, improved coaxial alignment, and more accurate positioning. AimsTo evaluate paravalvular aortic regurgitations after 30 -day after TAVI using the Edwards SAPIEN 3 prosthesis. MethodsProspective monocentric study including 66 high-risk or non-operable patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI using Edwards SAPIEN 3 prosthesis via transfemoral access, between September 2014 and March 2015. ResultsMean age of patient was 84 ± 7, 1 years (70 % female). The MDCT estimated an aortic annular diameter 25, 07 ± 2 mm. Mean logistic EuroSCORE was 15, 8 ± 10, 8. In our study, the device success rate was 98. 5 %. The pros-thesis has been deployed correctly in all cases and no failure of valve or embolization had occurred. Post TAVR, mean transaortic gradient decreased from 46, 0 ± 12, 33 mmHg to 8, 2 ± 3, 37 mmHg (p< 0. 001). No patient had moderate or severe PAR. At 30 days follow up, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed that the PAR was absent or trivial in 66 % of patients and mild in the remainder. Possible reasons for this low PAR rate include: 1) the outer polyethylene terephthalate <b>sealing</b> <b>cuff,</b> which enhances paravalvular sealing; 2) more accurate positioning; and 3) improved sizing with adjunctive MDCT. ConclusionIn our study, TAVI with Edwards SAPIEN 3 demonstrated lower paravalvular aortic leak rates than earlier generation devices in patients at high risk for surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sealing pressure as an inflation technique of the Microcuff pediatric tracheal cuffed tube. Materials and Methods: A total of 60 children were enrolled in this study. After induction of anesthesia and intubation with Microcuff pediatric tracheal tube, patients were randomly assigned, to one of the three groups. Control group (n = 20) the cuff was inflated to a cuff pressure of 20 cm H 2 O; sealing group (n = 20) the cuff was inflated to prevent the air leak at peak airway pressure of 20 cm H 2 O and the finger group (n = 20) the cuff was inflated to a suitable pressure using the finger estimation. Tracheal leak, incidence and severity of post-extubation cough, stridor, sore throat and hoarseness were recorded. Results: The cuff pressure as well as the volume of air to fill the cuff was significantly low in the sealing group when compared with the control group (P < 0. 001); however, their values were significantly high in the finger group compared with both the control and the sealing group (P < 0. 001). The incidence and severity of sore throat were significantly high in the finger group compared with both the control and the sealing group (P = 0. 0009 and P = 0. 0026). Three patients in the control group developed air leak around the endotracheal tube cuff. The incidence and severity of other complications were similar in the three groups. Conclusion: In pediatric N 2 O, free general anesthesia using Microcuff pediatric tracheal tub, <b>sealing</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure is safer than finger palpation technique regarding post-extubation morbidities and more reliable than recommended safe pressure in prevention of the air leak...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{safe use}} of cuffed {{tracheal}} tubes for children necessitates a cuff pressure limitation at 20 - 25 cmH 2 O. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the reliability and benefit of a new cuff pressure release valve (opening pressure 20 cmH 2 O) for children intubated with a cuffed tracheal tube. METHODS: In a prospective, observational trial cuff pressure was recorded in paediatric and adolescent patients intubated with a cuffed tracheal tube during sevoflurane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. The cuff pressure release valve was interposed between the cuff manometer and the pilot balloon. In 25 patients measurements were started at the initial opening pressure (group A) and in a further 25 patients measurements were started at the minimal <b>sealing</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure (group B). RESULTS: A total of 50 patients, aged from 0. 4 to 17. 8 years (median 7. 4 years) were enrolled in the study. The opening pressure measured (group A) was 19. 7 +/- 0. 8 cmH(2) O and the cuff sealing pressure (group B) was 11. 7 +/- 2. 9 cmH 2 O (range 6 - 16 cmH 2 O). Mean cuff pressure values in group A were 20. 4 +/- 1. 6 cmH 2 O and 16. 5 +/- 3. 3 cmH 2 O in group B. In one patient (group A) the cuff pressure exceeded 25 cmH 2 O and was manually decreased to 20 cmH 2 O. In total, 24 filling procedures (group A 14; group B 10) were required during 103. 1 h of investigation because of cuff pressure drop and audible air leakage, mainly caused by cuff pressure increases and consequent releases during patient positioning. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the tested cuff pressure release valve was useful and reliable to limit cuff pressure in tracheal intubated children and adolescents within an acceptable pressure range...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Ideally endotracheal tubes (ETT) should {{protect the}} airways without causing {{pressure}} induced tissue damage. Traditionally, {{the addition of}} a tracheal cuff was heralded as seal against aspiration. This type of ETT utilized a low volume high pressure cuff which caused tracheal damage such as stenosis and malacia. The next development in ETT design was the high volume low pressure cuffs intended to protect the airways while reducing tissue damage. Although reducing damage, the new cuff did not reliably protect the airways. Microaspiration still remains a serious complication of intubation. A taper shaped cuff design was recently introduced to prevent microaspiration without causing tracheal damage. Concerns were raised regarding the contact area and the resultant pressure against the tracheal wall of the taper shaped cuff. Another innovation introduced to prevent microaspiration is subglottic suction present in the tube design. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate <b>cuff</b> <b>seal</b> performance, <b>cuff</b> safety and intrinsic suction efficiency of current commercially available ETT. Methods: Three separate studies evaluated these areas of interest. <b>Cuff</b> <b>seal</b> performance was evaluated using an approved in vitro test fixture mimicking the human trachea. We investigated the <b>cuff</b> <b>seal</b> performance of 7 endotracheal tubes with different cuff designs and identical tracheal tube size using water as the medium. Three different size tubes from 3 different manufacturers were tested to determine subglottic suction efficiency and <b>cuff</b> <b>sealing</b> performance using the same in vitro test fixture. In a similar fixture a pressure sensitive array was mounted to compare the surface pressure of a standard barrel shaped cuff to the taper shaped cuff. The array design allowed for the pressure profile of the cuff to be mapped where it contacted the cylinder wall. In all tests the cuff pressures were maintained at 25 cm H 2 O according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Results: The sealing performance varied between the tube manufacturers with TaperGuard (TG) showing the lowest leak at. 6 g/ 5 minutes and Kimberly Clark Micro cuff (KCmc) with the highest 59. 2 g/ 5 minutes. In terms of suction efficiency Teleflex ISIS (ISIS) had the best suction performance (. 2 - 5. 3 ml/sec) at all viscosities and Portex (SACETT) (. 3 - 2. 9 ml/min) was the lowest. When comparing surface force the taper shaped cuff was less compared to the barrel shaped cuff. Conclusions: Performance in all areas tested ETTs varied considerably in terms of sealing and suction efficiency. However, the taper shaped cuff demonstrated the least surface pressure and best sealin...|$|R

40|$|Background Cyclic {{redistribution}} of air within the cuff during respiratory pressure changes creates a self-sealing mechanism which allows tracheal sealing, despite tracheal airway pressure being above baseline cuff inflation pressure. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of continuous automated cuff pressure regulation on tracheal sealing during cyclic respiratory pressure changes. Methods In vitro tracheal sealing was studied in four different high volume-low pressure (HVLP) tracheal tube cuffs size internal diameter 8. 0 and 5. 0 mm in combination with a conventional pressure manometer and two different automated pressure controllers (VBM Cuff Controller; Cuff Pressure Control Tracoe™). Experiments were performed at 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm H 2 O cuff pressure during intermittent positive pressure ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures of 20 and 25 cm H 2 O. Air leakage was assessed spirometrically. Experiments were performed four times with each tube brand and size with two exemplars of each of the three cuff pressure controllers. Results Owing to immediate cuff pressure correction, tracheal <b>sealing</b> at <b>cuff</b> pressure below inspiratory pressure was reduced in most of the tracheal tube cuffs, except in those with reduced sealing characteristics when using the Pressure Control Tracoe™ compared with the conventional pressure manometer and the VBM <b>Cuff</b> Controller.

40|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{in children}} is usually performed utilizing uncuffed endotracheal tubes for conduct of anesthesia {{as well as}} for prolonged ventilation in critical care units. However, uncuffed tubes may require multiple changes to avoid excessive air leak, with subsequent environmental pollution making the technique uneconomical. In addition, monitoring of ventilatory parameters, exhaled volumes, and end-expiratory gases may be unreliable. All these problems can be avoided by use of cuffed endotracheal tubes. Besides, cuffed endotracheal tubes may be of advantage in special situations like laparoscopic surgery and in surgical conditions at risk of aspiration.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{assessing}} the efficacy of filling a 50 % mixture of nitrous oxide : oxygen (50 %N 2 O:O 2) in the endotracheal tube cuff to provide stable cuff pressures during general anaesthesia with 67 %N 2 O. The endotracheal tube cuff pressures with air (control) as the inflating agent in the tubes {{were found to have}} a total mean pressure of 62. 60 ± 12. 33 {{at the end of one}} hour of general anaesthesia. When comparing the endotracheal tube cuff pressures in the Mallinckrodt tubes with that of the Portex tubes, with air as the inflating agent, the Portex tubes showed a significantly lower cuff pressures at the end of one hour. The endotracheal tube cuff pressures with 50 %N 2 O:O 2 as the inflating agent showed a total mean pressure of 27. 63 ± 3. 221 at the end of one hour of general anaesthesia. This indicates that inflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tubes with a 50 %N 2 O:O 2 rather than air maintains a stable intra cuff pressure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyperinflation of {{laryngeal}} mask airway (LMA) cuffs may be harmful {{because of the}} exertion of high pressures on pharyngeal and laryngeal structures. Although cuff manometers {{may be used to}} monitor cuff pressure, their use is not routine in many institutions and clinical endpoints are used instead. Furthermore, it is common clinical practice to add air to the cuff in the presence of an air leak to obtain a better seal. METHODS: In a prospective audit, the authors assessed air leakage around pediatric sized LMAs (n = 200) following inflation guided by common clinical endpoints (slight outward movement of the LMA) and then following adjustment of the cuff pressure to the recommended pressure range (120 cmH(2) O (size 1) and the median leakage around the cuff ranged from 0. 66 to 1. 07 ml x kg(- 1). Following cuff pressure adjustment according to the recommended pressure range (> 60 cmH(2) O), the leakage decreased significantly to 0. 51 - 0. 79 ml x kg(- 1) (P = 0. 002 for size 1, P > 0. 001 for size 1. 5 - 3). CONCLUSION: The use of clinical endpoints to inflate LMA cuffs is not only associated with significant hyperinflation in the majority of patients but also with an increased leakage around the LMA cuff when compared with adjusted LMA cuff pressures. Therefore, cuff manometers should routinely be used not only to avoid unnecessary hyperinflation but also to improve <b>cuff</b> <b>sealing</b> of LMA in children...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The ProSeal™ {{laryngeal}} mask airway (PLMA) has advantages of providing better <b>cuff</b> <b>seal</b> {{and the presence}} of a gastric drain tube. The manufacturer recommends actual body weight (ABW) for size selection. Pharyngeal area reduces with increase in body mass index (BMI); hence, in overweight patients, PLMA selected on ABW may not fit well. We hypothesised that the ideal body weight (IBW) would be more appropriate in size selection of PLMA. Methods: This randomised, single-blind study included 124 patients of 20 – 60 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I–II, with BMI> 25. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. In Group ABW, PLMA was selected based on ABW (62 patients) and in Group IBW, PLMA was selected based on IBW (62 patients). The primary outcome was the first-attempt insertion success rate. Oropharyngeal air leaks, gastric air leaks, drain tube air leaks, insertion difficulty scores and postoperative complications were assessed. Fibre-optic view (Grade I–IV) was assessed for proper placement by a blinded assessor. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: First-attempt insertion success rate and overall insertion success rates were similar in both the groups. Group IBW patients had significantly less resistance during insertion, lower peak airway pressures, successful nasogastric tube insertions, better fibre-optic views and less post-operative complications. Oropharyngeal leak pressure and instrumentation used for insertion were comparable. Conclusion: IBW is preferable for the size selection of the PLMA in overweight and obese patients compared to the ABW...|$|R
