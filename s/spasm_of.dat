5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the <b>spasm</b> <b>of</b> blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a <b>spasm</b> <b>of</b> the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E

25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has <b>spasm</b> <b>of</b> the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The focal {{dystonia}} benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) affects {{as many as}} 40, 000 {{individuals in}} the United States. This dystonia is characterized by trigeminal hyperexcitability, photophobia, and most disabling of the symptoms, involuntary <b>spasms</b> <b>of</b> lid closure that can produce functional blindness. Like many focal dystonias, BEB appears to develop from the interaction between a predisposing condition and an environmental trigger. The primary treatment for blepharospasm is to weaken the eyelid-closing orbicularis oculi muscle to reduce lid spasms. There are several animal models of blepharospasm that recreate the <b>spasms</b> <b>of</b> lid closure in order to investigate pharmacological treatments to prevent <b>spasms</b> <b>of</b> lid closure. One animal model attempts to mimic the predisposing condition and environmental trigger {{that give rise to}} BEB. This model indicates that abnormal interactions among trigeminal blink circuits, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum are the neural basis for BEB...|$|R

500|$|After the 1998 election, Janmaat became {{increasingly}} worried by legal pressure, {{believing that the}} Centre Democrats could become the government's next target after CP'86 was officially banned in 1998. He founded the [...] "Conservative Democrats" [...] as a potential successor party {{in the event that}} the Centre Democrats was proscribed. The new party contested the 1999 European elections as the Lijstverbinding Centrumdemocraten/Conservatieve Democraten, a supposed two-party cooperation, where the two names in reality represented the same party. It won only 0.5% of the vote in the election, a showing widely seen as the last <b>spasm</b> <b>of</b> a dying party. Janmaat's increasing physical exhaustion only served to exacerbate the situation. Nonetheless, with a new political climate following the September 11 attacks and the rise of Pim Fortuyn, Janmaat sought political rehabilitation in his final years. The reason was that his earlier criminal convictions arose from stating things that had now become accepted.|$|E
500|$|David Denby of The New Yorker {{asserted}} that the austere, but captivating installment presented a [...] "glancing, chilled view" [...] of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal. To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig, Fincher captures the [...] "menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape" [...] by carefully approaching its most gruesome features. Puig noted a surfeit of [...] "stylistic flourishes" [...] and [...] "intriguing" [...] changes in the narrative, compared to the original film. In his three-and-a-half star review, Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so-called [...] "paradoxical position" [...] that was both [...] "immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the [...] "fabulously sinister entertainment" [...] surpassed the original film [...] "in every way". The film took two-and-a-half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers, who concluded: [...] "Fincher's Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, admired the moments of [...] "brilliantly orchestrated" [...] anxiety and confusion, but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the [...] "lumbering proceduralism" [...] that he saw in its literary counterpart, as evident with the [...] "long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere". The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth's cinematography, which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film's darkness; [...] "Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular <b>spasm</b> <b>of</b> action involving a backpack." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility, the movie was [...] "technically superb" [...] and [...] "superbly acted". In contrast, Kyle Smith of New York Post censured the film, calling it [...] "rubbish" [...] and further commenting that it [...] "demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting, badly written, psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story {{so long as you}} allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis." ...|$|E
