Steve Dunn also became a successful horse trainer, winning two World Grand Championships, the first before his father won one. Steve Dunn's winning horses were Motown Magic in 1989, and Out On Parole in 2002. Bud and Steve Dunn remain the only father and son to win World Grand Championships within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. When Bud won his first World Grand Championship in 1992, three years after his son's first, <b>Steve</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I think him winning meant {{more to me than}} when I won it." [...] Bud Dunn said of his partnership with Steve, [...] "I always wanted him to work out here. But ain't many fathers and sons ever got along that long." ...|$|E

[...] The story that Steve told me {{was that it would}} have meant touring and Ronnie just wasn't up to it. It would have meant pretty much carrying him everywhere, no tour, no album. That's why the Mijits never came out at that point in time. It's been gathering dust for ages" [...] – Jim Leverton.|$|E

60|$|Steve's {{mother was}} an old lady who in her day had been the best washerwoman on Cherry Hill. She was, moreover, {{completely}} lacking in all the qualities which go {{to make up the}} patroness of sport. Steve had been injudicious enough to pay her a visit the day after his celebrated unpleasantness with that rugged warrior, Pat O'Flaherty (ne Smith), and, though he had knocked Pat out midway through the second round, he bore away from the arena a black eye of such a startling richness that old Mrs. Dingle had refused to be comforted until he had promised never to enter the ring again. Which, as <b>Steve</b> <b>said,</b> had come pretty hard, he being a man who would rather be a water-bucket in a ring than a president outside it.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>Steve</b> <b>said,</b> {{this gentleman}} had been [...] "hard hit" [...] and still hovered mothlike about the {{forbidden}} light.

The girl liked him, {{and he was the}} suitor of whom she had spoken so respectfully to Dr. Alec because he had no need of the heiress and had sincerely loved Rose. He had been away, and she hoped had gotten over his disappointment as happily as the rest, but now when he saw her, and came hurrying up so hungry for a word, she felt that he had not forgotten and was too kind to chill him with the bow which plainly says [...] "Don't stop." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Boston, Steve Jobs gave {{a status}} report on Apple Inc. Steve was the Chairman and CEO of Pixar. Steve {{addressed}} {{some of the}} comments that had been made about Apple: [...] "Apple has become irrelevant", [...] "Apple can't execute anything", and [...] "Apple's culture is anarchy; you can't manage it". Apple's sales were $11.1 billion in 1995, $9.5 billion in 1996, and $7 billion in 1997. Steve stated the falling sales were the fundamental problem. The beginning steps that Apple was going to take were: Board of Directors, Focus on Relevance, Invest in Core Assets, Meaningful Partnerships, and New Product Paradigm. Steve announced the new Board of Directors: Ed Woolard, Chairman and former CEO of DuPont; Gareth Chang, President of Hughes International; Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle Corporation; Jerry York (businessman), former CFO of IBM and Chrysler; William Campbell (business executive), CEO of Intuit, and Steve Jobs himself. Steve addressed their market focus. Apple was the dominant market leader for creative professionals. 80% of all computers used in advertising, graphic design, prepress, and printing were Apple computers. 64% of internet websites were created on a Macintosh. Apple was the largest education company in the world. Apple sold 60% of all computers in education. They sold over $2 billion in annual revenues. <b>Steve</b> <b>said</b> the Apple's core assets were the Apple brand and Mac OS. <b>Steve</b> <b>said</b> the Mac OS was still the best thing in the world. It had over 20 million active users, thousands of developers, and was a $1.5 billion software industry built around it. <b>Steve</b> <b>said</b> Apple is about the Mac OS. <b>Steve</b> <b>said</b> they released Mac OS 8 two weeks prior and had already sold 1,200,000 copies. Steve announced the partnership with Microsoft. Apple and Microsoft agreed to a patent cross license for existing patents and patents issued within the next five years. Microsoft made a five-year commitment to release Microsoft Office on the Mac. Microsoft would release the same number of major releases as on Windows. Apple decided Internet Explorer for Mac would be the default browser on Macintosh. Apple would be collaborating with Microsoft on Java (programming language) compatibility. Microsoft made a $150 million investment in Apple stock purchased at market price and agreed not to sell it for at least three years. Steve introduced Bill Gates via satellite.|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea for}} a BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) {{competition}} originated in 1993 when two Texas Instruments (TI) engineers, Ted Mahler and Steve Marum, were serving as guides for Engineering Day at their company site in Sherman.

50|$|At the Underworld Christmas party Karen {{started to}} have stomach pains {{and it was}} later {{confirmed}} that she had miscarried. This sent Karen over the edge, and when she discovered that Liz had told Tracy about her miscarriage she was furious. The two women ended up fighting {{on the roof of}} Underworld. The next day, Steve told Karen that he had had enough of her. Karen pleaded with Steve to give her another chance but <b>Steve</b> <b>said</b> that he had given her too many chances already and ordered her to leave. Heartbroken, Karen left the Street on Boxing Day 2004.|$|E
50|$|Kerry {{was less}} than pleased with her {{performance}} on stage and had to wait till that night {{to see if she}} made it into the top 8 in the finale round. She said that the main reason she didn't do so well on stage was due to her cramping and that she didn't do her poses quick enough. That night, during the announcing of the finalists, she did not advance to the final round. <b>Steve</b> <b>said</b> that if a female bodybuilder feels down about how they placed in a competition, that they should remember they are in remarkable condition compared to most women.|$|E

Steve has been involved in helping end the vendetta including assisting in faking Stefano's death, but when Andre killed Benjy, Steve lost control. He kidnapped Stefano and demanded Andre bring Roman Brady—who Andre had kidnapped—to the television stations where he was holding Stefano. Andre did as <b>Steve</b> <b>said</b> and released Roman. Realizing Steve was out of his mind with grief, Stefano dropped all charges against Steve for the kidnapping, doing so to honor Benjy's memory.|$|E

5000|$|Immediate {{reception}} was overwhelmingly positive. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 5 (out of 5) {{and stated that}} [...] "This story was amazing and filled with sadness. I cannot imagine a more compelling episode. The writing, the dialogue, the incredible performances all combined to a bring heartbreaking masterpiece to the small screen. I can't wait to see {{the second part of}} this story." [...] Steve Marsi, also from TV Fanatic, called the episode [...] "powerful and unexpected" [...] and said in a round table, [...] "Ziva screaming 'Abba' and bawling was enough to give anyone the chills, as was Gibbs standing stone-faced and ignoring the SecNav's calls. These scenes are enhanced by the fact that we're so invested in these characters after 10 seasons...Superb TV entertainment, but also emblematic of the uncertain times we live in." [...] Eric Hochberger added, [...] "Sometimes, I wish they wouldn't do this. Jackie in particular felt unnecessary to kill off. However, as <b>Steve</b> <b>said,</b> there's no denying the collective brilliance of the cast and writers last night and in similar episodes. So, I guess we have to trust them and see where they take this next week and beyond." ...|$|E
