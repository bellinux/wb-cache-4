Designed research of synthetic rope in logging is needed to determine when synthetic rope is a suitable replacement for steel Vllfe rope. replace In our trials, we assessed static line applications (guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines) and running line applications for yarding and ground-based logging systems. Our running line applications using synthetic rope included two skidder / crawler tractor winching trials, a Boman Mark IV carriage trial, and a Koller K 300 mainline trial. Static line applications such as guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines are acceptable replacements of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> with synthetic rope. Loggers were more likely to try additional applications once they used synthetic rope as tree straps and were confident of its strength. Cost was an initial drawback for most logging contractors. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} damage, replacement, and wear criteria for synthetic rope in logging applications. Running line applications showed positive results in the skidder / crawler winching trials with faster cycle times and increased efficiencies for using synthetic rope. The Koller K 300 mainline trials also produced positive results as a running line. The Boman Mark IV internal drum carriage trial showed no significant differences between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> and synthetic rope. We believe designed research is necessary to evaluate carriage applications with synthetic rope. Future studies for static line applications should include guyline taglines, skyline taglines, haywire (rigging line) replacement, and various other applications. Putting synthetic rope into the hands of users will help identify valuable applications where synthetic rope has merit. Future studies for running lines should focus on designed trials to adequately observe the effects of synthetic rope in specific applications such as side-hill lateral yarding, uphill lateral pulling in winching trials, and other difficult logging conditions. Preliminary results show synthetic rope is a good candidate for the replacement of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> in selected logging applications.

Typical systems consist of several <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> laid across the aircraft landing area, designed to be caught by an aircraft's tailhook. During a normal arrestment, the tailhook engages the wire and the aircraft's kinetic energy is transferred to hydraulic damping systems attached below the carrier deck.

These barricade and barrier systems are only used for emergency arrestments for aircraft without operable tailhooks.|$|E
50|$|The {{large volume}} of coffee {{shipments}} {{and the growth of}} the cities in the São Paulo region required more transport capacity. Therefore, construction of a second incline system started in 1895. The new line runs parallel to the already existing one in about two miles distance. It had five sections using continuous <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> which were moved by stationary 1,000 hp steam engines. Each section was about 2000 m long and had a grade of 8%. Two to three wagons have been coupled to the rope with the help of small locomotives fitted with grip engaging with the cable. These locomotives were also able to handle the wagons in the terminal station and between the sections, so that the operation of the incline system was facilitated. The locomotives have been called Locobreque (transl.: Locomotive Brake). In case the weight of the wagons to be lifted was too heavy compared to the wagons lowered at the same time, tank cars filled with water where used to counterbalance the system. The incline system was used in revenue service till 1982.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects and kink-wave propagation in <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> Compared to the two dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> the proposed model regards <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The dynamical characteristics of the <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 <b>Steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> has several disadvantages: its {{strength to weight}} ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope.</b> The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope,</b> but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware end connections, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and Y-splice.
