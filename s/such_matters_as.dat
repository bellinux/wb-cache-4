5|$|Shakespeare {{was born}} and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, {{with whom he had}} three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a {{successful}} career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 around 1613, he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.|$|E
5|$|Muslims of Bombay elected Jinnah, though then {{absent in}} London, as their {{representative}} to the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934. The British Parliament's Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces, with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> foreign policy, defence, {{and much of the}} budget. Full power remained {{in the hands of the}} Viceroy, however, who could dissolve legislatures and rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress was much better prepared for the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed to win a majority even of the Muslim seats in any of the provinces where members of that faith held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.|$|E

5|$|The Irish Football Association (IFA) was {{originally}} the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with Cliftonville F.C. in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially {{in its first}} decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast, Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association {{is known as the}} Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations' associations, the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against Italy). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{position}} {{was held by}} a number of authorities to hinge on <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> the statute De natis ultra mare of Edward III, and the will of Henry VIII.

25|$|During {{his public}} career, John C. West avoided racial animosities, denounced the KKK in 1958, and {{supported}} {{all of the}} Democratic presidential nominees.

West was primarily identified with <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> industrial recruitment, health, education, and the environment.

He served in the Senate from 1869 to 1875 and again from 1879 to 1881.

25|$|Public finance is {{the field}} of {{economics}} that deals with budgeting the revenues and expenditures of a public sector entity, usually government. The subject addresses <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> tax incidence (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on economic efficiency and income distribution {{of different kinds of}} spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of public choice theory, models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.|$|E

During the Great Depression, the world was awash with oil and greater output from Iraq would simply have driven the price down to even lower levels. Delaying tactics were employed not only in actual drilling and development, but also in conducting negotiations on <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> pipeline rights-of-way.|$|E
25|$|Argentina is a {{federation}} of 23 provinces {{and the federal}} capital of Buenos Aires. During the 19th century there was a bitter struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, and there {{has long been an}} element of tension regarding the division of powers between the central government and provincial bodies. The federal government retains control over <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> the regulation of commerce, customs collections, currency, civil or commercial codes, or the appointment of foreign agents.

Children are commonly teased on <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> their appearance, weight, behaviour, abilities, and clothing. This kind of teasing is often hurtful, even when the teaser believes he or she is being playful. One may also tease an animal. Some animals, such as dogs and cats, may recognise this as play; but in humans, teasing can become hurtful and take the form of bullying and abuse.|$|E

It prepares an annual Economic and Budget Outlook with a mid-year update and writes An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for the Senate's Appropriations Committee.

25|$|The Book of the Eparch, {{which dates}} to the 10th century, gives a {{detailed}} picture of the city's commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated <b>such</b> <b>matters</b> <b>as</b> production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one.
