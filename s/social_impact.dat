Software for life cycle assessment (LCA) is becoming increasingly effective in evaluating the potential environmental and resource impacts of design and supply chain decisions. As more decisionmakers commit to sustainability, there is increasing pressure to incorporate economic and social considerations into LCA. In addition, {{it may be necessary to}} incorporate <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> to ensure LCA is relevant with respect to developing countries. The degree to which <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> have been included in LCA is briefly reviewed and metrics associated with <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> are discussed.

40|$|Protected {{areas are}} the most widely applied policy tool for {{biodiversity}} conservation. However, effective management of protected areas is often obstructed by conflicts mainly associated with the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> imposed on local communities and other users by their establishment. Despite {{the importance of these}} <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> they remain significantly under-researched. There is now an increasing need to incorporate <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> in decision making processes by providing accurate estimations and develop ways to forecast their change in the future. Considering the increase of studies identifying this need, the present paper aims to indicate three main directions that will assist in designing effective tools for measuring and most importantly understanding social impacts: a) perceptions on <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of individuals who are directly affected by protected areas need to be incorporated in management evaluation techniques in a meaningful and accurate way and be combined with objective measurements of impact; b) understanding the factors determining the actual and perceived levels of <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> is a key step for the design of effective management frameworks of protected areas and c) <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> should not be seen as static concepts but should be seen as a dynamic and long-term factor which needs to be incorporated in decision-making processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify how degrees of contact derived from frequency of communication with tourists influence the local perceptions towards <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of tourism. This research also examines the local’s support for additional tourism development or support for restrictions on tourism development in Kampung Benuk Homestay (KBH), Kuching. Two theoretical frameworks, namely Social Exchange Theory and Model of Resident Tourism Perceptions and Attitudes were adapted in this research. A qualitative method was employed in which a semi-structured interview was conducted face-to-face with 12 respondents. Data from these interviews were analysed manually using Microsoft Word 2010. From the findings, three categories of respondent: ‘High Contact’ (HC), ‘Medium Contact’ (MC), and ‘Low Contact’ (LC), showed significantly different perceptions towards <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of homestay programme. The findings indicated that the positive or negative perceptions towards <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> influence the local’s support for additional tourism development or support for restrictions on tourism development. The HC respondents were positive towards <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> and supported additional tourism development. In contrast, the MC respondents perceived <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> negatively, but agreed to support additional tourism development. The LC respondents had positive perceptions towards <b>social</b> <b>impacts,</b> but were both supportive for additional tourism development and for restrictions on tourism development. The research provides practical implications for local government and stakeholders for planning and policy in the community-based homestay programme in Sarawak. The theoretical implication highlights the need for heterogeneous respondents in the future homestay programme studies on perceptions towards <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of tourism...|$|R

5|$|The {{closure of}} the border had a {{substantial}} economic and <b>social</b> <b>impact</b> on both halves of Germany. Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24secondary lines, 23autobahns or national roads, 140regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise interrupted. The tightest level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open. When {{relations between the two}} states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for economic assistance. Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although packages and letters were routinely opened and telephone calls were monitored by the East German secret police.|$|E

40|$|No {{commonly}} used framework {{exists in the}} scholarly study of the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of dams. This hinders comparisons of analyses and thus the accumulation of knowledge. The aim {{of this paper is}} to unify scholarly understanding of dams' <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> via the analysis and aggregation of the various frameworks currently used in the scholarly literature. For this purpose, we have systematically analyzed and aggregated 27 frameworks employed by academics analyzing dams' <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> (found in a set of 217 articles). A key finding of the analysis is that currently used frameworks are often not specific to dams and thus omit key impacts associated with them. The result of our analysis and aggregation is a new framework for scholarly analysis (which we call ‘matrix framework’) specifically on dams' <b>social</b> <b>impacts,</b> with space, time and value as its key dimensions as well as infrastructure, community and livelihood as its key components. Building on the scholarly understanding of this topic enables us to conceptualize the inherently complex and multidimensional issues of dams' <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> in a holistic manner. If commonly employed in academia (and possibly in practice), this framework would enable more transparent assessment and comparison of projects...|$|R

5|$|Zwingli's {{theological}} stance {{was gradually}} revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption {{and in the}} process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the veneration of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of excommunication. His attack on the claim that tithing was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and <b>social</b> <b>impact.</b> This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the sole basis of his teachings was Scripture.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a <b>social</b> <b>impact</b> assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Nuremberg Laws had a {{crippling}} economic and <b>social</b> <b>impact</b> on the Jewish community. Persons convicted {{of violating the}} marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed {{due to lack of}} customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it was almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the Madagascar Plan proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Tourism)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of arts festivals with reference to the KKNK and to make a comparison between the different cultures (white and coloured). This goal was achieved by firstly conceptualising culture. Secondly, a literature study was conducted in order to examine the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of events. Thirdly the results of the empirical research were discussed, and lastly conclusions were drawn from the research and recommendations were made with regard to the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> of events, as well as further research. From the literature, <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> were defined as the changes in the norms and values of society that are more apparent in the short-term. It was noted that when tourists vacate to a specific destination, visible impacts are notices. Events can, however, provide employment opportunities, promote international peace and pride, as well as promote educational and cultural experiences. It can also lead to increased levels of irritation, crime, drug and alcohol abuse and cultural change. These positive and negative impacts were measured by means of a questionnaire, as adapted from Fredline. The objective of the questionnaire is therefore to measure whether the community is positive or negative towards the festival, and whether there were any differences in the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> when comparing the results of the white and coloured communities. The questionnaire was distributed amongst the community members of Oudtshoorn, based on a stratified sampling method, followed by a random sampling method. A total of 258 questionnaires were completed, 110 from the white community and 148 from the coloured community. Two factor analyses were performed to determine the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> factors in order to determine differences in the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> on the white community and the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> on the coloured community. The first analysis resulted in eight factors and accounted for 58. 1 % of the total variance and was labelled as: community issues, negative <b>impacts,</b> everyday living, <b>social</b> opportunities, economic <b>impacts,</b> community rights, visitors and environmental impacts. The second analysis resulted in four factors that accounted for 59. 54 % of the total variance and were labelled according to similar characteristics which included: development opportunities, community involvement, motivational factors and social risks. Means and standards deviations had been determined, after which the affected sizes were determined to explore the differences between the <b>social</b> <b>impacts</b> on the white community and on the coloured community on the dimensions of the various factors as determined in the factor analysis. It is clear that there is a small affect (0. 2 - 0. 4) on the two communities. Master...|$|R
5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the <b>social</b> <b>impact</b> of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E
