The specimens of C. hamatus showed full reproductive activity but, the <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle</b> being over, only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells {{were present in the}} seminiferous tubules whereas the lumina were full of sperm. By contrast, the specimens of T. bernacchii were in the stage of spermatogenetical recrudescence, having not yet entered the reproductive period. In this species, the seminiferous tubules were devoid of lumen and full of spermatogonial cysts, showing some mitoses. Many tubules contained cysts of meiotic spermatocytes I and, in one case only, small cysts of spermatocytes II. The ®nal stages of spermatogenesis were lacking, presumably occurring later, in autumn/winter. The immunocyto-chemical tests aimed at identifying bFGF and FGFR 1 revealed a positive reaction both in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia in the C. hamatus specimens, indicating that this species was ready to start a new spermatoge-netic cycle. The weak reaction in the specimens of T. bernacchii suggests that, in this species, the stage of cell division was over and that of meiosis and di 8 ̆ 0 eren- tiation was starting.

40|$|During {{the annual}} <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle</b> of Mabuya carinata, {{there was a}} well-marked {{seasonal}} lipid cycle and steroidogenic activity in the testis. In the spermatogenetically active testis (Oct. -Dec.), the lipid was sparse and the activities of Î� 5 - 3 Î²- and 17 Î²-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenases were high in the Leydig cells. During the postnuptial testicular regression (Jan. -May), there was a slow buildup of cholesterol-pos. lipids in the testis along with decreased enzyme activities. In the fully regressed testis (June-July), the Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules were highly lipoidal and strongly cholesterol pos. and the steroidogenic enzymes were hardly demonstrable. During testicular recrudescence (late Aug. -Sept.), there was a marked lipid depletion when the seminiferous tubules were cleared of their lipids and th Leydig cells had shed excess lipids and cholesterol reaction weakened suggesting rapid mobilization. Simultaneously there was a sharp rise {{in the activities of}} the steroidogenic enzymes indicating renewed steroidogenic activity of the interstitial Leydig cells. The seasonal lipid cycle was inversely related to steroidogenic activity in the testis of M. carinata. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
30|$|During the {{reproductive}} season of D. melanostictus, adult nonreproductive females were not found, suggesting that all mature females produce only one clutch annually. Results {{of the analysis}} of D. melanostictus females collected from different localities of the Bangalore agglomeration showed a smaller oocyte volume and fewer oocytes than our results (Jørgensen et al. 1986). These differences {{may have been due}} to different allocation strategies of female reproductive resources among localities. Although females of D. melanostictus reproduce seasonally, the presence of developed secondary sexual characteristics (nuptial spines and hypertrophied forearms) and histological observations of the testes and vas deferens showed that there is no continuous spermiogenesis or spermiation, suggesting that males of this population are not capable of courtship and mating throughout the year.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} observed reproductive dysfunction in male fishes reared in captivity is reduction in sperm volume and quality. The Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus (Osteichthyes: Scombridae) {{is one of}} the few large pelagic and migratory marine fishes maintained in captivity with the purpose of establishing breeding populations to support an aquaculture industry. The objectives of the present study were to compare male germ cell proliferation and apoptosis between wild and captive individuals at two different phases of the <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle,</b> and to evaluate sperm motility characteristics of captive individuals. Histological observations were performed to analyze testicular activity, and germ cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated through the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated d’UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method,respectively. Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) was used to evaluate sperm motility. Results showed that germ cell proliferation was delayed and germ cell apoptosis increased in captive animals relative to wild individuals. Sperm motility of samples obtained from captive individuals was anomalous, both in terms of motility duration and swimming efficiency. Thus it appears that rearing in captivity impairs male reproductive function through, at least, changes in germ cell roliferation and apoptosis...|$|E

Leydig cells displayed changes of lectin-binding sites during annual cycle, and during the abortive spermatogenesis period lacked N-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans. Sertoli cells stained by Con A, WGA, RCA 120, BS I-B 4, showed, except in July, O-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans. Spermatogonia bound Con A and WGA. Spermatocytes bound also BS I-B 4, SBA, UEA I, and during spring spermatogenesis, revealed O-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans. The acrosomes of spermatids were also stained by RCA 120 and PNA, whereas the heads of spermatozoa did not bind SBA and PNA. During the abortive spermatogenic period, the acrosomes showed O-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans and N-linked glycans terminating in beta-galactosyl residues. During the reproductive period, the acrosomes of spermatozoa expressed O- and N-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans and beta-galactosyl terminal residues on O- and N-linked glycans.

40|$|Plasma {{levels of}} {{testosterone}} (T), thyroxine (T 4) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured {{in a field}} population of the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, in Michigan. All three hormones showed pronounced seasonality; plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) remained nondetectable. Plasma T and FSH concentrationswere highly correlated and exhibited biphasic cycles with peaks in spring and fall, whereas T 4 showed a single peak in summer, coincident with the nadir in T. Hormone levels were minimal {{on the day that}} animals emerged from hibernation at the end of March; T and FSH then increased rapidly (in ca. 1 week after emergence) to a transient peak that persisted for onlyca. 2 weeks. Plasma T and FSH rose again in September before the onset of hibernation and shortly after the late summer peak in spermatogenetic recrudescence. Plasma T 4 increased more gradually after emergence in spring and did not peak for 1 - 2 months, coincident with the nadir in T. The profile in plasma FSH is consistent with the view that this gonadotropin may regulate androgen secretion but it did not show the expected relationship to the <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Separate studies indicated that the turtles are sensitive to capture and handling; hormone levels (especially androgen) fall precipitously within a day of capture.

40|$|Inhibin is a glycoproteic hormone mostly {{produced}} by the gonads. Through a feedback at the pituitary level, it selectively inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone. In mammals, inhibin has been found also in some extragonadal tissues such as placenta, pituitary, adrenal, spleen, kidney, brain and spinal cord. At present, no information is available {{about the existence of}} inhibin in reptiles. The aim of the present work is to localise, through immunocytochemical methods, the sites of inhibin production in male lizards during the main phases of the reproductive cycle: the culmination phase (April-June), the early regressive phase (early July), the maximal regressive phase (August) and the winter stasis (January). In the testis, immunostaining is mainly localised in the Leydig cells during the early regressive phase, while it is observed in the Sertoli cells during the maximal regressive phase. In the epididymis, the immunostaining is present only during the reproductive period at the level of secreting cells and inside its ducts. In the adrenal gland, after immunostaining, both chromaffin and steroidogenetic tissues are inhibin-positive during the whole <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle,</b> though with variable intensity throughout the year: cross-reaction appears more evident from January to April (winter stasis and culmination phase) and weaker in June.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} variations of chiasma frequency and distribution {{have been studied}} in the lizard: Podareis sicula. In this species, as in Phyllodactylus (King & Hayman, Chromosoma 69 : 131 – 154, 1978), chiasma frequencies vary following a definite annual cycle, and clearly different trends are shown by interstitial and terminal chiasmata. A comparison between these seasonal chiasma frequency variations and those of environmental temperature shows {{the existence of a}} clear correlation between these two parameters. However, this correlation is different in the two types of chiasmata, and may be different within the same type of chiasma depending on the period of the year. A more significant correlation is observed between chiasma cycles and annual variations of the haematic levels of sexual steroid hormones. In particular we observe a highly significant correlation between interstitial chiasma frequencies and testosterone concentration. A less precise correlation between terminal chiasma frequencies and estradiol concentration is also observed. In Podarcis, as in Phyllodactylus, the sperm that will be used for fertilization derive from the spermatocytes showing the highest rate of interstitial chiasmata. This supports the hypothesis that the cyclic variations in interstitial chiasma frequencies represent a mechanism to ensure an adequate level of variability in a given population. The above mentioned correlation between chiasma frequencies and steroia hormone concentrations suggests that the seasonal chiasma cycles are controlled by the same environmental and hormonal factors regulating the <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{scleractinian coral}} Plesiastrea versipora occurs {{throughout}} most of the IndoPacific; however, the species is only abundant in temperate regions, including Sydney Harbour, in New South Wales, Australia, where it can be the dominant sessile organism over small spatial scales. Population genetics indicates that the Sydney Harbour population is highly isolated, suggesting long-term persistence will depend upon on the local production of recruits. To determine the potential role of sexual reproduction in population persistence, we examined a number of features of the reproductive biology of P. versipora for the first time, including the sexual system, the length of the gametogenetic cycles and size-specific fecundity. P. versipora was gonochoric, supporting recent molecular work removing the species from the Family Merulinidae, in which the species are exclusively hermaphroditic. The oogenic cycle was between 13 and 14 mo and the <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle</b> between 7 and 8 mo, with broadcast spawning inferred to occur in either January or February. Colony sex was strongly influenced by colony size: the probability of being male increased with colony area. The longer oogenic cycle suggests that females are investing energy in reproduction rather than growth, and consequently, males are on average larger for a given age. Alternatively, colonies may change sex from female to male as they grow. In contrast, per polyp fecundity did not vary with colony size. We conclude that the Sydney Harbour population is reproductively active and therefore has the potential to maintain current levels of abundance even without an external supply of propagules. 9 page(s...|$|E

The germ cell dynamics and gonadosomatic index (IG) were monitored. Based {{on the relative}} abundance of the diVerent types of germ cells present, the <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle</b> was divided into Wve stages: early (I; spermatogonia (SPG)), mid (II; SPG, spermatocytes (SPC) and spermatids (SPD)), and late spermatogenesis (III; SPC, SPD, and spermatozoa (SPZ)), functional maturation (IV; SPD and SPZ), and recovery (V; SPD, SPZ, and SPG). During summer, Wsh had stage I and V testes and the lowest values in plasma levels of sex steroids and IG. Testicular recrudescence seemed to begin in autumn, as denoted by the Wrst increase in IG and in the levels of 11 -KT and T, {{and the appearance of}} testes at stage II and III. During winter, the levels of 11 -KT and T peaked and soon began to decrease, the IG slightly declined and the proportion of running males (RM) gradually increased. In spring, levels of 11 -KT and T continued to decline, the IG slightly increased and the proportion of RM peaked concomitantly with the occurrence of stage IV testes. Plasma levels of 17, 20 -P did not change signiWcantly throughout testicular development. Transformation of SPD into SPZ followed a group-synchronous fashion, a phenomenon which parallels asynchronous oocyte development reported in females.

40|$|Part of {{this work}} was {{presented}} at the 7 th International Symposium on Fish Endocrinology, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaEstrogens are implicated in male gonad function, although their physiological roles remain uncertain. In the present study, we take advantage of the original model of spatio-temporal organization of trout spermatogenesis to revisit the synthesis and action sites of estrogens in fish testis. Within this system, somatic cell and germ cell development are synchronized due to a strict seasonal <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle</b> and the cystic organization of gonads. We evaluated the expression patterns and regulation of 3 aromatase isoforms (cyp 19 a, cyp 19 b-I, and cyp 19 b-II) and 4 estrogen receptors (esr 1 a, esr 1 b, esr 2 a, and esr 2 b) by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR during testicular maturation and in isolated germ cell populations. Our data demonstrated a reciprocal relationship between cyp 19 a and cyp 19 b (I and II) expression during testicular development (cyp 19 a decreased while cyp 19 b increased with maturation). Furthermore, cyp 19 b is significantly expressed in late germ cells. At the protein level, aromatase was immunohistochemically identified in interstitial tissue and in germ cells. Remarkable elevation of esr 1 a and esr 2 a was observed during the final stage of spermiation, while esr 1 b was expressed in an early stage of spermatogenetic development. Estrogen implants reduced testicular cyp 19 a transcript abundance while up-regulating cyp 19 b levels whereas androgens up-regulated testicular esr 1 a, esr 2 a, and esr 2 b. Together, the distinct spatio-temporal expression profiles and regulation of aromatases and estrogen receptors suggest that estrogens have discrete physiological functions during an early step of spermatogenesis and {{in the final stages of}} germ-cell maturation and/or excretion.

40|$|Continuous or cyclic {{production}} of spermatozoa throughout life in adult male vertebrate {{depends on a}} sub-population of undifferentiated germ cells acting as spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). What makes these cells self-renew or differentiate is barely understood, in particular in non-mammalian species including fish. In the highly seasonal rainbow trout, {{at the end of}} the annual <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle,</b> tubules of the spawning testis contain only spermatozoa with the exception of scarce undifferentiated spermatogonia that remain on the tubular wall, which will support the next round of spermatogenesis. Taking advantage of this model, we identified putative SSCs in fish testis using morphological, molecular and functional approaches. In all stages, large spermatogonia with ultrastructural characteristics of germinal stem cells were found, isolated or in doublet. Trout homologs of SSC and/or immature progenitor markers in mammals, nanos 2 and nanos 3, pou 2, plzf and piwil 2, were preferentially expressed in the prepubertal testis and in the undifferentiated A spermatogonia populations purified by centrifugal elutriation. This expression profile strongly suggests that these genes are functionally conserved between fish and mammals. Moreover, transplantation into embryonic recipients of the undifferentiated spermatogonial cells demonstrated their high 'stemness' efficiency in terms of migration into gonads and ability to give functional gametes. Interestingly, we show that nanos 2 expression was restricted to a sub-population of undifferentiated spermatogonia (less than 20 %) present as isolated cells or in doublet in the juvenile and in the maturing trout testis. In contrast, nanos 2 transcript was detected in all the undifferentiated spermatogonia remaining in the spawning testis. Plzf was also immuno-detected in A-Spg from spawning testis, which reinforces the idea that these cells are stem cells. From those results, we hypothesize that the subset of undifferentiated A spermatogonia expressing nanos 2 transcript are putative SSC in trout...|$|E
40|$|What {{makes the}} {{spermatogonial}} stem cells (SSCs) self-renew or differentiate to produce spermatozoa is barely understood, {{in particular in}} nonmammalian species. Our research explores possible regulations of the SSC niche in teleost, locally by paracrine factors and peripherally by hormonal regulation. In the present study, {{we focus on the}} Gdnf-Gfra 1 pathway that {{plays a major role in}} the regulation of SSC self-renewal in mammals. We describe a complex evolution of the genes encoding for Gdnf and Gfra 1 proteins in trout with the emergence of three gdnf and two gfra 1 paralogs. Using quantitative PCR measurements in isolated testicular cell populations, the gdnfb paralog was found expressed in A-spermatogonia and probably in another testicular cell type. In contrast, the transcript of gfra 1 a, the Gdnf receptor, was preferentially expressed in a population of undifferentiated A-spermatogonia (und A-Spg) separated by centrifugal elutriation. These und A-Spg also demonstrated high stemness potential in transplantation studies and preferentially expressed nanos 2, a putative SSC marker in trout (Bellaiche et al., Biol Reprod 2014; 90 : 79). Flow cytometer experiments demonstrate that only a subfraction of und A-Spg express Gfra 1. In trout, spermatogenesis develops along a strict annual cycle, and gdnfb and its receptor were expressed in a spermatogenetic activity-dependent manner. In particular, a dramatic increase of the gdnfb transcript coincided with the progressive cessation of rapid spermatogonial proliferation and of meiosis toward the end of the reproductive cycle. Together these results suggest that, in trout, Gdnfb is involved in the repression of und A-Spg differentiation. Fsh is an endocrine regulator of SSCs self-renewal through the up-regulation of Gdnf in rodents. We demonstrate that in trout, in vitro Fsh treatment stimulated the expression of the gfra 1 a 1 but not of its ligand, gdnfb. Fsh treatment also stimulated the proliferation of und A-Spg cocultured with testicular somatic cells. Based on those results, the Gfra 1 -positive cells could correspond to the putative SSCs in rainbow trout, and we propose that the balance between SSC self-renewal and differentiation during the trout <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle</b> is under paracrine regulation by Gdnfb, which represses, and under peripheral regulation by Fsh via the control of gfra 1 a 1 expression...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 243 - 268. Cordylus giganteus is a large, terrestrial, {{viviparous}} lizard, {{endemic to}} the Highveld grasslands of South Africa. Its distribution is limited and its conservation status is vulnerable. Autopsy and mark-recapture methods {{were used to}} study the seasonal aspects of its reproductive cycle, diet, energy reserves, growth, population dynamics, daily activity and thermoregulation. Reproduction is distinctly seasonal in both sexes. Females may reproduce biennially. Vitellogenesis commenced in autumn (March), and continued through hibernation with ovulation in spring (October). Two or three young are born in autumn. A functional placenta is implicated. Seasonal steroid hormone profiles are presented. Males exhibit a postnuptial <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Spermatogenesis commences in spring with peak spermiogenesis in autumn and testicular regression following in late autumn. Spermatozoa are stored in the epididymis and ductus deferens for seven to eight months. A bimodal plasma testosterone profile is reported, consistent with spermiogenesis in autumn and mating behaviour in spring. C. giganteus feeds during 8 {{months of the year}} and prefer Coleoptera as prey. Fat bodies are utilized for winter maintenance and reproduction. Hatchlings grow 20 - 30 mm during the first year and maximum growth rates occur in summer. Males and females attain sexual maturity at about 165 mm SVL in the fourth year. Seasonal affects on growth rate resulted in poor fit by either logistic-by-length or von Bertalanffy models and a seasonal oscillating model was introduced. Adult males are smaller than females; head sizes are the same but allometric slopes differed significantly. Population size and structure remained stable in the study area. Densities ranged from 9 - 11 lizards/ha. The age structure is marked by the low relative abundance of juveniles. Survivorship during the first year varied among years. Mortality was highest during summer months rather than winter months. Average annual survival of adults 'was high, but varied with sex and years (ranged from 58 %- 80 %). A life table yielded a net reproductive rate (Ro= 1) sufficient to sustain the population, if the reproductive life of an adult female is at least 12 years. Lizards remain in their burrows during winter. In summer, activity was bimodal on sunshine days but unimodal on cool overcast days. Body temperature is regulated by behavioural means (postural and orientation changes) and by shuttling to the cool burrow microclimate. The life history strategy corresponds partially to that of K-selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the male Rana epeirotica in Lake Ioannina, northwestern Greece, was studied. Emphasis was given on the spermatogenetic activity and {{the changes in the}} weight of testes, fat bodies and liver during the years 1998 and 1999. The spermatogenesis of R. epeirotica is of the potentially continuous type. Significant seasonal variations were observed in testes, fat body and liver weight. The seasonal variation of testes weight showed a good agreement with the <b>spermatogenetic</b> <b>cycle.</b> The reduction of fat body weight during the pre-hibernating period was attributed to the mobilisation of lipids to other body sites or their transformation into other metabolites. The significant decrease of liver weight in the dormant period, shows that this frog consumes mainly glycogen during wintering. The greatest decrease of fat body and liver weight in May {{is the result of the}} intensive activities related to reproduction and maintenance. The reproductive {{cycle of the}} water frog R. epeirotica in Lake Ioannina, northwestern Greece was studied from 1998 to 1999. Young females reached sexual maturity at a weight of 26. 3 g and length 67. 2 mm. The annual cyclic changes in weight and histological composition of the ovaries showed that R. epeirotica has a single reproductive period each year. Weight changes of the oviducts followed those shown by the ovaries. A continuous change in the percentage and diameter size of the ovarian follicles through the annual cycle was found. Clutch size ranged from 600 to 2900 ova of 1. 3 to 1. 6 mm egg diameter. Ovarian weight, clutch size and ovum size were positively correlated to body weight. The weights of fat body and liver had a peak in August and November respectively and they both were reduced considerably during hibernation. The age and growth of individuals of a population of the water frog R. epeirotica from northwestern Greece were studied in 1998 and 1999 using skeletochronology. Analysis of the age structure was based on the enumeration of Lines of Arrested Growth (LAGs) in phalanges. Age ranged from 1 - 5 years among 145 males and from 1 - 5 years among 173 females. The mean snout-vent length was 72. 74 ± 7. 96 mm in males and 83. 63 ± 11. 73 mm in females. The difference between the sexes in age and size was significant. Endosteal resorption may have eroded away the first LAG only in 9 % of the studied individuals and it was more frequent in females. Growth of adults was fitted by the Bertalanffy model. The growth coefficient (K) was 0. 88 in males and 0. 49 in females, mainly reflecting a faster male growth between metamorphosis and maturation. The mean time of metamorphosis for R. epeirotica is 88 days and its mean length is 20. 1 mm. The development of tadpoles follows the Gosner (1960) model. ...|$|E
