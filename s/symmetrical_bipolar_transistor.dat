40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This thesis {{deals with}} 1 /f noise in p-MOS, bipolar, and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> Experimental {{measurements}} determine the appropriate 1 /f noise for MOSFET's, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> The literature on 1 /f noise in p-MOSFETs, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> and lateral <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> is reviewed. The two {{main sources of}} low frequency 1 /f noise are mobility fluctuations and number fluctuations. Our 1 /f noise measurements in p-MOSFET's, <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors,</b> and lateral pnp <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> were done at frequencies of 1 Hz and 1 KHz respectively by both the automatic and analog methods. The measurement {{results suggest that the}} number fluctuation and mobility fluctuation models are applied for short channel and long channel p-MOSFET's in the saturation region respectively. Simulations have been done using PSPICE, with noise level NLEV= 0 and device model level 3 for long channel p-MOSFET's; with noise level NLEV= 2 and device model level 6 for short channel p-MOSFET's. Theoretical considerations as well as experimental results show {{that it is possible to}} take advantage of MOSFET and bipolar devices for low noise integrated circuit applications. Research on low frequency 1 /f noise in the different semiconductor devices is very important to determine the best semiconductor structure and best noise model for different devices. This is an especially important consideration in the development of the integrated circuits in high-density chip area, low voltage supply, low power consumption and low noise applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{electrothermal}} {{behavior of}} single- and two-finger <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> at medium- and high-current operations is studied through theoretical modeling, experimental measure-ments, and computer simulations. Bias conditions that border thermally stable and unstable operation regimes are described by novel analytical formulations, {{which for the}} first time include si-multaneously all relevant parameters that weaken the electrother-mal feedback at high currents such as ballasting resistors, current dependence of the base–emitter-voltage temperature coefficient, and high-injection effects. Hence, besides giving a correct de-scription of thermal instability mechanisms, the developed formu-lations also allow the prediction and physical understanding of restabilization phenomena. The models are supported by measure-ments on silicon-on-glass n-p-n <b>bipolar</b> junction <b>transistors</b> and by simulation results from a novel SPICE-based electrothermal macromodel for <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors.</b> Furthermore, the models are employed to analyze the influence of the germanium percentage in the base of SiGe heterojunction <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> on the thermal ruggedness of the device.
