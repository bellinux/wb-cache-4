40|$|With {{the fast}} growth in wind energy technologies, {{research}} into the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> system for wind turbines has drawn more attentions. Despite the advantages from the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, there are also several challenges {{for the application of}} <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> system for wind turbines. Accurate and adequate information of the wind turbine is needed for the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> system to carry out analysis, particularly with the growing size of wind farms. Another challenge is the huge amount of data needing to be collected, handled and processed. Minimising the number of sensors whilst still maintaining a sufficient number to assess the system’s conditions is a critical concern for <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring.</b> This paper focuses on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the optimization of sensor selection for wind turbine <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The principle behind the proposed methodology is presented and the method is also validated using simulation data obtained from wind power generation model in PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R
40|$|<b>Condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{systems are}} {{prevalent}} in industries that contain critical assets. Their use allows {{the detection of}} potential failures {{at an early stage}} in order to minimise downtime and maintenance costs of a system. Many <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems are commercially available, however these systems are limited in their support of diagnostic and prognostic models developed by external parties. An attempt to develop an extensible <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> software lead to the creation of an ISO 13374 /OSA-CBM based system named BUDS, which focuses on vibration <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Research into <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> data management strategies led our team to implement a database to support the data-driven application.

40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} {{currently}} considered {{as the main}} solution to reduce greenhouse gas emission. This has led to great developments {{in the use of}} renewable energy for electricity generation. Among many renewable energy resources, tidal energy has the advantage of being predictable, particularly when compared to wind energy. Currently the UK is the world leader in extracting energy from the tide; an estimation shows a potential of 67 TWh per year. In order to ensure safe operation and prolonged life for tidal turbines, <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> is essential. The technology for power generation using tidal turbines is new therefore the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> concept for these devices is yet to be established. Also, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of techniques suitable for health monitoring of the turbine components and support structure given their unique operating environment. In this paper the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> of a tidal turbine is investigated. The objective is to highlight the need for <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> and establish procedures to decide the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> techniques required, in addition to highlighting the impact and benefits of applying condition based maintenance. A model for failure analysis is developed to assess the needs for <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> and identify critical components, after which a ‘symptoms analysis’ was performed to decide the appropriate <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> techniques. Finally, the impact of <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> on system reliability is considered...|$|R
40|$|Using <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{to track}} machine health and trigger {{maintenance}} actions is a proven best practice. By monitoring machinery health, costly failures are avoided and downtime due to outages is reduced, which finally {{results in an}} increase of operational efficiency and productivity of the equipment. Many papers discuss the implementation of <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> to prevent failures and optimize maintenance actions. However, much less {{attention is paid to}} the use of <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> information in order to optimize production capacity of a machine or a plant. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} establish the link between <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> information and production capacity optimization by continuously adjusting production parameters (e. g. production speed) according to the measured <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> information. In this paper <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> of steel production machines using cost-effective temperature sensors is applied to monitor possible overheating of the machine and used to optimize the machine’s speed. Without optimization, the machine is simply stopped when overheating is detected. This results on lost production capacity. Therefore, the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> information is used as an input to the machine’s controller in order to optimize the production speed. The speed of the production machine is namely directly related to the corresponding temperature increase or decrease. Optimization of the production speed results in maximal production capacity and minimal machine downtime by prevention of overheating. The paper clearly illustrates how temperature <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> information can be used to maximize industrial production capacity. This approach extends the use of <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> information from purely avoiding unexpected failures to productivity optimization of an entire system. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|We review {{existing}} machine <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{techniques and}} industrial automation for plant-wide <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> of rotating electrical machines. Cost {{and complexity of}} a <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> system increase {{with the number of}} measurements, so extensive <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> is currently mainly restricted to the situations where the consequences of poor availability, yield or quality are so severe that they clearly justify the investment in monitoring. There are challenges to obtaining plant-wide monitoring that includes even small machines and non-critical applications. One of the major inhibiting factors is the ratio of <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> cost to equipment cost, which is crucial to the acceptance of using monitoring to guide maintenance for a large fleet of electrical machinery. Ongoing developments in sensing, communication and computation for industrial automation may greatly extend the set of machines for which extensive monitoring is viable...|$|R

40|$|Implementation of a <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{system is}} a {{difficult}} decision due to many uncertain parameters. This is certainly {{the case for the}} wind turbine industry where factors like long logistical times and weather conditions have a major influence on the economic benefit. One of the parameters that is neglected in most of the available literature is the performance of the <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> system itself. In this paper a new concept for modeling this performance based on the P–F curve of different failure modes is presented. The concept is illustrated on an extensive case study for a gearbox of a wind turbine. A stochastic simulation model is constructed in order to quantify the economic added value of implementing an imperfectly performing <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> system into a gearbox. This case study proves that a <b>condition</b> <b>monitoring</b> system generates an economic benefit compared to the currently applied maintenance strategy.
