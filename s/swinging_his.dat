5|$|Late in the 1999–2000 season, Niedermayer was {{involved}} in a violent incident with Peter Worell of the Florida Panthers. After being elbowed by Worell, Niedermayer responded by <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> stick at his opponents head. Worell suffered a concussion and missed six games, while Niedermayer was suspended for ten games – nine in the regular season, and New Jersey's first playoff game. After returning from his ban, Niedermayer's steady defensive contributions in the playoffs helped the Devils win their second Stanley Cup by defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the 2000 Stanley Cup Final. While celebrating his day with the Cup, Niedermayer took the trophy to Fisher Peak, overlooking his hometown of Cranbrook and was famously pictured hoisting it over his head.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was noted}} for his {{deliberate}} {{approach to the}} wicket and the rhythmical nature of his bowling action that involved him first <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> bowling arm, joining hands as he swung forwards then completing a loop of his joined hands before delivering the ball. He was noted as a heavy spinner of a cricket ball and comparisons were made with Ashley Mallett, the former Australian spin bowler.|$|E
25|$|He fired {{only when}} {{he thought he could}} destroy. Two hundred and fifty yards was the {{distance}} from which he liked best to fire. A couple of short, hard burst from there and that was usually it. He picked his targets off cleanly and decisively, <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> sight smoothly through them as a first-class shot strokes driven partridges out of the sky. It was a fluent and calculated exercise... For Beurling the confirmed kill was the thing.|$|E
50|$|This move is {{actually}} a counter. Usually, the opponent grabs the attacking wrestler (as if he would perform a sidewalk slam), the attacking counters and <b>swings</b> <b>his</b> body upwards, then scissors his legs around the opponent's head, spin around the opponent's body and <b>swings</b> <b>his</b> legs downwards, resulting in the headscissors takedown. This move was popularized by Trish Stratus.|$|R

25|$|After {{receiving}} fresh {{information regarding}} Ottoman deployments on 10 April, Dobell modified {{his plan to}} incorporate a more flexible approach. While the first stage would remain unchanged, during {{the second stage of}} the battle he might attack directly by <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> line slightly northeast, with only one division attacking Gaza to create a gap for Desert Column, depending on whether the hostile Atawineh defences were reinforced by units from the Hareira detachment. Or he might send most of his force to the coastal side of Gaza to make an attack there.|$|E
25|$|He was {{selected}} for appointment as Minister of National Revenue in January 1968 by Pearson, making him a junior minister in the cabinet. During the 1968 Liberal leadership race, Chrétien fought hard {{on behalf of his}} mentor Sharp, who aspired to lead the Liberal Party. Only at the last moment when it become clear that Sharp had no hope of winning the Liberal leadership just before the convention and after Sharp withdrew from the race, did Chrétien follow Sharp in <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> support behind the man who eventually won the race, Pierre Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|Turks, as an ethno-linguistic group, {{have been}} {{influenced}} by the Shahnameh since advent of Saljuqs. Toghrul III of Seljuqs is said to have recited the Shahnameh while <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> mace in battle. According to Ibn Bibi, in 618/1221 the Saljuq of Rum Ala' al-Din Kay-kubad decorated the walls of Konya and Sivas with verses from the Shahnameh. The Turks themselves connected their origin not with Turkish tribal history but with the Turan of Shahnameh. Specifically in India, through the Shahnameh, they felt themselves to be the last outpost tied to the civilized world by the thread of Iranianism.|$|E

25|$|A typical pommel horse {{exercise}} involves both single leg {{and double}} leg work. Single leg skills are generally {{found in the}} form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (Flares). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> body over the horse, or landing after a handstand variation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of 1988, during an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Hercules was <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> chain in the {{direction}} of another muscular power wrestler the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain snapping at the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules' full nelson and landing on top of him before lifting his shoulder at the two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules. During the match the Warrior had no-sold a number of Hercules' signature power moves, including receiving two clotheslines before being taken down with a third. This match has generally been {{regarded as one of the}} poorest matches in WrestleMania history.|$|E
500|$|This {{tradition}} posed {{a particular}} challenge at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy. The flag was passed from Sergio Chiamparino, {{the mayor of}} Turin, to Sam Sullivan, the mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. [...] Mayor Sullivan, who is a quadriplegic, waved the flag by holding it {{in one hand and}} <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> motorized wheelchair back and forth eight times.|$|E

[...] This technique {{can be seen in the}} tour documentary Beside You in Time. [...] In contrast to the lighting of previous tours, Performance 2007 featured minimal lighting that was designed to shadow Reznor and the band.|$|E
500|$|Duke {{was twice}} wounded during the War. At the Battle of Shiloh, he was <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> saber at a Union soldier {{when he was}} shot in the left {{shoulder}} by a Brown Bess musket. [...] The bullet exited his right shoulder, barely missing the spine. After recuperating, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and a few months later, to colonel. Duke's second wound came at Elizabethtown, Kentucky's Rolling Fork River during Morgan's Christmas Raid of 1862, when, on December 29, he was hit by a shell fragment while leading the back guard as the rest of Morgan's men crossed a stream; his men initially assumed he was dead.|$|E
500|$|After his {{performances}} in the AHL, Hextall was invited to the Flyers' training camp as a long-shot. His play in four exhibition games convinced Flyers' coach Mike Keenan to call up Hextall to the NHL, and to play him in the opening game of the season, against the Edmonton Oilers. Hextall conceded a goal from the first shot he faced in the game, but allowed no further shots past him, leading his side to a 2–1 victory. Hextall continued to display the aggressive nature with which he had always played, <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> stick at Brad Smith and Troy Murray early in his first NHL season. Despite these swipes, Hextall claimed at the time that, [...] "I used to be worse, I've learned to control my temper." [...] Two months after making these comments, Hextall {{was involved in a}} fight with opposing New Jersey Devils goaltender Alain Chevrier. Having lost to the Devils, the Flyers wanted revenge for Steve Richmond's punch on Kjell Samuelsson {{at the end of the}} game; Hextall targeted Chevrier in a fight labelled by Chico Resch as [...] "like a heavyweight against a lightweight." [...] Hextall and seven other players were fined $300 each for their part in the brawl.|$|E

500|$|For Sony's OVAs of the franchise, {{there have}} also been {{multiple}} response. Matthew Anderson from DVD Vision Japan found the series' title [...] "Samurai X" [...] unfitting for Kenshin as the reviewer regarded the character as a hired killer rather than as a samurai as seen across the prequel OVAs. Rio Yañez from Animerica said one of the major themes of Trust is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can have, something that Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him. Mike Crando from Anime News Network highly enjoyed Kenshin's characterization in the prequel as he refers it as [...] "it is a fascinating and emotional character study in its own right" [...] due to Kenshin's character development across these four episodes from [...] "an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only to be redeemed through love lost and the realization that <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> sword is destroying his own life as well as {{the lives of the people}} on the receiving end". Additionally, the reviewer enjoyed the OVA's director's cut for showing more fights between Kenshin and Shinsenguimi, the special forces where Saito originated from. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk found Kenshin as a [...] "complex" [...] character and said his relationship with Yukishiro Tomoe might appeal the viewers. Carlos Ross from THEM Anime Reviews shared similar feelings and enjoyed the romance between Kenshin Tomoe despite its tragic outcome. Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the [...] "Best anime romances" [...] with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Tomoe.|$|E
500|$|American pressmen {{had been}} alerted to an {{upcoming}} Buddhist demonstration {{to coincide with}} Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda {{in the north of}} Saigon. The group, which included Arnett, Browne, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhists filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngô Đình Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around [...] taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> arms, reportedly saying [...] "Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!" [...] Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diệm's regime, with the images of the burning Thích Quảng Đức on the front pages still fresh {{in the minds of the}} public.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the loss, Haye {{was widely}} praised for his {{performance}} in fighting on whilst severely injured.

2500|$|Elvis Presley saw Harris {{perform in}} Memphis {{in the early}} 1950s.

Harris remarked in a 1956 interview that Elvis's hip movements were stirring controversy in a way his own never did: [...] "Many people have been giving him trouble for <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> hips. I swing mine and have no trouble. He's got publicity I could not buy".|$|E

[...] The king spurred his horse and began <b>swinging</b> <b>his</b> sword at his companions, {{fighting}} until one of his chamberlains {{and a group of}} soldiers were able to grab him from his mount and lay him on the ground. He lay still and did not react, but fell into a coma. The king had killed a knight known as [...] "The Bastard of Polignac" [...] and several other men.|$|E
