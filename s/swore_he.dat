5|$|McMillin {{was born}} on January 12, 1895 to Reuben Thomas McMillin and Martha Buchanan Reilly in Prairie Hill, Limestone County, Texas. The family moved in 1897 to Waco and in 1901 to Fort Worth. McMillin's father was a meat packer. As a child, Bo was known to pick fights, but was also known all his life as one who never drunk nor smoked nor <b>swore.</b> <b>He</b> spoke with a {{distinctive}} Texas drawl.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (setts). He <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E
25|$|Henry Garnet Forrest {{was born}} on 5 December 1895 in Brunswick, Melbourne, Australia. His father was Robert Forrest; he signed the {{enlistment}} papers granting permission for his son's enlistment. The younger Forrest {{was working as a}} cook when he enlisted on 19 February 1915, and <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> was a British subject.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{thereafter}} there ensued {{a massive}} famine, {{and everyone was}} reduced to devouring not only grapes, but all sorts of plants and even animals {{in an attempt to}} satiate their hunger. Of them only Hwang-gung 황궁(黃穹) came forth to Mago 마고(麻姑) and begged her for forgiveness. He <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> would not rest until mankind could recover its pure nature. From her he obtained the Three Heavenly Heirlooms, and great knowledge. He then called together all the people of the earth, taught them agriculture, and gave each clan leader a Heavenly Heirloom and then sent them off in different directions to people the earth.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the paint}} {{was removed from the}} guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as {{evidenced}} from contemporary photographs. No further paint loss was seen over the subsequent twenty five years. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> would never sell it or paint it.|$|E
25|$|Later, while {{searching the}} area where Harrod was last seen, some of Harrod's friends found some bones in a cave. The bones were still tightly wrapped in sedge grass, which {{appeared}} to have been used to help transport the body to its present location. Some of the friends claimed that the bones were wearing Harrod's shirt, and that the buttons were missing. Others claimed there was no shirt at all. Regardless, when the men returned, Bridges had fled the area. Harrod's family claimed that Bridges' flight proved that Harrod's friends had found Harrod's body in the cave and feared that he would be implicated in his death. However, when Ann applied for Harrod's pension, she <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> had died in a hunting accident and that his clothes had been found in a nearby river.|$|E

500|$|In Baltimore, Conwell professed his {{obedience}} to Rome and <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese. The following year, the Vatican appointed Francis Kenrick as Conwell's coadjutor bishop {{with the right}} of succession and named him administrator of the diocese. Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky. He received permission to resume performing liturgical functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer. He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1970s, the {{underground}} comix movement was encountering a slowdown. [...] To give cartoonists a safe berth, Spiegelman co-edited the anthology Arcade with Bill Griffith, in 1975 and 1976. [...] Arcade was printed by The Print Mint and lasted seven issues, five {{of which had}} covers by Robert Crumb. [...] It stood out from similar publications by having an editorial plan, in which Spiegelman and Griffith attempt to show how comics connect to the broader realms of artistic and literary culture. [...] Spiegelman's own work in Arcade tended to be short and concerned with formal experimentation. [...] Arcade also introduced art from ages past, as well as contemporary literary pieces by writers such as William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski. [...] In 1975, Spiegelman moved back to New York City, which put most of the editorial work for Arcade {{on the shoulders of}} Griffith and his cartoonist wife, Diane Noomin. [...] This, combined with distribution problems and retailer indifference, led to the magazine's 1976 demise. [...] For a time, Spiegelman <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> would never edit another magazine.|$|E

2500|$|Knowles {{transferred}} to the 74-gun [...] in late 1795, serving under Sir John Jervis at Lisbon. While serving there he ran foul of Jervis, who had him court-martialled in 1796 {{on a charge of}} disobeying a verbal order. At the trial [...] Jervis's captain of the fleet Robert Calder swore that no order had been given, and the lieutenant who was supposed to have transmitted it <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> had not received one. The charge was therefore dismissed, but this appears to have been the start of a personal enmity of Jervis against Knowles.|$|E

2500|$|On June 1, 1915, Panzram burgled a {{house in}} Astoria, Oregon, but was arrested soon after while {{attempting}} to sell some of the stolen items. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, to be served at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, where he arrived on June 24. Warden Harry Minto believed in harsh treatment of inmates, including beatings and isolation, among other disciplinary measures. Later, Panzram stated that he <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> [...] "would never do that seven years and I defied the warden and all his officers to make me." [...] Later that year, Panzram helped fellow inmate Otto Hooker escape from the prison. While attempting to evade recapture, Hooker killed Minto, marking Panzram's first known involvement in a murder, as an accessory before the fact.|$|E
2500|$|Five years later, Brennius wed the {{daughter}} of the King of Norway without consulting Belinus. [...] Belinus invaded Northumberland and seized Brennius's land. [...] Brennius heard of this violation and gathered a large Norwegian army together to sail for Britain. [...] On the way, a fleet of ships under the King of Denmark attacked because the king wanted Brennius's wife for himself. [...] They fought in the open ocean and the two sides dispersed. [...] The King of Denmark managed to capture the wife of Brennius but he then got lost and landed on Britain. [...] Belinus captured the king and his brother's wife. [...] Brennius landed in Albany and demanded the return of all his lands and his wife. [...] If not, he <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> would kill Belinus if they ever met in battle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earthquake}} lasted 55 seconds. A hotel page {{described the}} pandemonium inside the hotel: [...] "I found the floor crowded with screaming guests running every which way. As the elevators were {{all out of}} order the guests headed for the marble stairs, which were broken and cracked and falling below." [...] The hotel manager, James Woods, wearing his bathrobe, tried to calm the guests, {{but most of them}} rushed outside onto Union Square. Later in the morning, opera singer Enrico Caruso and Alfred Hertz, the conductor of the San Francisco Symphony, who was hosting a tour by Caruso, who were both staying at the nearby Palace Hotel, fled the Palace and came to the St. Francis, where the restaurant was still open for breakfast. Caruso carried with him a signed photograph of President Theodore Roosevelt, and <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> would never return to San Francisco; he never did.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1987 and 1989, Fulci made a {{deal with}} {{producers}} Antonio Lucidi and Luigi Nannerini to lend his name to the credits of some low-budget horror films that he had not directed, simply to make the films more marketable to distributors outside of Italy. Although he did supervise the special gore effects in both The Curse and The Murder Secret (and directed some additional footage to lengthen the running time of Hansel and Gretel), he was hardly at all involved with some of the other projects which bore the [...] "Lucio Fulci Presents" [...] label on their video display boxes. Fulci tried unsuccessfully to have his name removed from the credits of one film in particular, Gianni Martucci's The Red Monks, since he <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> had no involvement with its production (although the film's producer Pino Buricchi begged him to let them use his name in the credits). The following year, in reciprocation for the use of his name, Fulci was permitted to use gore footage culled from these various films to make his infamous A Cat in the Brain.|$|E
2500|$|Powell's role in {{the plot}} almost {{came to an end}} when, on March 12, 1865, he beat a black maid at the Branson {{boarding}} house. She had him arrested and accused him of being a Confederate spy. It was a serious charge: Maryland was under martial law, and the Union Army's Provost Marshal had supervision over such cases. Using the name [...] "Lewis Paine", Powell <b>swore</b> <b>he</b> was from Fauquier County, Virginia, and knew nothing about the war. Declaring he was only 18 years old, he pretended to be stupid and not understand the English language too well. Lacking evidence that he was a spy, the Provost Marshal released Powell on March 14. Powell took an oath of allegiance to the United States, and the Provost Marshal wrote on his allegiance form that [...] "Lewis Paine" [...] was to live north of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{for the duration of the}} war. (The Provost Marshal had foolishly written the [...] "stay north" [...] order in pencil. Powell later erased it from his oath of allegiance.) ...|$|E
