50|$|In 1838 the Kleinwanzleben Zuckerfabrik (Kleinwanzleben Sugar Refinery) {{was founded}} as a stock company. In 1856 the {{majority}} of its shares were acquired by the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> and farmer Matthias Christian Rabbethge, one of the pioneers of the German sugar industry. In the same year he and his then future son-in-law Julius Giesecke founded a general commercial partnership (OHG). In 1885 the Rabbethge & Giesecke OHG became a joint stock company (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Zuckerfabrik Klein Wanzleben formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke Aktiengesellschaft (AG). In 1937 it was changed into Rabbethge & Giesecke AG because the Reichsnährstand did not want any anonymous investors in the agriculture and forestry sector. After the Second World War the company was relocated to the Lower Saxonian city of Einbeck which has been its headquarters since then. In 1946 a rescue company was established under the name Rabbethge & Giesecke Saatzucht GmbH. The foundation of this rescue company was necessary in order to continue the Western activities of the original joint stock company, which was still based in Klein Wanzleben. In 1951 the two companies were merged and took the title Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke AG. In 1975 it was changed into KWS Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke and then finally reduced to KWS SAAT AG in 1999.The first international branch of KWS was established in 1900 in the Ukrainian town Vinnytsia to meet the demand of sugar beet farmers in Russia. In 1920 the company began to expand its business into corn, fodder beet and potato breeding. Following the relocation to Einbeck, KWS focused on the breeding of sugar beet, corn, rapeseed, sunflower, cereals and potatoes. In the years directly after the war, the company became an important supplier to the West German sugar beet industry. Since 1963 it has established subsidiaries in Europe, North and South America, Asia and North Africa.|$|E
40|$|Through Monte Carlo {{simulation}} techniques, {{all possible}} scenarios are analyzed {{of the impact}} of the potential adoption of genetically modified herbicide tolerant sugar beets on the economics of Belgian sugar beet growers. The most likely gain for the average Belgian <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> amounts to 125 /ha. Assuming an adoption rate of 75 %, this transates into a total benefit foregone of 9 million for Belgian agriculture in the agricultural season 1998 - 1999. Three quarters of this benefit are absorbed by the farmers, while one quarter, i. e. 3 million, is extracted by the gene developers and seed suppliers. This refutes the argument of a seed industry extracting all benefits from biotechnology innovations. Production Economics, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{relates to}} a teaching exercise {{developed for the}} training of agronomy graduates at the AgroParisTech (France). Its aim {{is to show that}} agronomic knowledge (1) is useful to help us understand the ecological processes at the origin of a disaster, (2) must be related to other knowledge to be really effective in a context of action. The exercise is based on a role-playing game which leads the students to acquire by themselves most of the knowledge needed. The game context is the control of muddy flows in Normandy. The scenario is rather simple. A muddy flow occurs, in Normandy, at the outlet of a small catchment area composed of two villages: Hautville (upstream), and Basville (downstream). The damage occurs in Basville where some individual dwellings and a sugar refinery suffered severely from the muddy flow. A crisis meeting is organized. The students, divided into groups, are asked {{to play the role of}} the various participants attending the meeting, including the two mayors, the farmers, the sugar refinery manager and agricultural advisors. They are given specific details and a specific aim for the character they have to play. During the simulated meeting the teachers listen to the exchanges. At the end of the simulation they comment on the technical value of the arguments. Using the initial scenario and the specific details given to each group, the students have to understand that the muddy flow has two major origins. A <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> in Hautville is responsible for the runoff. A dairy farmer in Basville allowed the erosion of his soil by the concentrated runoff initiated in Hautville because he ploughed a previously permanent meadow. But the disaster is also due to the unsuitability of the damaged buildings downstream. The students are thus brought to propose some agronomic innovations via the collaboration between the different stakeholders attending the meeting. The students generally take a keen interest in this exercise. As a result, they and how the spatial organisation of the cultivation methods may interfere with these phenomena (reducing or increasing them). The students also learn about the roles of the various decision makers involved in the problems and their necessary coordination for the improvement of the environment...|$|E

30|$|Collective {{negotiations}} {{in the sugar}} sector. The quota system for sugar applies {{until the end of}} the 2016 / 2017 marketing year (Article 124 CMO Regulation). There will no longer be a guaranteed <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> price as from that date. The question arises whether growers will be able to continue to collectively negotiate prices with producers after the end of the quota regime, as is the current practice. Unlike in the milk, arable crops, olive oil and beef sectors, there is no explicit collective negotiation provision for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>growers</b> in the CMO. However, the rules for the sugar sector do provide for the collective negotiation of inter-professional agreements between associations of <b>beet</b> <b>growers</b> and <b>sugar</b> manufacturers (so-called agreements within the trade).

50|$|Its origins {{date from}} 1903 when Charles Boettcher founded the Great Western Sugar Company {{and opened a}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> plant in Loveland, Colorado and another in Greeley, Colorado. When the Utah Sugar Company {{approached}} Great Western Sugar Company in 1902, the companies agreed to allow Utah Sugar to expand into Idaho, provided Utah Sugar didn't expand into Colorado. This was likely on behalf of Henry Osborne Havemeyer, whose American Sugar Refining Company owned 50% of both companies. The Loveland plant closed in 1977, when the company was purchased by the sugar firm Tate & Lyle, at which time the name was changed to the Western Sugar Company.

40|$|Concern {{has grown}} in Europe over the {{agricultural}} and environmental impacts of genetically engineered (GE) crops, especially about gene flow to conventional varieties and wild relatives. Contrary to most crops that are grown for their seed or fruit, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> (Beta vulgaris L.) is grown for its root. Therefore, pollen-mediated gene flow in root production areas is not a concern in the debate on GE and non-GE crop co-existence, including table beet and chard in private gardens. However, pollen flow could {{be responsible for the}} admixture of GE and non-GE materials in the seed lots provided to farmers; but it can be easily prevented by breeding and multiplicating GE and non-GE seeds in different regions. In contrast, pollen flow to wild relatives could certainly generate agronomic trouble much more easily and quickly than with any other crop. There is always a small proportion of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> plants that flower, in spite of being a root crop, because of either their sensitivity to vernalization or the presence of a dominant bolting gene.

For 2004 and 2005 efficiency and TFP are calculated by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and by a Malmquist index respectively. Between 2004 and 2005 the average technical efficiency was very stable, around 0. 80 for CRS efficiency and 0. 87 for VRS efficiency, suggesting that in both years farms were similarly clustered towards the frontier.

In 2004 the highest technical efficiency {{can be observed in}} Szerencs district followed by Kaba district and then Szolnok district, while the efficiency rating changed in 2005 when the most efficient district was KaposvÃ¡r, followed by Szerencs and PetÅ‘hÃ¡za.

The main reason for the observed TFP increase was technical progress of 8 %, while technical efficiency played a limited role in improving the performance of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. At the same time there was a clear convergence which can be identified and thus improving efficiency scores among individual holdings. Although in the analysed period TFP increased, our empirical results have revealed pure technical inefficiency. In the first three most efficient <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production districts the technical efficiency decreased while in the two least efficient districts technical efficiency increased and they became more homogenous to the frontier compared to the former three districts in 2005.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cultivar}} mixtures and two irrigation frequency treatments were evaluated over two seasons for {{their impact on}} a complex of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> root diseases in three fields infested with the fungal pathogens Aphanomyces cochliodes, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-betae, Rhizoctonia solani, and the viral pathogen Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV). Irrigations after emergence consisted of two or five (two 1994 studies) and three or six (1995 study) applications of water for dry and wet treatments, respectively. Cultivar treatments included MH 9155, HH 67, Ranger, Rhizosen, and four combinations of these same cultivars. Disease progress was monitored through destructive sampling of plants exhibiting foliar symptoms typical of root disease during the season. At harvest, data on root and sucrose yields, sucrose percentage, and a root disease index were collected. No significant irrigation × cultivar treatment interactions were observed. Few significant differences were observed between irrigation treatments involving measured yield components. Reduced irrigations however, resulted in significantly lower disease incidence in all three repeated experiments when cultivar treatments were combined. No added benefits were observed for increasing yield or decreasing root disease by planting mixed cultivars, compared to the same cultivars planted individually. Several regionally adapted cultivars performed as well or better than mixtures under the unusually high levels of disease pressure in test fields. When few alternative options are available, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>growers</b> may still benefit from reducing irrigations, and growing locally adapted cultivars in soils severely infested with root pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Cropping {{allocations}} have normally {{been studied}} using frameworks that assume {{the existence of}} a representative farmer who cares about maximising gross margin. Evidence has shown that results obtained from these studies to predict cropping allocations in response to policy reforms are not satisfactory. On the other hand, an alternative research using multivariate models (i. e. models that consider economic and social-psychological variables to explain farmers’ behaviour) has been developed with the purpose of identifying farmers’ motivations to adopt specific environmental policies. However, this research has not been extended to study strategic cropping decisions. This is surprising given the fact that policy reforms strongly affect the allocation of crops when they are accompanied with the elimination of domestic distorting policies. The objective of this thesis is to fill this gap by proposing a novel holistic multivariate model designed exclusively to study farmers’ strategic cropping decisions. The proposed model integrates a number of alternative and complementary approaches that can explain farmers’ strategic behaviour. The model was applied to a sample of ex-sugar beet farmers in the West Midlands region of the UK to investigate the way in which these individuals adjusted to the Sugar Regime reform introduced on 20 th February 2006. As a consequence of this reform, the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> factory located in Allscott in Shropshire was closed and the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>growers</b> in this area adjusted by replacing <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> with alternative crops. Evidence has revealed that these farmers replaced <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> with crops with low gross margin such as oilseed. This choice is puzzling because other crops with high levels of gross margin such as carrots and parsnips were also available when the reform was implemented. The proposed multivariate model not only was useful to explain this choice, but also identified heterogeneous behavioural responses that no related research has identified so far.

40|$|The Next Round of {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} under the World Trade Organization is set to begin {{towards the end of}} 1999. This study was initiated to inform, substantiate and aid the development of industry and government negotiation positions for the Round. It was sponsored by Agricore, Alberta Agriculture and Food Council, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Alberta Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs, the Alberta <b>Sugar</b> <b>Beet</b> <b>Growers,</b> the Canadian Dehydrators Association, the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association, and the Potato Growers of Alberta. Its overall objective was to quantify the net benefits from agricultural trade liberalization in the Next Round of the WTO. The specific objectives may be encapsulated as follows: 1. Assess the relative sizes of the supply managed and non-supply managed segments in Canada's agri-food sector with the view to understanding the implications of trade liberalization on these segments. 2. Examine the implications of trade liberalization on trade by degree of value-adding. 3. Estimate the extent and distribution of government support to agriculture in Canada on a regional basis. 4. Quantify the net benefits from elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers to the agri-food sector and the economy. 5. Evaluate the impact of emerging trade issues (e. g., food safety, genetically modified organisms and biotechnology) on Canada's agri-food industries. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
