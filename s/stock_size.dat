The Eastern Baltic cod stock had quite low {{abundance}} until the 1970s, but then grew rapidly due to low fishing pressure and favourable environmental conditions for egg and larvae survival (high salinity, oxygen amount and abundance of prey copepods).

50|$|Rapid {{increases}} in phytoplankton growth, that typically occur {{during the spring}} bloom, arise because phytoplankton can reproduce rapidly under optimal growth conditions (i.e., high nutrient levels, ideal light and temperature, and minimal losses from grazing and vertical mixing). In terms of reproduction, many species of phytoplankton can double at least once per day, allowing for exponential {{increases in}} phytoplankton <b>stock</b> <b>size.</b> For example, the <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> of a population that doubles once per day will increase 1000-fold in just 10 days. In addition, there is a lag in the grazing response of herbivorous zooplankton {{at the start of}} blooms, which minimize phytoplankton losses. This lag occurs because there is low winter zooplankton abundance and many zooplankton, such as copepods, have longer generation times than phytoplankton.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, all cod stocks of the North Atlantic {{have been exposed}} to {{gradually}} rising fishing pressures due in part to improvements in technology that result in increasingly efficient fishing practices. At the same time, all stocks have experiences changing environmental conditions, which, together with increasing fishing pressures, are thought to be responsible for the historical fluctuations in stock abundances and structures. <b>Stock</b> <b>sizes,</b> and the age and <b>size</b> structures of <b>stocks</b> have consequently been depleted. Such drastic changes in population sizes have raised concerns about potential (selective) changes in genetic composition and loss in genetic diversity. Today many of the stocks are heavily overfished and some are considered to have reached the stage of recruitment overfishing.

Age-cohort-based models, state-of-the-art in DSM, are of a descriptive nature: Each age-cohort is assigned an expected lifetime and the cohort’s use phase ends when its lifetime elapses. At any given point in time, in-use stocks are composed of different age-cohorts, each with its specific material content and energy efficiency. In DSM, the assumed total <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> is determined by exogenously specified parameters such as population and per capita service level and the age-cohort lifetime model can be used to adjust the inflows into and the outflows from stocks.|$|E

The sensitivity of the model to the <b>stock</b> <b>sizes</b> and food preferences of harp seals and minke whales is investigated, to-gether with the sensitivity to the food preferences of cod. A tentative conclusion on likely effects of an increasing whale stock is that the herring stock will be most heavily affected.

The small fraction (20% of the original stock) had barely one-quarter of the dry matter mass of the large fraction at the time of outplanting. Ten years later, in the blade-scarified site, seedlings of the large fraction had almost 50% greater stem volume than had seedlings of the small fraction. Without site preparation, large stock were more than twice the size of small stock after 10 years.|$|E

50|$|Some {{of these}} {{benchmarks}} are combined {{in the form}} of ratios in order to better understand the status of the stock. A Fcurr/Fmsy ratio greater than one indicates that overfishing is occurring. When SSBcurr/SSBmsy is greater than one, the MSY will be produced, but if it is less than one it means that the stock is overfished. MFMT and MSST are used as limit reference points. When MFMT is exceeded or the spawning <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> dips below MSST the fishery is shut down. A benchmark that is currently gaining in popularity is SPR, spawning potential ratio. The SPR is the average fecundity of a recruit over its lifetime when the stock is fished divided by the average fecundity of a recruit over its lifetime when the stock is unfished. The SPR is based on the principle that certain levels of fish have to survive in order to spawn and replenish the stock at a sustainable level.|$|E
40|$|Models for {{fluctuations}} in <b>size</b> of fish <b>stocks</b> must include parameters that describe expected dynamics, {{as well as}} stochastic influences. In addition, reliable population projections also require assessments about the uncertainties in estimates of vital parameters. Here we develop an age-structured model of population dynamics based on catch-at-age data and indices of abundance in which the natural and fishing mortality are separated in a Bayesian state-space model. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to fit the model to the data. The model is fitted to a data set of 19 years for Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua). By simulations of the fitted model we show that the model captures the dynamical pattern of natural mortality adequately, whereas the absolute size of natural mortality is difficult to estimate. Access to long time series of high-quality data are necessary for obtaining precise estimates of all the parameters in the model, but some parameters cannot be estimated without including some prior information. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that temporal variability in natural mortality strongly affects perceived variability in <b>stock</b> <b>sizes.</b> Thus, using estimation procedures that neglect temporal {{fluctuations in}} natural mortality may therefore give biased estimates of fluctuations in fish <b>stock</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|R

The Northeast Arctic cod is found in the Barents Sea area. This stock spawns in March and April along the Norwegian coast, about 40% around the Lofoten archipelago.

50|$|A fishery for Antarctic toothfish, {{managed by}} the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), has existed since 1997. The {{existence}} of this fishery in the Ross Sea, the area where most Antarctic toothfish are caught, is very contentious - the main argument proposed for this being the lack of accurate population parameters, such as original <b>stock</b> <b>size,</b> fecundity, and recruitment. Moreover, the main fishing grounds is presumed by some researchers to cover the area through which the entire stock of Antarctic toothfish pass. Typically the fishing season has finished in the area {{by the end of}} February and {{for the remainder of the}} year much of the area is covered by sea-ice providing a natural impediment to fishing. This fishery is characterised by opponents as being a challenge to manage owing to the nature of benthic longline fishing. The bycatch of other fish can also be significant, with the ratio to tonnes of toothfish caught ranging from 4.5% to 17.9% and averaging 9.3% from the 1999/2000 fishing season to 2013/14 in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 when the toothfish catch first exceeded 50 tonnes and from 2.3% to 24.5% averaging 12.4% in CCAMLR Subarea 88.2 up to the latest publicly available figure from 2013/14. The bycatch of other fish species is also regulated to a maximum amount annually by CCAMLR. CCAMLR decision rules are based on determining the catch level that will ensure that the median estimated spawning stock biomass (not total biomass) is greater than or equal to 50% of the average pre-exploitation spawning biomass after a further 35 years of fishing (i.e. 35 years from each year of assessment), with the additional condition that there is less than a 10% probability that the spawning biomass will decline below 20% of the pre-exploitation level at any time during this period. Current spawning stock biomass for Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea Region is estimated to be at 75% of the pre-exploitation level (95% Bayesian probability interval 71-78%), well above the 50% target reference point.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecosystem}} approach to fishing is encapsulated in Article II of the CAMLR Convention. The {{ecosystem approach}} utilizes decision rules based on both population status targets and on limit reference points and incorporates uncertainty and ecosystem {{status in the}} calculation of these targets. Different reference points {{to account for the}} needs of dependent predators in the ecosystem are used depending on the location of the species in the food web. The ecosystem fisheries management approach by CCAMLR involves use of move-on rules to protect trophic interactions, and limit direct effects of fishing on fish bycatch, seabirds and Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). There are annually reviewed mitigation measures such as line weighting and streamer lines to minimize seabird bycatch which have resulted in a substantial reduction in accidental seabird mortalities in the CAMLR Convention Area. The 50% (target) and 20% (limit) reference points used by the CCAMLR decision rules exceed the requirements for target and limit reference points set by almost all national and international fisheries management organizations, even for species longer lived than toothfish. A wide study of many fisheries generally indicated that most reach maximum sustainable yield at 30-35% of their pre-exploitation abundances. CCAMLR uses a more conservative reference level to allow exploitation at a level where toothfish recruitment and the ecosystem in general is not appreciably impacted. This is required by Article II of the CAMLR Convention. A common misunderstanding of the CCAMLR decision rules is an assumption that the decline in population size will follow a clear trajectory from the starting year to a point 35 years later when the <b>stock</b> <b>size</b> will reach 50% of pre-exploitation levels and an assumption that there is no feedback during each assessment. The catch limit however is re-calculated based on all updated or revised data at each annual or biennual assessment. This approach is used to ensure that the 50% level will be approached slowly and enables an ongoing readjustment of catch levels as knowledge improves.|$|E

The <b>stock</b> <b>sizes</b> and landings of fish are calculated for each fishing period and the net present values of profits from fishing are determined for time periods prior to and after the change in population dynamics. Results show that reduced growth rates or carrying capacities both lead to lower stock levels and consequently to smaller catch sizes. There is only a small short-term economic impact on the fisheries but the long-term consequences are quite pronounced. In some cases, a higher fishing activity in the first few years after the change in population dynamics causes harvest sizes to remain stable despite diminishing <b>stock</b> <b>sizes.</b> This stabilizes the returns from fishing in the short run but veils the apparent negative long-term impact on the fisheries resulting from adversely affected stock dynamics.

40|$|Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Optimal policy {{recommendations}} from natural resource management models can involve fast-changing management interventions.

We examine how accounting for these costs changes optimal management strategies in static and time-varying environments. Increasing policy adjustment costs results in optimal approach paths to stationary optimal solutions that are more gradual but that rely on oscillatory convergence. In time-varying environments, including policy adjustment costs smoothes optimal management recommendations, resulting in decreased variation in effort levels on the stationary part of the optimal solution, but increased variation in optimal <b>stock</b> <b>sizes.</b> We conclude that accounting for policy adjustment costs in this way leads to management recommendations that in some ways would be simpler for managers to implement (more gradual approach paths), but in other ways more challenging (oscillatory convergence) and that can affect where environmental variability is expressed in model predictions (<b>stock</b> <b>sizes</b> versus effort levels) while not suppressing this variability altogether...|$|R
