40|$|In this paper, we show both {{theoretically}} and empirically {{that the}} size of over-the-counter (OTC) markets can be reduced without affecting individual net positions. First, we find that the networked nature of these markets generates an excess of notional obligations between the aggregate gross amount and the minimum amount required to satisfy each individual net position. Second, we show conditions under which such excess can be removed. We refer to this netting operation as compression and identify feasibility and effciency criteria, highlighting intermediation as the key element for excess levels. We show that a trade-off exists between the amount of notional that can be eliminated from the system and the conservation of original trading relationships. Third, we apply our framework to a unique and comprehensive transaction-level dataset on OTC derivatives including all firms based in the European Union. On average, we find that around 75 % of market gross notional relates to excess. While around 50 % can in general be removed via bilateral compression, more sophisticated multilateral compression approaches are substantially more effcient. In particular, we find that even the most conservative multilateral approach which <b>satisfies</b> <b>relationship</b> constraints can eliminate up to 98 % of excess in the markets...|$|E

Predictors of child care use, satisfaction with non-maternal care and confidence in the relationship and communication with caregivers are examined. Realising ideals predicted more hours of child care use, although not greater satisfaction. Those with the father or a grandparent as the caregiver were more satisfied, as were mothers with more progressive attitudes to child rearing and to maternal employment.

40|$|Abstract. A core {{problem in}} Model Driven Engineering is model {{consistency}} achievement: all models must <b>satisfy</b> <b>relationships</b> constraining them. Active consistency techniques monitor and control models edition for preventing inconsistencies, e. g., using automatic errors correction. The main problem {{of these approaches}} is that strict enforcement of consistency narrows the modeler’s possibilities for exploring conflicting or tradeoff solutions; this is just what temporaries inconsistencies enable. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach capitalizing on active consistency characteristics while allowing the user to edit inconsistent models in a managed mode: at any moment {{we are able to}} propose a sequence of modelling operations that, when executed, make the model consistent. The solution consists in defining a set of automatons capturing a sufficient part of the model state space for managing any inconsistent situation. We illustrate this approach on a consistency relationship implied by the application of a security design pattern impacting both class and sequence diagrams of a UML 2 model. ...|$|R

The full quark model wave functions are employed to numerically calculate the form factors to all relevant orders in (1 /m_c, 1 /m_s). The form factors obtained <b>satisfy</b> <b>relationships</b> {{expected from the}} heavy quark effective theory (HQET). The differential decay rates and branching fractions are calculated for transitions to the ground state {{and a number of}} excited states of Λ. The branching fraction of the semileptonic decay width to the total width of Λ_c has been calculated and compared with other theoretical estimates and experimental results. The branching fractions for Λ_c→Λ^* l^+ν_l→Σπ l^+ν_l and Λ_c→Λ^* l^+ν_l→ NK̅ l^+ν_l are also calculated. Apart from decays to the ground state Λ(1115), it is found that decays through the Λ(1405) provide {{a significant portion of the}} branching fraction Λ_c→ X_s lν_l. A new estimate for f=B(Λ_c^+→Λ l^+ν_l) /B(Λ_c^+→ X_s l^+ν_l) is obtained. Comment: 44 pages, 24 figures, submitted to Physical Review...|$|R

The research literature has frequently noted that parental involvement {{in the treatment of}} childhood EBD has a positive impact on outcomes in both school and community-based supports. The current study examined the relationship between parent involvement and school services received for children with emotional and behavioral needs. Parents of children with EBD were recruited from one large and two small on-line support groups. Results suggest that parents who reported satisfaction with school teams were more likely to receive research-based services and had a higher rate of school and community partnerships than those who were not <b>satisfied.</b> <b>Relationships</b> were found between the parent satisfaction with the schools and quality of communication, the severity of child behavior, and the level of parent stress.

40|$|The {{desertification}} process converts fuzzy {{numbers to}} crisp ones {{and is an}} important stage {{in the implementation of}} fuzzy systems. In many actual applications, we encounter cases, in which the observed or derived values of the variables are approximate, yet the variables themselves must satisfy a set of relationships dictated by physical principle. When the observed values do not <b>satisfy</b> the <b>relationships,</b> each value is adjusted until they <b>satisfy</b> the <b>relationships</b> among observed data indicating their mathematical dependence on one another. Hence, this study proposes a new method based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to defuzzify groups of fuzzy numbers. It also aims to assume that each observed value is an approximate number (or a fuzzy number) and the true value (crisp value) is found in the production possibility set of the DEA model. The proposed method partitions the fuzzy numbers and the relationships among these observed data are observed as constraints.
