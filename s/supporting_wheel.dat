50|$|W.J. Ewing {{implemented}} a monorail system, {{with only one}} rail and double flanged rail wheels, that had been proposed by William Thorold in a lecture to the British Association in 1868. This system avoided all those problems, since it was laid out {{along the side of}} a road, it took up very little land. Further, the road or balance wheel's main purpose was to balance the train and to keep it upright. The balancing wheel on the road carried only 4% or 5% of the load, it did not subtract much from the steel wheel-steel rail efficiency. As the track was on side of the road, it was no obstacle to vehicles crossing it. Further, since it was a monorail with a <b>supporting</b> <b>wheel</b> on the ground, the issue of curve resistance did not arise in Ewing System, since the wheels were placed on a single track only.|$|E
40|$|The CMS Silicon Barrel Detector is a {{subsystem}} of the CMS Tracker and {{consists of}} seven wheels. For the SiB 1 -Milestone, that was completed in Summer 1997, one of these wheels has been built and equipped with 14 working silicon microstrip detector modules and 112 dummy modules. The working modules consist of two detectors glued together each one having 1024 strips with a pitch of 50 micron that are read out by eight PreMux 128 Chips. In the dummy modules the Readout Electronics have been substituted by resistors simulating the heat load. The dummy silicon sensors have fiducial marks and were alligned with a precision of 5 micron.

40|$|Soil {{processing}} {{in plant}} production {{is a very}} impor-tant factor influencing the yield of a harvest. Also soil processing, not done {{in the right way}} and on time, re-duces the stability of yields and soil fertility. The main factor in soil processing is the clearing away of weeds, parasites and other diseases. Crucial also is the influ-ence of soil processing in the economical use of soil moisture. When producing huge amounts of crops, inap-propriate rainfall could have the main impact on yields. That is why we focus on the best results in reducing costs, lowering fuel consumption, time, working forces and soil consolidation. ANKEN et al. (1993) explain the requirements for studying the function of modern culti-vators. Similar conclusions were drawn by JÄGER and FUNK (1994). HŮLA and MAYER (1995) came to the same conclusions. They also examined in detail the fac-tors that influence the resistance of the working elements of the shovel cultivator. It is very important to know the exact weight and direction of forces over time Fx and Fz = f(t), because of finding out the impact of each factor on the need for energy during soil processing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Either the working parts of weeders or whole working sections have to be connected with a frame in order to follow the field’s surface independently and to achieve a constant depth of soil processing. This can be achieved thanks to the four-hinge mechanism (parallelogram or lever system). When designing the measuring equip-ment we took into account constructional solutions of one-hinge suspension with <b>supporting</b> <b>wheel</b> and the Device for measuring the forces influencing duckfoot share...|$|E

Although many foreign experts compare M-80A with Russian BMP-1, the Yugoslav IFV is a true original design. Unlike the BMP-1 which had 6 <b>support</b> <b>wheels</b> and was armed with 73 mm gun, M-80A had 5 <b>support</b> <b>wheels</b> and had 20 mm gun. M-80A incorporates numerous elements from the newer BMP-2 and the French AMX-10P giving it more power and better protection over its counterpart.

40|$|O estudo das tensões em colhedoras de forragens é imprescindível, uma vez que as condições de operação são muito variáveis e severas. Utilizou-se um sistema "datalogger" devidamente calibrado para medir as tensões, em função do tempo, numa colhedora de forragem. Foram desenvolvidos modelos matemáticos para obter a variação periódica dessas tensões, considerando-se a influência da roda de apoio e da velocidade angular do rotor de corte. O ajuste dos modelos foi verificado pelo coeficiente de determinação (R²). A variação periódica das tensões, em função do tempo, para os valores experimentais e teóricos, foi representada graficamente, utilizando-se da planilha eletrônica EXCEL. Observou-se que as menores amplitudes de tensões e os maiores períodos do ciclo corresponderam aos tratamentos que utilizaram a roda de apoio. A análise estatística mostrou que a velocidade angular do rotor de corte apresentou diferença significativa, {{conforme}} o Teste de Tukey, para 5 %. Com base nos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que os ciclos de tensões em colhedoras de forragens podem ser representados com bom ajuste por funções senoidais e que o uso da roda de apoio pode aumentar o tempo de serviço da colhedora. The {{study of}} stress in forage harvester is necessary, because the operation conditions are very different and rigorous. A calibrated datalogger system {{was used to measure}} the stress as function of time for a forage harvester. Mathematical models were developed to obtain the periodical variation of this stress by considering the influence of <b>support</b> <b>wheel</b> and the angular velocity of cutterheads. The agreement of these models was verified by the determination coefficient (R²). The periodical variation of stress as function of time for both experimental and theoretical values was graphically represented by using of the software EXCEL. It was observed that the minimal amplitude stress and the maximal periods of cycle corresponded to the treatments employed, which utilized the <b>support</b> <b>wheel.</b> The statistical analysis showed that the angular velocity of cutterheads presented significant difference, according to the Tukey Test for 5 %. Based on the obtained results was concluded that, the stress cycle can be represented by senoidal functions with an adequate agreement, and that the operation time of harvesters can be increased by using a <b>support</b> <b>wheel...</b>|$|R

The inadequate roll control was not greatly improved, retaining the wing warping of the Gastambide-Mengin. Ground handling and take-off / landing performance was improved, however, by revising the complex inadequate quadricycle undercarriage of the Gastambide-Mengin, with strut <b>supported</b> <b>wheels</b> forward and aft on the centre-line and side-by-side wheels midway between the singles.
