60|$|The Uggards are, or fancy themselves, a warlike race: {{nowhere in}} those distant seas {{are there any}} islanders so vain of their {{military}} power, the consciousness of which they acquired chiefly by fighting one another. Many years ago, however, they had a war {{with the people of}} another island kingdom, called Wug. The Wuggards held dominion over a third island, Scamadumclitchclitch, whose people had tried to throw off the yoke. In order to subdue them--at least to tears--it was decided to deprive them of garlic, the <b>sole</b> <b>article</b> of diet known to them and the Wuggards, and in that country dug out of the ground like coal. So the Wuggards in the rebellious island stopped up all the garlic mines, supplying their own needs by purchase from foreign trading proas. Having few cowrie shells, with which to purchase, the poor Scamadumclitchclitchians suffered a great distress, which so touched the hearts of the compassionate Uggards--a most humane and conscientious people--that they declared war against the Wuggards and sent a fleet of proas to the relief of the sufferers. The fleet established a strict blockade of every port in Scamadumclitchclitch, and not a clove of garlic could enter the island. That compelled the Wuggard army of occupation to reopen the mines for its own subsistence.|$|E
6000|$|There is a franker cheerfulness--though {{certainly}} a proper amount of that forlornness which lurks about every object {{to which the}} Campagna forms a background--in the primitive little taverns where, on the homeward stretch, in the waning light, you are often glad to rein up and demand a bottle of their best. Their best and their worst are indeed the same, though with a shifting price, and plain vino bianco or vino rosso (rarely both) is the <b>sole</b> <b>article</b> of refreshment in which they deal. There is a ragged bush over the door, and within, under a dusky vault, on crooked cobble-stones, sit half-a-dozen contadini in their indigo jackets and goatskin breeches and with their elbows on the table. There is generally a rabble of infantile beggars at the door, pretty enough in their dusty rags, with their fine eyes and intense Italian smile, to make you forget your private vow of doing your individual best I to make these people, whom you like so much, unlearn their old vices. Was Porta Pia bombarded three years ago that Peppino should still grow up to whine for a copper? But the Italian shells had no direct message for Peppino's stomach--and {{you are going to}} a dinner-party at a villa. So Peppino [...] "points" [...] an instant for the copper in the dust and grows up a Roman beggar. The whole little place represents the most primitive form of hostelry; but along any of the roads leading out of the city you may find establishments of a higher type, with Garibaldi, superbly mounted and foreshortened, painted on the wall, or a lady in a low-necked dress opening a fictive lattice with irresistible hospitality, and a yard with the classic vine-wreathed arbour casting thin shadows upon benches and tables draped and cushioned with the white dust from which the highways from the gates borrow most of their local colour. None the less, I say, you avoid the highroads, and, if you are a person of taste, don't grumble at the occasional need of following the walls of the city. City walls, to a properly constituted American, can never be an object of indifference; and it is emphatically [...] "no end of a sensation" [...] to pace in the shadow of this massive cincture of Rome. I have found myself, as I skirted its base, talking of trivial things, but never without a sudden reflection on the deplorable impermanence of first impressions. A twelvemonth ago the raw plank fences of a Boston suburb, inscribed with the virtues of healing drugs, bristled along my horizon: now I glance with idle eyes at a compacted antiquity in which a more learned sense may read portentous dates and signs--Servius, Aurelius, Honorius. But even to idle eyes the prodigious, the continuous thing bristles with eloquent passages. In some places, where the huge brickwork is black with time and certain strange square towers look down at you with still blue eyes, the Roman sky peering through lidless loopholes, and there is nothing but white dust in the road and solitude in the air, I might take myself for a wandering Tartar touching on the confines of the Celestial Empire. The wall of China must have very much such a gaunt robustness. The colour of the Roman ramparts is everywhere fine, and their rugged patchwork has been subdued by time and weather into a mellow harmony that the brush only asks to catch up. On the northern side of the city, behind the Vatican, St. Peter's and the Trastevere, I have seen them glowing in the late afternoon with the tones of ancient bronze and rusty gold. Here at various points they are embossed with the Papal insignia, the tiara with its flying bands and crossed keys; to the high style of which the grace that attaches to almost any lost cause--even if not quite the [...] "tender" [...] grace of a day that is dead--considerably adds a style. With the dome of St. Peter's resting on their cornice and the hugely clustered architecture of the Vatican rising from them as from a terrace, they seem indeed the valid bulwark of an ecclesiastical city. Vain bulwark, alas! sighs the sentimental tourist, fresh from the meagre entertainment of this latter Holy Week. But he may find monumental consolation in this neighbourhood at a source where, as I pass, I never fail to apply for it. At half-an-hour's walk beyond Porta San Pancrazio, beneath the wall of the Villa Doria, is a delightfully pompous ecclesiastical gateway of the seventeenth century, erected by Paul V to commemorate his restoration of the aqueducts through which the stream bearing his name flows towards the fine florid portico protecting its clear- sheeted outgush on the crest of the Janiculan. It arches across the road in the most ornamental manner of the period, and one can hardly pause before it without seeming to assist at a ten minutes' revival of old Italy--without feeling as if one were in a cocked hat and sword and were coming up to Rome, in another mood than Luther's, with a letter of recommendation to the mistress of a cardinal.|$|E

40|$|Citation: Allingham, Grace. Milk. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1904. Introduction: The use of milk {{is general}} and {{not limited to}} any class or locality; it is {{regarded}} as a necessity by almost every family and because of this, we cannot glean too much information regarding it. This is doubly important when we think of the failure of Americans to appreciate the food value of milk and its products. Although {{this is one of the}} greatest dairy countries in the world, it does not lead in the per capita consumption of dairy products. In some of the older European countries two or three times as much milk and cheese is consumed per capita as in the United States. However, the average consumption of milk is high in many parts of this country, and, assisted by improved methods of production and transportation, it seems to be increasing. Milk contains all the ingredients needed for nourishment; that is, it furnishes the materials which build up the body and keep it in repair, and also those which supply it with fuel to keep it warm. and to furnish the energy needed to do its work. It is not a perfect food, but it is a complete food; that is, it contains all the food elements but not in the proportion needed. However, it is the most nearly perfect food, and is one of the best types of what may be termed a well-balanced food. It is not only the best, but one of the cheapest of human foods, especially as a source of proteid. But its use as a food is not fully appreciated. It should be regarded as a regular article of diet, as bread, meat and vegetables, remembering, of course, that the diet of the adult must not contain so large a percentage as that of a child.

40|$|O objetivo da presente dissertação é contribuir para o aprimoramento do debate que se trava, desde a promulgação da Constituição de 1988, sobre a cooperação preconizada pelo parágrafo único do artigo 23, como forma de se realizar as tarefas administrativas comuns a todos os quatro entes federados. Com efeito, avaliamos não só as competências contidas na atual Constituição - demonstrando que a competência comum é autônoma e, portanto, ao lado das demais, estabelece o regime atual de repartição constitucional de competências - como, também, as principais normas constitucionais relacionadas com as Cartas Políticas anteriores, com o intuito de construir um raciocínio que nos conduza ao modelo atual de cooperação advindo do acima mencionado parágrafo único do artigo 23. A partir daquela metodologia, constatamos que esse agir estatal cooperado estabelecido pela Constituição de 1988, não obstante possuir raízes nas Constituições anteriores, é inovador e contemporâneo, refletindo o regime cooperativo estatal de agir previsto nos artigos 91 a e 91 b da Lei Fundamental de Bonn, com a redação que lhes conferiu a reforma de 1969. A cooperação será voluntária até a edição da lei complementar anunciada pelo parágrafo único do artigo 23 da Carta de 1988. Após, será ela obrigatória, mas esta obrigatoriedade somente surtirá efeitos a partir do momento em que os entes federados façam a opção pelo agir integrado, ou seja, desde que optem por realizar as tarefas administrativas comuns de forma cooperada, pois aquela lei complementar não tem autorização constitucional para estabelecer normas que reflitam qualquer tipo de subordinação, já que isso violaria a autonomia política a eles constitucionalmente assegurada. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to present a contribution to the juridical debate over the issue of cooperation, between the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities, to carry out common administrative functions assigned to federal, state and local governments. This legal discussion has been troublesome since the promulgation of the Federal Constitution of 1988, which introduced a provision, in the <b>sole</b> paragraph of <b>article</b> 23, to regulate the matter of cooperation between the four public entities comprised in the Federative Republic of Brazil. As a matter of fact, this study not only analyzes the power (or authority) granted by the Constitution of 1988, in common, to the four above mentioned public entities, but also evaluates provisions of former Brazilian Constitutions dealing with that subject to devise a legal perspective on the cooperative model introduced under the rule of the <b>sole</b> paragraph of <b>article</b> 23. Hence, it demonstrates that common power (or authority) is autonomous and constitutes, with other forms of governmental authority, part of the constitutional framework of separation of powers. Based on such premises the conclusion of this essay purports that, notwithstanding the fact that cooperation between public entities has its roots in past Brazilian constitutional regulations, the form of cooperative action designed by the Constitution of 1988 is innovative and up- to-date, reflecting the model of state cooperative form of action introduced in Germany, during the constitutional reform of 1969, through the discipline of articles 91 a and 91 b of the German Constitution. Cooperation between the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities shall be voluntary until the enactment of a Supplementary Law prescribed in the rule of the <b>sole</b> paragraph of <b>article</b> 23 of the Brazilian Constitution. After the passing of such legislation cooperation shall became mandatory, if the public entities involved decide to carry out common administrative tasks in a combined fashion. It is to be noticed, however, that the Supplementary Law referred in the <b>sole</b> paragraph of <b>article</b> 23 shall not establish any kind of subordination or hierarchy between the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities due to constitutional provisions granting political autonomy to each of those entities...|$|R

Key words: author order, co-authorship, production of science. A cornerstone of economic theory is the be-lief that rational economic agents respond to the incentives with which they are presented. Labor economists have extended this theory to consider how individuals respond to the incentives provided by the remuneration sys-tems they face at their places of employment. Following such theory, it is held that ratio-nal agents are more likely to participate in those activities for which they receive the high-est relative return. For academics, an inter-esting focus of this line of research is the economic return to measurable aspects of the publication process. For instance, within the economics literature, Graves, Marchand, and Sexton; Moore, Newman, and Turnbull (1998), and Sauer examine the economic return to publishing in different quality journals, while Moore, Newman, and Turnbull (2001) and Sauer examine the economic return to col-laboration.

40|$|The Eurozone {{official}} {{sector has}} {{declared that the}} belated restructuring of Greek bonds held by private sector creditors in 2012 was a “unique and exceptional” event, never, ever to be repeated in any other Eurozone country. Maybe so. But if this assurance proves in time to be as fragile as the official sector’s prior pronouncements {{on the subject of}} “private sector involvement” in Eurozone sovereign debt problems, any future Eurozone debt restructuring will be surely plagued by the problem of non-participating creditors [...] - holdouts. Indeed, it is the undisguised fear of holdouts and the prospect of a messy, Argentine-style debt restructuring in the belly of Europe that {{has been one of the}} principal motivations for the official sector’s willingness to use its taxpayer money to repay, in full and on time, all of the private sector creditors of Eurozone countries receiving bailouts (the belated Greek restructuring being the <b>sole</b> exception). This <b>article</b> argues that a simple amendment of the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (the Eurozone’s new bailout facility) could immunize within the confines of the Eurozone the assets of a Eurozone country receiving ESM bailout assistance from attachment by litigious holdout creditors. By thus increasing the difficulties that holdouts would face in enforcing court judgments against a debtor country, the objective of the amendment is to deflate creditor expectations that staying out of an ESM-supported sovereign debt restructuring will lead to a preferential recovery for the holdouts. This measure would also, when taken together with the other steps that the Eurozone has already implemented, substantially replicate the important features of the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism proposed by the IMF in 2002...|$|R
5000|$|The Amnesty Law, {{organized}} into five chapters (which was considered highly satisfactory by {{the victims of}} political persecution) guarantees the following amnesty rights: the declaration {{of the status of}} political amnesty recipient; financial reparations; assurance, for all official purposes, that the period of time in which they were forced to stop their professional activities due to punishment or threat of punishment will count as valid; the conclusion of courses interrupted due to punishment or the validation of diplomas obtained by those who completed courses at teaching institutes outside the country; and the right to reinstatement for punished civil servants and public employees. In the <b>sole</b> paragraph of <b>article</b> 1, the law guarantees those who were removed from their jobs by administrative cases, based on emergency legislation, without the right to contest the case or defend themselves, and prevented from knowing the motives and grounds for the decision, reinstatement to their positions (due to the age of the claimants, this reinstatement has occurred, in practice, in retirement). The law also lists in detail all the punishments that entitle victims to the status of recipients of political amnesty, and it states that financial reparations, provided for in chapter III, may be paid in two different ways: in a single installment, consisting of the payment of 30 times the minimum monthly wage per year of punishment for those who cannot prove an employment relationship, and whose value may not, under any circumstances, exceed 100,000 reais or in permanent and continuous monthly installments, guaranteed to those who can prove an employment relationship. According to the law, each victim of political persecution has the right to receive the outstanding amounts up until five years before the date of their request claiming amnesty.|$|R
40|$|This book {{discusses}} {{the role of}} public policy in Article 81 of the EC Treaty. The Commission, and recently the Court of First Instance {{have said that the}} <b>sole</b> objective of <b>Article</b> 81 EC is consumer welfare. Many competition lawyers and economists support this view. Writing in a crisp, plain style, Townley demonstrates that public policy considerations are still relevant in that provision. He also examines how and where they are currently considered and then suggests why, how and where this might be changed. The book explains how some of the most complex competition law cases can be understood and offers a framework for those fighting or deciding such cases in the future. As such, it will be of interest to European competition lawyers, both academics and practitioners (furnishing them with a framework for hard cases), as well as students, seeking a deeper understanding of how the European competition rules work and how they interact both with European Union and Member State public policy goals. It will also help competition economists by revealing the mechanisms through which public policy considerations impact upon the consumer welfare test in European law.
