5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of <b>spawning</b> varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad {{development}} indicating that <b>spawning</b> in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while <b>spawning</b> in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. <b>Spawning</b> takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The <b>spawning</b> takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the <b>spawning</b> season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E
5|$|Synchronous <b>spawning</b> is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when {{multiple}} species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This synchrony is essential so male and female gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous <b>spawning</b> may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The <b>spawning</b> event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>spawning</b> {{season for}} bigfin reef squids usually begins in May, but they lay eggs {{all year round}} and <b>spawning</b> seasons can vary by location. A single female can spawn {{more than once in}} her lifetime. Females can release 20 to 1180 eggs per {{individual}} and will die soon afterwards.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spawn</b> {{abilities}}: <b>Spawn</b> {{abilities are}} like blade abilities {{except that they}} are activated in the <b>spawn</b> phase by paying <b>spawn</b> points and sometimes may only be activated when in specific cells on the board.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawn</b> camping is a {{practice}} where a player waits near precise <b>spawn</b> points to kill enemies as they <b>spawn.</b> This is usually {{considered to be}} poor sportsmanship and some players even perceive it to be exploitative of the game itself. Most team-based games {{have some kind of}} protection against <b>spawn</b> camping, such as a one-way door that only allows players to leave the <b>spawn</b> area, permanent AI defences or perhaps a timer which kills enemies if they spend too long around the <b>spawn</b> area. Games with capturable <b>spawn</b> points will often leave some <b>spawn</b> points without this sort of camping protection. <b>Spawn</b> points for game objects are often abused in a similar fashion in game types such as role-playing games.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawn</b> Cost: The {{minimum amount}} of <b>spawn</b> points a player has to spend to <b>spawn</b> the miniature. At the {{beginning}} of each turn, each player rolls one die, and the total represents the number of <b>spawn</b> points available for that turn.|$|R
5|$|The spermatophores usually remain {{embedded}} {{near the}} mouth of the female. Mating usually occurs well before <b>spawning,</b> but may also happen on the <b>spawning</b> grounds themselves. In those cases, the male will stay near the female's side as she lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to <b>spawning,</b> resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring <b>spawning</b> period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spawn</b> {{points are}} areas in a level where players <b>spawn.</b> In levels {{designed}} for team play, these points are usually grouped {{so that each}} team <b>spawns</b> in their own tight area of the level. <b>Spawn</b> points are typically reserved for one team {{at any time and}} often have the ability to change hands to the other team. Some games even allow <b>spawn</b> points to be created by players; using a beacon for example in Battlefield 2142. [...] "Odd" [...] <b>spawn</b> points cause the player to be <b>spawned</b> as if actively entering the game world, rather than merely appearing there.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawn</b> {{trapping}} is {{the act of}} {{camping in}} an advantageous position {{in the vicinity of}} an enemies <b>spawn</b> and killing them as soon as they leave the <b>spawn,</b> or their <b>spawn</b> protection runs out. Base trapping {{can also be used to}} describe this act.|$|R
50|$|Some {{games have}} <b>spawn</b> {{protection}} systems, giving newly <b>spawned</b> players invulnerability, or respawning {{them in an}} area close to the <b>spawn.</b> Another mechanism employed in games is 'point spawning', in which a player is <b>spawned</b> near a teammate and not at a specific location.|$|R
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the species from {{becoming}} extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible <b>spawning</b> areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring <b>spawning</b> areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is {{to survive in the}} wild.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eight fungal and one {{bacterial}} contaminants from naturally contaminated <b>spawn</b> of {{oyster mushroom}} were isolated and identified. These were Aspergillus ffavus var. cotumneris, A. niger, Alternaria alternata, Penicillium janthinellum, Penicillium spp., Rhizopus stotoniter, Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride and Bacillus brevis. Month-wise variation in <b>spawn</b> contaminations caused by various {{fungal and bacterial}} contaminants was observed. The contamination was the highest during the monsoon season (28. 57 %) followed by pre-monsoon (21. 90 %). Type of substrates {{was found to have}} influence on <b>spawn</b> contamination. Paddy grain based <b>spawn</b> recorded significantly lowest (15. 00 %) contamination as compared to wheat grain based (30. 00 %) <b>spawn.</b> Key words: <b>Spawn,</b> oyster mushroom Contamination of cereal grain based <b>spawn</b> caused by various mycoparasites has been constantly reported from many countries (Bitner, 1971; Biserka, 1972 and Suman and Jandaik, 1992). As a result, <b>spawn</b> manufacturers usually lose 15 - 20 % <b>spawn</b> due to spoilage caused by different contaminants (Suman and Jandaik, 1992; Ahlawat et al., 1999). Hence the spoilage of <b>spawn</b> due to some fungal and bacterial contaminants is considered {{to be one of the}} biggest constraints faced by the <b>spawn</b> producing laboratories. Considering the importance of this aspect the present study was undertaken to determine the type and extent of contamination of mushroom <b>spawn</b> bags and also to find out the effect of different factors affecting their incidence...|$|R

5|$|The oceangoing (anadromous) form, {{including}} those returning for <b>spawning,</b> {{are known as}} steelhead in Canada and the U.S. In Tasmania they are commercially propagated in sea cages and are known as ocean trout, although {{they are the same}} species.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly <b>spawning</b> {{an area of}} low pressure. Upon {{the formation of the}} low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, <b>spawning</b> Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The low developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Bald eagles {{will also}} congregate in certain {{locations}} in winter. From November until February, {{one to two}} thousand birds winter in Squamish, British Columbia, about halfway between Vancouver and Whistler. The birds primarily gather along the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers, attracted by the salmon <b>spawning</b> in the area.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first issue}} of <b>Spawn</b> was very popular with sales of 1.7 million copies. During <b>Spawns</b> second year of publication, Wizard noted that [...] "The top dog at Image is {{undoubtedly}} Todd McFarlanes <b>Spawn,</b> which, without the added marketing push of fancy covers, polybagged issues, or card inserts has become the best-selling comic {{on a consistent basis}} that is currently being published." [...] Sales slumped around the time of <b>Spawn</b> #25, but by <b>Spawn</b> #45 it was again a consistently strong seller.|$|R
5|$|Brooding {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. Synchronous <b>spawning</b> events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E
5|$|From {{late morning}} to early afternoon, another squall line moved through {{northern}} parts of Mississippi and Alabama as high wind shear and low-level moisture persisted. However, this time several discrete supercells developed along {{and in front}} of the line, <b>spawning</b> seven weak tornadoes across Morgan, Limestone, and Madison Counties in northern Alabama around noon that day.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from <b>spawning</b> altogether.|$|E
