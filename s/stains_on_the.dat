5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> laundry at Frank's house.|$|E
5|$|Ron (Nick Offerman) sends Leslie (Amy Poehler) to run {{an errand}} at the DMV in Pawnee Hall's fourth floor, a dark and unsettling place that {{includes}} probation offices and divorce filings. A reluctant and frightened Leslie navigates past reprobates and blood <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and spots Tom (Aziz Ansari) leaving the divorce office with his wife Wendy (Jama Williamson). Unaware that their relationship was a green card marriage to prevent Wendy from being deported back to Canada, Leslie later tries to comfort Tom, who insists he is fine. Nevertheless, Leslie persists in her efforts to cheer him up, in part by ordering a singing horse telegram to cheer him up. Ron, who knows about Tom's fake marriage, suggests Tom act sad so Leslie can feel like she cheered him up. When Leslie sets up a social event to cheer him up, Tom suggests a strip club, but Leslie follows Jerry's (Jim O'Heir) suggestion {{they go to the}} dinosaur-themed restaurant, Jurassic Fork.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, {{it emerged}} that red <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hand wraps Margarito {{used in the}} Cotto fight were similar to the <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inserts seized before the Mosley fight. This has raised suspicions that Margarito's gloves were loaded for that fight and {{possibly}} others as well.|$|E

25|$|The key {{evidence}} supporting this allegation was the jumpsuit, {{as well as}} a highly contentious forensic report claiming to have found evidence of foetal haemoglobin in <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front seat of the Chamberlains' 1977 Torana hatchback. Foetal haemoglobin is present in infants six months and younger; Azaria was nine weeks old {{at the time of her}} disappearance.|$|E
25|$|There was {{considerable}} media attention regarding the apparently trivial and possibly unhygienic {{elements of the}} installation, such as yellow <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bedsheets, condoms, empty cigarette packets, {{and a pair of}} knickers with menstrual stains. The bed was presented as it had been when she had stayed in it for several days, feeling suicidal because of relationship difficulties.|$|E

25|$|The {{court was}} also told that DNA {{evidence}} had confirmed that semen <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red towel covering Douty's body came from Butler {{and that the}} chances of another person having the same profile were 1 in 23 × 1015. Dr Kary Mullis, who won a Nobel Prize {{for his work on}} DNA replication, advised the defence throughout the trial, but was not called to testify.|$|E
25|$|The sloping {{corridor}} {{beyond the}} entrance was partially filled with rubble. Since the secondary wall {{was built on}} top of material originating from this rubble, the fill seems to date {{from the time of}} the original interment. By 1907 this rubble had spread down into the burial chamber. <b>Stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and walls of the corridor indicate that water had infiltrated the tomb in the past.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reddish <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shroud {{suggesting}} blood, {{but it is}} uncertain whether these stains were produced {{at the same time}} as the image, or afterwards. McCrone (see painting hypothesis) identified these as containing iron oxide, theorizing that its presence was likely due to simple pigment materials used in medieval times. Other researchers, including Alan Adler, identified the reddish stains as blood and interpreted the iron oxide as a natural residue of hemoglobin.|$|E

25|$|As an oxidant, {{silver nitrate}} should be {{properly}} stored away from organic compounds. Despite its common usage in extremely low concentrations to prevent gonorrhea and control nose bleeds, silver nitrate {{is still very}} much toxic and corrosive. Brief exposure will not produce any immediate side effects other than the purple, brown or black <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skin, but upon constant exposure to high concentrations, side effects will be noticeable, which include burns. Long-term exposure may cause eye damage. Silver nitrate is known to be a skin and eye irritant. Silver nitrate has not been thoroughly investigated for potential carcinogenic effect.|$|E
25|$|The Athabasca River {{cuts through}} the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily {{observed}} as black <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river banks. Since portions of the Athabasca sands are shallow enough to be surface-mineable, they were the earliest ones to see development. Historically, the bitumen was used by the indigenous Cree and Dene Aboriginal peoples to waterproof their canoes. The Athabasca oil sands first {{came to the attention of}} European fur traders in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the Hudson's Bay Company post at York Factory on Hudson Bay.|$|E
25|$|During the trial, a {{mattress}} {{was presented to}} court, supposedly stained with Anwar's semen. This was submitted as DNA evidence of Anwar's sexual acts. Anwar denied having {{anything to do with}} the mattress, although the DNA tests came out positive. Lim Kong Boon, a DNA chemist, testified during the trial that DNA taken from 10 of 13 semen <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mattress matched Anwar's DNA. The defence team implied that DNA samples may have been taken from Anwar, while unconscious, after his beating in police custody, to create false forensics evidence to frame Anwar; however, High Court Judge Augustine Paul accepted that DNA evidence.|$|E

25|$|Only {{two species}} present erect leaves {{and are the}} only ones {{frequently}} found as lithophytes, Scuticaria irwiniana, easily known recognized because of its flowers without any <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> internally entirely purple and externally whitish sepals and petals, with white labellum, striped of purple. This species generally can be identified even without flowers because of its reptant, slightly ascendant growth, and longer rhizome than any other species. Scuticaria strictifolia also has erect leaves but occasionally, when cultivated under insufficient light, their leaves can be narrower and slightly bent making the distracted observer find hard to differentiate it from S. hadwenii. The Brazilian taxonomist Guido Pabst considered this species a variety of the later.|$|E
25|$|When a young Roman {{inadvertently}} {{fell through}} a cleft in the Esquiline hillside {{at the end}} of the 15th century, he found himself in a strange cave or grotta filled with painted figures. Soon the young artists of Rome were having themselves let down on boards knotted to ropes to see for themselves. The fourth style frescoes that were uncovered then have faded to pale gray <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plaster now, but the effect of these freshly rediscovered grottesche decorations was electrifying in the early Renaissance, which was just arriving in Rome. When Pinturicchio, Raphael and Michelangelo crawled underground and were let down shafts to study them, carving their names on the walls to let the world know they had been there, the paintings were a revelation of the true world of antiquity. Beside the graffiti signatures of later tourists, like Casanova and the Marquis de Sade scratched into a fresco inches apart (British Archaeology June 1999), are the autographs of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Martin van Heemskerck, and Filippino Lippi.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E

25|$|The same {{afternoon}} police {{searched the}} Leik family's basement, Collins {{was confronted with}} evidence thus far gained and deduced. Although Collins burst into tears when informed the <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor covered with paint had been varnish, he quickly regained his composure and continued to deny any knowledge of Karen Sue Beineman. Later that day, having received initial laboratory reports indicating the hair samples recovered from Beineman's panties matched those discovered in Leik's basement, and that the bloodstains recovered from this location were of the same type as hers, Collins was arrested and his apartment and vehicles thoroughly searched. Despite recovering numerous stolen items from his apartment and being informed by Arnold Davis that Collins {{had been in the}} habit of committing burglaries with a former roommate of theirs named Andrew Manuel, no incriminating evidence linking Collins to Beineman or any victim of the Michigan Murders was discovered, although officers were informed by Arnold Davis on this date of the incident two days earlier in which he (Davis) had observed Collins carrying a laundry box containing women's clothing and jewelry from his apartment and towards his car.|$|E
500|$|Tunnel {{construction}} {{was completed in}} June 1990, and was celebrated with a soft opening of Pioneer Square station and the re-opening of Prefontaine Park. During preparation for the resurfacing of 3rd Avenue above the new tunnel station, workers discovered an [...] cable car flywheel that had been buried after service on the Yesler Way line ceased in 1940. The flywheel was later restored {{and placed in the}} south mezzanine of Pioneer Square station. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. At the time of its opening, Pioneer Square station had the longest and steepest escalator west of the Mississippi River. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. [...] During its early months, Pioneer Square and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later fixed by Metro contractors, but remained visible in the form of rust <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> station ceiling.|$|E
500|$|Burgess shale type {{preservation}} {{is defined}} as the fossilization of non-biomineralized organisms as flattened carbonaceous films in marine shales. When the animals started to decompose, their tissues collapsed {{under the weight of the}} sediment that buried them. The typical flattened fossils are outlines of tougher parts such as cuticles and jaws, which resisted decomposition for long enough to be fossilized. Soft elements, such as muscles and gut contents, were sometimes squeezed out of the decomposing organism to produce dark <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fossils. Organisms that lack tougher structures, such as flatworms, nemerteans and shell-less molluscs, were not preserved by this process. Very soft but chemically active tissues may be preserved by different processes. For instance during decomposition, bacteria modify the chemically unusual mid-gut glands of some organisms into the durable mineral phosphate. This change happens extremely quickly, before the corpse is compressed, and leaves a three-dimensional mold of the tissues. Gills can also be preserved in something close to their original three-dimensional shape by this process. Both preservation mechanisms can appear in the same fossil. In Burgess-like shales, organisms and parts that are only quite soft, such as muscles, are generally lost, while those that are extremely soft and those that are fairly tough are preserved. The preservation of different body parts in different ways may sometimes help palaeontologists, by suggesting whether a body part was fairly tough like an arthropod limb (preserved as flat film) or very soft and chemically active, like a part of the gut (preserved as a solid piece of mineral). These differences may also help to identify fossils, by excluding from consideration organisms whose body parts do not match the combination of types of preservation found in a particular fossil bed.|$|E
