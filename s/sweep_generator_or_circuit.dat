5000|$|If {{the input}} signal were present, the {{resulting}} display {{would not be}} stable at the horizontal sweep's free-running frequency {{because it was not}} a submultiple of the input (vertical axis) signal. To fix that, the <b>sweep</b> <b>generator</b> would be synchronized by adding a scaled version of the input the signal to the <b>sweep</b> <b>generator's</b> comparator. The added signal would cause the comparator to trip a little earlier and thus synchronize it to the input signal. The operator could adjust the synch level; for some designs, the operator could choose the polarity. [...] The <b>sweep</b> <b>generator</b> would turn off (known as blanking) the beam during retrace.|$|R

40|$|Abstract　One of {{measuring}} apparatuses using a <b>sweep</b> <b>generator</b> is a swept frequency measurement system (SF) {{and the other}} is a spectrum analyzer (SA). Though the appearance of SF differs substantially from that of SA at a glance, we clarified that the output signal of SF is quite same as that of SA if the device under test is a filter used in SF. The analysis by FFT is almost equivalent to the numerical analysis of differential equations in the meaning of time complexity. If only the frequency characteristics of a device under test can be measured, the method using FFT is superior to the numerical analysis of differential equations...|$|R
5000|$|A pitch {{generator}} {{is a type}} {{of signal}} generator optimized for use in audio and acoustics applications. Pitch generators typically include sine waves over the audio frequency range (20 Hz - 20 kHz). Sophisticated pitch generators will also include <b>sweep</b> <b>generators</b> (a function which varies the output frequency over a range, in order to make frequency-domain measurements), multipitch generators (which output several pitches simultaneously, and are used to check for intermodulation distortion and other non-linear effects), and tone bursts (used to measure response to transients). Pitch generators are typically used in conjunction with sound level meters, when measuring the acoustics of a room or a sound reproduction system, and/or with oscilloscopes or specialized audio analyzers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{reflection}} coefficient measurement technique using a three-probe reflectometer was analyzed. Based {{on the results}} of the theoretical analysis, a very simple and low cost automated stepped frequency six-port reflectometer in the 7 GHz band was designed and manufactured. A six-port network was fabricated using a simple three-probe hybrid waveguide-coaxial structure and "off the shelf" waveguide components. An automatic measuring system was implemented by adding <b>sweep</b> <b>generator</b> and commercial power meters controlled by a PC computer. Calibration was implemented using the modified Neumeyer method. Measurements were made using few unknown loads and the achieved accuracy was 3 % in magnitude and 1 in the phase in the whole waveguide band. It was in good agreement with the theoretical prediction.
