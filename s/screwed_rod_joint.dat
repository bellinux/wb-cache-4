40|$|The {{significant}} {{features of}} screw transmission are effort-saving and self-locking. Based on this, a screw-rod-type actuator is proposed, which {{is driven by}} a nut swung spirally together with piezoelectric transducers. The actuator consists of three parts: a nut fastened to a hollow cylinder, a precise <b>screw</b> <b>rod,</b> and two orthogonal piezoelectric vibrators worked on d 33 mode. The <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> is forced to rotate and translate by traveling wave within the helical surface of nut, which is generated by two vibrators. First, the actuator’s running mechanism is preliminarily illustrated. Second, modal analysis and optimal design of the stator are performed through finite element method. Finally, the prototype actuator is manufactured and tested. The experimental results have proven that this driving manner is feasible, and the main characteristics are as follows: the stable working frequency is about at 9. 5 [*]kHz, and the maximum no-load speed and output force are approximately 61 [*]r/min and 2. 1 [*]N, respectively, under 300 [*]Vpp...|$|R

The hollow sucker rod’s characteristic is easy disassembling, multiple sealing, and also has a large contact area of the shoulder. By using the method of finite-element analysis, we set up the finite-element model and analyze the contact stress and deformation distribution of two kinds of structure in different friction coefficients. Through the analysis, we find not only the bearing capacity of the circular arc shoulder joint, but also the sealing is also better than the tapered shoulder's joint. And for both kinds of joints, the friction coefficient is an important factor to affect the pretightening force...|$|R

Multi-axial pedicle screw designs allow deviation of the screw {{away from the}} perpendicular to the longitudinal rod, which facilitates application of a screw-rod system such as PRIMA OCT into the curved spine.

30|$|Early {{reports of}} {{decompression}} and stabilization {{in patients with}} neurological deficit and thoracolumbar fracture demonstrated improvement that was {{equal to that of}} nonoperative results in the literature [28 – 34]. With the advent of newer instrumentation techniques and aggressive direct anterior decompression, the degree of neurological recovery appears more favorable than earlier reports [35 – 41]. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are two techniques that show good potential in terms of decreasing pain and improving function in osteoporotic low-energy compression and burst fractures. Early reports demonstrate these techniques to be highly effective with good pain relief and relatively few complications [42 – 46]. Primary goals in thoracolumbar trauma patients are preservation of remaining spinal cord function, restoration of spinal alignment, achievement of pain-free fracture site, maximum neurological recovery, and early rehabilitation. This can be achieved by optimizing neural decompression while providing stable internal fixation over the least number of spinal segments [47]. The pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> systems, by virtue of direct fixation through middle and anterior columns, are able to reduce fractures of these columns by ligamentotaxis [48 – 52]. Transpedicular <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> construct is currently the standard in segmental fixation of thoracolumbar spine [53 – 55]. Posterior surgery with pedicle screw constructs over a short segment stabilizes the fracture and allows early mobilization, much as nonoperative regimes do. Recent prospective randomized studies comparing these two treatment options suggest there is no clinical advantage of surgery over nonoperative care [56, 57].|$|R

Correction is obtained by posterior bending in situ of a <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> fixation. When the deformity is flexible, first we perform a posterior reduction and stabilization, and secondly an anterior approach for interbody fusion. When spine is rigid an anterior release with waiting bone graft is performed first followed by a second posterior reduction and stabilization. This strategy allows a real correction without the loss of correction in time. This technique is fast and safe as demonstrated in our series of 20 patients...|$|R

40|$|Glued-in rod {{connections}} for timber beams {{are increasingly}} being used, as they offer high strength and stiffness and a better appearance in comparison with traditional mechanical connections. First, a campaign of experimental tests on glued-in threaded steel <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to monotonic bending moments was carried out checking {{the effect of a}} confining system for the bars (transversal screws), the different arrangement of the rods or varying the mechanical characteristics of the steel of the bars. A negligible effect on joint ductility was observed using transversal screws whereas with a correct design and a proper choice of rod steel grade an important ductile behaviour was achieved. The experiments were then extended to cyclic tests so to emphasize the cyclic performance of glued-in <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> under bending moments. The aim was mainly to understand the joint structural response under cyclic loads, simulating the effects of seismic action. The test results indicate that the joint can initially develop a high dissipative capacity, but after a few cycles, the energy dissipation is considerably reduced by the occurrence of longitudinal splitting in the timber edge of the joining bars leading to lateral instability of the rods...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Lately {{consensus}} is evolving {{around the world}} for stabilization of spine with instrumentation in cases of thoracolumbar burst fractures allowing early mobilization aiding limitation of neurological injury and restoring spinal stability. The use of pedicular <b>screws</b> and <b>rod</b> system and titanium cage allows adequate 3 dimensional control of each motion segment and allows rigid fixation. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the mode, level, efficacy of posterior stabilization with pedicle <b>screw</b> and <b>rod</b> system and anterior fusion with titanium cage, the radiological, neurological and functional out come in order to recreate a stable pain free spinal column.

40|$|With the {{increased}} incidence of road traffic accidents and industrial trauma, {{there has been}} {{a significant increase in the}} number of thoraco - lumbar spinal injuries. Decompression and early fusion with instrumentation is a generally accepted treatment meth od for patients with unstable injuries and with a neurological deficit; it helps in early mobilization, and avoids the complications of prolonged recumbency. The pedicle <b>screw</b> - <b>rod</b> system is versatile in that it stabilizes the three columns of the spine. Th e pedicle is the strongest part of the vertebra and is the force nucleus of the vertebral body. Through the pedicle all forces are transmitted from posterior elements to the vertebral body. Therefore, by fixation of the vertebral body through the pedicle, significant strength of the entire vertebral complex is possible. In our study we operated on 28 patients of unstable thoraco - lumbar injuries, where we performed Moss - Miami instrumentation (pedicular <b>screw</b> <b>rod</b> fixation). All the cases were followed up for a minimum of one year. In all these cases we had favorable results. There was a reduction of an average pre - op kyphotic angle of 15. 8 º to an average post - op kyphotic angle of 6. 6 º. W e also noted significant neurological improvement as assessed by Frankel g rading. In this study, we found that the t ranspedicular fixation with <b>screws</b> and <b>rods</b> system is effective in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar spinal injuries. Although the prognosis of the neurological injury seems to be largely determined at the ti me of trauma, surgical decompression will definitely improve the neurologic deficit in incomplete cord injuries.

40|$|Scoliosis is {{a spinal}} {{deformity}} characterised by lateral curvatures of the spine. It typically occurs during adolescence, but in rare incidences {{can occur in}} young children. In adolescents, if severe or progressive, surgical treatment {{in the form of}} spinal fusion using <b>screw</b> and <b>rod</b> constructs may take place. However, in younger patients the spine and lungs are still growing, therefore, fusion is not recommended before the age of eight years. For early onset scoliosis fusionless techniques are used, with the current gold standard being traditional growing <b>rods,</b> incorporating pedicle <b>screws</b> and <b>rods,</b> which are periodically lengthened through frequent surgical interventions. Due to the number surgeries throughout the treatment period, this treatment suffers from high complication rates. As this treatment is far from ideal, alternative treatments are being explored to reduce these issues. This thesis describes the initial development of an alternative implant for the treatment of early onset scoliosis to alleviate the issues of traditional growing rods. The implant was based on a pedicle <b>screw</b> and <b>rod</b> system, but incorporated a bearing component to allow free extension of the construct without the need for further surgery. The development of the implant design was achieved through finite element analysis of individual components and of constructs using contact conditions.

The use of basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) rods would result in lower weight of the joint and improved resistance to corrosion but {{there appears to be}} little or no investigation on the use of these rods in the bonded-in rod technique. The aim of this research was to examine the behaviour of bonded-in BFRP and steel rods and to propose design models to enhance current knowledge in bonded-in rod technology. The mechanical properties of the timber members were characterised so as to predict the behaviour of donor and spliced beams for the proposed stressed model. Pull-out tests of the rods were conducted to investigate some factors that affect joint capacity and based of the results bonded-in rod timber beams were fabricated and tested for ultimate capacity and flexural stiffness. An analytical model based on the interfacial tress-strain interaction of the BFRP rods with the adhesive layer and the timber members was developed to predict pull-out capacity of the samples. Average shear strength from steel pull-out tests was also used to propose a design equation for pull-out capacity of steel samples. In both the BFRP and steel samples, good agreement with the tests results was observed. A trapezoidal timber compressive stress model was developed to predict ultimate moment capacities of steel and BFRP timber beams. Good agreement was found between the theoretical and bonded-in steel rod beams whereas results form bonded-in BFRP rod beams were lower due to tensile splitting. Bonded-in steel beams recorded higher stiffness than the theoretical stiffness, whereas there was strong agreement between the theoretical predictions and BFRP beam tests.
