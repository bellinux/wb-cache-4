40|$|Single-wall carbon {{nanotube}} deposition on the cladding of optical fibers {{has been carried}} out to fabricate an all-fiber nonlinear device. Two different nanotube deposition techniques were studied. The first consisted of repeatedly immersing the optical fiber into a nanotube <b>supension,</b> increasing the thickness of the coating in each step. The second deposition involved wrapping a thin film of nanotubes around the optical fiber. For both cases, interaction of transmitted light through the fiber core with the external coating was assisted by the cladding mode resonances of a tilted fiber Bragg grating. Ultrafast nonlinear effects of the nanotube-coated fiber were measured by means of a pump- probe pulses experiment. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Suspensions of {{superheated}} superconducting grains are a detecting composite material. Each grain in the <b>supension</b> is a microcalorimeter with {{an energy}} threshold defined by its equatorial magnetic field {{for a given}} temperature. The higher the matrix density, the larger the gamma stopping power. For several years, cylindrical cells of such suspensions about 2 cm long and 0. 4 mm in diameter can be read out in real time. As a result, using two independent cells, one can record a time coincidence between them. This could be potentially very useful for positron cameras where two diametrically opposite cells are simultaneously knocked by 511 keV gammas. This paper, based {{on the state of}} art in SSG in high density matrix, discusses such a feasibility. Comment: 18 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|Surface T-antigen of {{simian virus}} 40 -transformed human fetal brain (SV 40 -HFB) cells was {{analysed}} by the indirect peroxidase-labeled antibody method at light and electron microscopic levels. SV 40 -tumor-bearing hamster serum {{was used as}} anti-T serum. The specificity of the antiserum against T-antigen was confirmed by Western-blot analysis in SV 40 -HFB whole cell extract. Under the light microscope, T-antigen was observed in the nuclei, except for the nucleoli, of acetone-fixed monolayer cells, {{but not on the}} cell surface. Unfixed monolayer and suspension cells did not give staining on the cell surface. When these cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) and the reaction was performed in cell suspension or monolayer, positive staining was observed on the cell surface, but not in the nuclei. Under the electron microscope, nuclear T-antigen was distributed in the nucleoplasm, especially in the area of euchromatin, on frozen-sections of PFA-fixed cells. The PFA-fixed <b>supension</b> cells gave specific immunoreactive products on the entire plasma membrane. These results indicate that surface T-antigen of SV 40 -transformed cells may exist on the entire plasma membane as a cryptic form, suggesting a mechanism of escape from the immune response by the SV 40 -tumor-bearing host...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{rheological}} behavior of two series of model suspensions containing the same glass fibers in a Newtonian polybutene {{and in a}} Boger fluid has also been investigated. The steady-state shear viscosity of both <b>supensions</b> increased with fiber content, but the suspensions in the Boger fluid became shear thinning. Both types of suspension exhibited non-negligible normal stresses. The steady-state viscosity and normal stress difference of the <b>supensions</b> in the polybutene are well predicted by the Lipscomb ~ 1987 ! equation coupled with the Folgar–Tucker ~ 1984 ! model. Both types of fiber suspensions were shown to exhibit shear and normal stress overshoots in stress growth experiments. Under flow reversal, a shear stress overshoot was observed at a larger deformation compared to the primary overshoot. The reverse overshoot {{has been attributed to}} tumbling of fibers that are not totally aligned in the flow direction even after a very long time. When the flow was reversed, the normal stress difference took initially mimimum values ~negative values in the polybutene case! and then depicted a smaller positive overshoot before reaching a steady-state value. The normal stress undershoot has been attributed to a transient fiber-oriented structure. The shape and the magnitude of these overshoots depend on the fiber content, nature of the matrix, and time delay between consecutive experiments...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{construct}} a com-putational fluid dynamics model capable of simulating the transient non-Newtonian process of apheresis. A Lagrangian–Eulerian model has been developed which tracks the blood particles within a two-dimensional flow configuration. Within the Eulerian method, the fluid mass and momentum conservation equations within the separa-tor are solved using the density and the viscosity is calcu-lated from the blood particle concentrations. Subsequently, the displacement of the blood particles is calculated with a Lagrangian method. Hawksley’s model for the density of <b>supensions</b> {{is used in the}} variable density calculation. The viscosity is calculated with two models based on Vand’s rigid particle suspension viscosity concepts, followed by the flow field calculation in the separator. Simulations were performed for various inlet hematocrit values and separa-tor lengths. The simulations are in satisfactory agreement with experimental results reported in literature, indicating a complete separation of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), as well as nearly complete separation of red blood cells and platelets. No hemolysis was observed in the sim-ulations because the shear rate remained under the criti-cal value of 150 N/m...|$|R
40|$|Oral mucositis (OM) is an {{inflammatory}} and ulcerative {{process of the}} mucosa of the mouth that result from the administration of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy or blood and marrow stem cell transplant. The incidence and severity of OM will vary from patient to patient, that correlates with the risk factors. The risk factors are patient related factors and therapy related factors. We reported a case in a 33 years old woman patient with OM grade IV accompanied with oral candidiasis who is undergoing radiotherapy in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital for her nasopharyngeal cancer. The estimated risk factors of the severity OM in this case are the patient gender, poor oral hygiene, poor nutritional status, decreased saliva production, dose total and fractional radiation, and the staging of cancer. Chlorhexidine gluconate 0. 2 % mouthwash and Mycostatin oral <b>supension</b> administration was decreased the severity of OM in this patient, nevertheless not yet totally recovery because another risk factors that can affect OM and dental management can not optimally controlled.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the antimicrobial efficacy of Chlorhexidine, Nisin and Linezolid and {{a control group}} (Normal saline) against Enterococcus faecalis (EF). Methods: Human single rooted premolars with type I canal anatomy were instrumented with ProTaper using NaOCl as an irrigant. <b>Supension</b> of EF was inoculated into each root specimen and incubated. The medicaments were syringed into each root and incubated. After 24 hours, 8 samples per group (among the 4 groups) were retrieved. A hole was drilled on each root, and the dentinal shavings obtained were allowed to fall in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth. Dilutions from the broth were plated and spread over blood agar. Colony-forming units (CFU) of EF was counted. The procedure was repeated after 72 hrs and 1 week. Results: In group Nisin, the mean CFU was 10. 6250 at 24 hrs, 6. 6250 at 72 hrs and 6. 2500 after 1 week respectively (statistically significant). In group Chlorhexidine, mean CFU {{was found to be}} the lowest of 10. 5000 at 24 hrs, with further gradual increase to 13. 7500 at 72 hrs and further increase to 15. 8750 by 1 week.

In this thesis we reported {{the results of}} our investigation into the behavior of particles settling in a quiescent and sheared suspensions using a molecular-dynamics-type simulator. The effects of varying the concentration over the range of 0. 0025 to 0. 05, and the shear rate between 0. 0 and 20. 0 on the average particle velocity, the diffusion coefficient, the variance of the particle velocity, the average particle-distribution function, the particle-distribution-correlation time, and the average velocity and variance autocorrelation times are reported. We found that the first correction to the sedimentation velocity for concentration (c) depended upon c rather than [ [...] . ], and that no structure with a length scale of [ [...] . ] developed in the particle-distribution function. Shearing the suspension caused a nonuniform particle-angular distribution to form, and the particle correlation times and the diffusion coefficients to decrease. Using the diffusion coefficient from the simulations, we modelled the spreading of the interface between the <b>supension</b> and the clear fluid region. We found that the spreading of the interface could cause misinterpretation of the experimental measurements of the sedimentation velocity, and that this might explain the discrepancies among the experimental data. In building the simulator, we needed to determine what effects N, the number of particles used in the simulator, have on the simulation results. Neither the sedimentation velocity, nor the average particle-distribution function changed when N varied from 27 to 125. However, we found that both the variance of the particle velocity and the diffusion coefficent grew with N. We have shown that for an homogeneous suspension, these statistics will converge, although the number of particles needed may still be very large, especially in the low concentration range which we are interested in. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} sytematic {{measurements}} of the low frequency conductivity in aequous <b>supensions</b> of highly charged colloidal spheres. System preparation in a closed tubing system results in precisely controlled number densities between 1 E 16 /m 3 and 1 E 19 /m^ 3 (packing fractions between 1 E- 7 and 1 E- 2) and electrolyte concentrations between 1 E- 7 and 1 E- 3 mol/l. Due to long ranged Coulomb repulsion some of the systems show a pronounced fluid or crystalline order. Under deionized conditions we find s to depend linearily on the packing fraction with no detectable influence of the phase transitions. Further at constant packing fraction s increases sublinearily with increasing number of dissociable surface groups N. As a function of c the conductivity shows pronounced differences depending {{on the kind of}} electrolyte used. We propose a simple yet powerful model based on independent migration of all species present and additivity of the respective conductivity contributions. It takes account of small ion macro-ion interactions in terms of an effectivly transported charge. The model successfully describes our qualitatively complex experimental observations. It further facilitates quantitative estimates of conductivity over a wide range of particle and experimental parameters. Comment: 32 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables, Accepted by Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNovel {{bionanocomposite}} {{materials were}} successfully prepared using 2 : 1 phyllosilicates and an amino acid, L-DOPA. A systematic study of DOPA interactions with these smectites {{and with a}} nonporous amorphous silica (Aerosil) used for comparison was undertaken by combining macroscopic information, including XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, and proton relaxation times in the synthesis <b>supensions,</b> with microscopic observations and several spectroscopic techniques: vibrational (transmission mode IR and photoacoustic spectroscopies), solidstate 13 C NMR, and XPS. A significant variety of behaviors is revealed. DOPA interacts very weakly with Aerosil, although it contributes to the structuring of the solution {{with the appearance of}} a population of bound water molecules. In contrast, the weakly basic conditions in smectite suspensions catalyze oxidation by dissolved O 2 to indolic species and polymerization to pseudomelanin. With saponite, structural characterization reveals that L-DOPA zwitterions are accommodated vertically in the interlayer region as a monolayer of partially superimposed species. In addition, TEM indicates that lamellar deposits of pseudomelanin grow epitaxially on the saponite layers. With Laponite, the oxidation reactions seem to be somewhat modified by the specific catalytic effect of edge groups, and the organic species cause a strong structuring of the dispersion with gelification. The interesting chemistry taking place in these systems has implications for both DOPA vectorization and nanocomposite materials synthesi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new, simple, and {{versatile}} method {{was developed to}} prepare protein nanoparticles, for the first time, and the approach was extended to prepare organic, inorganic, and biological nanomaterials. For example, nanoparticles of met-hemoglobin and glucose oxidase are readily prepared by contacting a fine spray of aqueous solutions of the proteins to an organic solvent such as methanol or acetonitrile. The protein nanoparticles suspended in organic solvents retained their secondary structure and biological activities to a significant extent. Using this approach, we also successfully prepared nanoparticles of transition metal complexes, organic molecules, nucleic acids, inorganic polymers, and organic polymers. Particle size depended on reagent concentrations, pH and the solvent used, and particle sizes have been controlled from 20 to 200 nm by adjusting these parameters. In each case, particle sizes and size distributions were determined by dynamic light scattering and the data have been confirmed by electron microscopy. Addition of appropriate electrolytes to the nanoparticle <b>supensions</b> stabilized them against aggregation or crystallization, and particles were stable over months of storage at 4 ˚C. Nanoparticles of met-hemoglobin, glucose oxidase, and calf thymus DNA indicated retention of their native-like structures, as evidenced from their respective circular dichroism spectra. Enzyme nanoparticles retained their catalytic activities to a significant extent. For example, peroxidase-like activity of met-hemoglobin nanoparticles suspended in methanol was 0. 3 µ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of larger}} more {{flexible}} blades in turbomachines requires detailed knowledge about flutter phenomena especially for compressor cascades in transonic flow where vibrating shocks may drastically change the aerodynamic behaviour. In order {{to investigate the}} aerodynamic behaviour, basic experiments were performed to measure unsteady pressure distributions for subsonic and transonic flow conditions. Experimental investigations on a two-dimensional section of a compressor cascade were carried out at EPF Lausanne in the annular wind tunnel for non-rotating cascades. In this wind tunnel real flow conditions are simulated by using a spiral flow. The twenty blades of the cascade were mounted on elastic spring <b>supensions</b> which allowed for torsional motion about the midchord. For the measurement of the unsteady pressure distributions, the blades were excited to harmonic torsional vibrations in all possible twenty travelling wave modes of the cascade. In order to ensure precise aerodynamic stability investigations, {{it is essential to}} know the complete unsteady pressure distribution around the profile. In this cascade piezoelectric pressure transducers were mounted close together around the blades in order to resolve pressure variations caused by a vibrating shock. These measured pressure distributions enable the evaluation of local stability/instability contributions using the local work coefficient and furthermore allow an integration into reliable global stability parameters such as the out-of-phase component of the unsteady moment coefficients. The influence that front shock on the suction side as well as the blade channel shock have on the stability behaviour is shown for the transonic case...|$|R
40|$|The {{precursors}} of B lymphocytes {{have previously}} been distinguished and characterized by various parameters including {{their ability to}} generate B cells after adoptive transfer, expression of surface markers and/or B cell function after short-term induction in vitro, and their synthesis but not surface display ofimmunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains (1 - 19). The {{extent to which these}} cells are heterogenous in fetal and adult life is not known, and it is also not clear to what extent their numbers depend on differentiation from muhipotential hemopoietic stem cells. The ability to form foci of proliferating hemopoietic cells in spleens of irradiated recipients is usually ascribed to uncommitted colony-forming stem cells (CFU-s) 1 but recent studies suggest that differentiation options for some CFU-s may be restricted (20). Our previous studies identified one or more cell types which were capable of restoring colony-forming B cells (CFU-B) to partially immunodeficient CBA/N mice (6, 19). These ceils were neither surface Ig ÷ (B cells) nor closely related to CFU-s. That is, the restorative capacity of various cell <b>supensions</b> did not correlate with numbers of either CFU-s or lymphocytes, and furthermore newly formed B cells in irradiated, reconstituted mice were not spatially related to the clonal progeny of CFU-s. Our present observations further define these pre-B cell populations and demonstrate by means of a monoclonal antibody that they may be distinguished from CFU-s from an early stage of embryonic life. These findings presage studies of factors that regulate lymphoid system development and raise interesting questions about initial events in the differentiation of this lineage. Among these are the following: (a) whether precommitted cells arise {{at a very early age}} and have sufficient self-renewal and differentiation potential to obscure the subsequent contribution of less mature, uncommitted stem cells, and (b) whether truly multipotential stem cells comprise a very small subpopulation of cells detected by the in vivo splenic focus (CFU-s) assay...|$|R
