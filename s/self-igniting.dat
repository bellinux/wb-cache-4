Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of <b>self-igniting</b> or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E

25|$|On 29 July 1940, {{manufacturers}} Albright & Wilson of Oldbury {{demonstrated to}} the RAF how their white phosphorus {{could be used}} to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned, resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a <b>self-igniting</b> petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No. 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (<b>Self-Igniting</b> Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve, making the contents slightly sticky, and the mixture would separate into two layers– this was intentional, and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers, as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.|$|E

2500|$|White {{phosphorus}} is {{a translucent}} waxy solid that quickly becomes yellow {{when exposed to}} light. For this reason it is also called yellow phosphorus. It glows greenish in the dark (when exposed to oxygen) and is highly flammable and pyrophoric (<b>self-igniting)</b> upon contact with air. It is toxic, causing severe liver damage on ingestion and phossy jaw from chronic ingestion or inhalation. The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell, and samples are commonly coated with white [...] "diphosphorus pentoxide", which consists of P4O10 tetrahedral with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. White phosphorus is only slightly soluble in water and can be stored under water. Indeed, white phosphorus is safe from <b>self-igniting</b> only when it is submerged in water.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the associations between the fire causes and the influence factors that include provinces, months, hours, building types and places. The fire causes that are obtained from China fire statistics are composed of arson, electric, production, careless with fire, smoking, playing with fire, <b>self-ignite,</b> unknown and others. The results show that the tendency of fire causes of various provinces is different. Fires occurred in January and February is trend to be strongly associated with playing with fire. The difference of fire causes between night and daytime is obvious. It is clear that the daytime trend to be associated with smoking, careless with fire, production operation and playing with fire, while the night group trends to be associated with arson, unknown, others, electrical fire and <b>self-ignite.</b> It is shown that significant differences of fire causes exist among the building types and the places. Multi-storied buildings have close association with electrical fire. Personnel crowded places are trend to be associated with electrical fire while the vehicles are trend to be associated with <b>self-ignite.</b> Finally, the study highlights that correspondence analysis is an appropriate technique to explore the relationships among fire statistics data and can play a complementary role in analyzing fire data...|$|R
50|$|Spontaneous {{combustion}} {{is a type}} of combustion {{which occurs}} by self heating (increase in temperature due to exothermic internal reactions), followed by thermal runaway (self heating which rapidly accelerates to high temperatures) and finally, ignition.For example, phosphorus <b>self-ignites</b> at room temperature without the application of heat.|$|R

It {{can also be used}} for regenerative cooling of rocket engines. Peroxide was used very successfully as an oxidizer in World War II German rocket motors (e.g. T-Stoff, containing oxyquinoline stabilizer, for both the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe RATO externally podded monopropellant booster system, and for the Walter HWK 109-509 rocket motor series used for the Me 163B), most often used with C-Stoff in a <b>self-igniting</b> hypergolic combination, and for the low-cost British Black Knight and Black Arrow launchers.|$|E
2500|$|White {{phosphorus}} is {{the least}} stable, the most reactive, the most volatile, the least dense, and the most toxic of the allotropes. White phosphorus gradually changes to red phosphorus. This transformation is accelerated by light and heat, and samples of white phosphorus almost always contain some red phosphorus and accordingly appear yellow. For this reason, white phosphorus that is aged or otherwise impure (e.g. weapons-grade, not lab-grade WP) is also called yellow phosphorus. When exposed to oxygen, white phosphorus glows in the dark with a very faint tinge of green and blue. [...] It is highly flammable and pyrophoric (<b>self-igniting)</b> upon contact with air. [...] Owing to its pyrophoricity, white phosphorus is used as an additive in napalm. The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell, and samples are commonly coated with white [...] "phosphorus pentoxide", which consists of [...] tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. White phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide.|$|E

50|$|Vinyl siding {{features}} a chlorine base, making it inherently slow to ignite and flame retardant. All organic materials (that is, anything containing carbon) will ignite, but {{the higher the}} temperature a material has to reach before it flames, the safer it is. PVC won’t ignite, even from another flame, until it reaches about 730°F (387°C) and won’t <b>self-ignite</b> until about 850°F (454°C). Those ignition temperatures are significantly higher than common framing lumber, which ignites from a flame at 500°F (260°C) and <b>self-ignites</b> at 770°F (410°C). Also, ASTM D2863 tests show that rigid PVC’s high Limiting Oxygen Index means that it needs unusually high amounts of oxygen to burn and stay burning. Rigid PVC (vinyl siding) will not independently sustain combustion in air with a normal concentration of oxygen (about 21 percent) — so it extinguishes more easily.|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{occurrence}} of auto-ignition centers in a two-stroke SI engine was investigated using planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). An experimental SI engine equipped with glass windows to enable full optical access into the combustion chamber was operated under knocking conditions. The pulsed output of two XeCl excimer lasers was formed into planar light sheets (300 μm × 4 cm), which were spatially overlapped and directed into the combustion chamber of the operating engine. Unburned fuel components fluoresce strongly when illuminated with XeCl laser radiation; burned regions display no fluorescence. <b>Self-ignited</b> regions therefore show up as dark sites in the fluorescence images, indicating local consumption of the fuel. The resulting PLIF images were recorded using fast-gated ICCD cameras. By delaying the second laser pulse a specific time (100 ns- 600 μs), image pairs were acquired which allowed the temporal development and mutual influence of hot-spots to be studied. The short laser pulse duration (20 ns), the two-dimensional nature of the imaged region and the strong signals obtained from our detection scheme yield very detailed information of the <b>self-ignited</b> regions. Approximately 20 000 image pairs were recorded. As important quantities, spatial distribution and expansion velocities were extracted from the PLIF images and investigated statistically.
