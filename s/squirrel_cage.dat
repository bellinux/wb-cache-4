25|$|Induction motors may {{be further}} divided into <b>Squirrel</b> <b>Cage</b> Induction Motors and Wound Rotor Induction Motors. SCIMs have a heavy winding {{made up of}} solid bars, usually {{aluminum}} or copper, joined by rings {{at the ends of}} the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.|$|E
25|$|Currents induced {{into this}} winding provide the rotor {{magnetic}} field. The {{shape of the}} rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> is nearly at line frequency and tends {{to be in the}} outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.|$|E

2500|$|In {{single phase}} <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} {{starting}} a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque. Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Brushless Doubly-Fed Machines have {{potential}} benefits in variable speed generation and adjustable speed drive applications by combining a robust machine structure with a reduced power converter rating. While recent work has demonstrated feasibility, steady-state performance {{has not been}} optimized. The nature of doubly-fed operation causes rotor currents of varying, relatively high frequency. Moreover, the rotor structure deviates from conventional <b>squirrel</b> <b>cages.</b> Consequently, induction machine rotor bar geometries need to be carefully examined and refined for applicability in the doubly-fed system. The present thesis uses finite element analysis to investigate alternative rotor bar design. Two-dimensional finite element analysis is used to investigate basic rotor bar characteristics. Interface with a detailed simulation program enables investigation of assembled rotors, otherwise a three-dimensional analysis problem. Rotor bar geometries for a high speed alternator are investigated. Bar shapes are kept simple to allow manufacturing of the rotor {{in the absence of}} the-casting equipment. Rotor prototypes are constructed using custom, laser-cut laminations and experimental results for the alternator verify improved line-to-shaft efficiencies over conventional rotor geometries as well as off-the-shelf alternators...|$|R

60|$|We {{returned}} to a hasty dinner [in Pall Mall], and then hurried away to see honest Dan Terry's house, called the Adelphi Theatre, where we saw the Pilot, from the American novel of that name. It is extremely popular, the dramatist having seized on the whole story, and turned the odious and ridiculous parts, assigned by the original author to the British, against the Yankees themselves. There is a quiet effrontery in this that is of a rare and peculiar character. The Americans were so much displeased, that they attempted a row--which rendered the piece doubly attractive to the seamen at Wapping, who came up and crowded the house night after night, to support the honour of the British flag. After all, one must deprecate whatever keeps up ill-will betwixt America and the mother country; and we in particular should avoid awakening painful recollections. Our high situation enables us to contemn petty insults and to make advances towards cordiality. I was, however, glad to see honest Dan's theatre as full seemingly as it could hold.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Research was conducted in Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico, to investigate the efficacy of orally administered bait cubes containing pyriproxyfen for control of the plague vector flea, Oropsylla montana (Baker), on rock squirrels, Spermophilus variegatus (Erxleben). Pyriproxyfen, accumulated in the squirrel blood, was ingested by feeding adult fleas, and was absorbed in the developing eggs preventing maturation of oocytes or hatching of larvae. Initially bait cubes containing another growth regulator, lufenuron, were fed to rock squirrels in the field. Fleas were collected from trapped squirrels and maintained in the laboratory to determine percent egg mortality. However, techniques for bait studies in the field proved inadequate. Flea eggs became desiccated, and bait consumption by the squirrels was uncontrollable. Consequently, additional studies were conducted with wild-caught squirrels maintained in an environmentally controlled laboratory. Squirrels were housed in individual cages containing nest boxes and infested with fleas to provide a continuous source of eggs. The use of lufenuron was discontinued. Instead, <b>caged</b> <b>squirrels</b> were fed bait cubes containing concentrations of pyriproxyfen ranging from 60, 100 and 200 mg per kg of body weight to determine the dosage needed to prevent egg hatch. Flea eggs were collected from the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cages</b> weekly, and egg hatch was determined for fleas fed on each group of test squirrels and compared with that for fleas fed on an untreated control group of squirrels. Results showed that 100 and 200 mg/kg dosages of pyriproxyfen effectively inhibited egg hatch for nearly two months or more. At a dose of 60 mg/kg of body weight, egg hatch rose to 50 % during the third month after treatment, whereas the higher dosages of 100 to 200 mg/kg continued to prevent egg hatch at rates greatly exceeding 50 %. At 200 mg/kg, pyriproxyfen prevented hatching of over 90 % of the eggs for ~ 11 weeks in at least one of three replicates and for ~ 9 weeks from averaged data...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{negative}} consequences of introduction of non-native species are generally known in the scientific community, the majority of the public is unaware of the effects on native ecosystems. [...] Effective control of the spreading of grey squirrels throughout continental Europe will require a coordinated approach of many nations, and ecologists recommend public education and trade restrictions as primary means to prevent new introductions of non-native species. [...] Currently, the release of non-native species is illegal in most European countries, but both illegal and allowed importations and escapes of grey squirrels from captivity pose threats to native red squirrel and tree populations. [...] In addition to preventing introduction of grey squirrels, containment and eradication could serve to control the species’ invasive actions.Methods for grey squirrel population control depend on the target of protection. In the presence of red <b>squirrels,</b> <b>cage</b> trapping or shooting can be effective. In the absence of red squirrels, poisoning by the anticoagulant Warfarin can be used in special feeding hoppers. [...] These methods are currently effectively controlling the grey squirrel population in Britain. [...] Selectively timed culls, or removal of a percentage of the breeding individuals, of grey squirrel populations can help control and prevent tree damage. Although grey squirrel populations readily recover from culls, their coincidence with annual periods of the greatest damage to trees, typically between April and September when the squirrels are most active in foraging among broadleaf tree populations, can minimize tree damage. [...] Alternatively, non-lethal methods of population control, such as fertility treatments, are being developed, although the effectiveness of these treatments is unknown.In areas most threatened by spread of grey squirrels, eradication may be more effective than population containment. Eradication of the population of grey squirrels in Genoa would protect two native subspecies of red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris italicus and Sciurus vulgaris meridionalis, in south east Italy, and eradication of the grey squirrel population in Ticino would eliminate the threat of grey squirrel invasion into Switzerland for the next 100 years. [...] While these efforts are supported by ecologists, their success will depend on public opinion, governmental support, and awareness of the situation.|$|R
