500|$|Aboard Guillaume Tell, the British found {{evidence}} {{of the severity of}} the food shortages in Valletta: [...] "the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule, hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral's stern-galley". News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food <b>supplies,</b> <b>refused,</b> stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E

5|$|Kerr invited Whitlam and Minister for Labour Senator Jim McClelland {{to lunch}} on 30 October, {{immediately}} preceding an Executive Council meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, and the Senate would not convene until 1 July, thus obviating {{the threat of}} a possible temporary Labor majority. Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser's leadership and the Senate's right to block <b>supply,</b> <b>refused</b> any compromise.|$|R

50|$|Whilst {{the hobby}} is {{probably}} legal in most jurisdictions, {{the relationship between}} amateur chemists and law enforcement agencies is often fraught. Hobbyists are often affected by laws intended to fight drugs and terrorism. Furthermore, many chemical <b>supply</b> houses <b>refuse</b> to sell to amateurs, with such policies sometimes being stated openly.|$|R
25|$|During early flight tests, {{repeated}} supersonic test {{runs over}} southern Britain were conducted; {{as a result}} of these flights, a number of claims for damages against the supersonic booms were received. Tests of the Delta 2's low-level supersonic flight capability were disrupted due to the perceived heightened risk posed by supersonic booms being produced during lower altitude flight; as such, the Ministry of <b>Supply</b> <b>refused</b> to allow this testing to be performed over the UK. As a result of this refusal, Fairey chose to transport the Delta 2 first to France and later to Norway so that the tests could be performed. The French government required the tests to be insured against damage claims; this demand had proved impractical with a British-based insurance company due to unrealistic prices; however, a French company insured them for £40. No claims were ever received in either France or Norway.|$|R
25|$|Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá visited Acoma {{soon after}} Oñate's {{departure}} by {{himself with a}} dog and a horse and asked for other <b>supplies.</b> Villagrá <b>refused</b> to get off his horse and left to follow after Oñate's party. However, Zutacapan convinced {{him to return to}} receive supplies. In questioning by Zutacapan, Villagrá said that 103 armed men were two day away from Acoma. Zutacapan then told Villagrá to leave Acoma.|$|R
50|$|Like the British Fascists (BF) they {{contacted}} the Home Secretary {{in the run-up}} to the 1926 General Strike to offer their services to the Organisation for the Maintenance of <b>Supplies.</b> Rippon-Seymour <b>refused</b> to follow the lead of BF chairman R. B. D. Blakeney in breaking from fascism and so his offer was turned down flat by the government. As individuals National Fascisti members were however allowed to enter the Special Constabulary during the strike, which many did.|$|R
50|$|Lafayette {{spent the}} first part of the winter of 1780-81 in Philadelphia, where the American Philosophical Society elected him its first foreign member.

25|$|In November 1822, the {{provisional}} Greek government at Hermione {{sent a letter}} asking {{him to return to}} them. He declined but joined the Greek committee in London (formed 8 March 1823) and contributed money and military <b>supplies.</b> He <b>refused</b> the committee’s invitation to go to Greece as one of three commissioners in charge of stores and funds stating that the Greeks were unwilling to submit to European discipline. As a committee member he strongly supported the appointment of George Byron, 6th Baron Byron.|$|R
5000|$|Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz {{stated that}} the Fed pursued an erroneously {{restrictive}} monetary policy, exacerbating the Great Depression. After the stock market crashed in 1929, the Fed continued to contract (decrease) the money <b>supply</b> and <b>refused</b> to save banks that were struggling due to bank runs. This mistake, critics charge, allowed {{what might have been}} a relatively mild recession to explode into catastrophe. Friedman and Schwartz believed that the depression was [...] "a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces".|$|R

He remained anticlerical and close to the extreme radical left.He was named a Knight of the Légion d'honneur in 1878. Two years later, he was one of the founders of the Société des Artistes Français and, the following year, the Salon des Artistes Français. Among his best-known students were Charles Léandre, Paul Milliet, Henri Rivière and Paul Signac.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet advance {{was stopped}} at the Mannerheim Line. Red Army troops {{suffered}} from poor morale and a shortage of <b>supplies,</b> eventually <b>refusing</b> to participate in more suicidal frontal attacks. The Finns, led by General Harald Öhquist, decided to launch a counterattack and encircle three Soviet divisions into a motti near Viipuri on 23 December. Öhquist's plan was bold, and it failed. The Finns lost 1,300 men, and the Soviets were later estimated to have lost a similar number. Some sources estimate the Soviets lost 1,244 tanks.|$|R
50|$|The Quebec provincial {{government}} requested {{support from the}} Canadian Army, which sent in 3700 troops. Provincial and national leaders participated in negotiations between the Mohawk and the {{provincial government}}. The Mohawk at Kanehsatà:ke were forced by the Canadian army to remove their barricades. Police and military forces pushed the remaining protesters back until they were confined to the Onentokon Treatment Centre and surrounded by the military. Throughout the summer the community of Kanehsatà:ke had their food, medicine and <b>supplies</b> systematically <b>refused</b> and spoiled by the SQ and Canadian Army.|$|R
25|$|The embargo was not uniform across Europe. Of {{the nine}} {{members of the}} European Economic Community (EEC), the Netherlands faced a {{complete}} embargo, the UK and France received almost uninterrupted <b>supplies</b> (having <b>refused</b> to allow America to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis), while the other six faced partial cutbacks. The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and Harold Wilson's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War. His successor, Ted Heath, reversed this policy in 1970, calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.|$|R
50|$|At 09:36 EST on 8 December 2000 {{the crew}} paid {{the first visit}} to the Expedition 1 crew {{residing}} in the space station. Until then the shuttle and the station had kept one hatch closed to maintain respective atmospheric pressures, allowing the shuttle crew to conduct their spacewalks and mission goals. After a welcome ceremony and briefing, the eight spacefarers conducted structural tests of the station and its solar arrays, transferred equipment, <b>supplies</b> and <b>refuse</b> {{back and forth between the}} spacecraft, and checked out the television camera cable installed by Tanner and Noriega for the upcoming mission.|$|R
40|$|Cholera {{has been}} in {{existence}} in Sarawak {{for many years and}} since 1873 many major epidemics have occurred. The epidemics usually occur during the dry months of May, June and July and the population affected are those in coastal areas. As in other outbreaks the areas affected were those which had poor environmental sanitation, poor water <b>supply,</b> poor <b>refuse</b> disposal and indiscriminate disposal of faeces. Malays are more affected as in Peninsular Malaysia outbreaks. The classical biotype was common prior to 1961. In later years the El Tor (biotype) has been responsible for most outbreaks.

50|$|Cuesta was <b>refused</b> <b>supplies</b> and {{reinforcements}} until {{local authorities}} could review the appointments {{he had made}} to the army. As a result, a French offensive in the Spring annulled Cuesta's previous gains. On 26 March, Cuesta was badly wounded and trampled by cavalry, and his army savagely defeated, at the Battle of Medellín. Like Blücher after him, he continued fighting as a near-invalid.|$|R
50|$|French {{troops at}} Dien Bien Phu finally capitulated on 7 May. However, the Vietminh allowed Galard {{and the medical}} staff to {{continue}} {{to care for their}} wounded and she worked changing bandages despite short <b>supplies.</b> Galard still <b>refused</b> any kind of cooperation. When some of the Vietminh began to hoard medical supplies for their own use, she hid some of them under her stretcher bed.|$|R
50|$|Israeli {{authorities}} {{used water}} and power supplies {{as a means to}} pressure the residents, asking the residents to join the village unions in the 1980s and cutting off {{water and power}} <b>supplies</b> when they <b>refused</b> to cooperate with the military ruler.

Ludvigsen again refuses to communicate through Hartmann and hangs up. Negotiations slowly continue, and Omar reacts incredulously to Ludvigsen's continued low-ball offers, which he says {{will result in the}} deaths of himself and the crew unless Ludvigsen makes a realistic offer. The situation takes a toll on Ludvigsen, culminating in his yelling at his worried girlfriend.|$|R

30|$|Balassa ([1990]) {{outlines}} indicative planning as {{a procedure}} that often seek {{to draw attention to}} the problems, indicate a broad direction for the solution and stimulate debate and discussion overcoming these problems, a debate in which numerous stakeholders get involved before workable policies are implemented. Compliance is usually not compulsory but rather planning incentives draw the attention of the developers and capitalise on these, therefore revitalising the designated areas. In some situations planning incentives such as building lines, bulk factor and rezoning may lure developers, investors and even encourage property owners to develop structures that are more profitable. For example rezoning a residential area into a mixed zone with offices and flats may be helpful since residential use is a low competitor in terms of returns on the land use. The provision of social services such as water <b>supply,</b> <b>refuse</b> collection and street lighting may appear as trivial issues but these actually contribute immensely in the success of revitalisation plans thus the need to consider this when revitalising the inner city. Thus, inner-city revitalisation may be achieved through the provision of adequate and reliable social services in the inner city. Indicative planning does not really conform to the concept of ecological planning. Ecological planning as discussed earlier on is founded on politics of an area, thus there has to be some directives from high above on the strategies for revitalisation. There has to be some compliance to say the use of solar power by households, in such a way a common goal is sought. Incentives are rather contextual and may fail to spur some interest in some individuals. Therefore, revitalisation plans are framed from citizen needs and what they feel is right for them without need for incentives, which often fail to achieve the required goals.|$|R

50|$|In early 1850, George Law, {{owner of}} the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, bought up the options of the land {{from the mouth of}} the Chagres River to the end of Navy Bay in order to force the {{directors}} of the new Panama Railroad to give him a position on the board of the company. Since there were no harbor facilities on the Atlantic side of the isthmus, they needed to create a town with docking facilities to unload their railroad <b>supplies</b> there. <b>Refusing</b> to allow Law onto the board, the directors decided to start building harbor facilities, an Atlantic terminus, and their railroad from the vacant site of Manzanillo Island. Starting in May 1850, what would become the city of Aspinwall (now Colón) was founded on the 650 acre on the western end of a treacherously marshy islet covered with mangrove trees, known as Manzanillo Island.|$|R
