5|$|Although in the English {{language}} borscht refers {{almost invariably}} to a beet-based <b>soup,</b> <b>in</b> some culinary cultures there exist soups {{with the same}} or similar names where beetroots are absent or merely optional.

5|$|Borscht, {{like any}} other <b>soup</b> <b>in</b> East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by itself, but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.|$|E

5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot <b>soup.</b> <b>In</b> 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster {{examined}} the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating hypercycle in a prebiotic <b>soup.</b> <b>In</b> a hypercycle, the information storing system (possibly RNA) produces an enzyme, which catalyzes {{the formation of}} another information system, in sequence until {{the product of the}} last aids {{in the formation of the}} first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create quasispecies, which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.|$|E
25|$|Early in the year, Gundelia plants {{growing in}} the wild are cut at the base and the thorns are removed. Leaves, stems, roots, and {{particularly}} the undeveloped flowerheads can be eaten.

Gundelia is said have a taste between asparagus and artichoke. Another dish is to put a trimmed inflorescence in a meatball, fry these in olive oil and then simmer them in a sauce containing lemon juice. In rural communities in Kurdistan, Gundelia is still {{being used as a}} vegetable, but in Israel collecting for the market resulted in a decline in the plant population and collecting is restricted to personal use.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of Progress {{ushered in}} a {{standard}} of passenger train speed and comfort not previously seen in Australia. Its introduction in November 1937 marked the culmination of many years of preparatory work by the Victorian Railways, from the laying of heavier rail on the North East line, introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange apparatus to allow continuous high speed running between track sections, introduction of high-powered three-cylinder Pacific locomotives, and the testing of air conditioning equipment on passenger rolling stock. Such was the commitment of VR Chief Commissioner Harold Clapp to introducing a world-class train service to Victorian Railways, virtually no detail was overlooked. VR engineers famously road-tested the new train's smoothness on curves by studying a full bowl of <b>soup</b> <b>in</b> the dining car as the train took curves at full speed; if the soup splashed {{over the side of}} the bowl a decision would be taken whether to modify the curve for higher speeds or reduce the speed limit for the curve. Harold Clapp could not, however, take credit for the name for the service; when discussing with his wife his proposed Royal Victorian name (inspired by the LMS Royal Scot), Mrs Clapp suggested, on the spur of the moment, Spirit of Progress.|$|E
