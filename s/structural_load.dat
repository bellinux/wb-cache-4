25|$|Portland cement {{is a basic}} {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar and most non-specialty grout. The most common use for Portland cement is {{in the production of}} concrete. Concrete is a composite material consisting of aggregate (gravel and sand), cement, and water. As a construction material, concrete can be cast in almost any shape desired, and once hardened, can become a <b>structural</b> (<b>load</b> bearing) element. Portland cement may be grey or white.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{deformation}} is {{a function}} of the material properties, exposure time, exposure temperature and the applied <b>structural</b> <b>load.</b> Depending on the magnitude of the applied stress and its duration, the deformation may become so large that a component can no longer perform its function — for example creep of a turbine blade will cause the blade to contact the casing, resulting in the failure of the blade. Creep is usually of concern to engineers and metallurgists when evaluating components that operate under high stresses or high temperatures. Creep is a deformation mechanism that may or may not constitute a failure mode. For example, moderate creep in concrete is sometimes welcomed because it relieves tensile stresses that might otherwise lead to cracking.|$|E

The present elsA and Helios analyses include the test-stand modeling. Comprehensive analyses show significant phase differences for the airloads and <b>structural</b> <b>loads.</b> The phase correlation is substantially improved by the coupled analyses for both high-speed and high-thrust conditions. In general, the coupled analyses also improve the half peak-to-peak correlation of <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> compared to the comprehensive analyses. The majority of the predictions from the coupled analyses in half peak-to-peak blade <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> are within 20 % of the measured data.

25|$|Being {{the weakest}} {{of the weak}} {{chemical}} forces, with a strength between 0.4 and 4kJ/mol they may still support an integral <b>structural</b> <b>load</b> when multitudes of such interactions are present. Such a force results from a transient shift in electron density. Specifically, as the electrons are in orbit of the protons and neutrons within an atom the electron density may tend to shift more greatly on a side. Thus, this generates a transient charge to which a nearby atom can be either attracted or repelled. When the interatomic distance of two atoms is greater than 0.6 nm the force is {{not strong enough to}} be observed. In the same vein, when the interatomic distance is below 0.4 nm the force becomes repulsive.|$|E

40|$|One of the Civil {{criteria}} in ABET TC 2 K is that programs “apply current knowledge and adapt to emerging applications of technology,” such as, {{changes in the}} building codes. Structural design firms also have the expectation that Civil Engineering Technology (CET) graduates {{should be able to}} apply current codes to determine <b>structural</b> <b>loads,</b> required for the analysis and design of structures. While most CET programs expose their students to structural analysis and design using instructor or textbook-prescribed loads, few expose students to the detailed calculation of actual <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> using current codes. Many jurisdictions in the United States, including New York State, have recently adopted the International Building Code (IBC), which contains the latest provisions on <b>structural</b> <b>loads,</b> including wind and seismic loads for buildings. Prior to 2002, in New York State, the building code only required buildings to be designed for wind loads using a very simple tabular method. Seismic loads were not considered. Under that dispensation, it was possible and feasible to integrate the topic of <b>structural</b> <b>loads,</b> dead, live, snow and wind load, into any one of the structural design courses, all-be-it at an elementary level. However, with the adoption of building codes, such as the IBC 2000, the calculation of <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> has become complex and time consuming. In order to meet the changing needs in this subject area of the CET curriculum, a new stand-alone course in <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> and systems has become a necessity. This paper discusses the development and integration of a 2 -credit hour required course in <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> and systems that is offered to 3 rd year students in the CET program at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The topics discussed include: impetus for developing the course, course structure and syllabus, integration into the curriculum, intended learning outcomes, course text development (no available structured textbook exists), typical homework assignments, summary and conclusions...|$|R

2500|$|The Carbon Dragon is {{predominantly}} a conventional wood and doped aircraft fabric glider, making judicious use of carbon fiber in the wing spar caps, control rods, flaperons and the elliptical tail boom to save weight.

The cockpit is totally enclosed {{and the original}} design called for a cockpit width of [...] at the hips and [...] at the shoulder, although some have been modified to accommodate pilots of larger dimensions. The main aircraft structure consists of dual triangular torque boxes {{on each side of}} the fuselage. The wing employs a Culver SD airfoil that was designed by Irv Culver for the project and full-span flaperons of 30% chord. The flaperons can deploy from −5° to +15° as flaps and −4° to +16° as ailerons, with a 4:1 differential. The flaperons are driven by two, vertically mounted pushrods enclosed within the fuselage and connected to the side stick. The wing ribs forward of the spar are fabricated from [...] 5-ply mahogany and aft of the spar from [...] square spruce. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel, mounted on the hinged cockpit bottom door, that opens to allow the pilot to lift the aircraft for foot-launching. The aircraft was designed so that if the pilot falls while foot-launching his body will be in the rear fuselage cavity and not pinned under the aircraft.

40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>loading</b> {{produced}} by an impacting vortex is a hazardous phenomenon that is encountered in numerous applications {{ranging from the}} destruction of residences by tornados to the chopping of tip vortices by rotors. Adequate design of structures to resist vortex-induced <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> necessitates study of the phenomenon that control the <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> {{produced by}} an impacting vortex. This body of work extends the current knowledge base of vortex-structure interaction by evaluating {{the influence of the}} relative vortex-to-structure size on the <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> that the vortex produces. A computer model is utilized to directly simulate the two-dimensional impact of an impinging vortex with a slender, cylindrical structure. The vortex’s tangential velocity profile (TVP) is defined by a normalization of the Vatistas analytical (TVP) which realistically replicates the documented spectrum of measured vortex TVPs. The impinging vortex’s maximum tangential velocity is fixed, and the vortex’s critical radius is incremented from one to one-hundred times the structure’s diameter. When the impinging vortex is small, it interacts with vortices produced on the structure by the free stream, and maximum force coefficient amplitudes vary by more than 400 % when the impinging vortex impacts the structure at different times. Maximum drag and lift force coefficient amplitudes reach asymptotic values as the impinging vortex’s size increases that are respectively 94. 77 % and 10. 66 % less than maximum force coefficients produced by an equivalent maximum velocity free stream. The vortex produces maximum <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> when its path is shifted above the structure’s centerline, and maximum drag and lift force coefficients are respectively up to 4. 80 % and 34. 07 % greater than maximum force coefficients produced by an equivalent-velocity free stream. Finally, the dynamic load factor (DLF) concept is used to develop a generalized methodology to assess the dynamic amplification of a structure’s response to vortex loading and to assess the dynamic loading threat that tornados pose. Typical civil and residential structures will not experience significant response amplification, but responses of very flexible structures may be amplified by up to 2. 88 times...|$|R
