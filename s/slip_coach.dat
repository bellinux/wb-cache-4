50|$|Between 1888 and 1901 the G&SWR {{operated}} a <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> service. The <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> section was slipped at Irvine off the 4.15 pm St Enoch to Ayr, which ran non-stop from Paisley to Prestwick. The slip section {{was attached to}} an Ardrossan to Ayr stopping train, with which it followed the main train. Six-wheel brake vans with end windows were built for the service.|$|E
50|$|The train {{coaches were}} hauled by a YP steam {{locomotive}} {{and had a}} <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> from Vasco da Gama to Guntur. This <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> to Guntur {{was attached to the}} Gomantak Express along with slip coaches to Gadag. These slip coaches were then attached to the Miraj Gadag link express at Londa and the <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> to Guntur was then attached to the Hubli Guntur fast passenger service at Gadag. This practice of attaching/detaching the slip coaches was discontinued at Gadag and instead the slip coaches went as far as Hubli after the introduction of the Amaravati Express. This practice continued until the gauge conversion work started in the mid-1990s and the train tracks were standardised in 1997.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{baseline}} {{traffic on the}} line was difficult to augment, the Great Western Railway fostered an increase in tourist traffic, especially from South Wales, on the line.

50|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>coach</b> has widely been {{replaced}} by dividing trains where for example a 8-coach train would split in 2 portions e.g. a portion to serve a main line {{and the other to}} serve a branch line spurring off the main line in question.

50|$|A <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> or slip {{carriage}} is a British and Irish railway {{term for}} passenger rolling stock that is uncoupled from an express train while {{the train is}} in motion, then slowed by a guard in the coach using the brakes, bringing it {{to a stop at}} the next station. The coach was thus said to be slipped from its train. This allowed passengers to alight at an intermediate station without the main train having to stop, thus improving the journey time of the main train. In an era when the railway companies were highly competitive, they strove to keep journey times as short as possible, avoiding intermediate stops wherever possible.|$|E
50|$|The station {{became a}} popular {{alighting}} place for day-trippers from London {{and two or}} three special services ran on Sundays bringing as many as fifty or sixty excursionists to the area who often found they had to walk the four miles to Buckingham in the absence of local conveyances. A <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> service to Buckingham was introduced in 1923 {{to take advantage of the}} wealthy and prominent commuters who were now living in the area; these included Admiral Roger Keyes and Captain Ferrass Loftus who both lived at Tingewick, the banker L. Fleischmann of Chetwode Manor and Charles William Trotter, a director of the LNER who lived at Barton Hartshorn Manor.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1904, the GWR {{introduced}} a new express train to replace The Cornishman: the Cornish Riviera Limited, running non-stop from Paddington to Plymouth North Road station and then through Cornwall to Penzance. The Cornishman name was not used again until summer 1935, when it was re-introduced for the 10:35 relief to the Cornish Riviera Limited. The timetable showed the [...] "Limited" [...] running non-stop to Truro, although stopping to add a banker at Newton Abbot and to change engines at Devonport; The Cornishman had the Weymouth <b>Slip</b> <b>coach,</b> and contained portions for Plymouth, Newquay, Helston, St Erth and Penzance.

50|$|Initially, {{numbered}} as 3132, {{this service}} had 4 <b>slip</b> <b>coaches</b> linked with Island Express at Erode. Later, C. K. Jaffer Sharief, the then Minister of Railways, introduced an exclusive full service between Bengaluru and Trichy as Train No.65316532 operated by Bengaluru railway division of Southern Railway zone, (before {{the formation of}} South Western Railway zone).|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{services}} originally {{consisted of}} four trains each way per day, with additional services between Weedon and Daventry, however by the 1920s and 30s this {{had grown to}} eleven trains each way per day, some of which continued to either Nuneaton or Northampton (requiring reversal at Blisworth). Additional trains also ran in the mornings and afternoons between Leamington and Flecknoe (later cut back to Napton) {{for the benefit of}} schoolchildren. A short lived <b>slip</b> <b>coach</b> service from London was introduced for a while in the 1900s but was not a success. The service was cut back sharply during World War II, and the pre-war timetable was never fully reintroduced. The growth in bus and car traffic meant that the passenger numbers declined from the 1940s onwards. Flecknoe station was the most remote station on the line and closed to passengers in 1952 but remained open for freight until 1956. All passenger services on the line were withdrawn on 13 September 1958.|$|E
50|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway’s stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and <b>slip</b> <b>coaches.</b> Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk and at express speeds.|$|R
50|$|The first certain {{example of}} this {{practice}} being carried out was at Haywards Heath on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in February 1858. Improvements in the acceleration of trains, the introduction of fixed multiple unit trains, and the high cost per passenger of operating <b>slip</b> <b>coaches,</b> meant that the operation had mostly died out by the mid-20th century.|$|R

50|$|With {{the opening}} of the London Extension in 1899, Sheffield gained a new direct service to London. To attract the lucrative trade between the cities, the Great Central Railway {{launched}} Sheffield Without A Stop on 1 July 1903 and became something of a trademark for the company, with 163.75 mi being run in exactly 3 hours, an average of nearly 55 mph. <b>Slip</b> <b>coaches</b> were provided for passengers for Leicester and Nottingham.|$|R
