2500|$|Subsumption {{architecture}} is a methodology for developing artificial intelligence that is heavily associated with behavior based robotics. [...] This {{architecture is}} a way of decomposing complicated intelligent behavior into many [...] "simple" [...] behavior modules, which are in turn organized into layers. Each layer implements a particular goal of the <b>software</b> <b>agent</b> (i.e. system as a whole), and higher layers are increasingly more abstract. Each layer's goal subsumes that of the underlying layers, e.g. the decision to move forward by the eat-food layer takes into account the decision of the lowest obstacle-avoidance layer. Behavior need not be planned by a superior layer, rather behaviors may be triggered by sensory inputs and so are only active under circumstances where they might be appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|MASSIVE is {{the name}} of a {{computer}} program developed by Weta to create automatic battle sequences rather than individually animate every soldier. Stephen Regelous developed the system in 1996, originally to create crowd scenes in King Kong. The system creates a large number of choices for each <b>software</b> <b>agent</b> to pick when inside a digital arena. Catherine Thiel provided the movements of each type of soldier, like the unique fighting styles (designed by Tony Wolf) or fleeing. To add to this, digital environments would also be created for the simulations. Massive also features Grunt, a memory-conservative special purpose renderer, which was used for scenes containing as many as 200,000 agents and several million polygons. The Pelennor Fields scene also contains [...] "multi-body agents" [...] {{in the form of a}} 5×5 grid of Orcs.|$|E

40|$|Faced {{with the}} ongoing {{evolution}} of <b>software</b> <b>agents</b> from mere passive tools to e-tailers acting autonomously for their human owners (principals), new legal challenges {{appear on the}} agenda.

Based on the characteristics of <b>software</b> <b>agents</b> this paper examines approaches for a legal classification of <b>software</b> <b>agents</b> and thereby analyzes current legislation that deal with the conclusion of contracts by <b>software</b> <b>agents.</b> Finally, this paper addresses remaining legal questions and discusses proposed solutions...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the strengths and}} limitations of <b>software</b> <b>agents</b> is very important. Many issues and limitations have been discussed in the literature, for example, <b>software</b> <b>agents</b> have limited learning capability. However, if we could see such limitations in a controlled environment and measure how such limitations affect the agents' performance, such research can be extremely helpful to design better <b>software</b> <b>agents.</b> We developed an artificial market with networked computers to simulate {{the environment of the}} Internet. This artificial market allows players, such as, humans or <b>software</b> <b>agents,</b> to compete in a simulated dynamic market. We conducted two sets of experiments to study the limitations of <b>software</b> <b>agents.</b> The first set of five experiments were used to identify the knowledge or strategies that human subjects applied in competition. We classified the knowledge or strategies into four levels: perception, uses of simple model and heuristics, application of long-term strategies and psychological tactics, and prediction or forecasting. The second set of five experiments studied how much humans can transfer their knowledge to the <b>software</b> <b>agents.</b> In all the experiments, subjects received monetay rewards From the statistical analysis of the decisions of humans and <b>software</b> <b>agents,</b> we have identified several limitations to the <b>software</b> <b>agents.</b> For example, some subjects used veiy complicated strategies and psychological tactics in earning high profits. However, they could not transfer such knowledge to the <b>software</b> <b>agents.</b> From interviews and questionnaires we confirmed such findings. Based on these Jindings, we conclude that <b>software</b> <b>agents</b> are suitable for wellstructured and repeating tasks and not suitable for critical and high-risk task, such as, investment. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

An identical set of tests is also conducted using <b>software</b> <b>agents</b> to represent all of the suppliers.
