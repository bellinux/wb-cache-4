5|$|Although {{she had not}} {{suffered}} {{anything like}} the damage she had inflicted, Virginia was not completely unscathed. Shots from Cumberland, Congress, and Union troops ashore had riddled her <b>smokestack,</b> reducing her already low speed. Two of her guns were disabled and several armor plates had been loosened. Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, whose left thigh was pierced by a rifle shot.|$|E
5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's <b>smokestack.</b> Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E
50|$|About point 2, the <b>smokestacks</b> were {{arranged}} in a diamond shape, {{and in the middle}} the two <b>smokestacks</b> that are arranged parallel and the others in the front and back overlap so that it looks like there’s only one. When viewed from right beside it, it looks like there’s only one. At a diagonal it looks like there are two. From in between them, all four are visible, and from the direct front it looks like there are three. Also, you could see the <b>smokestacks</b> very well from the Jōban Line or Keisei lines, and you could see the number of <b>smokestacks</b> change as the train moved down the tracks.|$|R

5|$|Later that day, {{the ship}} {{captured}} a barge {{out from under}} the guns of Fort Powell, a fortification guarding another entrance to Mobile Bay further north. Chickasaw fired 25 shots at the fort and was struck once, another hit on her <b>smokestack.</b> On 6 August, the ship bombarded Fort Gaines for two hours in support of troops besieging the fort. Beginning on 13 August, she intermittently bombarded Fort Morgan until the fort surrendered on 23 August. Between 15–17 August, Chickasaw was operating further north in Mobile Bay and engaged several of the ships defending Mobile without result.|$|E
5|$|The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works {{locomotive}} acquired {{along with}} them could not be restored. Built in 1902, this locomotive was {{the oldest of the}} five locomotives purchased and was determined to have too many problems to be rebuilt. It was stored out of use in California for a period before being sold to an unknown locomotive broker. Some of its parts were used to help restore the four Baldwin locomotives, including its <b>smokestack,</b> which was fitted to the WDWRR's No. 4 locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Strickland did {{not take}} into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a <b>smokestack</b> (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E

5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight <b>smokestack</b> (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular headlamp, and a small cowcatcher. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an observation coach. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond <b>smokestack</b> (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a caboose. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E

25|$|Turkey Point was {{directly}} hit by Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992, destroying two raw water tanks and {{portions of the}} fire protection systems, draining another raw water tank, partially disabling the fire protection systems, causing severe damage to various non-nuclear structures, and cracking the <b>smokestack</b> for fossil-fueled Unit 1. The <b>smokestack</b> later had to be demolished and rebuilt. It also suffered a total loss of offsite power, requiring {{the use of the}} onsite emergency diesel generators for several days. No significant damage was done to the plant's nuclear containment buildings. The plant was built to withstand winds of up to 235mph (380km/h), greatly exceeding the maximum winds recorded by most category 5 hurricanes.|$|E

25|$|The 2nd Brigade reached Samawah at 3:00 AM on 30 March, {{expecting to}} assault a trench {{line on the}} eastern {{outskirts}} of the town. Instead, they discovered a sand berm surrounding a landfill, which was not defended by enemy forces. At dawn, the Americans began to advance towards the cement factory and received heavy small arms, mortar, and RPG fire. A sharp firefight developed between the Americans hiding behind the berms in the landfill and railroad track, and the Iraqi forces around the cement factory. An Iraqi sniper fired {{from the top of}} the factory's <b>smokestack</b> until an American soldier fired a TOW missile into the <b>smokestack,</b> collapsing the structure. Lacking smoke shells for their mortars in order to screen their movements, American forces were unable to advance and pulled back to the east. OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters arrived and attacked enemy mortar and RPG teams, and destroyed several technical vehicles. At around 3:00 PM, Navy F/A-18 Hornets arrived on station and bombed a warehouse attached to the cement factory. Fighting around the cement factory died down at nightfall.|$|E
