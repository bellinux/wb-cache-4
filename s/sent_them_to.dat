5|$|With {{government}} abatement and Quisling's personal engagement, Jews {{were registered}} in a German initiative of January 1942. On 26 October, German forces, {{with help from}} the Norwegian police, arrested 300 registered male Jews in Norway and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> concentration camps, most in Berg and manned by Hirden, the paramilitary wing of Nasjonal Samling. Over-65s were quickly released by the Norwegian government. Most controversially, the Jews's property was confiscated by the state.|$|E

5|$|Benedetto Pistrucci {{was born}} in Rome on 24 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (née Greco). His elder brother Filippo {{displayed}} artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci wanted his sons to follow in his footsteps and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys {{were enrolled in the}} Roman College.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, {{but with all the}} sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|In spring 587, Philippicus {{was again}} ill, {{and unable to}} {{campaign}} in person. He assigned two thirds of his army to Heraclius the Elder and the remainder to generals Theodore and Andreas, and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> raid Persian territory. Heraclius the Elder besieged an unnamed strong fort, using his siege engines day and night until it fell. After installing a garrison in the captured fort, Theophanes the Confessor reports that Heraclius the Elder proceeded to join General Theodore at the siege of Beioudaes, but {{this seems to be}} an error. Theophanes seems to have misunderstood the relevant passage of Theophylact which has Theodore and Andreas joining at that siege.|$|E

5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|The design {{department}} found all their locations and designed sets in eight weeks, guided by {{input from the}} filmmakers. Nowak started by creating artwork for all the major sets and locations, working with the two concept artists Tim Flattery and Jim Martin. Nowak created drafts and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Flattery and Martin who continued to develop them until they were complete. The complete artwork was then presented to Chris Carter, Rob Bowman, Lata Ryan and Sackheim for approval. While considering the time schedule, they made no notable changes to the artwork.|$|E

5|$|These troops, {{who were}} trained soldiers, were {{responsible}} for preparing the combat reports {{to be used as}} source material for the OKW communiqués. The propaganda companies were only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda for immediate dissemination.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, {{and with}} the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. The second time he was informed {{there was only one}} uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S.atratus), despite size and colour differences, and <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began {{to attract the attention of}} biologists, and were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.|$|E
5|$|Emesa and Chalcis {{asked for}} peace for a year. Abu Ubaidah, {{accepted}} the offer {{and rather than}} invading the districts of Emesa and Chalcis, he consolidated his rule in conquered land and captured Hama, Ma’arrat an Nu’man. However, the peace treaties were on Heraclius' instructions to lull the Muslims and to secure time for preparation of defenses of Northern Syria. Having mustered sizable armies at Antioch, Heraclius <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reinforce strategically important areas of Northern Syria, most importantly the strong fortress of Chalcis. With the arrival of Byzantine army in the city, the peace treaty was violated. Abu Ubadiah and Khalid then marched to Emesa, and a Byzantine army that halted Khalid’s advance guard was routed and the Muslims besieged Emesa which was finally completed in March 636 after two months of siege.|$|E

5|$|Forster's force landed {{near the}} American-occupied fort on May 18, and sent in {{a demand for}} surrender. Butterfield countered with a request to {{withdraw}} under arms, which Forster refused. The parties exchanged fire. During {{the course of the}} exchange, Forster received word that Sherburne had crossed the Ottawa River from the island of Montreal to Quinze-Chênes, but, believing The Cedars to have fallen already, had retreated back across the river. This news caused the besiegers to redouble their efforts the next day. Additional help arrived for the British in the form of about 40Canadiens under Jean-Baptiste Testard de Montigny; Forster <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> harass Sherburne. Word then came to Forster that Sherburne had resumed his advance; Butterfield, unaware of this, surrendered the fort. The terms of capitulation included a guarantee of the personal safety of the captured men. The Iroquois plundered the fort's stores, and denied some of the captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem {{had been}} well-fortified after Heraclius recaptured {{it from the}} Persians. After the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius {{repaired}} its defenses. The Muslims had so far not attempted any siege of the city. However, since 634, Saracen forces {{had the potential to}} threaten all routes to the city. Although it was not encircled, it had been in a state of siege since the Muslims captured the neighboring forts of Pella and Bosra. After the Battle of Yarmouk, the city was severed from the rest of Syria, and was presumably being prepared for a siege that seemed inevitable. When the Muslim army reached Jericho, Sophronius collected all the holy relics including the True Cross, and secretly <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the coast, to be taken to Constantinople. The Muslim troops besieged the city some time in November 636. Instead of relentless assaults on the city, they decided to press on with the siege until the Byzantines ran short of supplies and a bloodless surrender could be negotiated.|$|E
5|$|Sympathetic towards Chabaneau's {{state of}} poverty, the {{director}} of a Jesuit college in Passy offered him a position as a mathematics professor, despite Chabaneau having only a basic understanding of arithmetic. In studying the material for the next day's lessons, Chabaneau taught himself algebra and geometry. His academic interest soon spread to physics, natural history, and chemistry. At the age of twenty, Chabaneau was convinced to join the newly established Real Seminario Patriotico at Vergara to teach French and physics by brothers Fausto and Juan José Elhuyar. The two brothers, who later made a name for themselves by isolating metallic tungsten, had been hired by the Count of Peñaflorida, who had <b>sent</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> France to find professors for the Vergara Seminary.|$|E
