25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design {{was different from}} the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left hand drive version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> difficult to get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E

Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn."

500|$|The video {{channels}} [...] "Nano of the North", {{an episode}} {{from the fourth}} season of The Powerpuff Girls, in which each Sugababes member portrays a Powerpuff Girl. The video opens with a clip of Professor Utonium driving in his car. Meanwhile, a dark cloud hovers over Townsville and it soon begins to rain and dissolves the town. When Professor Utonium arrives home, The Powerpuff Girls are shown watching the Sugababes on television, although the clip is interrupted with a News Flash that reads [...] "Robot Rain Terrorises Townsville". Professor Utonium manages to retrieve the Sugababes and infuses them with Chemical X. He shrinks them to a microscopic size, places them in a glass jar and drives off {{in the car with}} them. He exits the car but trips over, causing the jar to drop and break. The Sugababes, playing the roles of The Powerpuff Girls, fight off the Nanobots with their superpowers. However, a gigantic Nanobot soon appears, and subsequently defeats the Sugababes through superior strength. Professor Utonium witnesses the incident and crushes the Nanobot with his foot. The rain subsequently stops and the sun appears, in which the people of the town start to celebrate. When the Sugababes were questioned about their reaction to the video and its animation, group member Keisha Buchanan responded: [...] "It was so funny seeing us like that and the Powerpuff Girls cartoon itself. The video so much resembled our personalities with these three characters <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> funny to watch actually." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2001, Sneaky Sound System {{were formed}} in Sydney as hosts to dance music parties, Sneaky Sundays. Black Angus (Angus McDonald) had met MC Double D (Daimon Downey) at {{a fancy dress}} party in 2000 and the pair soon became flatmates. Angus {{was working as a}} DJ with Damien Hesse and invited D to MC at their regular Sunday parties. Hesse {{explained}} their concept [...] "We wanted to start a Sunday night, our own night in Sydney, because we didn't feel we fit into anything else that was going on ... We played for over a year to over 100 people in a basement in Bondi <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much an underground thing". Various live musicians would perform irregularly with Sneaky Sound System, the group added cabaret elements including specialist dancers. With Angus on guitar and D on vocoder and vocals, they began gigging at various clubs and festivals along the Australian east coast. They recorded a remix album, Other Peoples Music, produced and engineered by Peter Dolso. The double CD was released on 3 October 2003 by Sony Music Australia. The line-up for the album included Angus, D, Hesse (as a remixer) and Tricky Nick (Nick Broadhurst) on saxophone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly written and {{recorded}} in the girls' home in Los Angeles with German songwriter Toby Gad. Jessica Origliasso states [...] "It was really great. Toby works on a simplified set-up on his Mac computer. It takes all the pressure out {{of being in a}} recording studio. We were able to take our time and get it right and not stress about time ticking." [...] When working on the album the girls knew exactly which songwriters they wanted to work with including Billy Steinberg (who has worked with Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used). The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song [...] "Revenge Is Sweeter (Than You Ever Were)" [...] is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states [...] "When it comes down to it, that song's about cheating. A {{lot of people have been}} through it, like I've been through it, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> easy to relate to that situation. And I saw that whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her." [...] Another personal song includes [...] "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that [...] "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly because we were bawling our eyes out". Jess says, [...] "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".|$|E
2500|$|The album {{title is}} a catchphrase used by Ghoulardi, the 1960s horror host alter-ego of Cleveland {{television}} presenter Ernie Anderson. Carney called the title [...] "a shout-out to Ohio", {{the state in}} which he and Auerbach grew up. The title also captured the despondent tone of the record. Auerbach said, [...] "We liked the association with Ghoulardi, this kind of weird freak from Ohio from the early 60s – that was a phrase he used to use. And then {{so much of the}} album was lyrically melancholy and introspective and personal, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> blue. I guess it just made sense." [...] Carney explained the original context in which Ghoulardi used the phrase: [...] "It's [...] way of telling people to fuck off." [...] The cover art, which features an image of a blue and magenta spiral, was designed by Michael Carney, the group's art director and Patrick's brother. After selecting the title, Patrick said the group began [...] "referencing early '60s sci-fi, shows like The Outer Limits and Twilight Zone" [...] for the art direction, due to Ghoulardi's association with the genre. The album's artwork was influenced by Carney's interest in mind control; the subject drew his attention after he feuded on Twitter with fans of pop star Justin Bieber. Director Harmony Korine subsequently recommended Carney watch the 1985 film The Peanut Butter Solution, in which a teacher uses mind control on students to make them build paintbrushes. The film inspired the hypnotism wheel on the cover and in the album's promotional videos.|$|E
