40|$|Abstract - Dutch organic {{dairy farmers}} {{asked for a}} tool to get insight in the {{ecological}} sustainabilty of their farms. For that purpose, the area used for milk production outside the farm was calculated for 17 farmers. As expected, a high variation in external input was found, since diversity in farming {{was one of the}} selection criteria for involving the project. Management factors as <b>selling</b> <b>manure</b> and crop rotation resulted in a smaller total area used per kg produced milk. A deep litter stable and a low clover percentage in the grassland fields caused on the other hand an increasment in total area used per kg milk and thereby a lower degree of closeness of nutrient cycles. The calculation of external hectares (ha) gave the farmers insight in the total area that they used for milk production. The degree of closeness varied per farm, which means that improvement on this issue is possible. A few Bioveem-farmers have almost closed their cycles; these farmers used no, or even a nega-tive amount of external ha. This means that closing nutrient cycles is possible in organic dairy farming. And that in some cases even space is created for other more demanding types of land use such arable farming. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective of {{this project}} is to measure farm-gate {{phosphorus}} (P) import/export balances on Minnesota dairy farms and beef feedlots, identify imbalance sources, and examine strategies for reducing excess soil test phosphorus (STP) buildup. When livestock farms are land-limited relative to manure-P STP can rise, increasing dissolved and particulate P in runoff, and increasing algae growth in rivers and lakes. Detailed spreadsheet analyses of P imports and exports on fourteen dairy and five beef feedlots collected where there was expectation of excess P imports over exports. Excess P ranged from less than 1 to 130 kg ha- 1 year- 1. Feed and fertilizer were the largest P import sources with feed supplements usually the largest. There were case studies developed in four management areas: 1. Feed management: reduce ration P to National Research Council recommendations, and reduce feed waste. 2. Herd management: breed all heifers to freshen at 22 - 24 months, and reduce heifer inventory. 3. Crop management: increase crop yields and forage quality, and base P fertilizer applications (including starter) on university guidelines. 4. Manure management: transport manure to distant low STP fields, <b>sell</b> <b>manure,</b> and incorporate manure to conserve nitrogen (N), allowing reduced application rates to meet crop N requirements. Case studies presented at 21 workshops to dairy farms, beef feedlots, and agricultural professionals. Almost half of producer attendees stated their operations are likely out of balance; most are considering adopting {{one or more of}} the strategies presented.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of {{structural}} changes in hog production manure management practices. Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study are obtained from a large-scale nationwide hog producers' survey in rural China conducted by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2010. A descriptive analysis between hog manure management and its main determinants was conducted. Based on the collected data, an econometric model on the determinants of hog manure management was constructed and used for analysis. Findings - The results of this study suggest that the scale of hog production has an important impact on the pattern of hog manure management. Moreover, the results from descriptive statistics and multivariate estimation suggest that smaller hog producers are more likely to apply hog manure to their own lands, while larger hog producers are more likely to <b>sell</b> the <b>manure</b> or find other ways to dispose of it. Originality/value - This study contributes to the existing literature by examining the impact of structural changes in hog production on hog manure management and the environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{and use of}} biomass fuels for heating and cooking presents a ubiquitous problem {{for the majority of}} people on three continents. Inefficient cooking and heating practices (wood burns at 5 – 8 % efficiency and cow dung at 3 – 5 %) not only pollute the home but deplete biomass resources and require increasing amounts of time and energy for fuel acquisition. These factors challenge the sustainability of local and global environments as well as the health and economic prosperity of vast numbers of people in the developing world. In response to these issues, Fort Lewis College students have designed and built four biogas digester prototypes and completed a design for a biogas digester based on the research and results of experiments conducted at Fort Lewis College was developed for use in Chimborazo Ecuador. The recommended design is a 7000 liter balloon style biogas plant constructed using ferrocement. The design includes a construction plan that includes estimated cost of construction as well as operation and maintenance of the system. The financial cost of the digester is an estimate of the cost to purchase the required materials in Ecuador. Biogas utilization for cooking, and for the production of anaerobically digested manure is a unique and realizable opportunity for a vast number of people and communities in both the developing and developed world. Positive impacts are possible in terms of quality of life (reduced time for fuel collection, reduced fuel costs, and improved sanitation, increased crop yields), improved health (reduced indoor smoke from clean burning biogas), economic savings and/or earnings (eliminates need for purchasing traditional fertilizers and creates an opportunity to <b>sell</b> excess <b>manure</b> generated by digesters), and environmental responsibility (utilizes renewable resource and enhances soil fertility) ...|$|R
40|$|Livestock {{and crop}} {{producers}} can reduce or even eliminate purchases of commercial nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) by taking proper credit for manure nutrients applied to their fields. The N, P, and K {{value of the}} manure generated annually by a 100 -sow farrow-to-finish operation can be worth over $ 8, 000 {{at the time it}} is hauled to the field. (Note that the cost of transporting manure to the field or land applying the manure to cropland is not included here.) Producers can profit from these manure nutrients on their own cropland or by <b>selling</b> the <b>manure</b> to neighboring crop farmers. Replacement Strategy The fertilizer bill for a 150 bu/acre corn crop is approximately $ 100 /acre if only the value of the N applied and the P and K removed by the crop are considered. A 50 bu/acre soybean crop removes approximately $ 40 of P and K per acre. Because manure contains more P and K relative to N based on corn crop removal, manure applied to corn based on crop N needs generally contains enough P and K to fertilize a second crop with both nutrients. Therefore, in a two-year corn-soybean rotation, the manure applied to a corn crop can easily be worth $ 140 /acre by eliminating the need for commercial N, P, and K for both the corn and soybean crops. Ideally, you should apply manure based on its plant-available N (PAN) content and place it on fields that test low for P and K so that crop production fields can benefit from the added P and K. To maximize manure nutrient value, you need three things: a manure nutrient analysis, application equipment that can apply manure at the desired PAN rate, and soil test reports to determine which fields will benefit most from the P and K present in the manure.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to identify the major determinants (e. g. zootechnical and socio-economic parameters) of manure management practised by urban livestock keepers. Data were collected from four single-visit, multi-object surveys in three cities of Africa. The livestock keepers were classified either as 'good user' or 'bad user' of manure depending on how they use the manure. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the habit of manure utilization shows geographical differences. In general, livestock keepers engaged in agricultural activities are good manure users. Furthermore, manual workers, traders or the self-employed are better manure users than other professional groups. The manure utilization varies also in function of the livestock numbers. In Brazzaville, the habit of <b>selling</b> animals influenced <b>manure</b> management positively. Experience of keeping livestock before the civil war in Brazzaville was also a determining factor of manure use in the post-war urban livestock keeping in 2001. When designing policies to reduce the environmental effects of urban livestock keeping, the highlighted factors can assist city planners to understand how urban livestock keepers use manure. Using the non-parametric classification tree method CART, two approaches were used to select an optimal classification of 'bad' manure users: the 'Cook and Goldman rule' and the 'Classification with different misclassification cost ratios' method. The optimal tree was selected by using receiver operating characteristics curve information. This method can be useful in assessing other aspects of waste management...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{and use of}} biomass fuels for heating and cooking presents a ubiquitous problem {{for the majority of}} people on three continents. Inefficient cooking and heating practices (wood burns at 5 – 8 % efficiency and cow dung at 3 – 5 %) not only pollute the home but deplete biomass resources and require increasing amounts of time and energy for fuel acquisition. These factors challenge the sustainability of local and global environments as well as the health and economic prosperity of vast numbers of people in the developing world. In response to these issues, Fort Lewis College students and faculty received a phase I, EPA P 3 grant which was used to design and build two biogas digester prototypes. Working with faculty, students also designed a low cost cook stove capable of burning the biogas produced, and evaluated biogas slurry application as an appropriate and effective soil fertility amendment. Phase I prototype digesters demonstrated the feasibility of biogas generation, using simple materials such as trash cans, oil drums, and polyethylene bags. A full scale digester, based on prototype biogas production volumes, would range from 5000 to 9000 liters, depending on the design implemented (fixed drum or polybag). This digester volume is projected to meet the cooking needs of a typical Ecuadorian family of six, 2 m 3 gas /day. In addition to producing methane gas for cooking and heating, the system produces significant quantities of bio-digested manure. The bio-digested manure was applied as a fertilizer to potatoes and a newly established grass pasture mixture. Potato shoot dry weight at harvest was 132 % and 131 % of control dry weight for low and high applications of bio-digested manure, respectively. There was a 51 % difference and 80 % difference in dry weight yield from control between low and high applications of bio-digested manure for pasture grasses. Biogas utilization for cooking, and for the production of anaerobically digested manure is a unique and realizable opportunity for a vast number of people and communities in both the developing and developed world.
