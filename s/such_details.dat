5|$|I {{was anxious}} that <b>such</b> <b>details</b> {{should be put}} on record because some of these {{regional}} cooking pots are already becoming {{very hard to find}} in France, so that in some sense Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015 the Australian Federal Court {{refused the}} {{application}} for film makers of Dallas Buyers Club to force ISPs {{to hand over}} the details of their customers. The courts found that the contents of the letter, proposed by the film makers to contact downloaders with, were more demanding than deemed appropriate. The letter was found to ask for <b>such</b> <b>details</b> as salary and other films that were downloaded, as well as punitive damages, which are illegal to seek under Australian law.|$|E

Instead, application software such as window managers, GUI widget toolkits and desktop environments, or application-specific {{graphical user interfaces}} define and provide <b>such</b> <b>details.</b> As a result, there is no typical X interface and several different desktop environments have become popular among users.|$|E

25|$|People can {{be trained}} to have their {{suspicion}} aroused if the message does not contain any specific personal information. Phishing attempts in early 2006, however, used personalized information, which makes it unsafe {{to assume that the}} presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate. Furthermore, another recent study concluded in part that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks, which suggests that most people do not pay attention to <b>such</b> <b>details.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Case for Impeachment devotes {{a chapter}} to assertions of sexual {{misconduct}} made by women against Trump, and details some of Trump's legal affairs stemming from them. Lichtman describes Trump as driven by lust, and places the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording within a larger context of public degradation of women. Events contained {{in the discussion of}} this topic are later contrasted with the fact that despite <b>such</b> <b>details,</b> Trump garnered a majority of white female voters' support compared to his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|<b>Such</b> <b>details</b> are {{corroborated by}} many other sources. Accounts {{of the actions}} of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a {{considerable}} element of carnival to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.|$|E

25|$|The {{ranking of}} lay grades {{has been seen}} by many {{scholars}} as rather schematic and not reflecting realities on the ground. Some of the texts give considerable detail on diet, tools owned, number of livestock, and even the size of house a person of a given status had. Modern scholars have generally assumed <b>such</b> <b>details</b> rarely match exactly what someone of a given rank had. In addition, Críth Gablach contains the fee a client paid to a lord, according to rank from the lowest free man through the noble ranks, even though no noble would be another's client.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great variety}} of such proofs of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, of which several will be given here. They vary in the amount of {{abstract}} algebraic notions required to understand the proof. The simplest proofs use just those notions needed to formulate the theorem (matrices, polynomials with numeric entries, determinants), but involve technical computations that render somewhat mysterious the fact that they lead precisely to the correct conclusion. It is possible to avoid <b>such</b> <b>details,</b> but at the price of involving more subtle algebraic notions: polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, or matrices with unusual kinds of entries.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{a census}} was {{taken of the}} United Kingdom, {{recording}} <b>such</b> <b>details</b> as people's age, ethnicity and religion. According to the Office for National Statistics, {{at the time of}} the census Whitefield had a population of 23,283. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 91.3 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 28.8% were single (never married) 44.6% married, and 8.4% divorced. Whitefield's 9,849 households included 29.8% one-person, 36.8% married couples living together, 8.3% were co-habiting couples, and 11.4% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 30.2% had no academic qualifications.|$|E

The responsibility of this division-level organization was {{to carry out the}} research and engineering phases of all of the experimental flight test programs assigned to the AFFTC, including overseeing <b>such</b> <b>details</b> as the human factors program and overseeing the weighing and balancing of aircraft. Ridley's new organization included separate branches for Data Reduction, Performance Engineering and Flight Research. It was in this post that he made his longest-lasting contributions to the science of flight testing.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{three of}} Presley's bodyguards were fired {{and decided to}} write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle. Worried about the impact <b>such</b> <b>details</b> might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the {{publication}} of the book. Parker made attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so. According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to do something about it. The book would eventually be published in August 1977, two weeks before Presley's death.|$|E
25|$|Mysteriously, {{this work}} was a fresco of her father's Cluj University, which Rădulescu may not have {{attended}} at all, to {{the backdrop of the}} Great Depression and political convulsions. <b>Such</b> <b>details</b> renewed speculation that Marta was signing works penned by Dan Rădulescu. The student-narrator takes part in the strike of 1932, where she meets recruiters for both the Romanian Communist Party and the fascist Iron Guard (including a glimpse of the agitator Bănică Dobre). The autofictional Rădulescu informs the reader that she prefers the Guard, but attends meetings of the far-left, during which communist activists imply that the difference between them and the fascists is a minor one.|$|E

25|$|Two kit {{versions}} of the Chrysler Turbine Car were significant - a standard bronze colored promotional authentic to the cars used by the public, and a white version that {{was the color of}} one of the test mules, which was also lent for the making of the movie The Lively Set. This model had a friction motor and fewer than 500 were produced. Some of the Turbine models were nearly as incredible as the real car, with <b>such</b> <b>details</b> as folding seats, opening doors, hood, deck lid, and steerable front wheels. Chassis detail was remarkable, accurately depicting the huge ducting passages running the length of the car needed to expel the turbine's waste gasses.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} 2005. Filmed {{on location in}} Utah, it received production incentives from the Utah Film Commission, a state agency providing funding to promote development of the film industry in the western state. The waterfalls scene was filmed at Utah's Bridal Veil Falls. In addition to the towns of Circleville and Kanab, scenes were shot in Kane and Tooele Counties, as well as scenic Bryce Canyon. The Stearman biplane used in the aerial sequences {{was provided by the}} Utah Wing of the Commemorative Air Force. Costume designer Anna K.

25|$|Regarding Sophoniba, {{her story}} {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} the rivalry between the two kings, Syphax of Masaesyli (west Numidia) and Masinissa of Massyli (east Numidia). Her story also sheds light {{on the relationship between}} Carthage and the Berbers, with particular reference to Rome. Livy (59 BC–AD 17), the Roman historian, presents a rather detailed portrait of these circumstances, especially events following the defeat of her husband Syphax. <b>Such</b> <b>details</b> may shed light on the personality of Masinissa, or at least on the world in which he lived. Yet ancient historians were not unfamiliar with propaganda and their readers expected them to recreate scenes, giving memorable, probable versions of what might have happened.|$|E
