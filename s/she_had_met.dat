A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley.

5|$|Doro {{signed a}} {{worldwide}} {{contract with the}} major record label WEA (now Warner Music Group) {{at the end of}} 1995 and started writing new material with Jürgen Engler and Chris Lietz of the German industrial metal and EBM band Die Krupps, who <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> while working on remixes of songs from Machine II Machine.

WEA judged the album unsuitable for the US market and published it only in Germany.

She makes the cards every day after dinner for everyone <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>met</b> as well as those people's friends and family even if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not seen them before. In October 1995, Catlin sent birthday cards to roughly 1,400 people. In July 2009, Catlin sent birthday cards each year to 3,834 people.|$|R

5|$|His wife {{of nearly}} half a century, Elizabeth, to whom {{he had not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Rix Nicholas {{returned}} to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> during her travels {{in the early}} 1920s. The couple settled at Delegate, New South Wales; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair Musterer, Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful {{of the works of}} emerging major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, grew out of step with trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, Australian War Memorial, National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Queensland Art Gallery.|$|E
