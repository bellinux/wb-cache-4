2500|$|An {{operating}} system (OS) is software (programs and data) {{that runs on}} computers and manages the computer hardware and provides common services for efficient execution of various application software. For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the {{operating system}} acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware, but will frequently call the OS or be interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on almost any device that contains a computer—from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers. The GM-NAA I/O, created by Owen Mock and Bob Patrick of General Motors Research Laboratories in early 1956 (or late 1955) for their IBM 701 mainframe computer is {{generally considered to be}} the first [...] "batch processing" [...] operating system and possibly the first [...] "real" [...] operating system. Rudimentary forms of operating systems existed before batch processing, the Input/Output Control System (IOCS) being one example. However, what specifically differentiated and made the GM-NAA I/O as {{the first of its kind}} was that instead of having a human operator manually load each program as what previous systems were only capable of doing, computerized software as used on GM-NAA I/O, thereafter handled the <b>scheduling,</b> <b>management,</b> and multi-tasking of all computer applications.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to study the {{description}} and extension of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard in construction <b>schedule</b> <b>management,</b> which achieves the information exchange and sharing among the different information systems and stakeholders, and facilitates the collaborative construction in the construction projects. Design/methodology/approach: The schedule information processing and coordination are difficult in the complex construction project. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides the platform for exchanging and sharing information among information systems and stakeholders based on the IFC standard. Through analyzing the schedule plan, implementing, check and control, the information flow in the <b>schedule</b> <b>management</b> is reflected based on the IDEF. According to the IFC 4, the information model for the <b>schedule</b> <b>management</b> is established, which not only includes the each aspect of the <b>schedule</b> <b>management,</b> but also includes the cost management, the resource management, the quality management and the risk management. Findings: The information requirement for the construction <b>schedule</b> <b>management</b> can be summarized into three aspects: the schedule plan information, the implementing information and the check and control information. The three aspects can be described through the existing and extended entities of IFC 4, and the information models are established. Originality/value : The main contribution of the article is to establish the construction <b>schedule</b> <b>management</b> information model, which achieves the information exchange and share in the construction project, and facilitates the development of the application software to meet the requirements of the construction project. </p...|$|R

The intent is to improve <b>schedule</b> <b>management</b> by providing recommended concepts, processes, and techniques used within the Agency and private industry. The intended function of this handbook is two-fold: first, to provide guidance for meeting the scheduling requirements contained in NPR 7120. 5, NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements, NPR 7120. 7, NASA Information Technology and Institutional Infrastructure Program and Project Requirements, NPR 7120. 8, NASA Research and Technology Program and Project Management Requirements, and NPD 1000. 5, Policy for NASA Acquisition. The second function is to describe the <b>schedule</b> <b>management</b> approach and the recommended best practices for carrying out this project control function.

40|$|Recently, {{works in}} the {{shipbuilding}} industry have become bigger, specialised, and complicated. Therefore, the required work processes are varied and need more material, technology, and labour. Thus, project-scheduling management {{is a major factor}} that increases profits of shipbuilding companies. If the <b>scheduling</b> <b>management</b> fails, drawbacks such as schedule delays and quality deterioration occur. To improve the project-scheduling management, many research studies on <b>scheduling</b> <b>management</b> were conducted using the Program Evaluation and Review Technique/Critical Path Method (PERT/CPM) and critical chain project management (CCPM). The CCPM technique deals with scheduling using a project buffer. Management of the project buffer is very important for successful project scheduling. The main objective of this research is to apply project scheduling on an engine operation outfitting task of a middle-size dual-fuel electric propulsion-liquefied natural gas ship using the CCPM based on the theory of constraints. To consider various environments such as schedule delay factors, it is proposed the method of project-buffer-size decision using the fuzzy theory. As a result, it is recognised that the proposed CCPM is more effective in project scheduling than the CCPM and PERT/CPM, which are traditional project-scheduling methods...|$|E

40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{approach}} {{enables a}} full {{environmental impact evaluation}} for a product or process, and is increasingly being utilised in an agricultural context. An LCA was performed for sugarcane production under irrigation at Pongola, South Africa. A baseline scenario, representing farmer intuition-based irrigation <b>scheduling</b> <b>management,</b> and an objective irrigation <b>scheduling</b> <b>management</b> scenario, were compared. Data from a field and lysimeter trial, the DSSAT-Canegro model, and prescribed LCA methodology were used to compile input and emission inventories for the two scenarios. Findings show that per ton of green cane produced, more accurate irrigation scheduling can reduce the total energy input requirement by 8. 2 % and greenhouse gas emissions by 10 %. Most significantly, eutrophication potential can be reduced by 43 %, mostly due to reduced deep drainage losses. While total water consumption is similar for both scenarios, more effective use of rainfall (green water) is achieved through more accurate scheduling, thus reducing river water extraction requirements. Water savings can potentially be used to irrigate larger areas of land or to meet the environmental reserve. In addition to escalating input (electricity, nitrogen, water) costs, such assessments will further encourage irrigators to schedule more accurately, {{and can be used}} to establish environmental stewardship incentives for farmers. The LCA framework developed in this study can be used to investigate the environmental impact of sugar production in various regions under different management practices in the South African sugar industry...|$|E
