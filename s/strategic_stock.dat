2500|$|The {{estimated}} population size for the Alaska stock of ringed seals is 249,000 animals. Currently, the population trend for this stock is unknown. [...] Ringed seals {{are listed as}} a species of [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN, and are considered not “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act. Reliable estimates of the minimum population, potential biological removal, and human-caused mortality and serious injury are currently not available. Because the potential biological removal for ringed seals is unknown, the level of annual U.S. commercial fishery-related mortality that can be considered insignificant and approaching zero mortality and serious injury rate is unknown.

Due to a very low level of interactions between U.S. commercial fisheries and ringed seals, the Alaska stock of ringed seals is not considered a <b>strategic</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
40|$|Technical {{management}} {{is an important}} policy field for housing associations. Technical management processes influence the product, price, and exploitation characteristics of dwellings. At the higher level the <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy concerns the complete stock of the housing association. The design of a model relationship between the <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy and technical management by housing associations features prominently in the research, and common ground is sought between the two areas. Important points attended to in the study are the relationships between <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy, (de) investment policy, maintenance policy, and rental price policy; the relationships between investments, maintenance activities, performance levels, defects, life cycles and exploitation period; and the relationships between policy development, provision of information, organization, and management. By deriving the technical management from the <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> policy, the housing association can carry out maintenance and adaptations efficiently and effectively [...] in other words in a professional, client-centred, sustainable manner. The likelihood of loss of capital is reduced. Product characteristics and maintenance performance levels can be adjusted to suit the target groups and clients served. Clients appreciate having more freedom of choice in the maintenance and adaptation of the (interior of their) dwellings, and set requirements with respect to maintenance work: information, approachability, client friendly attitudes, orderliness, and so forth. Through the mutual harmonisation of policy, the foundations of policy can be made clear and transparent for all parties concerned {{within and outside the}} organization. Thereby, opportunities are enhanced for controlling processes, costs and performance and contracting out parts of the management process in a responsible manner. The housing associations can concentrate on their core tasks and the planning and control of the technical management process. OT...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWithin {{the last}} decade, several {{cases of the}} supply chain {{vulnerability}} to major disruptions have been observed. The typical mitigation strategies such as safety inventory and excess capacity are inadequate to cover the major disruptions. Furthermore it is not economical to invest in such costly proactive strategies to recover from infrequent disruptions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide a decision making tool achieving robust supply flow by incorporating <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> and reconfigurable back-up supplier in mitigating disruptions. We consider a firm with two suppliers where the main supplier is cost-effective but prone to disruptions and the back-up supplier is reliable but expensive due to re-configurability characteristics. We present a multi-stage robust optimization model to determine optimal <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> levels and layout configuration of the back-up supplier for a supply chain subject to random realization of disruptions and available capacity during the ramp-up time. Furthermore, the partial available capacity of the backup supplier during the response time has been modelled using queuing theoretical models. The results show the optimality of highly scalable configuration as the decision maker becomes more risk averse...|$|E

40|$|Relief Aid in East Africa Over {{a period}} of six months during second half of 2011, the global {{humanitarian}} Community responded {{to one of the}} most severe droughts the world has ever seen. A total of 13 million people were given emergency assistance including food, water and shelter. Unfortunately, this intervention is not an isolated event. The countries located in East Africa have a dire history of political instability, civil war, regional conflicts as well as floods and draughts. As a consequence, millions of people live in poverty and daily struggle against the risk of starvation. To escape conflict zones, natural disasters and areas prone to extreme food shortages people flee their homes to live as refugees. For instance, it is estimated that about one million Somalis live as refugees in the Horn of Africa. Several decades of chronic food deficits in East Africa has led to massive support from the humanitarian community. Governments around the world, the United Nations as well as non-governmental organizations have responded by supplying food directly to the people in need. One of these organizations is Global Food Aid (GFA). GFA has operated in the various countries in East Africa since the 1980 s. Together with the respective governments, GFA is involved with food distribution in response to for instance sudden-onset disasters, refugee camps and long-term development programmes. Project: <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> In responding to the current drought, GFA has received substantial criticism from global media. Primarily, the reactions concern the inability to assist the people in need in a timely manner. It has simply taken too long time to transport and distribute the food. This is not the first time this type of criticism hits GFA and therefore headquarters (HQ) has informed about a new initiative for responding to various emergencies around the world. To decrease the lead times of GFA’s food supply chain, a new initiative to pre-position stock in strategic locations is going to be rolled out to the organization’s field offices. The roll out will be done in several steps where step one focuses on a selected pilot case. The purpose to run a pilot case is to learn and understand the feasibility of <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> in the food supply chain before expanding globally.

40|$|Wheat {{is central}} to the {{government}} of Egypt’s food security policy which is influenced by a concern for overdependence on imports and the need to provide subsidized bread for the poor. This paper uses a multi-market approach {{to assess the impact of}} complete wheat market liberalization, an international wheat price increase, the value of <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> and the impact of investment to generate higher yields and lower transaction costs for wheat producers. Results show that wheat market liberalization implies very substantial costs for consumers and producers. The estimated income losses that these groups suffer would appear to be below the current total subsidy costs and hence a cash transfer program would, in principle, be feasible. The results show that wheat price movements impact strongly on the supply and/or demand side in particular of berseem, rice, maize, cotton and livestock which has significant implications for their net imports as well as input use. Results indicate that <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks</b> can be useful to neutralize the impact of a wheat price spike. Increasing wheat yields and reducing transportation boosts wheat self-sufficiency but does not dampen the impact of removing the wheat subsidy system on household’s welfare.

40|$|In {{the past}} stock {{assessment}} surveys were generally reactive {{in response to}} a particular problem e. g. a pollution incident and as such were limited in the information they provided. A programme of <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> assessment would be more beneficial, providing up to date information on the status and composition of the stock. On a national level this could reveal trends in population dynamics and enable comparisons to be made between key rivers and between regions. The Stock Assessment Task Group (1991) has recommended annual strategic surveys for juvenile salmonids and triennial strategic surveys for coarse fish and non- migratory salmonids. The aim of this pilot study was to gain information on species distribution and their relative abundance within the River Lune catchment, and to compare the findings with the surveys carried out between 1981 - 1985.

Despite suffering drought conditions for much of 1995, only salmon fry production {{appeared to have been}} affected.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to link {{humanitarian}} logistics (HL) and supply chain risk management (SCRM) to provide an understanding of risk mitigation strategies that humanitarian organisations use, or could use, to improve their logistics preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Based on systematic reviews of RMS in SCRM and supply chain strategies (SCS) in HL literature, a framework is developed and used to review published case studies in HL. Findings: The study finds that humanitarian actors use a number of the strategies proposed in the framework, particularly those related to strategic stocks, postponement, and collaboration. Strategies related to sourcing and procurement, however, especially those on supplier relationships, seem to be lacking in both research and practice. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on secondary data and could be further developed through case studies based on primary data. Future studies should explore the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications: Practitioners can use the framework to identify potential new SCS and how strategies can be combined. Findings can help them to understand the abnormal risks of main concern, how they may impact normal risks, and provide ideas on how to tackle trade-offs between different risks. Social implications: The results can support improvements in humanitarian supply chains, which will provide affected people with rapid, cost-efficient, and better-adapted responses. Originality/value: The paper connects SCRM and HL to develop a framework and suggests propositions on how humanitarian actors can mitigate supply chain risks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} costs of {{vaccination}} regimens for introducing inactivated polio vaccine in routine immunization in Brazil. METHODS A cost analysis was conducted for vaccines in five vaccination regimens, including inactivated polio vaccine, compared with the oral polio vaccine-only regimen. The costs of the vaccines were estimated for routine use and for the &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221;, during when the oral polio vaccine is administered to children aged less than five years, independent of their vaccine status, and the <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> of inactivated polio vaccine. The presented estimated costs are of 2011. RESULTS The annual costs of the oral vaccine-only program (routine and two National Immunization Days) were estimated at US$ 19, 873, 170. The incremental costs of inclusion of the inactivated vaccine depended {{on the number of}} vaccine doses, presentation of the vaccine (bottles with single dose or ten doses), and number of &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221; carried out. The cost of the regimen adopted with two doses of inactivated vaccine followed by three doses of oral vaccine and one &# 8220;National Immunization Day&# 8221; was estimated at US$ 29, 653, 539. The concomitant replacement of the DTPw/Hib and HepB vaccines with the pentavalent vaccine enabled the introduction of the inactivated polio without increasing the number of injections or number of visits needed to complete the vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of the inactivated vaccine increased the annual costs of the polio vaccines by 49. 2 % compared with the oral vaccine-only regimen.

40|$|The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) {{includes}} a multi-step process for reducing national marine mammal bycatch. This process requires the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to publish annual marine mammal Stock Assessment Reports (SARs), which include best estimates of each stock’s abundance, population trend, maximum rate of increase, potential biological removal (PBR), and ‘annual human-caused mortality and serious injury’. On {{the basis of}} these estimates, NMFS determines ‘strategic’ stocks which are most at risk from bycatch. According to the MMPA, a stock should be considered strategic if is: a) Threatened or Endangered under the ESA, or decreasing in abundance and likely to be listed, or b) classified as depleted under the MMPA, or c) experiencing direct human-caused mortality and serious injury at a level which exceeds its PBR. If strategic stocks interact with commercial fisheries that have significant levels of marine mammal bycatch, the agency is required to establish Take Reduction Teams (TRTs), which craft Take Reduction Plans (TRPs). TRPs include measures to reduce the fishery-related mortality of a particular <b>strategic</b> <b>stock,</b> given that the current level of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury exceeds the stock’s PBR. Therefore, without a TRT, the strategic stocks interacting with fisheries that cause either frequent or occasional mortality will continue to remain imperiled because nothing is being done to reduce the unsustainable level of stock mortality. Because NMFS’ status determinations are data-dependent, deficient and/or imprecise stock data hinders the agency’s ability to appropriately determine strategic status. This project assessed {{the current state of the}} U.

The motive behind this thesis was to strengthen Cargotec’s service business by creating common policies and by optimizing the {{tied up capital}} in the stocking network while providing suitable service level. The first target was to examine and describe the existing inventory management process. The second objective was to create guidelines for analyzing front line inventories and for determining inventory assortments at different levels. The final objective was to define how inventory management performance should be measured in future. This thesis {{is a mix of}} action oriented research and case study. The first step of the thesis was to create a theoretical framework which would be the foundation for developing and unifying inventory management policies of Cargotec Services. In this part of the thesis, scientific journals and literature were used as source material. The second part of this thesis is the empirical study. This part was begun by examining inventory management processes of both central and case front line unit. The present processes were defined by observation, interviewing responsible personnel, and examining internal documents. After the current processes were examined and described, the streamlining framework was constructed. The framework was based on the theoretical context, interviews, statistics, and benchmarking. This thesis presents a framework for streamlining inventory management process. The framework consists of different guidelines and instructions. The first guideline is for analyzing local item activity. Locally active items are divided into items that need to be stocked locally and items that should be stocked only centrally. Conversely, locally non-active items should be divided into returnable and non-returnable items. The study provides also guidelines for forming <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> in the network and performance measurements for inventory management in future. Besides the inventory management streamlining, Cargotec Services should also measure and develop performance of suppliers, haulers, and warehousing service providers. Cooperation and information sharing between different parties should be enhanced by interaction, communication, and exploitation of the new information system and collaboration tools...|$|E

RESEARCH PURPOSE : This article investigated the supply chain risks faced by grocery manufacturers in the South African fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry and explored supply chain design approaches that enable supply chain resilience. MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY : South African grocery manufacturers are faced with distinct risks. Whilst supply chain risk management studies have provided firms with certain guidelines to mitigate risk, supply chains are still vulnerable to unanticipated risks.

Oil consumption is increasing nearly twice as fast in the region as in the world as a whole, while options for increasing production are severely limited. The result is a steadily growing dependence on imported oil, largely from the volatile Middle East. Apart from efforts to increase domestic production and slow consumption growth, recommendations for policymakers include initiating joint ventures with oil producers, improving the efficiency of domestic markets, building up <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks,</b> strengthening regional cooperation, reducing transportation bottlenecks, and establishing a regional market for oil futures.

40|$|Natural and manmade {{disasters}} {{have occurred}} throughout the decades, within the United States {{and around the}} globe. Increased incidence and awareness of terrorist attacks have caused the US to re-evaluate its safety and preparedness efforts to prevent such events from happening and to develop an adequate response plan if such unfortunate events do occur. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} research is to (1) review and discuss the American Burn Association’s (ABA) paradigm for emergency planning in burn disasters, (2) give recommendation about the National Response Framework (NRF) guidelines on “all hazards” response as they pertains to burns, and (3) give recommendations on how the US can maintain an ample supply of allograft tissue for emergency situations that result in burn victims. A literature review was completed, and a best practices approach for the above issues was created. Recommendations were given to strengthen both ABA’s response plane and the NRF guidelines for burn casualties. Also, opportunities to achieve better outcomes for burn victims by promoting and starting an allograft tissue reserve were recommended. The ABA’s emergency response plan for events that produce mass burn casualties was reviewed. Primary and secondary triaging of burn victims to burn centers is the model used for this organization, yet the ABA’s plan was not congruent with other federal and regional response plans. Differences in these plans centered around triage protocols for treatment on scene as opposed to triage and evacuation to burn centers. Recommendations were given to improve the ABA’s emergency response plan by incorporating other plans and maintaining congruency to accommodate local responses. Furthermore, recommendations for the NRF were constructed by using criteria from the ABA. The NRF provides guidelines for all aspects of government including local, tribal, state, and federal levels by describing how to respond to emergencies for all hazards. Even though this framework provides incident command structure, organization, and alternate resources and organizations, the framework only depicts a broad representation of response actions and does not give detail or awareness to more specific or critical circumstances. If emphasis from the NRF were placed on both local and state awareness of the complexities of mass burn management in emergency situations, better outcomes would be produced. By using the ABA’s response model and guidance from the NRF, regions could create efficient response plans with resources already sustained by their area if federal assistance were unable to reach the emergency in time. The US simply does not have enough allograft tissue available to respond to an emergent event involving mass burn casualties. Although autografts are the preferred method of grafting, other temporary and permanent skin alternatives were reviewed for advantages and disadvantages. Skin on skin is the graft of choice, whether the procedure is an autograft (the person’s own skin) or allograft (skin from a cadaver); as this has been shown to produce the best results versus other alternatives. When burned individuals are unable to provide autografts due to the severity of their burns, cadaveric allograft skin can be used to decrease pain, prevent infection, promote skin growth, and act as a temporary barrier. Proper cryopreservation of allograft tissues preserves these tissues up to five years, with no decrease in viability. Recommendations have been given for the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate a <b>strategic</b> <b>stock</b> of cryopreserved allografts for emergency situations, and for the American Association of Tissue Banking (AATB) to establish and maintain this allograft tissue reserve. Achieving both of these recommendations would allow monitoring inventory using strict storage guidelines and circulating inventory to ensure use before its five year expiration. Further research needs to be completed on these issues to provide additional support and significance. If the recommendations provided were implemented, our nation could save more lives in disasters involving mass burn injuries...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{examination}} of over 40 years of data reveals that oil price shocks are invariably followed by 2 – 3 years of weak {{economic growth and}} weak economic growth is almost always preceded by an oil price shock. This paper reviews why the price-inelastic demand and supply of oil cause oil price shocks and why oil price shocks reduce economic growth through dislocations of labor and capital. This paper also reviews {{the current state of}} oil-supply security noting that previous episodes of supply instability appear to have become chronic conditions. While new unconventional oil production technologies have revitalized North American oil production, there are significant barriers to a world-wide uptake of these technologies. <b>Strategic</b> petroleum <b>stocks</b> could provide a large measure of protection to the world economy during an oil supply disruption if they are used promptly and in sufficient volume to prevent large oil-price spikes. Despite the large volume of world-wide emergency reserves, their effectiveness in protecting world economies is not assured. <b>Strategic</b> oil <b>stocks</b> have not been used in sufficient quantity or soon enough to avoid the economic downturns that followed past oil supply outages. In addition, the growth of U. S. oil production has reduced the ability of the U. S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to protect the economy following a future oil supply disruption. The policy implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) {{have been}} {{identified}} as Arctic ecosystem sentinels because they are broadly dispersed, high trophic feeders and are likely to be negatively impacted by climate change. They are highly dependent on hearing and underwater sound to enact key biological activities such as forage for prey, communicate with conspecifics and navigate. Therefore, understanding how noise might affect their sensory ecology is a priority to encourage their survival and address the broader potential acoustic impacts within the Arctic. Ocean noise levels are increasing in the Arctic due to an increase in human activities, which are related to the interests in Arctic resources and the opening of the Northwest Passage. This is of concern because several beluga populations are endangered and considered <b>strategic</b> <b>stocks.</b> Their hearing sensitivities are unknown. The work presented here describes for the first time how wild belugas hear. OBJECTIVE To describe the hearing sensitivity of temporarily restrained Bristol Bay belugas using auditory evoked potential (AEP) techniques for the range 4 - 180 kHz in the shortest time possible. METHODS 1) Solitary belugas were captured using a 300 -ft. long net, 15 -ft deep with 21 in. mesh deployed from an 18 ft. aluminum skiff with a 70 hp outboard assisted by an additional two to four support boats. Animals were restrained with a combination of a tail rope, head hoop net, and a modified canvass sling. 2) Sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tone-bursts wer...|$|R

40|$|The key {{question}} {{dealt with in}} this report is whether and how governments {{should be involved in}} taking measures regarding security of energy supply. In order to answer this question, we developed a framework for cost-benefit analysis and applied this framework to a number of policy options. The options chosen vary from government investments in <b>strategic</b> oil <b>stocks</b> to financial incentives for consumers to reduce their consumption of electricity. The set of options comprises several types of governmental action, including subsidies, regulation and government investments. Moreover, the selection includes measures meant to address risks on all three major energy markets: oil, natural gas, and electricity. ...|$|R
