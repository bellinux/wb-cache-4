Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special move or reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter made people <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>look.</b> On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine. Over to you, Sony. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210173015/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-review/ |archivedate=December 10, 2014 }} The only other first-party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection. Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn {{proved to be the}} more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of the}} Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E
500|$|First Lady Barbara Bush paraphrased {{the film}} in her 1990 {{commencement}} address at Wellesley College: [...] "Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, 'Life moves pretty fast; if you don't <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> around once in a while, you could miss it!'" [...] Responding to the audience's enthusiastic applause, she added [...] "I'm {{not going to tell}} George ya clapped more for Ferris than ya clapped for George." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the Test series, a major {{convention}} was in progress to discuss the proposed federation of the Australian colonies. However, the victory over England dominated the attention of the Australian public and some newspapers decried the focus on cricket when important matters were being discussed. [...] Another editor remarked in defence of the public, [...] "We believe that Harry Trott and his ten good men and true have done more for the federation of Australian hearts than all the big delegates put together." [...] In reply to complaints about leave granted to Trott to play cricket, his proud employers at the Post office responded [...] "Harry Trott is a national institution." [...] Passers-by, including men and their families, would <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at Trott's home in Albert Park [...] "with the deference of worshippers at a shrine", in the words of cricket writer Ray Robinson.|$|E

She speeds off trying to beat Ferris home. Ferris makes it home first, to find Rooney waiting for him outside. Jeannie races into the house as their mother talks to their father about her {{behavior}} today. Jeannie discovers Rooney threatening Ferris, and has a change of heart; she tells {{him that she was}} just helping to return Ferris from the hospital, and shows Rooney his wallet that she had found from his earlier break-in attempts. Rooney flees while Ferris thanks Jeannie and rushes back to his bedroom to greet his parents while feigning his waning illness. As they leave, Ferris reminds the audience, [...] "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> around once in a while, you could miss it." ...|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
