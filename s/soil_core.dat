40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} effect of tree species on {{nitrification}} in five young plantations and an old native beech coppice forest at the Breuil experimental site in central France. The potential net nitrification (PNN) of soil was high in beech, Corsican pine, and Douglas fir plantations (high nitrifying stands denoted H) and low in spruce and Nordmann fir plantations {{as well as in}} native forest stands (low nitrifying stands denoted L). We hypothesized that tree species would stimulate or inhibit nitrification in transplanted <b>soil</b> <b>cores</b> within a few years after the cores were transplanted between stands. We first initiated a transplant experiment where <b>soil</b> <b>cores</b> were exchanged between all stands. The PNN remained high in <b>soil</b> <b>cores</b> from H transferred to H and low in <b>soil</b> <b>cores</b> from L transferred to L. The PNN increased considerably after 16 months in <b>soil</b> <b>cores</b> transferred from L to H, whereas the transfer of <b>soil</b> <b>cores</b> from H to L decreased the PNN only slightly after 28 months. In a second transplant experiment, forest floor material was exchanged between the Douglas fir (H) and the native forest (L) stand. Six months later, the forest floor from the native forest had increased the PNN of the Douglas fir soil considerably, whereas the forest floor from Douglas fir did not affect the PNN of the soil in the native forest stand. It was concluded that beech, Corsican pine, and Douglas fir rapidly stimulate soil nitrification by either activation of suppressed nitrifier communities and/or colonization by new nitrifier communities. Conversely, the slow and irregular reduction of nitrification in spruce, Nordmann fir, and native forest was probably due to the low and heterogeneously distributed flux of inhibiting substances per volume of soil. Our experiments suggest that the inhibition of nitrification is not tightly connected to forest floor leachates, but that the forest floor both reflects and maintains the major ongoing processes. In the long term, humus build up and the production of inhibiting substances may completely block the nitrification activity...|$|R

Much of this information is obtained {{with the use of}} microcosms. The design of the microcosm significantly affects the ability of the recombinant microorganism to survive in soil and, thus, complicates the risk assessment process. To standardize microcosms for future use, we evaluated the survival of Pseudomonas aureofaciens 3732 RN-L 11 (lacZY Rif(supr) Nal(supr)) in intact soil cores (5. 0 by 15 cm; polyvinyl chloride core) and disturbed soil microcosms (50 g of fresh, sieved soil). Survival data were compared with those obtained during a field release. The intact <b>soil</b> <b>core</b> microcosm was shown to closely simulate results obtained in the field. The intact <b>soil</b> <b>core</b> microcosm closely predicts survival in bulk soil and in the rhizosphere of wheat.

The disturbed soil microcosm exhibited a much more rapid decline in population size (34 days to zero) than the intact core microcosm.

A controlled release fertilizer was introduced into an undisturbed <b>soil</b> <b>core</b> in a laboratory lysimeter and subjected to infiltration events. The production of ions resulting from processes associated with nitrification and their transport through the <b>soil</b> <b>core</b> was observed by time lapse ERT and analysis of seepage water samples from a multicompartment sampler. ERT images show development and propagation of a high-conductivity plume from the fertilizer source zone. Molar amounts of nitrate produced in and exported from the <b>soil</b> <b>core</b> could be well reproduced by time lapse ERT using a spatial moment analysis. Furthermore, we observed that several shape measures of local breakthrough-curves (BTCs) of seepage water conductivity and nitrate derived by effluent analyses and BTCs of bulk conductivity derived by ERT are highly correlated, indicating the preservation of spatial differences of the plume breakthrough in the ERT data. Also differences between nitrate breakthrough and a conservative tracer breakthrough can be observed by ERT. However, the estimation of target ion concentrations by ERT is error bound and the smoothing algorithm of the inversion masks spatial conductivity differences. This results in difficulties reproducing spatial differences of ion source functions and variances of travel times. Despite the observed limitations, we conclude that time lapse ERT can be qualitatively and quantitatively informative with respect to processes affecting the fate of nitrate in arable soils...|$|E

From the field capacities determined {{directly in the}} field, and from 15 -bar moisture percentages obtained on undisturbzd <b>soil</b> <b>cores,</b> tlie total available moisture property has been evaluated for each soil. It has bzen shown that b~lk density influences moisture content over the entire rangz of matric suction 0. 1 to 15. 0 bars. Furthermore, it has b:en demonstrated that bulk density exerts a similar effect on the wilting point determined by the sunflower technique. It has b:en concluded that undisturbed <b>soil</b> <b>cores</b> are essential for reliabl: determinations of the wilting point, and corresponding total availabl: moisture evaluations...|$|R
