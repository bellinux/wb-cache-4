50|$|Explicit {{requirements}} {{exist for}} drainage requirements on ships with well decks. On many vessels the cargo hatches and cargo handling <b>booms</b> and <b>winches</b> were {{located on the}} well decks between a central superstructure and raised forecastle and poop.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship had}} hydrographic <b>booms</b> and <b>winches</b> on her bridge deck on both her port and {{starboard}} sides. The booms had mechanical travelers to which lowering blocks were attached which regulated {{the distance of the}} lowering wire from the rail.|$|R
5000|$|Boom - use an {{adjustable}} <b>boom</b> with a <b>winch</b> to recover vehicles from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reach backing-up. Some booms are fixed, some heavy pivoting A-frames, others hydraulic-powered telescoping tubes. In the past boom trucks used a [...] "hook and chain" [...] system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a <b>boom</b> <b>winch.</b> A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects {{the truck and}} vehicle, {{so it can be}} towed on its other axle. [...] "Slings" [...] and [...] "belt lifts" [...] are an evolution, with rubber straps replacing part of the chains. Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars. But they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have {{one or two of the}} front or rear wheels missing or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers. Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, since it can cause problems with the car's drivetrain.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was {{constructed}} on Georges Head and {{was designed to}} prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a <b>boom</b> net <b>winch</b> house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay.|$|R
50|$|Masts were fitted on the {{centerline}} of {{the vessel}} between hatches Nos. 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 4 and 5, to which cargo booms were rigged. Two king posts, one port and one starboard, were fitted at both the forward and after ends of the deck house. Hatches Nos. 1 and 5 were provided with two 5-ton <b>booms</b> and two <b>winches</b> each. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 hatches were provided with four 5-ton <b>booms</b> and four <b>winches</b> each. The cargo winches were driven by 50-horsepower electric motors, all installed on the main deck.|$|R
50|$|The LST {{proved to}} be a remarkably {{versatile}} ship. A number of them were converted to become landing craft repair ships (ARL). In this design, the bow ramp and doors were removed, and the bow was sealed. Derricks, <b>booms,</b> and <b>winches</b> were added to haul damaged landing craft on board for repairs, and blacksmith, machine, and electrical workshops were provided on the main deck and tank deck.|$|R
50|$|The Bergetiger was {{the name}} the Allied forces gave to a German World War II armored tracked vehicle based on the Tiger I chassis. The vehicle was found {{abandoned}} on a roadside in Italy with terminal engine problems. The main gun had been removed, and a <b>boom</b> & <b>winch</b> assembly had been fitted to the turret. No other Tiger tanks modified in this manner were ever recovered.|$|R
50|$|The anti-submarine boom net was {{demolished}} {{soon after}} World War II, {{and all that}} remains are {{the foundations of the}} old <b>boom</b> net <b>winch</b> house, which can be viewed on Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay. Today, the Australian War Memorial has on display a composite of the two midget submarines salvaged from Sydney Harbour. The conning tower of one of the midget submarines is on display at the RAN Heritage Centre, Garden Island, Sydney.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, and in {{particular}} Ontario, the donkey engine was often mounted on a barge that could float and thus winch itself over both land and water. Log <b>booms</b> would be <b>winched</b> across water with the engine and it would often be reconfigured with a saw to mill the timber.|$|R
25|$|Enterprise was the {{smallest}} J-Class to be built, her size being an early {{indication of the}} ruthless efficiency that was employed by the renowned naval architect Starling Burgess. The efficiency of design was coupled {{to a number of}} pioneering features such as the Park Avenue <b>Boom,</b> hidden lightweight <b>winches</b> and the world’s first duralumin mast.|$|R
5000|$|SAFARI TRUCK - It was a green safari {{truck that}} could sit two {{figures in the}} front. It came with a {{rhinoceros}} and a net that could either {{be used to make}} a cage in the truck bed or as a capture net to snag the rhino. The truck had a winch in the front and a <b>boom</b> for the <b>winch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The M4 Sherman's basic chassis {{was used}} for all the sundry roles of a modern {{mechanized}} force: roughly 50,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers. These included M32 and M74 [...] "tow truck"-style recovery tanks with <b>winches,</b> <b>booms,</b> and an 81 mm mortar for smoke screens; M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) artillery prime movers; M7B1, M12, M40, and M43 self-propelled artillery; and the M10 and M36 tank destroyers.|$|R
5000|$|The Mil OKB's {{response}} drew {{heavily on}} the Mi-6, utilising the dynamic components and [...] Soloviev D-25V turboshaft engines, on a slim fuselage sitting on four tall strut braced undercarriage legs, with a wide track allowing the helicopter to taxi over loads, or for mobile loads to be moved underneath. The fuselage can carry 28 passengers inside the cabin as well as 3 tonnes lb of cargo loaded through a side door in the aft fuselage, by an integral <b>boom</b> and <b>winch.</b> Underslung loads can be attached directly to the fuselage by hydraulically operated clamps, or carried on a 8.5 x 3.6 m pallet lifted by the winch and braced by cables and/or struts to the undercarriage legs. The external sling system, with a capacity of 8 tonnes lb, of the Mi-6 could also be fitted under the centre fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|Conifers {{engineering}} plant {{consisted of}} two Cooper-Bessemer straight-8 cylinder, 4-cycle diesel engines. Because of their distinctive rumble, the Coopers were {{referred to as the}} [...] "rock-crushers". Each diesel drove a Westinghouse DC generator. The DC electricity powered a single Westinghouse main-motor, which was coupled directly to the propeller shaft. The 5-bladed prop measured 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m) in diameter. The cargo <b>boom</b> and hoist <b>winches</b> were electric powered. The boat davits were hand-cranked, while the falls were fair-led to the aft towing capstan.|$|R
5000|$|The menace {{of water}} {{hyacinth}} was {{addressed by the}} Indian Army (Western Command, Vajra Corps.) in the year 2000, in a joint effort initiated by the Chief Minister of the State. Under the Pilot Project named “Sahyog” the Army adopted several innovative mechanical system of weed removal. The Army General reporting {{on the progress of}} the works stated: Through a number of innovative methods, we succeeded in making dynamic <b>booms,</b> and <b>winches</b> etc. After the operation, we have placed static and dynamic booms at strategic points in the Harike Lake to hold back the floating mats of water hyacinth so that it doesn’t spread. At the end of six months of untiring labour by our team, we had opened four channels, which had got choked with silt over the years. We also planted 750 saplings of plants of two years of age on the island for birds to nest and roost in future.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} road {{locomotives}} are {{fitted with a}} crane boom on the front. The boom pivot is mounted on the front axle assembly and a small winch is mounted on an extension to the smokebox {{in front of the}} chimney, the cable passing over a sheave {{at the top of the}} <b>boom</b> arm. The <b>winch</b> is powered by bevel gears on a shaft driven directly from the engine, with some form of clutch providing raise/lower control. These road locomotives can be used to load a trailer as well as to haul it to a new location. They are often referred to as 'crane engines'.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942 {{during the}} Second World War the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was {{constructed}} on Georges Head and {{was designed to}} prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a <b>boom</b> net <b>winch</b> house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay. On the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines attempted to enter Sydney Harbour in {{what became known as}} the Attack on Sydney Harbour. One of the Japanese midget submarines became entangled in the boom net and after unsuccessful attempts by the crew to free the submarine they detonated charges within the sub, killing themselves and destroying their sub in the process.Chowder Bay was used in the late 1820s as an anchorage for visiting American whaling ships. [...] In 1831 Archibald Mosman and John Bell were allotted grants of land in Mosman Bay to establish a whaling station. The only remaining building of the original whaling station is The Barn in Avenue Road. The Barn was a store and sail drying house. It is now the home of the 1st Mosman 1908 Scout Group.|$|R
40|$|Lifting {{operation}} on a FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel) {{is much more}} demanding for the crane and the crane driver than similar operations on a fixed offshore platform. Due to {{the motion of the}} FPSO in heavy sea and strong wind, the crane is subjected to additional dynamic forces as well as swinging loads. The present paper deals with numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the Norne offshore crane during lifting operation. The simulations are performed by FEDEM – a general nonlinear dynamic analysis program for flexible multibody systems. The pedestal, “king ” and boom are flexible links modelled by shell finite elements and connected together by different joints. The hoisting rope and the hydraulic cylinders are modelled by linear and nonlinear spring and damper elements. A control system is implemented in the model making it possible to control the movement of the <b>boom</b> and the <b>winch</b> to compensate for the relative motion between the ship and the supply vessel and keep the load in rest relative to the vessel. Examples are shown of calculated natural frequencies and mode shapes as function of hoisting rope length and boom angle. Furthermore, maximum dynamic stresses in different sections/details are presented as function of how the crane is operated. Besides giving necessary stress data for design verification against overload and fatigue, the presented model can be used to optimise the operation procedure, determine the maximum allowable load for various sea states and to calculate necessary power to control the motion of the load...|$|R
