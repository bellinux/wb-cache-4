The well-known Burgess Shale Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E

Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: [...] "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop he wants. It looks like he's really worked on his glove play, just using the glove along with his strong accurate arm. It's a very true ball that he throws over there. It's got a lot on it.

Lin gained national attention for his performance against the 12th-ranked Connecticut Huskies, against whom he scored a career-high 30 points and grabbed 9 rebounds on the road. After the game, Hall of Fame Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said of Lin: [...] "I've <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> teams come through here, and he could play for any of them.

500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E

Kenney had <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> baseball by this time, and doubted that his former pitcher's one great pitch (the [...] "outcurve", as it was called) would work as effectively against professional competition. Yet the man liked the teenaged McGraw very much, and when the boy insisted that he could play any position available, Kenney decided to give him a chance. McGraw signed his first contract to play professional baseball on April 1, 1890.|$|E
2500|$|Phillips, {{a native}} of the North Central section of Detroit, Michigan, grew up in a rough neighborhood. His father, Virgil, wanted to keep him off the streets, so he created a program called REACH (an acronym for religion, education, athletics, {{character}} and hope) where Rashad and others could go to play basketball and stay out of trouble. Later, when he was a senior at college, Phillips said, [...] "I thank God every day for giving me a father who did the things he did for me... I've <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people fall victim to the streets, but that was never an option for me. I always had a gym to go to.

I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical.

[...] "I’ve <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> launches," [...] commented Launch Director Michael D.

There are certain traditional aspects of the genre I wanted to keep and help perpetuate in Star Wars." [...] During production, he changed Luke's name from Starkiller to Skywalker and altered the title to The Star Wars and later Star Wars. He would also continue to tweak the script during filming, including adding the death of Obi-Wan after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film.|$|E

[...] In the 11th century, the Sa'ada tribe from the Bani Salim migrated to Cyrenaica; each sub tribe from the Sa'adi historically controlled a section of Cyrenaica. Benghazi and its surrounding areas were controlled by Barghathi tribe. In modern times, Benghazi has <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Libyans from {{different parts of the country}} move into the city, especially since the Kingdom era. Many came to Benghazi from Misrata. Thus Benghazi has always been seen as a welcoming city, a city which the local Bedouins refer to as 'Benghazi rabayit al thayih' which can be translated as, 'Benghazi raises the lost' as many immigrants who arrived from the Western Maghreb or the former Al Andalus came with little money, clothes or food and were looked after very generously by the local Bedouin population as well as those arriving following the Italian war from western Libya.|$|E
2500|$|The sudden {{collapse}} of ITV Digital {{had left the}} club with debts of over £2million, £700,000 of which was owed to the Inland Revenue and a further substantial amount to their bankers, Lloyds Bank.

Coupled with this, it meant first-team players such as Danny Coyne and Georges Santos {{moved on to other}} clubs.

Grimsby Town played the season using the brand [...] "Grimsby Town Sports" [...] before a lucrative three-year deal with Nike was signed in April 2004. Groves dabbled in the transfer market and brought in a batch of new signings, notably Jason Crowe and Des Hamilton, Aidan Davison and Tony Crane.

2500|$|Keaton's {{first major}} hit since 1996 came in 2003's Something's Gotta Give, {{directed}} by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 66 and 57 respectively, {{were seen as}} bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were {{too old to be}} bankable. Keaton commented about the situation in Ladies' Home Journal: [...] "Let's face it, people my age and Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> life. They {{have a great deal of}} passion and hope—why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?" [...] Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125million in North America. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Nicholson and Keaton bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for." [...] The following year, Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her role in the film.|$|E
