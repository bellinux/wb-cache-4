5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to <b>survive,</b> therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to <b>survive.</b> For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to <b>survive.</b>|$|E

Adults of Cicindela togata are unable to <b>survive</b> immersion in water, but larvae are able to <b>survive</b> a prolonged period, up to 6 days, of anoxia during floods. Anoxia tolerance in the larvae may have been sustained by switching to anaerobic metabolic pathways or by reducing metabolic rate.

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to <b>survive</b> and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could <b>survive</b> well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to <b>survive,</b> this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
