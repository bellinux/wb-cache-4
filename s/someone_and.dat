5|$|In {{the fourth}} episode, an amnesic Kay {{is accused of}} murdering defense {{attorney}} Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor Franziska von Karma. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had a burn mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, {{the head of the}} investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as the auctioneer and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then remembers being attacked by <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm I granted Charlotte and Bernhard a villa near Tiergarten in Berlin and {{transferred}} Bernhard to a regiment in the city. Charlotte {{spent much of}} her time socialising with other ladies, where it was common to pursue activities such as skating, gossiping, and holding dinner parties. She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also smoked and drank, and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She earned a reputation as a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> earning their confidence, only to spread their secrets to others.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry brought Emma & Hook to the stables, but {{he really}} {{just wanted to see}} Violet, even though he didn't tell her about his birth mother being the Dark One. Hook made Emma forget all about Rumple's manifestation with a romantic horseback riding. She needed to trust <b>someone,</b> <b>and</b> {{afterwards}} the two kiss in a field of Middlemist flowers.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} in Lyra's levels are Evasion and Deception minigames. Evasion games occur whenever Lyra is spotted by an enemy, and involves pressing buttons {{to correspond with}} icons on screen to allow Lyra escape from her pursuer. Deception games are more common. These games take place whenever Lyra {{is involved in a}} conversation with <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> is attempting to deceive them. The better the player performs in the minigame, the more successful Lyra is in her deception. The minigames include, but are not limited to, matching symbols, collecting falling icons, avoiding falling icons, a Whac-A-Mole type game and a snooker type game.|$|E
25|$|Intentional torts include, among others, certain torts {{arising from}} the {{occupation}} or use of land. The tort of nuisance, for example, involves strict liability for a neighbor who interferes with another's enjoyment of his real property. Trespass allows owners to sue for entrances by a person (or his structure, such as an overhanging building) on their land. Several intentional torts do not involve land. Examples include false imprisonment, the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining <b>someone,</b> <b>and</b> defamation (in some jurisdictions split into libel and slander), where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff's reputation.|$|E

I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
25|$|It takes just {{one-tenth of}} a second for us to judge <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> make a first impression. Research finds that the more time {{participants}} are afforded to form the impression, the more confidence in impressions they report. Not only are people quick to form first impressions, they are also fairly accurate when the target presents him or herself genuinely. People are generally not good at perceiving feigned emotions or detecting lies. Research participants who reported forming accurate impressions of specific targets did {{tend to have more}} accurate perceptions of specific targets that aligned with others' reports of the target. Individuals are also fairly reliable at understanding the first impression that he/she will project to others.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (Council of Europe) has {{published}} its report on its 2007 visit to Estonia, stating {{that many of}} the persons detained by the police in connection with the April 2007 events in Tallinn were not granted all the fundamental safeguards (the right of those concerned to inform a close relative or another third party of their choice of their situation, the right of access to a lawyer, and the right of access to a doctor) from the outset of their detention: while many of the persons concerned were allowed to contact <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> to be assisted by a lawyer only when brought before a judge, a number of detained persons claimed that their requests to see a doctor whilst in police custody had been denied, even when they displayed visible injuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{residents}} of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of strychnine poisoning. Hastings, a house guest, enlists {{the help of}} his friend Hercule Poirot, who is staying in the nearby village, Styles St. Mary. Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder. On the day she was killed, Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone, either her husband Alfred or her stepson John. Afterwards, she seemed quite distressed and, apparently, made a new will — which no one can find. She ate little at dinner and retired early to her room with her document case. The case was later forced open by <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> a document removed. Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village, so was not present when the poisoning occurred. Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp.|$|E
25|$|In {{an early}} study of U.S. 1,632 {{students}} from 79 different schools, {{boys and girls}} were surveyed {{and asked if they}} had, at some time, been asked to engage in unwelcome sexual behavior. 85% of the girls and 76% of the boys said that this had occurred. The boys and girls indicated that the behavior they experienced included pinching, grabbing, touching in a sexual manner. One fourth of the girls had been forced to kiss <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> 10% of both the girls and the boys reported having been forced against their wills to do something sexual other than kissing. Students reported that 80% of the unwelcome sexual behavior had come from other students, and 20% had come from teachers, coaches, or other adults. Out of the total of child abuse rates, slightly more than 75% were neglected, 18% were assaulted and slightly more than nine percent were sexually abused.|$|E

500|$|After {{the legal}} {{proceedings}} in the Guerra case, Feit {{was sent to}} Assumption Abbey, a Trappist monastery in Missouri. An abbot there told monk Dale Tacheny that Feit had killed <b>someone</b> <b>and</b> he asked Tacheny to counsel Feit {{for a few months}} and to determine whether Feit had the disposition to become a monk. Tacheny says that Feit confessed to hurting a young lady and murdering another one, but that it was not Tacheny's job to judge Feit at the time, so Feit's confession went unreported to authorities for many years.|$|E
500|$|I think I should {{rephrase}} {{myself from}} my previous letters when I {{was talking about}} taking a 'break'. What I meant was I am {{taking a break from}} being told what to do. ...
