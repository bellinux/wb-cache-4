5|$|The {{color of}} the smoke {{indicates}} the results to the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark <b>smoke.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
5|$|The small {{particles}} in the smoke contained hydrocarbons, which can be an irritant but have a low toxicity and were not expected to cause any long-term harm. The Met Office issued warnings that the <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the night of 11 December.|$|E
5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked for a {{cigarette}} to <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of reading a kvitel, {{it was a sign}} that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked for a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E

5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bong.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E
5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the exposure to}} cigarette smoke of infants aged 0 - 14 months. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. The area of Westfriesland, the Netherlands. Method. All parents of infants 8 days, 3, 5, 9, and 14 months old who visited the infant welfare centre in 1992 were asked to fill in a questionnaire. Results. The questionnaire was filled in by 75 % of the parents. Smoking before pregnancy was reported by 38 % of the mothers, 25 % smoked for more than 12 weeks during pregnancy. Almost 50 % of all infants were exposed to cigarette smoke at home: 31 % of the fathers, 27 % of the mothers and 21 % others smoked at home. The number of parents who smoked ≥ 16 cigarettes a day at home was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weekend than on working days. Nobody <b>smoked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bedroom of the infant, 42 % <b>smoked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living room, 21 % smoked during nursing the infant and 11 % <b>smoked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of the infant. Conclusion. Infants are often exposed to cigarette smoke at home, during nursing and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car...|$|R

5|$|Howard (Melissa Leo) quits smoking, and {{her partner}} Felton (Daniel Baldwin) fears her edginess will endanger his safety. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) also tries to quit smoking, but tries to live {{vicariously}} through his smoking partner Pembleton (Andre Braugher). Howard and Bayliss petition Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{to set up a}} non-smoking section for the squad room, but an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke. Howard, Felton, Bayliss and Pembleton find they share a common suspect in a Union Square murder, and plan a joint stakeout. Howard and Bayliss decide to ride together so Pembleton and Felton can <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car. Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting smoking. Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but smoking, prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask for a cigarette. As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{generated}} evidence that second-hand smoke causes {{the same problems}} as direct smoking, including lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lung ailments such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. Specifically, meta-analyses show that lifelong non-smokers with partners who <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home have a 20–30% greater risk of lung cancer than non-smokers who live with non-smokers. Non-smokers exposed to cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace have an increased lung cancer risk of 16–19%.|$|E

40|$|Although {{researchers}} {{and health care}} practitioners tend to use standard categories to classify smokers and nonsmokers, recent research suggests that individual smokers may {{use a variety of}} self-definitions regarding their smoking behavior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine smoking identity and smoking behavior among college students, specifically, the relationship between self-identifying as a smoker, nonsmoker, occasional smoker, or social smoker and number of days <b>smoked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past month. Data were obtained during a campuswide health assessment of randomly selected full-time students (N = 741). Results indicate discrepancy between smoking identity and cigarette use. Twenty percent of students who <b>smoked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 30 days self-identified as nonsmokers. Such discrepancies have implications for data collection in research as well as on questionnaires and in health care interviews. Failure to understand actual smoking behavior may increase the risk that individuals will not receive effective smoking prevention and cessation interventions...|$|R
