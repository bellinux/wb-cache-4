25|$|During World War II, the Dutch heroine Hannie <b>Schaft</b> {{worked for}} a Dutch {{resistance}} group; she was captured by the Germans and executed just {{before the end of}} the war in 1945. Despite her efforts and those of her colleagues and private families such as the Ten Booms, most Haarlem Jews were deported, the Haarlem Synagogue was demolished and the Jewish hospital was annexed by the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis. Several Haarlem families, whether they were politically active in the NSB or not, suffered from random attacks, as the Haarlem writer Harry Mulisch described in his book De Aanslag. Haarlemmers survived during the Hunger Winter by eating tulip bulbs stored in sheds in the sandy fields around the city.|$|E

5000|$|On November 27, 1945, <b>Schaft</b> was reburied {{in a state}} funeral. Queen Whilhelmina called <b>Schaft</b> [...] "the {{symbol of}} the Resistance." [...] However, when {{communism}} fell out of favor in the Netherlands, commemorations for <b>Schaft</b> were banned.|$|E

50|$|<b>Schaft</b> {{would remain}} dormant from then until 1994, when Imai's band Buck-Tick and Maki's band Soft Ballet toured together, giving the duo the {{opportunity}} to occasionally perform sets under the name <b>Schaft.,</b> however the urge to reform <b>Schaft</b> must {{have come to the}} duo long before their live reunion, as only a month later they released their first full album of all new material.|$|E
50|$|Andreas Jørgensen <b>Schaft</b> (1760-1826) was a Norwegian {{civil servant}} (zahlkasserer). He {{was married to}} Petronelle Nicoline Green, {{with whom he had}} the {{daughter}} Martine Elisabeth <b>Schaft</b> (1799-1843), who 8 May 1824 married the missionary Magnus Andreas Gjør (1801-1874).|$|E

50|$|The top 8 teams (<b>SCHAFT</b> through TROOPER) were {{initially}} eligible for funding. However, {{after the completion}} of the trials, Team <b>SCHAFT</b> elected to move to Track D, as a self-funded project. <b>SCHAFT</b> was acquired by Google, which also acquired autonomous vehicle technologies from teams that competed in the DARPA Grand Challenge. The move of <b>SCHAFT</b> to track D frees up DARPA funding for additional finalists. THOR, ViGIR, and KAIST, each of which earned 8 points during the trials, will now compete in the finals, with KAIST continuing as a track D self-funded team. Team THOR and Team ViGIR will split the DARPA funding, and Team THOR will further split into two teams after the move of its leader to a different university.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Schaft</b> did not, however, accept every job. For instance, {{when asked}} to kidnap the {{children}} of a Nazi official she refused. If the plan failed, the children {{would have to be}} killed, and <b>Schaft</b> felt that was too similar to the Nazi's acts of terror. When seen at the location of a particular assassination, <b>Schaft</b> was identified as [...] "the girl with the red hair." [...] Her involvement led [...] "the girl with the red hair" [...] to be placed on the Nazi's most wanted list.|$|E
