50|$|After the Hocking Valley {{system was}} {{acquired}} by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, the line was under C&O ownership. During the 1950s, the track was modernized to include CTC signals and remote dispatch capability.

50|$|Van Buskirk Island is a {{man-made}} island formed in 1802, and {{was created by}} the dams for the mills, The Southern End was known as the old Dock, Upper Landing or Old Landing and was the official head of navigation on the Hackensack River (the highest point of navigable water on the river). Schooners plied the river regularly between Old Dock and New York City. The land was also an industrial center from Pre-Revolutionary War times with several types of mills: saw mills, bark mills, a woolen mill, and finally a gristmill. After this it was used as the site for the Hackensack Water Company from 1882. The site remains historically intact from 1911, including important <b>steam</b> <b>equipment</b> from the Industrial Revolution.|$|R

40|$|Industrial boiler {{plants are}} {{an area of}} {{opportunity}} in virtually every industry to save energy and reduce costs by using relatively simple, inexpensive auditing procedures.

40|$|For maximum {{effectiveness}} in steam systems, steam traps should have operating characteristics which closely match {{the requirements of}} the applications for which they are used. A trap which holds back condensate until it is subcooled and some of the sensible heat has been utilized is unsuitable where the need is to get maximum output from an exchanger by discharging condensate as soon as it forms. Equally, a trap discharging condensate at steam temperature can exacerbate flash steam problems in cases where surplus heat exchange area exists and a subcooling trap might be more suitable. In all cases, undersized traps simply cannot drain condensate from the <b>steam</b> <b>equipment</b> at the required rate, while oversized traps which cost more will usually wear faster and begin leaking expensive steam. This emphasizes the need for carefully selecting trap sizes that are properly engineered for maximum system efficiency. And, of course, the ability of a trap to cope with varying loads and to discharge noncondensible gases is often important. The recommended procedure is to first select the trap type which has performance capabilities that satisfy specific application needs, and then to choose a size which handles the condensate load without any unnecessary excess capacity. The Selection Guide, Table 1, is not comprehensive but helps in many applications where no unusual operating conditions or severe corrosion problems exist. Choosing the correct trap size then implies estimating the steam consumption rate, which of course equals the condensate load. Sometimes the load has already been measured, or the rated output of the <b>steam</b> <b>equipment</b> is known or can be obtained from the original manufacturer. In other cases, an estimate must be made and a Table o f Load Formulas will help although it, too, cannot be comprehensive. After making the best possible estimate of the load, a safety factor is applied. This allows for any inaccuracies in the estimating, for increased condensation rates at start-up, and for lower than anticipated pressure differentials across the trap...|$|R
