Adherence was monitored via weekly diary entries with regular phone contact from researchers. This single-blinded, two armed quasi-randomized pilot study recruited adult participants diagnosed with a recent stroke (≤ 7 days). The primary outcomes were depression and cognition (memory and attention) at 3 month and the secondary outcomes were anxiety, language, disability {{and quality of life}} at 3 or 6 months. Of the 38 participants 11 had a prior history of stroke and 8 died during follow- up. There were no between-group differences in baseline characteristics and no between-group differences in any outcome over time. Adherence to the listening-to-music intervention was low (22. 2 %).

40|$|Background: Inflammatory and hemostasis-related {{biomarkers}} may identify {{women at}} risk of stroke. Methods: Hormones and Biomarkers Predicting Stroke is a study of ischemic stroke among postmenopausal women participating in the Women’s Health Initiative observational study (n 5 972 case-control pairs). A Biomarker Risk Score (BRS) was derived from levels of 7 inflammatory and hemostasis-related biomarkers that appeared individually to predict risk of ischemic stroke: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin- 6, tissue plasminogen activator, D-dimer, white blood cell count, neopterin, and homocysteine. The c index {{was used to evaluate}} discrimination. Results: Of all the individual biomarkers examined, CRP emerged as the only independent single predictor of ischemic stroke (adjusted odds ratio comparing Quartile 4 v Quartile 1 5 1. 64, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 15 - 2. 32, P 5. 01) after adjustment for other biomarkers and <b>standard</b> <b>stroke</b> risk factors.

40|$|Background: Although the {{negative}} impact of sleep apnea on the clinical course of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is well known, data regarding non-invasive ventilation in acute patients are scarce. Several studies have shown its tolerability and safety, yet no controlled randomized sequential phase studies exist that aim to establish the efficacy of early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. Methods/design: We decided to examine our hypothesis that early non-invasive ventilation with auto-titrating bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP) positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. We perform a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater- blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients with AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be randomized to <b>standard</b> <b>stroke</b> care alone or <b>standard</b> <b>stroke</b> care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated within 24 hours of stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo unattended cardiorespiratory polygraphy between days three and five to assess sleep apnea. Our primary endpoint will be any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS at 72 hours from randomization. Safety, tolerability, short-term and three-months functional outcomes will be assessed as secondary endpoints by un-blinded and blinded observers respectively. Discussion: We expect that this study will advance our understanding of how early treatment with non-invasive ventilation can counterbalance, or possibly reverse, the deleterious effects of sleep apnea in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. The study will provide preliminary data to power a subsequent phase III study...|$|E

30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} in this study. First, {{the number of}} sample cases was small, and the statistical analysis {{was not able to}} evaluate enough. Even though, we screened patients who took the only one antithrombotic agent during the study period, so that the data should not be contaminated by any other medicines. Second, this study adopted patients with antiplatelet medicines as control. Since prescribed antithrombotic agents were various depend on stroke subtype, {{it is not enough to}} compare the anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects among patients prescribed NOACs or antiplatelets.

The study design included data on 1000 patients of 45 and older with first-time acute cerebrovascular disease of ischemic type. Results. Direct medical costs for the chosen patient cohort per the <b>Standard</b> of <b>stroke</b> treatment current at the time of the study were 730 575 189 rubles, in case of naftidrofuryl inclusion they were 476 467 620 rubles.

Indirect nonmedical costs associated with temporary incapacity for work for treatment per the <b>Standard</b> of <b>stroke</b> treatment were 124 156 950 rubles, and 64 559 180 rubles for naftidrofuryl use which demonstrates the drug’s economic benefit.

METHODS: All patients {{over the age of}} 14 years with acute stroke were prospectively enrolled in Aga Khan University stroke databank from August 1999 to May 2001 (22 month period). All patients were evaluated by a consultant neurologist and underwent <b>standard</b> <b>stroke</b> work up such as neuroimaging, TTE, carotid doppler sonography and blood tests e. g. serum glucose, lipid profile, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. For the purpose of this study, patients with ischemic stroke were identified and their echocardiographic data was retrieved and analyzed.

We aimed to evaluate {{the influence of the}} sequence of PCT and CTA on quantitative perfusion parameters, venous contrast enhancement and examination time to save critical time in the therapeutic window in stroke patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS Stroke CT data sets of 85 patients, 47 patients with CTA before PCT (group A) and 38 with CTA after PCT (group B) were retrospectively analyzed by two experienced neuroradiologists. Parameter maps of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, time to peak and mean transit time and contrast enhancements (arterial and venous) were compared. RESULTS Both readers rated contrast of brain-supplying arteries to be equal in both groups (p= 0. 55 (intracranial) and p= 0. 73 (extracranial)) although the extent of venous superimposition of the ICA was rated higher in group B (p= 0. 04). Quantitative perfusion parameters did not significantly differ between the groups (all p> 0. 18), while the extent of venous superimposition of the ICA was rated higher in group B (p= 0. 04).
