25|$|There are {{two main}} reasons for the {{relationship}} between number of <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area,</b> both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species. The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of island biogeography as described by MacArthur and Wilson. Large areas have large populations, which are less likely to go extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{epidemiological study}} (n = 7, 875) of neurologically expressed disorders (NED) in ruminants before {{the onset of}} the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic (years studied, 1980 to 1997) was carried out in Belgium. The archives of all veterinary laboratories and rabies and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) epidemiosurveillance networks were consulted. For all species, a significantly higher number of NED with virological causes (rabies) was reported south of the Sambre-Meuse Valley. During the period 1992 to 1997, for which the data were complete, (i) the predicted annual incidence of NED varied significantly as a function of <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area</b> (higher numbers in areas where rabies was present) but was always above 100 cases per million, and (ii) the mean incidence of suspected TSE cases and, among them, those investigated by histopathological examination varied significantly as a function of <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area.</b> The positive predictive value of a presumptive clinical diagnosis of NED ranged from 0. 13 (game) to 0. 63 (sheep). Knowledge of the positive predictive value permits the definition of a reference point before certain actions (e. g., awareness and training campaigns) are undertaken. It also shows the usefulness of a systematic necropsy or complementary laboratory tests to establish an etiological diagnosis. TSE analysis of a small, targeted historical sampling (n = 48) permitted the confirmation of one case and uncovered another case of scrapie. The {{results of the present study}} help to develop and maintain the quality of the worldwide clinical epidemiological networks for TSE, especially in countries that in the past imported live animals, animal products, and feedstuffs from countries with TSE cases.

The general objectives of our study were fourfold: (1) to evaluate the behaviour of species–area curves across geo-graphic scales, (2) to determine sample sizes necessary to produce acceptably precise estimates of tree species diversity, (3) to evaluate relationships among estimates of tree species diversity for local to large geographic scales, and (4) to determine whether the proportion of native tree species may be precisely estimated using sample sizes smaller than those necessary to estimate total tree species diversity. Such investigations are necessary to improve biodiversity monitoring at large scales. The analytical approaches included Monte Carlo bootstrap simulation...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Presentation date: 1999 - 09 - 27 This study {{examined}} {{the question of whether}} a big island can be divided into many smaller islands with the same pattern of area-species curve as that of the complete island. To address this question, this study used data on the number and distribution of amphibians and reptiles on Puerto Rico and landbridge islands of the Puerto Rican Bank, which were fragmented from the big island about 10, 000 years ago. In Puerto Rico, the data show correlations between the number of <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area</b> available at different elevation levels and between <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area</b> after removing effects of elevation. These patterns are different from the patterns of correlation between area and the number of reptiles and amphibians on 29 islands on the Puerto Rican Bank. The area-species curves of the elevationally and areally subdivided "islands" on Puerto Rico tend to have steeper slopes than the curves of the Puerto Rican Bank islands. Analyses of area and the number of those species on fragmented habitat islands at different elevations also indicated correlation between them. However, patterns of correlation seem not to be the same at each altitude. The slope of the area-species curve seems to decrease with increasing elevation levels. Other patterns of species distribution of Puerto Rico's herpetofauna are: there are linear relationships between the number of species and elevation, the number of species and distance from the coast, and the number of species and the species range areas. Multiple regression analyses of three variables: area, precipitation, and elevation, suggested that variation of species distribution in Puerto Rico is partly caused by interactions among these variables. Elevation plays an especially important role in explaining reptile and amphibian distribution. The rainfall variable had the least effect on determining herpetofauna diversity. The study results suggest that area-species correlation is a consequence of habitat heterogeneity on the island...|$|E

40|$|Species-area curves (SACs) are {{generally}} described as power laws. As power laws, SACs imply fractality in {{the relation between}} the number of <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area.</b> In nature, however, the power-law form of SACs is generally observed only within a certain range of areas, not at all spatial scales. Full-scale nested SACs, from the smallest (a few individuals) to largest (regional) scales, may be best fitted by a logistic function. This is because large-scale and small-scale species richness {{are generally}} not under similar controls and, consequently, the shape of the SAC changes with scale. At the smallest scales, the form of the SAC is shaped by the autocorrelation structure of environmental conditions among neighboring sites. At the opposite end, the scaling behavior of SACs is controlled by the richness of the regional species pool. Therefore, a unifying scaling theory that bridges the gap between small-scale and large-scale species-area relationships is desirable. In this paper, I suggest that, logistic SACs can be considered ‘asymptotic fractals’ that are characterized by a scaling exponent continuously changing with scale...|$|E
40|$|MacArthur and Wilson's (1967) {{model for}} island {{biogeography}} is examined, {{particularly with regard}} to the proposed species-area relationship. The first chapter includes a consideration of the theoretical background. Nine habitat islands and corresponding mainland regions of similar area were selected. All the sites possess a canopy of mountain beech trees, (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides), and are located in the western segment of Tongariro National Park. Plants and litter animals were sampled from within these sites to determine the possible relationship between <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area.</b> Forest plant species numbers as well as proportions, assessed using a modification of the Point-centred quarter method, revealed a statistically significant species-area relationship. Litter Crustacea collected in one thousandth of a square metre core samples, and removed from cores by wet extraction, show a gradation in habitat preference, hence a species-area relationship cannot be determined. A wide range of animals collected in pitfall traps appear also not to produce a significant species-area relationship. Possible reasons for the obscurity of such a relationship are considered. An overall assessment of the information gathered in the light of island biogeographic theory is presented, and some more recent thought on the causal explanations for the species-area relationship are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} of nematode data from field experiments {{depends largely on}} how well samples represent the nematode population. Data from an intensive sampling of three field plots before and after spring cultivation were used to compare eight simulated sampling schemes. Average deviation from the plot mean ranged from 10 % to 34 % before cultivation and from 7 % to 16 % after cultivation. Samples taken from only the plant row erred most before cultivation but were comparable to other schemes after cultivation. Several schemes achieved a 25 % deviation or less in 90 % of the sample simulations. Sampling a nematode population usually involves subsampling a composite bulk sample, however, and this increases error by an estimable amount. A random sample with 35 cores and four random subsamples estimated mean plot densities within 25 % with probabilities ranging from 0. 77 to 0. 85. The probability of a sample-subsample combination coming within a specified percent error of the true mean can be extended cautiously to any field mean and variance more-or-less independent of <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area</b> using formulae presented herein.

40|$|For {{planning}} practical measures {{aimed at}} biodiversity protection, conservation priorities must be identified {{at a local}} scale. Unfortunately, identifying local conservation priorities requires high-resolution data on <b>species</b> distribution, <b>and</b> these are often unavailable. Atlases of species distribution provide data for several groups of organisms in many different areas but are often too coarse in resolution to provide valuable information. We explored the possibility of cross-scale modelling <b>species</b> distributions <b>and</b> we clarified, for the first time, its effect on prioritization exercises. We used different modelling techniques for scaling down atlas data for Sardinian reptiles, validated the outcomes with detailed, field-sampled data, and compared conservation priorities deriving from atlas maps and downscaled models. Doing this, we obtained as a further result the identification of priority <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>areas</b> for future conservation strategies. Our results encourage us to experiment further with this approach. Through the downscaling procedure, we obtain high-resolution models with strong variations in predictive performances, {{although most of the}} models show satisfactory/excellent scores. This testifies that low-resolution data can be downscaled maintaining low rates of omission and commission errors. Increasing the resolution of distribution maps used for prioritization influences the spatial patterns of priority but does not modify the evaluation of species representation. Overall, we show that atlases can meet the large demand for distribution data by decision makers if appropriate downscaling procedures are adopted. In addition, we provide practical instruments for the conservation of reptiles in Sardinia by identifying priority <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>areas</b> that require strict management...|$|R
40|$|Species richness, the {{location}} of exotic species and heterogeneity (investigated via dissimilarity and via species-area relations) were investigated in relation to spatial scale, in an ecotone between Nothofagus forest and sub-alpine shrubland. The rate of change in ordination score as well as tree diameter and the dripline were used to locate {{the position of the}} ecotone. Patterns of species richness were largely scale-independent, with species richness lowest in the forest community, intermediate in the ecotone, highest a short distance into the shrubland, and lower again in the shrubland further from the ecotone. High richness just into the shrubland is attributed to the existence of a fine-scale spatial mosaic pattern of vegetation, though the spatial mass effect may have a role. Exotic species were absent in the forest, but occurred sparsely in the ecotone and in the shrubland, possibly with decreasing frequency away from the ecotone. Community pattern, expressed by species-based dissimilarity and species-area curves, also differed. The ecotone community was the most heterogeneous (indicated by higher dissimilarity values and a steeper species-area slope with higher Arrhenius z-values), with the forest the least heterogeneous and the shrubland intermediate. We conclude that z-values are inter-woven with both habitat and spatial scale, and that this argues against a universal relationship between <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>area...</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{tropical}} {{pelagic species}} are attracted by floating {{objects in the}} surface of the ocean, industrial purse seiners deploy thousands of man-made drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs) to facilitate their catch of tunas. However, the sharp increase in the use of DFADs leads to some ecological concerns, such as producing higher amount of by-catch or alteration of natural behaviour of fish. We used fishers ' satellite-linked GPS buoys equipped with echo-sounders to continuously collect acoustic samples under remote DFADs and investigate the diel behaviour patterns of the associated fish (i. e., non-tuna species and small and large tunas) and their potential biological interactions. Results showed a strong correlation between the presence of non-tuna species and small tunas, and between small and large tunas. Diel biomass dynamics were highly variable and seem to be both species and regionspecific, which may suggest adaptive behaviour patterns. Tuna associated with DFADs in the Somalia area showed a clear night-time associative behaviour. In contrast, tuna in the NW Seychelles associated with DFADs to a greater degree during daytime. In the Mozambique Channel, large tuna showed daytime associative behaviour, while small tuna showed a maximum biomassat sunrise, decreasing over the day. The associative behaviour of non-tuna species was slightly variable, being uniform near the equator or showing two peaks when increasing latitude. This study shows the importance and effect of biological factors on the associative behaviour of the fish and serves as a first step towards improving pre-set selectivity of purse seine fisheries using DFADs.

40|$|Self-similar {{distributions}} of species across a landscape {{have been proposed}} as one potential cause of the well-known species-area relationship. The best known of these proposals {{is in the form}} of a probability rule for species occurrence. The application of this rule to the number of species occurring in primary wellshaped rectangles within the landscape gives rise to a discrete power law for species-area relationships. However, this result requires a specific scheme for bisecting the landscape to generate the rectangles. Some additional, more general consequences of the probability rule are presented here. These include the result that the number of species in a well-shaped rectangle depends on its location, not just on its area. In addition, a self-similar landscape contains well-shaped rectangles that are, in fact, not self-similar. The probability rule in general produces testable predictions about how and where species are distributed that are independent of the power law. Subject headings: species-area relationship, self-similarity, probability rules, power laws, scaling, mathematics.
