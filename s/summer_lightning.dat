2500|$|In {{his novel}} <b>Summer</b> <b>Lightning,</b> first {{published}} in 1929, P. G. Wodehouse invented a dissolute past for the character Galahad Threepwood, {{in the course of}} which Brooks is mentioned. In his younger days Galahad had been [...] "a brother-in-arms of the Shifter, the Pitcher, Peter Blobbs and the rest of an interesting but not strait-laced circle".|$|E

6000|$|A flash {{passed over}} the Spaniard's face, which {{disclosed}} terrible depths of fury and hatred beneath that quiet mask, as the <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> displays the black abysses of the thunder-storm; but like the <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> it passed almost unseen; and blandly as ever, he answered: ...|$|E

60|$|There {{was half}} an hour of merry talk, graceful and gay: a good story, a bon-mot fresh from the mint, some raillery like <b>summer</b> <b>lightning,</b> vivid but not scorching.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} deadly soft and still, a slight mist hid the furthest verges of the sea's horizon. Behind it, the <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> seemed like portals that opened and shut in the heavens, {{revealing}} a glory without form, and closing again.|$|E
60|$|She {{smiled in}} her vivid way--only twice or thrice did I see her smile thus {{and then it}} was like a flash of <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> illumining a clouded sky, since for the most part her face was grave and even sombre.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation {{throughout}} the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, {{mainly because of the}} intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in <b>summer,</b> when <b>lightning</b> is also much more frequent).|$|R
60|$|As I gushed {{into the}} sea, a thunder-boom sounded in my ear; my soul seemed flying from my mouth. The feeling of death flooded over {{me with the}} billows. The blow from the sea must have turned me, so that I sank almost feet {{foremost}} through a soft, seething foamy lull. Some current seemed hurrying me away; in a trance I yielded, and sank deeper down with a glide. Purple and pathless was the deep calm now around me, flecked by <b>summer</b> <b>lightnings</b> in an azure afar. The horrible nausea was gone; the bloody, blind film turned a pale green; I wondered whether I was yet dead, or still dying. But of a sudden some fashionless form brushed my side--some inert, coiled fish of the sea; the thrill of being alive again tingled in my nerves, and the strong shunning of death shocked me through.|$|R
2500|$|The {{climate of}} St. Paul is Arctic maritime. The Bering Sea {{location}} results in cool weather year-round and {{a narrow range}} of mean temperatures varying from 19 to 51 degrees Fahrenheit. Average precipitation is 25inches, with snowfall of 56inches. Heavy fog is common during <b>summer</b> months. <b>Lightning</b> and thunder are virtually unheard of. [...] The last time a thunderstorm occurred in St. Paul was on November 8, 1982, {{which was the first}} thunderstorm in 40 years.|$|R
60|$|A {{few seconds}} after midnight {{the crowd in}} the Chertsey road, Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent {{brightness}} like <b>summer</b> <b>lightning.</b> This was the second cylinder.|$|E
6000|$|The {{noise of}} their meeting shields {{came to our}} ears {{like that of the}} roll of thunder, and the sheen of their stabbing-spears shone as shines the broad <b>summer</b> <b>lightning.</b> They hung and wavered on the slope; then from the Amawombe ranks rose a roar of ...|$|E
60|$|Some few {{believe that}} this inestimable stone is blazing as of old, and {{say that they have}} caught its radiance, like a flash of <b>summer</b> <b>lightning,</b> far down the valley of the Saco. And be it owned that many a mile from the Crystal Hills I saw a wondrous light around their summits, and was lured by the faith of poesy to be the latest pilgrim of the Great Carbuncle.|$|E
50|$|Precipitation {{throughout}} the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, {{mainly because of the}} intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in <b>summer,</b> when <b>lightning</b> is also much more frequent).The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.|$|R
5000|$|Hiking {{requires}} approximately 4160 ft in {{elevation gain}} and ~12.6 miles distance round-trip. [...] Those attempting to {{hike to the}} summit of Apache Peak should bring at bare minimum 3 liters of water, especially in the summer months. The humidity in winter is very low (<15%) so bring more water than you expect even when the temperatures are not high. In winter snow storms are common. In <b>summer</b> fierce <b>lightning</b> storms and flash floods hit the peaks so do not hike in summer when thunderstorms are present.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>summer</b> of 1935, <b>lightning</b> {{struck the}} steeple {{of the school}} and fire {{destroyed}} the building. Classes were held temporarily in the old Baptist and Methodist churches while a new building could be constructed. Until 1938, the school included only grades 1 through 11. 12th grade was added in 1954.|$|R
60|$|Then she boldly {{entered the}} inner precincts; being privileged, {{she could do}} even that, without {{creating}} attention. Milor's words of contempt, the royal arms of England on the seal of the letter, coupled with her father's attitude with her just now, and his veiled suggestions, told her all she wanted to know. And quick as flashes of <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> her woman's intuition whispered words of wisdom in her ear.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was the}} {{magnetism}} that {{emanated from}} him {{that could not be}} denied; the light that now and then, swift as <b>summer</b> <b>lightning,</b> flashed out from the depths of the blue eyes usually veiled by heavy, lazy lids, the sudden tightening of firm lips, the setting of the square jaw, which in a moment--but only for the space of a second--transformed the entire face, and revealed the born leader of men.|$|E
60|$|Far {{out to the}} {{northeast}} there came the flicker of a squadron of warships waving white swords of light about the sky. I kept them hull-down, and presently they were mere <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> over the watery edge of the globe.... I fell into thought that was nearly formless, into doubts and dreams that have no words, and it seemed good to me to drive ahead and on and or through the windy starlight, over the long black waves.|$|E
50|$|The beithir was {{considered}} one of the Fuath. They were said to be sighted on <b>summer</b> nights when <b>lightning</b> strikes occurred. It was written by John Gregorson Campbell that if a snake is killed then its head must be removed and disposed away from the body. Otherwise, the two parts will come together and the snake will come back alive as a beithir.|$|R
50|$|The {{climate of}} the {{wilderness}} is Mediterranean, although {{the distance from the}} coast allows for cooler winters and hotter summers than are found in the coastal strip. Snow is common on the higher peaks in the winter, although it rarely lingers except on north-facing slopes. Rain is extremely rare in the <b>summer,</b> and dry <b>lightning</b> from the occasional thunderstorms can start fires.|$|R
50|$|In the Junior School, Westbourne {{participate}} in the Coeducational Independent Primary Schools Sports Association (CIPPSA), with weekly sport matches. All teams also {{have the opportunity to}} {{participate in}} the <b>Summer</b> and Winter <b>Lightning</b> Premierships. They also compete in the SYDSA (South Yarra District Schools Association) where they compete against other schools in carnivals such as Swimming, Athletics and Cross Country and can progress to the Beachside Division and onto Regionals and State level.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a bright}} moon, but it was behind the clouds. It was a fine dry night, but it was most uncommonly dark. Paths, hedges, fields, houses, and trees, were enveloped in one deep shade. The {{atmosphere}} was hot and sultry, the <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> quivered faintly {{on the verge of}} the horizon, and was the only sight that varied the dull gloom in which everything was wrapped--sound there was none, except the distant barking of some restless house-dog.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a strange}} and sudden aching there. Was he going from her? If so, what would be left? How little and how narrow seemed the outlook of her life--with the world waiting for her, the world of beauty, effort, self-sacrifice, fidelity! It was as though a flash of that <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> had fled by, {{singeing}} her, taking from her all powers of flight, burning off her wings, as off one of those pale hovering moths. Tears started up, and trickled down her face. 'Blind!' she thought; 'how could I have been so blind?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Upon {{the morning}} of the 26th of August the French {{batteries}} opened fire, and from Guarda the dull, heavy roar of artillery could be heard all day. As darkness fell, the officers of the Rangers were, as usual, assembling round their fire, when the earth seemed to shake beneath their feet, and a flash like that of <b>summer</b> <b>lightning</b> lit the eastern sky. [...] "What can that be?" [...] was the general exclamation. A minute later, and a deep, heavy, prolonged roar sounded in their ears--then all was quiet.|$|E
50|$|Those {{attempting}} to {{hike to the}} summit of Miller Peak should bring at bare minimum 3 liters of water, especially in the summer months. The humidity in winter is very low (<15%) so bring more water than you expect even when the temperatures are not high. In winter snow storms are common. In <b>summer</b> fierce <b>lightning</b> storms and flash floods hit the peaks so do not hike in summer when thunderstorms are present. Hikers should also be aware the area is frequented by illegal immigrants and drug runners crossing over from Mexico, {{just a few miles}} away. Always be aware of your surroundings. Although traffic has decreased in recent years, trash from recent illegal travelers is easily evident. You will also occasionally cross paths with Border Patrol agents as they also hike the area on patrol.|$|R
6000|$|Why do I {{love to see}} a flabby-faced man {{go behind}} curtains, and, {{emerging}} in a wig and a false beard, {{say that he is}} now Bismarck or Mr. Chamberlain? I have felt resentment against the Lightning Impersonator ever since the days of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. During that <b>summer</b> every <b>Lightning</b> Impersonator ended his show by shouting, while the band played the National Anthem, [...] "Queen Victoria!" [...] He was not a bit like Queen Victoria. He did not even, to my thinking, look a lady; but at once I had to stand up in my place and sing [...] "God save the Queen." [...] It was a time of enthusiastic loyalty; if you did not spring up quickly some patriotic old fool from the back would reach across and hit you over the head with the first thing he could lay his hands upon.|$|R
40|$|The European {{lightning}} detection network LINET, {{which has}} been operated and expanded since May 2006, can very accurately detect lightning activity over most parts of Europe. To test the location accuracy we investigated lightning strikes into elevated structures like radio or TV towers, masts or high-rise buildings. Locations {{of more than one}} hundred structures were determined and occurrence of lightning strikes at or close to these positions were analyzed for a period of three years. During <b>summer</b> thunderstorms <b>lightning</b> strikes were distributed more uniformly, but during the winter month single "hot spots" around the selected objects were detectable. The position of registered strokes relating to the location of the objects were analyzed for the time period from October to March. At some sites a systematic location offset was found, probably caused by inhomogeneous propagation conditions, requiring certain network corrections. The mean distance before and after correction have been calculated for each structure...|$|R
