The programme written from this simulation model and modified so {{can be used to}} assist in the design of a spark ignition engine for alternative fuels as well as to study many design parameters such as the effect of engine design parameter like stroke and diameter of the cylinder on the performance and exhaust emissions of spark ignition engines. In this paper, the description of three type of engines design parameters according to (stroke/diameter) which are called under square, square and over <b>square</b> <b>engines</b> using three type of fuel (gasoline, LPG, CNG) singly have been taken. The variations of power output, thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, ignition delay, temperature of exhaust gases, heat loss and the exhaust emissions (CO 2, CO, NO, O 2) by volume, were calculated for each type of engine and then comparing the results to investigate how to increase engine efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions. The accuracy of the present model is confirmed by comparison with experimental result that have established by previous literatures and the results were agreement with literatures. The main results obtained from the present study shows that, the <b>square</b> <b>engines</b> (S/D= 1) can be considered as most efficient, modern and suitable design for engines running by gasoline and alternative fuels like LPG and CNG, because of higher power output due to the suitable piston area for pressure distribution.

50|$|European practice, {{particularly}} on the Clyde, favoured Napier's steeple engine instead of the <b>square</b> <b>engine.</b> These were more complicated to construct and used more ironwork, but they placed the cylinder beneath the crankshaft and so were more stable in a narrow hull.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} large eddy simulation (LES) {{and experimental}} studies of the combustion process of ethanol/air mixture in an experimental optical HCCI engine. The fuel is injected to the intake port manifolds to generate uniform fuel/air mixture in the cylinder. Two different piston shapes, one with a flat disc and one with a square bowl, were employed to generate different in-cylinder turbulence and temperature field prior to autoignition. The {{aim of this study}} was to scrutinize the effect of in-cylinder turbulence on the temperature field and on the combustion process. The fuel tracer, acetone, is measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to characterize the reaction fronts, and chemiluminescence images were recorded using a high-speed camera, with a 0. 25 crank angle degree resolution, to further illustrate the combustion process. Pressure in the cylinder is recorded in the experiments. Spatial and temporal resolved LES was used to gain information on the turbulence mixing, heat transfer and combustion process. It was shown that gas temperature in the piston bowl is generally higher than that in the squish, leading to an earlier ignition in the bowl. Compared to the disc <b>engine,</b> the <b>square</b> bowl <b>engine</b> has a higher temperature inhomogeneity owing to the turbulence wall heat transfer. The experimentally observed higher combustion duration and slower pressure rise rate in the <b>square</b> bowl <b>engine</b> as compared to the disc engine can be explained by the higher temperature inhomogeneity in the <b>square</b> bowl <b>engine...</b>|$|R

25|$|Because the {{cylinder}} was placed above the crankshaft {{in this type}} of engine, it had a high center of gravity and was therefore deemed unsuitable for oceangoing service, so that its use was largely confined to vessels plying inland waterways.

50|$|The {{different}} layout {{was primarily}} chosen {{to reduce the}} impact of the inertial torsion inherent with crank throws spaced 90° apart due to the pistons being accelerated (start-stop motion), given this engine was meant to be high revving and inertial forces scale as to the <b>square</b> of <b>engine</b> speed. The reduction in torsion was achieved by splitting the crank into two separate parts, geared together, from their respective midpoints, via a counter-shaft, from which power was delivered to the gearbox.|$|R

This rare engine produced 200 hp (149 kW) and 280 ft•lbf (380 N•m) and, although export (to the UK) versions were planned, the closure by British Leyland of their Australian operations in 1975 precluded the widespread application of this engine.British Leyland did import one complete P76 engine for assessment {{but it was never}} fitted to a vehicle and was sold off on the demise of the company.|$|E
5000|$|Undersquare {{engines are}} {{typically}} tuned to exhibit peak torque at lower RPM than an oversquare engine {{due to their}} longer crank throw and high piston speed at high RPM. While the surface area of the cylinder in an undersquare engine may be {{higher than that of}} a <b>square</b> <b>engine</b> cylinder, heat exchange through the cylinder wall is lessened compared to heat exchange through the cylinder head and piston since the cylinder wall is not in constant contact with the expanding gasses. Since each unit of area of cylinder wall permits less heat loss to the engine than through the cylinder head or piston, undersquare engines generally exhibit improved thermal efficiency compared to oversquare engines. For these reasons, diesel truck engines which require low RPM torque and high thermal efficiency more than high power density most commonly adopt an undersquare engine geometry.|$|E
