25|$|Yamuna is {{described}} {{as the daughter of}} the sun god Surya (though some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the daughter of Brahma) and his wife Saranyu (Sanjna in later literature), the goddess of the clouds, and the twin sister of Yama, the god of death. Her other brothers include Vaivasvata Manu, the first man and the twin Ashvins, divine doctors. She {{is described}} as Surya's favourite child. As the daughter of Surya, she is also called as Suryatanaya, Suryaja and Ravinandini.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of John Hunyadi's mother {{is even less}} certain. In connection with King Sigismund's supposed parentage, both Bonfini and Heltai <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{the daughter of a}} rich boyar, or nobleman, whose estates were located at Morzsina (present-day Margina, Romania). Pop proposes that she was called Elisabeth. According to historian László Makkai, John Hunyadi's mother {{was a member of the}} Muzsina (or Mușina) kenez family from Demsus (Densuș, Romania), but Pop refuses the {{identification of}} the Morzsina and Muzsina families.|$|E
25|$|Both Theophilus and Susannah Maria {{were members}} of the Drury Lane theatre company managed by Cibber. From 1735, Cibber began drawing his wife's {{earnings}} from the theatre personally, ignoring the marriage settlement, and by 1737 he was even selling her clothes and personal effects to make money. In 1738, the couple were involved in a notorious lawsuit which drew public attention to Cibber's connivance in his wife's adultery. The Cibbers had established a ménage à trois with John Sloper, a country squire, from whom Theophilus accepted money. The three of them set up house together in Kensington, for which Sloper paid the rent and maintenance, until Cibber slipped away to France to escape his creditors. To his dismay, Susannah Maria wrote him a letter to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> leaving him for Sloper.|$|E

Brigitte then holds out her hand and presses a cut on it against a cut on Ginger's hand - {{mingling}} their blood and infecting Brigitte.|$|R
500|$|In Hindu mythology, Ahalya ( [...] , IAST: Ahalyā) {{also known}} as [...] Ahilya, is {{the wife of the}} sage Gautama Maharishi.

500|$|Legends {{incorrectly}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> Jelena Obilić, a {{widow of}} Miloš Obilić. One of the legends about Jelena {{was recorded in}} Herzegovina. According to that legend Sandalj asked Jelena who was her favorite husband. Her reply was that she would give away both Sandalj and Balšić just to see Miloš Obilić one more time. Sandalj was angered and Jelena had {{to run away from}} him. While she was on the way to Zeta, in some nettle, she gave birth to a boy who was a founder of Koprivica family (kopriva, [...] "nettle").|$|E
500|$|Shelley {{frequently}} laments {{the poor}} education on offer to Italians, although she hopes this will spur them to revolt. She {{does not think}} much of the Germans. In her earlier travels, she had described the Germans as rude and disgusting; in 1842, she wrote to her half-sister Claire Clairmont, [...] "I do dislike the Germans—& never wish to visit Germany again—but I would not put this in print—for the surface is all I know." [...] Rambles contains little commentary on the Germans, therefore, except to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> impressed by their public education system.|$|E

500|$|Hathaway, by contrast, {{actively}} {{sought the}} part, tracing [...] "Hire me" [...] {{in the sand}} of the zen garden on Hacken's desk when she talked about the project with the executive. While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to audition, {{she knew she was}} not the studio's first choice and had to be patient (other accounts <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the only actress considered for the lead). Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies. She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects. She celebrated when she learned she had gotten the part.|$|E
500|$|Kaganovich (...) was a Project 26bis2 [...] of the Soviet Navy {{that was}} built during World War II. She was built in Siberia from {{components}} shipped from European Russia. She saw no action {{during the war and}} served into the Cold War. She was renamed Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to distinguish her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. Her post-war career was generally uneventful, although her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon in 1957. She was renamed Petropavlovsk (...) in 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> converted into a floating barracks in 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that she was simply sold for scrap in 1960.|$|E
500|$|The Arabian {{milestones}} {{presented the}} Palmyrene king as a Roman governor and commander, referring {{to him as}} vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux Romanorum. The assumption of such titles was probably meant to legitimize Zenobia's control of the province, not yet a usurpation of the imperial title. Until now, Zenobia could <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> acting {{as a representative of}} the emperor (who was securing the eastern lands of the empire) while the Roman monarch was preoccupied with struggles in Europe. Although Vaballathus' use of the titles amounted to a claim to the imperial throne, Zenobia could still justify them and maintain a mask of subordination to Rome; an [...] "imperator" [...] was a commander of troops, not the equal of an emperor ("imperator caesar").|$|E

500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to listen to what they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|She {{returned}} to the Mediterranean in September 1901 and remained there until the Russo-Japanese War when she {{was transferred to the}} Baltic to be refitted in late 1904 to serve as the flagship of the Third Pacific Squadron under Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov. The squadron departed Liepāja on 15 January 1905 for the Pacific. She was slightly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima, receiving one hit from a twelve-inch gun, two from eight-inch guns and two from six-inch guns, and suffered only 5 killed and 35 men wounded. She was surrendered, along with most of the Third Pacific Squadron, by Admiral Nebogatov the following day. On 6 June 1905, she was taken into the Imperial Japanese Navy and renamed Iki, after Iki Island in the Sea of Japan, near site of the Battle of Tsushima. She served as a gunnery training ship until 12 December 1910 when she was redesignated as a first-class coast defense ship and a training vessel. [...] As the Iki she was armed with her original 12-inch/30 caliber guns in a forward twin turret, six 6-inch/40 caliber Armstrong Pattern Z guns in single mounts, six 4.7-inch/40 caliber Armstrong Pattern T guns in single mounts, six 3-inch/40 caliber Armstrong N guns in single mounts and six 18-inch torpedoes. [...] She was stricken 1 May 1915 and sunk as a target by the battlecruisers [...] and , although Watts and Gordon <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> scrapped in 1922.|$|E

2500|$|Kennedy's role split many Buffy fans {{into two}} groups. Many viewers hated Kennedy, {{because they saw}} her {{as a way of}} saying; [...] "Tara's dead, let's move on."

After the {{emotional}} death of Tara and Willow's reaction (nearly ending all life on Earth) many fans thought that it was ridiculous for Willow to recover and move on so quickly. Kennedy overall, has received much hate, but there is the other side who <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> exactly what Willow needed to recover and continue a happy life.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a severe}} famine {{in the land}} of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, {{traveled}} to Egypt.

When they entered Egypt, the Pharaoh's officials praised Sarai's beauty to Pharaoh, and they took her into the palace and gave Abram goods in exchange.
