40|$|BACKGROUND. In recent years, {{increasing}} {{attention has}} been paid to improving car frontal design in order to minimise pedestrian injury. Many tests have been carried out using a free-flight instrumented headform projected against the car exterior. For pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, the bonnet should act as a cushion in an <b>impact.</b> AIMS <b>OF</b> THIS PAPER. General principles of bonnet design are stated. Particular attention is given to the issue of stiffness, and new implications are drawn. FINDINGS. Regarding bonnet stiffness, there is an optimum: too stiff, and the bonnet is injurious; not stiff enough, and the pedestrianâ€™s head may bottom out, i. e., strike the very stiff structures in the engine compartment. In addition, the optimum bonnet stiffness will be different for different <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact.</b> CONCLUSIONS. There is a need for results covering the range <b>of</b> <b>speeds</b> at which serious pedestrian injuries occur. Theory does permit scaling of HIC (Head Injury Criterion) to different speeds, however, so not all speeds will need to be tested. Similar considerations apply to headform mass. T. P. Hutchinson, D.

5000|$|A kinetic {{projectile}} {{can also}} be dropped from aircraft. This is applied by replacing the explosives of a regular bomb with a non-explosive material (e.g. concrete), for a precision hit with less collateral damage. A typical bomb has a mass of 900 kg and a <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> of 800 km/h (220 m/s). It is also applied for training the act of dropping a bomb with explosives. http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1999/10/991007-iraq.htm This method {{has been used in}} Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent military operations in Iraq by mating concrete-filled training bombs with JDAM GPS guidance kits, to attack vehicles and other relatively [...] "soft" [...] targets located too close to civilian structures for the use of conventional high explosive bombs.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{an ideal}} helmet liner is stiff enough to {{decelerate}} the impacting head {{to an abrupt}} stop in a smooth uniform manner just before it completely crushes the liner and no stiffer. The required stiffness depends on the impact speed of the head, which is unknown {{at the time of}} manufacture of the helmet. The result is that the manufacturer must choose a likely <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> and optimize the helmet for that impact speed. If the helmet is in a real impact that is slower than the one for which it was designed, it will still help but the head will be decelerated a little more violently than was actually necessary given the available space between the inside and outside of the helmet, although that deceleration will still be much less than what it {{would have been in the}} absence of the helmet. If the impact is faster than the one the helmet was designed for, the head will completely crush the liner and slow down but not stop in the process. When the crush space of the liner runs out, the head will stop suddenly which is not ideal. However, in the absence of the helmet, the head would have been brought to a sudden stop from a higher speed causing more injury. Still, a helmet with a stiffer foam that stopped the head before the liner crush space ran out would have done a better job. So helmets help most in impacts at the speeds they were designed for, and continue to help but not as much in impacts that are at different speeds. In practice, motorcycle helmet manufacturers choose the impact speed they will design for based on the speed used in standard helmet tests. Most standard helmet tests use speeds between 4 and 7 m/s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{object that}} {{excavated}} the crater was a nickel-iron meteorite about [...] across. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> {{has been a}} subject of some debate. Modeling initially suggested that the meteorite struck at up to 20kilometers per second (12miles per second) but more recent research suggests the impact was substantially slower, at 12.8 kilometers per second (8.0miles per second). It is believed {{that about half of}} the impactor's bulk was vaporized during its descent. Impact energy has been estimated at about 10 megatons. The meteorite was mostly vaporized upon impact, leaving few remains in the crater.|$|R
50|$|The {{criterion}} of 200 km/h is selected for several reasons; above this <b>speed,</b> the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> geometric defects are intensified, track adhesion is decreased, aerodynamic resistance is greatly increased, pressure fluctuations within tunnels cause passenger discomfort, {{and it becomes}} difficult for drivers to identify trackside signalling.|$|R

30|$|When {{a missile}} hits a fabric, a {{reflective}} force is implied to the missile which reduces its speed {{and at times}} fabric is deformed and strain waves are transferred to fabric edges through the yarns. Kinetic energy of missile is dissipated by strain energy of yarns in places where slipping friction exists. Thus, missile energy dissipation is influenced by factors such as; fiber type, fabric structure, missile geometry, <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact,</b> friction between missile and fabric and friction of yarns and fibers in the fabric. Determining a quantitative value for yarn strain energy, kinetic energy and energy dissipation in places with friction is very difficult {{and in some cases}} impossible (Duana et al. 2006 a).|$|E
40|$|Much of {{the recent}} decline in road traffic {{injuries}} and fatalities in developed nations is attributed to government regulations and institutional crash test ratings. While the regulations provide minimum performance or equipment requirements, crash tests provide a standardized method for crashworthiness comparisons between vehicles, and they do so using prescribed crash scenarios that aim to represent real-world crashes. Because {{the results of these}} tests influence consumer demand for vehicles, automakers commonly optimize vehicle designs to perform well in these specific crash scenarios. This study explores the impact of three particular specifications of the NHTSA NCAP frontal crash test on optimal automobile design, including the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact,</b> the injury severity measured, and the ratings system used to present the results.

40|$|Penetrating {{traumatic}} brain injury (pTBI) {{has been difficult to}} model in small laboratory animals, such as rats or mice. Previously, we have established a non-fatal, rat model for penetrating brain injury using a modified air-rifle that accelerates a pellet, which hits a small probe that then penetrates the experimental animalâ€™s brain. Knockout and transgenic strains of mice offer attractive tools to study biological reactions induced by TBI. Hence, in the present study, we adapted and modified our model to be used with mice. The technical characterization of the impact device included depth and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact,</b> as well as dimensions of the temporary cavity formed in a brain surrogate material after impact. Biologically, we have focused on three distinct levels of severity (mild, moderate, and severe), and characterized the acute phase response to injury in terms of tissue destruction, neural degeneration, and gliosis. Functional outcome was assessed by measuring bodyweight and motor performance on rotarod. The results showed that this model is capable of reproducing major morphological and neurological changes of pTBI; as such, we recommend its utilization in research studies aiming to unravel the biological events underlying injury and regeneration after pTBI...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Tennis serve is a closed-skill motion {{influenced}} by the kinematic chain concept. An important role on the final performance is surely linked to the knee joint motion, although only few studies addressed lower-limb influence. In this work we propose a study about the proprioceptive angle size of knee joint in the first flat serve produced by tennis players of different performance levels. Twelve subjects involved in the study are divided in three groups using the ITN classification code: beginner, intermediate and advanced players. A simple biomechanical model of lower limb was proposed to study the knee joint motion. Three flat serves were recorded using three synchronized cams. A specific algorithm was developed to obtain the maximum flexion value of front knee using coordinates of lower-limb joints. <b>Speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> (SB) and height of impact (HB) were also evaluated to compare results with previous works and to assess the tennis playersâ€™ performance.

40|$|OBJECTIVESâ€”To {{determine}} whether the presence and severity of post-traumatic vomiting can predict {{the risk of a}} skull vault fracture in adults and children. â€¨METHODSâ€”Data were analysed relating to a consecutive series of 5416 patients including children who presented to an emergency service in the United Kingdom during a 1 year study period with a principal diagnosis of head injury. Characteristics studied were age, sex, <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact,</b> level of consciousness on arrival, incidence of skull fracture, and the presence and severity of post-traumatic vomiting. â€¨RESULTSâ€”The overall incidence of post-traumatic vomiting was 7 % in adults and 12 % in children. In patients with a skull fracture the incidence of post-traumatic vomiting was 28 % in adults and 33 % in children. Post-traumatic vomiting was associated with a fourfold increase in the relative risk for a skull fracture. Nausea alone did not increase the risk of a skull fracture and multiple episodes of vomiting were no more significant than a single episode. In patients who were fully alert at presentation, post-traumatic vomiting was associated with a twofold increase in relative risk for a skull fracture. â€¨CONCLUSIONâ€”These results support the incorporation of enquiry about vomiting into the guidelines for skull radiography.
