40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on secrecy jurisdictions thus far has revolved around the domestic political factors inducing countries to become secrecy jurisdictions. In this thesis, I identify political factors at the international level related to position in the international system and to geographic location, and assess the importance of these as determinants of which countries become secrecy jurisdictions and of their degree of financial secrecy. In addition, I evaluate the international political factors' ability to predict which countries may become secrecy jurisdictions in the future. I find that none of the international political factors identified in this thesis significantly increase the likelihood of a country becoming a <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> or increase their expected degree of financial secrecy. Rather, the results of this thesis mainly give credit to the domestic political factors, as well as the non-political country characteristics. However, international political factors may be useful in predicting future secrecy jurisdictions, and thus be important guides to policy. The results of this thesis underscore the importance of continuing to push secrecy jurisdictions to take domestic measures to ensure greater financial transparency, and the need for a more coordinated effort at the international level to curb financial secrecy and the use of secrecy jurisdictions...|$|E
50|$|In April 1998 an OECD report {{acknowledged}} that tax havens erode {{the tax base}} of other countries and undermine the fairness of tax systems, diminishing global welfare. It noted that tax havens were expanding at an exponential rate. The report focused on tax havens in the Caribbean who were not OECD members, and the OECD was thus criticized for not addressing tax havens who were its members. A second report in 2000 included a blacklist of 35 <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> - all outside the OECD - and a threat of defensive measures against them, with backing from the United States under the Clinton administration.|$|R

The business model of tax havens is illustrated by using Mauritius and Jersey as case studies. I also provide several real world examples of how <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> lead to inefficient market outcomes and breach of regulations in non-haven countries.

40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Celtic Tiger, the socio-economic particularity of neoliberal capitalism in its Irish manifestation has increasingly been critiqued, but little {{attention has been paid to}} neoliberalism as ecology within Ireland. This article conducts an exploratory survey of the characteristics of the Irish neoliberal ecological regime during and after the Celtic Tiger, identifying the opening of new commodity frontiers (such as fracking, water, agro-biotechnology, and biopharma) constituted in the neoliberal drive to appropriate and financialize nature. I argue for the usefulness of applying not only the tools of world-systems analysis, but also Jason W. Moore’s world-ecological paradigm, to analysis of Ireland as a semi-periphery. What is crucial to a macro-ecological understanding of Ireland’s role in the neoliberal regime of the world-ecology is the inextricability of its financial role as a tax haven and <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> zone from its environmental function as a semi-peripheral pollution and water haven. We can adapt Jason W. Moore’s slogan that “Wall Street…becomes a way of organizing all of nature, characterized by the financialization of any income-generating activity” (Moore 2011 b: 39) to say that to say that the “IFSC is a way of organizing nature,” with pernicious consequences for water, energy, and food systems in Ireland. Financial service centers and pharmaceutical factories, plantations and cattle ranches, tax havens and pollution havens, empires and common markets are all forms of environment-making that constellate human relations and extra-human processes into new ecological regimes. More expansive, dialectical understandings of “ecology” as comprising the whole of socio-ecological relations within the capitalist world-ecology—from farming to pharma to financialization—are crucial to forming configurations of knowledge able not only to take account of Ireland’s role in the environmental history of capitalism, but also to respond to the urgent ecological crises of the neoliberal present...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study how {{multinational}} companies are using various strategies {{in order to}} minimize their total tax burden. We use theory and relevant literature to describe some of the strategies available, and we also confirm that these strategies are in fact being used on a global scale. By studying two of the largest companies in the world, respectively The Coca-Cola Company and IKEA, we are able to see how some of these strategies are used in real life. By studying these two companies, we find that both show signs indicating an aggressive use of tax minimization strategies. The lack of transparency and the complicated organizational structures we have found are both clear indications that aggressive tax planning is being used. By locating the concentrate operation in a tax haven, we believe that The Coca-Cola Company is able to keep massive amounts of income outside of the United States, free of tax. This strategy is possible by having the parent located in Delaware, a high <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> known for offering easy access to tax havens. Tax havens and high secrecy jurisdictions are also common denominators for IKEA´s corporate structure, which includes both a foundation and holding companies located in tax havens such as the Netherlands, The Netherlands Antilles and Luxembourg. By funnelling royalty payments through shell companies and into holding companies in tax havens, as well as shifting profits away from high tax jurisdictions by using aggressive transfer pricing and internal debt; we believe that the companies able to save massive amounts of taxes. The problem of companies being able to avoid taxes {{is the result of a}} malfunctioning global tax system, where various loopholes are easy to exploit. The lack of a common understanding between all jurisdictions, where some deviate from the others in order to increase income, is a problem that needs to be solved. As we describe in the last chapter of our thesis, several actions have been and are to be taken in order to prevent companies from dodging taxes. Most countries are now on board for a new global transparency agreement, and there is reason to believe that we will see changes in the near future, hopefully increasing the total amount of tax paid at a global scale. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|This chapter considers, first, whether {{substantial}} transfer mispricing bymajor {{corporations that}} contributes {{to a loss of}} at least US$ 160 billion ayear to developing countries is plausible in the context of total likelycorporate profits earned worldwide in a year. 1 Second, it tests whether corporate activities in developing countriesand in the extractive industries in particular might be especially prone tothis abuse. Third, it considers whether this sum could be hidden from view within the accounts or financial statements of the multinational corporations(MNCs) that might be perpetrating the mispricing. Fourth, it explores the possibility that the MNCs might use <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> to assist in hiding these transactions from view. In each case, it is suggested that the behavior described is plausible and that, as a consequence, losses of the estimated amount are also plausible,although not proven to exist {{as a result of this}} work...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two years {{offshore}} banking has come under increased scrutiny worldwide by the media, lawmakers, and the general population. Despite this attention, there are few sources which estimate private, non-resident deposits into offshore financial centers. In light of this lack of data, this paper develops a proxy measure which uses data from the Bank of International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, and the central banks of offshore financial centers to estimate non-resident deposits in <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> held by individuals and corporations. In the context of this paper, the term “secrecy jurisdiction ” comprises a broader array of countries than the traditional definition of an offshore financial center. The paper finds that these deposits have been increasing markedly since meaningful data collection efforts began in the early 1990 s, with current totals standing just under US$ 10 trillion. Even when adjusted for inflation, this expansion has dramatically outstripped the growth rate of recorded world wealth. The three jurisdictions holding the larges...|$|R
40|$|Global tax {{abuse is}} one of the key {{obstacles}} to sustainable development. Each year more than USD one trillion are lost to cross border tax abuse and stored away in tax havens. We establish that tax abuse accumulates capital, makes tax systems more regressive and diminishes government revenues. Tax abuse consequently indirectly increases economic inequality and relative poverty and reduces social expenditure affecting both dimensions of economic and social rights fulfillment: the ability of people to claim their rights in the market place or through the provision of entitlements. We test our theory in a cross-sectional study and find empirical evidence for several of the factors in our theory. Both revenue generation and expenditure of fiscal policy are subject to the obligations to progressively realize economic and social human rights by using the maximum of available resources. We confirm that Mozambique has respect, protect and fulfill obligations to refrain from granting extensive tax exemptions, prevent tax avoidance and prosecute tax evasion. State parties hosting and controlling multinational corporations committing tax abuse abroad have similar extraterritorial obligations. Tax havens and <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> deliberately undermine the sovereignty of other states in domestic resource mobilization for rights fulfillment...|$|R
50|$|A wage-led growth {{strategy}} aims at {{establishing a}} full-employment growth {{model in which}} sustained wage growth drives demand growth via consumption growth and via accelerator effects of investment growth, as well as productivity growth via labor-saving-induced technological change. Due to this strategy's repeating itself in a cyclical manner, this theory {{is thought to be}} more stable in the long run than profit-led growth because a wage-led growth strategy will result in stable or rising wage shares if it follows the circular cumulative causation behavior. This theory commands slower paced growth and is more viable in the long run, however, it relies heavily on technological change to redistribute wages and labor in order to continue along the cumulative causation trend. A wage-led growth strategy includes measures to restrict financial speculation, encourage a more long-term view in corporate governance, strengthen the role of stakeholders, and rein in excessive pay in the financial sector. A restructuring of the financial sector is needed to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of financial crises. Such measures are likely to include restrictions on bank bonuses, financial transactions taxes, pro-cyclical credit management, regulation of the shadow banking industry, and closing of <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> (tax havens), as well as the establishment of a sizable not-for-profit segment within the banking industry and a strengthening of stakeholders within corporate governance that will also lead to an improvement in labor's bargaining power and the wage share.|$|R
50|$|An {{accidental}} American is {{a citizen}} of a country other than the United States who may also be considered a U.S. citizen under U.S. nationality law but is not aware of having U.S. status, or has only become aware of it recently during adulthood. Accidental Americans' U.S. citizenship arises due to their parents' ties to the United States rather than their own choices: they may be born {{in their own country}} but to one U.S. citizen parent who emigrated from the United States, or they may be born in the U.S. to parents residing in the country temporarily for work or study and then return to their own country in their early childhood, with few if any memories of the United States. The term may also sometimes be applied to people who definitely are not U.S. citizens but have some other sort of connection with the country, for example green card holders who moved back to their country of origin and let their green cards expire without formally cancelling their U.S. immigration status, or non-U.S. citizens married to Americans abroad. Such tenuous connections to the United States began to become a more salient issue in the late 2000s due to Internal Revenue Service crackdowns which were ostensibly aimed at tax evaders hiding assets in <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> but ended up having much broader effects on people with U.S. citizenship who resided in other countries, as well as their families.|$|R
40|$|Much {{more than}} its {{domestic}} analogues, the contest over international rules and procedures is essentially confined to a small elite of agents—multinational corporations, industry associations, banks, hedge funds, billionaires—who can effectively influence the negotiating positions {{of the most powerful}} governments, foremost that of the United States. Lesser constituents are marginalized through the exclusivity and intransparency of international negotiations, the high costs of successful lobbying and the routine dismissal of moral concerns as inappropriate to the jungle of international relations. We find the fingerprints of this global elite all over the workaday parts of our system of international rules and procedures. Many resource-rich countries are suffering economically because their rulers are internationally recognized as entitled to borrow in the country’s name and to confer ownership rights in its natural resources, regardless of how these rulers came to power and regardless of how badly they rule. These international rules secure the flow of resources into the industrialized countries while facilitating oppression and corruption, and encouraging coups and civil wars in the developing world. Poor countries are drained of badly needed capital and tax revenues through an international tax and financial system that enables their richer citizens to hide assets in foreign <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> and enables multinational corporations to shift their profits to tax havens through trade mis-invoicing and other gimmicky transactions among subsidiaries of the same corporation.

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{sovereignty}} {{is central to}} any international tax issue. While a nation is free to design its tax laws {{as it sees fit}} and raise revenue in accordance with the needs of its citizens, {{it is not possible to}} undertake such a task in isolation. In a world of cross-border investments and business transactions, all tax regimes impact on one another. Tax interactions between sovereign states cannot be avoided. Ultimately, the interactions mean that a nation must decide whether to engage in both collaboration and coordination with other nations and supranational bodies alike or maintain an individualised stance in relation to its tax policy. Whatever the decision, there is arguably an exercise in national sovereignty in some form. In the context of an international tax regime, whether that regime is interpreted broadly as meaning international norms generally adopted by nations around the world or domestic regimes legislating for cross-border transactions, rhetoric around national fiscal sovereignty takes on many different forms. At one end of the spectrum it is relied upon by financial <b>secrecy</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> (tax havens) as a defence to their position on the basis that ‘other’ nations cannot interfere with the fiscal sovereignty of a jurisdiction. At the other end of the spectrum, it is argued that profit shifting and international tax avoidance if not stopped is, in and of itself, a threat to a nation’s fiscal sovereignty on the basis that it threatens the ability to tax and raise the revenue needed. This paper considers a modern conceptualisation of sovereignty along with its role within international tax coordination and collaboration to argue that a move towards a more unified approach to addressing international base erosion and profit shifting may be the ultimate exercise of national fiscal sovereignty. By using the current transfer pricing regime as a case study, this paper posits that it is not merely enough to have international agreement on allocation rules to be applied, but that the ultimate exercise of national sovereignty is political agreement with other states to ensure that it is governments which determine the allocational basis of worldwide profits to be taxed. In doing so, it is demonstrated that the arm’s length pricing requirement of the current transfer pricing regime, rather than providing governments with the ability to determine the location of profits, is providing multinational entities with the ultimate power to determine that location. If left unchecked, this will eventually erode a nation’s ability to capture the required tax revenue and, as a consequence, may be deemed a failure by nation states to exercise their fiscal sovereignty. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{tax haven}} is a {{jurisdiction}} that offers favorable tax or other conditions to its taxpayers as {{relative to other}} jurisdictions. There is no generally accepted definition of what renders a country or jurisdiction a tax haven, but activities that are commonly associated with such places range far beyond tax. The term most commonly refers to those countries or jurisdictions that have a low-tax or no-tax regime or which offer generous tax incentives. Some definitions focus purely on tax: for example, a widely cited academic paper describes a tax haven as a jurisdiction where particular taxes, such as an inheritance tax or income tax, are levied {{at a low rate}} or not at all. Other definitions refer to a state, country, or territory which maintains a system of financial secrecy, which enables foreign individuals to hide assets or income to avoid or reduce taxes in the home jurisdiction. Some refer to [...] "secrecy jurisdictions" [...] as an alternative to [...] "tax havens" [...] to emphasise the secrecy element, and a Financial <b>Secrecy</b> Index ranks <b>jurisdictions</b> according to their size and secrecy.|$|R
40|$|Short title: Illicit {{financial}} flows {{and the fourth}} Millennium Development GoalObjectives: This paper sets out to estimate the cost of illicit {{financial flows}} (IFF) {{in terms of the}} amount of time it could take to reach the fourth Millennium Development Goal (MDG) in 34 African countries. Design: We have calculated the percentage increase in gross domestic product (GDP) if IFFs were curtailed using IFF/GDP ratios. We applied the income (GDP) elasticity of child mortality to the increase in GDP to estimate the reduction in time to reach the fourth MDG in 34 African countries. Participants: children aged under five years. Settings: 34 countries in SSA. Main outcome measures: Reduction in time to reach the first indicator of the fourth MDG, under-five mortality rate in the absence of IFF. Results: We found that in the 34 SSA countries, six countries will achieve their fourth MDG target at the current rates of decline. In the absence of IFF, 16 countries would reach their fourth MDG target by 2015 and there would be large reductions for all other countries. Conclusions: This drain on development is facilitated by financial <b>secrecy</b> in other <b>jurisdictions.</b> Rich and poor countries alike must stem the haemorrhage of IFF by taking decisive steps towards improving financial transparency.

40|$|Weaknesses in the {{enforcement}} of regulation have been targeted by the G- 20 as a priority concern for reform. But enforcement efforts in securities markets have proven difficult and uneven. The recent scandal in the United States, wherein a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard Madoff went undetected by the U. S. authorities {{for more than two}} decades, has once again highlighted the importance of effective enforcement of securities regulation, as well as the challenges that securities regulators around the world face in implementing credible enforcement programs. While in many instances it is individuals who bear the losses, we show that noncompliance with securities law can have serious system-wide impact and that the credibility of the system as a whole rests on the existence of effective discipline-the probability of real consequences for failure to obey the law. This paper explores the elements of enforcement, why it is so challenging, why it is important, and whether its effects can be measured. Through an analysis of the data gathered in the World Bank/IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), the paper examines how enforcement is being carried out around the world and draws conclusions regarding how countries are meeting the challenge of effective enforcement.
