25|$|Strictly speaking, the theorem only {{applies to}} a class of {{mathematical}} functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or sample rate) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces {{the concept of a}} sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are bandlimited to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the <b>sampling</b> <b>process.</b> It expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the sampling theorem to images should be made with care. For example, the <b>sampling</b> <b>process</b> in any standard image sensor (CCD or CMOS camera) is relatively far from the ideal sampling which would measure the image intensity at a single point. Instead these devices have a relatively large sensor area at each sample point {{in order to obtain}} sufficient amount of light. In other words, any detector has a finite-width point spread function. The analog optical image intensity function which is sampled by the sensor device is not in general bandlimited, and the non-ideal sampling is itself a useful type of low-pass filter, though not always sufficient to remove enough high frequencies to sufficiently reduce aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial anti-aliasing, a separate anti-aliasing filter (optical low-pass filter) is typically included in a camera system to further blur the optical image. Despite images having these problems in relation to the sampling theorem, the theorem can be used to describe the basics of down and up sampling of images.|$|E

2500|$|Shotgun {{sequencing}} is a sequencing method {{designed for}} analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs, {{up to and including}} entire chromosomes. It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a shotgun. Since this method can only be used for fairly short sequences (100 to 1000 base pairs), longer DNA sequences must be broken into random small segments which are then sequenced to obtain reads. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing. Computer programs then use the overlapping ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence. [...] Shotgun sequencing is a random <b>sampling</b> <b>process,</b> requiring over-sampling to ensure a given nucleotide is represented in the reconstructed sequence; the average number of reads by which a genome is over-sampled is referred to as coverage.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to compare three techniques of sample preparation for cervical flow crystallization (pressure imprint, touch imprint and smear), analyzing the tree forms (crystallization) as a characterization of the cervical flow of dairy cattle, according to the day of collection and moment of the estrous cycle. Ten clinically healthy, multiparous Holstein Friesian dairy cows were sampled and 30 to 50 days postpartum. Each was collected from the vaginal cervix using a disposable pipette and a 50 cc syringe. The two imprints and the smear were prepared on slides, with two-step protocol according to the methodology of Prado et al. (2012). The samples were then allowed to dry in {{the environment and the}} microscope was read with a higher magnification objective (40 X) to observe the formation of the crystals, these procedures were performed in 4 different moments of the estrous cycle (0, 7, 14, 21 days). To quantify the crystallization, a scale from 0 to 4 was used, which varies depending on the formation of typical crystals at least formation or absence. At day 0, 7, 14, 21, the crystallization level in the three techniques had significant difference (P < 0. 05). At day 0, 50 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>processed</b> by the touch imprint and pressure imprint showed typical formation compared to 20 % that were processed by the smear technique. On day 7, 80 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>processed</b> by touch imprint, 90 % of the smear technique and 70 % of the pressure imprint, present atypical crystals. On day 14, 60 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>processed</b> by the contact imprint and 30 % and 40 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>processed</b> by the smear technique and pressure imprint, respectively, showed atypical crystal formation. On day 21, 40 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>processed</b> by the touch imprint and 10 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>processed</b> by the smear technique and pressure imprint showed typical crystal formation.
