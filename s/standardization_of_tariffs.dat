Their aim was to [...] "restore Ottoman law, and rejuvenate the military" [...] as well as reviving [...] "a secure tax base for the government". In order to reestablish rule in 1834 the Sultan abolished public elections for the position of governor, and began [...] "neutralizing local families such as the Jalilis and their class." [...] and appointing new, non-Maslawi governors directly. In line with its reintegration within central government rule, Mosul was required to conform to new Ottoman reform legislation, including the <b>standardization</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> rates, the consolidation of internal taxes and {{the integration of the}} administrative apparatus with the central government.|$|R

Yet, despite their attempts to reclaim control over the Maslawi government apparatus, the city’s most prominent families such as the Jalilis still retained significant influence [...] "not only within local circles, but also within the central government apparatus." [...] After the reign of Bayraktar Mehmet Pasha, the Ottoman government (wishing still to restrain the influence of powerful local families) appointed a series of governors in rapid succession, ruling [...] "for only a brief period before being sent somewhere else to govern, making it impossible for any of them to achieve a substantial local power base." [...] Without this power base, such Pashas remained dependent upon families such as the Jalilis to [...] "intercede on their behalf" [...] with local Maslawis {{in order for them to}} accomplish [...] "even their most basic tasks of collecting taxes and providing security". Ironically, in [...] "one of the last administrative changes of the reform era" [...] in which proxy rule by appointed Pashas gave way to direct, centralized rule by Sultan Abdulhamid II, the deputies appointed to discharge Ottoman jurisdiction [...] "once again hailed from traditional elite families in the city." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{concerning the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the inter-industry wage premium has not addressed {{the role of}} total factor productivity (TFP) in determining both the wage premium and tariffs. This omission invalidates the use <b>of</b> the pre-reform <b>tariff</b> level as an instrument for the change in tariffs. Based on an analysis of Colombian data, I find that including TFP in the estimated model of the effects <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the wage premium leads to a 36 % decrease in the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the inter-industry wage premium relative to the model that omits TFP. More specifically, a ten percentage point decrease in tariffs reduces the wage premium by 1. 1 %. This finding suggests the importance of using policies that boost productivity to offset the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> on the wage premium. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> for labour productivity faces the challenge <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> policy endogeneity. Tariff policy is designed to promote economic development and the industrial sector tariff structure may reflect characteristics of the industries protected. We seek to identify the effect <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> by taking advantage <b>of</b> multilateral <b>tariff</b> liberalization using reductions in industrial sector tariffs in other world regions as instruments for sectoral tariff reductions in South Africa. The data cover 28 manufacturing sectors over the period 1988 - 2003. We find that tariff reductions have stimulated labour productivity when instrumented by multilateral tariffs. The ordinary least-squares estimates show downward bias and this confirms the endogeneity <b>of</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Investigation <b>of</b> channels of effects shows some support {{for the importance of}} competitive pressure and technology spillover from trade liberalization.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} multilateral market access liberalization of the Doha Round agricultural negotiations. At the center are the effects of variations in the magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> cuts, different tariff cutting formulas, the tariff capping as well as different numbers and width <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> bands. The simulations are conducted with an extended version of the GTAP model and the GTAP database (6. 0) including bound and applied rates and a module to cut tariffs at the 6 -digit tariff line level. The results reveal that the heights <b>of</b> the <b>tariff</b> cuts {{and the kind of}} tiered formula applied are most important for the outcome of the Doha Round, while the width <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> bands and the tariff capping only have a moderate influence on the countries' trade pattern and welfare. In contrast, the number <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> bands is not important for the results. ...|$|R

In this way, it will lay a strong foundation for designing a negotiation scheme that will give Korea a favorable position in future tariff negotiation.
