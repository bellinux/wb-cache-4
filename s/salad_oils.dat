5000|$|Halfhill and Robert Ward, a Los Angeles merchant, {{decided to}} buy the {{machinery}} of San Francisco's Golden Gate Packing Company, which had just gone out of business. Neither Halfhill nor Ward had enough money to do this, so approached Joseph H. Lapham, a wealthy merchant, with this business proposition. They bought the fish-packing machinery and formed the Southern California Fish Company with Lapham as its president. Halfhill, Ward, and Lapham were the stockholders of this new firm. In 1893, they constructed a new two-story fish packing factory plant on Terminal Island at San Pedro Bay, where they used their machinery to pack sardines.The sardine-packing business was prosperous for ten years. In 1903, the sardine harvest failed in San Pedro Bay for some unknown reason. Halfhill then looked for some other seafood to keep his plant running. In his travels, he had picked up a can of Italian canned tuna and brought it back to his plant {{to see if he}} could copy it. Halfhill then began experimenting in packing fish that were plentiful in the Pacific Ocean. He found that coast-rock cod, albacore, and halibut were bountiful. Halfhill then experimented with the idea of removing natural fish oils and substituting them with <b>salad</b> <b>oils,</b> like olive or cottonseed oil. He then cooked this preparation tuna with compressed steam and it resulted in a white meat with the texture of chicken.|$|E

While the meal {{plays a significant role}} in livestock !eeding, the oils pressed from seeds have been adapted for a variety of uses such as paint products, margarines and <b>salad</b> <b>oils.</b> Prior to World War n considerable quantities of olive, corn, peanut and other oils were imported. However with importation restricted during the war, a serious shortage resulted which spurred investigations on the use of domestic oils from crops such as linseed, soybean, rapeseed, mnstard seed and sunflower seed. The recent sanctioning of margarine production has further stimulated the interest in these oils. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The lipid {{fraction}} of Pistacia atlantica seeds was extracted {{for the first}} time by means of cold-press technique and analyzed for its chemical composition. The fatty acids, sterols, triacylglycerols (TAG), tocopherols, polyphenols, and pigments were identified and their concentrations were determined by means of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). Because of its high content of unsaturated fatty acids, it might prove to be of value in diets and it may be used as edible cooking or <b>salad</b> <b>oils</b> or for margarine manufacture. Pistacia atlantica seed oil has the unique sterols and tocopherols content providing source of natural antioxidants. The main triacylglycerols were SLL + PLO, SOL + POO, OOLn + PLL, OOO, and SOO. This paper examined the phenolic {{fraction of}} Pistacia atlantica seed oil. Moreover, caffeic acid followed by cinnamic acid, pinoresinol, vanillin, p-Coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-Coumaric acid was also determined. This paper presents the first investigation of chlorophyll's and carotene's composition in Pistacia atlantica seed oil. Furthermore, pheophytin a was the major component, followed by luteoxanthin, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, lutein isomers, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a′, and pheophytin a′ were also determined...|$|E

40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis (PCA) {{is a popular}} method of dietary patterns analysis, but our understanding of its use to describe changes in dietary patterns over time is limited. Using a FFQ, we assessed the diets of 12, 572 nonpregnant women aged 20 - 34 y from Southampton, UK, of whom 2270 and 2649 became pregnant and provided complete dietary data in early and late pregnancy, respectively. Intakes of white bread, breakfast cereals, cakes and biscuits, processed meat, crisps, fruit and fruit juices, sweet spreads, confectionery, hot chocolate drinks, puddings, cream, milk, cheese, full-fat spread, cooking fats and <b>salad</b> <b>oils,</b> red meat, and soft drinks increased in pregnancy. Intakes of rice and pasta, liver and kidney, vegetables, nuts, diet cola, tea and coffee, boiled potatoes, and crackers decreased in pregnancy. PCA {{at each time point}} produced 2 consistent dietary patterns, labeled prudent and high-energy. At each time point in pregnancy, and for both the prudent and high-energy patterns, we derived 2 dietary pattern scores for each woman: a natural score, based on the pattern defined at that time point, and an applied score, based on the pattern defined before pregnancy. Applied scores are preferred to natural scores to characterize changes in dietary patterns over time because the scale of measurement remains constant. Using applied scores, there was a very small mean decrease in prudent diet score in pregnancy and a very small mean increase in high-energy diet score in late pregnancy, indicating little overall change in dietary patterns in pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} World War II {{cut off from}} the North American {{continent}} supplies of imported vegetable oils. This focused attention on a search for new plant sources, increased production from available sources and alteration of available vegetable oils by physical and chemical processes to meet industrial demands. This resulted in stimulation of the vegetable oil industry. The maintenance of this industry against competition from oil exporting countries requires production of superior oil products at costs which will not be excessive. In addition to production of oils in competition with imported oils, there has been an increased demand for modified oils specifically adapted for certain purposes, e. g., fast-drying oils. The modification of vegetable oils may be aided by a knowledge of the acids and glycerides that are present. Sunflower seed (Helianthus annus) is grown extensively in Russia, Argentine, China, Hungary and United States. Commercial production of sunflower seed in Canada has increased rapidly since 1941 as a war measure. The two main varieties are Sunrise and Mennonite, which are adapted to regions of a relatively long frost free period. Approximately 20, 000 acres were seeded in Manitoba in 1945, and two oil expeller mills have been built in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The oil is an edible, semi-drying oil used extensively for Cooking and <b>salad</b> <b>oils,</b> shortenings and, to a limited extent, for paints and varnishes. Jamieson (63) gives the following fatty acid composition: oleic 33. 4, linoleic 57. 5, palmitic 3. 5, stearic 2. 9, arachidic 0. 6 and lignoceric 0. 4. Linolenic acid is not detected by chemical analyses. The present investigation Was undertaken to determine: (1) the relation of iodine value to fatty acid composition, (2) the glyceride structure by fractional crystallization, (3) if changes in the glyceride structure induced by physical and chemical treatment, such as molecular rearrangements, could be detected by fractional crystallization...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to clarify the influence of preservation conditions on {{the deterioration of the}} vegetable oils used in daily life. Each of iodine value for five kinds of vegetable <b>oil,</b> that is, <b>salad</b> <b>oil,</b> olive oil, sesame oil, corn oil, and soy bean germ oil was obtained by the experiment, because iodine value shows the degree of unsaturated fatty acids as the constituents of lipid, and it seems to relate to the deterioration of oil. Then, the changes of the deterioration for five kinds of vegetable oil which were put on the preservation of eight weeks at a constant temperature of 60 ℃ were examined every week by the rate of weight increase (%), peroxide value (POV) and acid value (AV). Furthermore, both samples of <b>salad</b> <b>oil</b> used in frying the sliced potato and an unused <b>salad</b> <b>oil</b> were put on the place of sunlight irradiation and the shade, and were examined every week by peroxide value. As the result, it was concluded that the preservation conditions of a lower temperature and the shade place were extremely important in the preservation of vegetable oils. 本報告では，植物油のサラダ油，コーン油，オリーブ油，ゴマ油，および大豆胚芽油の 5 種類の植物油を試料として取り上げた。尚，その中の大豆胚芽油は体内レステロール低下の機能をもつ油で，そのような高付加価値をもつ油は人間の健康増進のため，今後益々製造されて行くだろう。それら 5 種類の植物油の保存期間による油の経時的な変化を，重量増加率，過酸化物量，抗酸化性の定性テスト，および酸価により調べ，また日光照射による油の酸化については過酸化物量の測定により検討した。それらの実験により，油の保存条件が油の酸化や加水分解による油の劣化に及ぼす影響について調べた...|$|R

To illustrate their different adsorption mechanism, adsorption capacities of EG for these pollutants are firstly detected. And then stepwise adsorption for oils {{is carried out}} with EG which has been saturated first by PEG with different MW. Then difference between stepwise adsorbance of oil is checked with deviation analysis. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) analysis is used to show structure difference of EG adsorbed different adsorbates.
