Improving the working of statistical analyses by advanced computer technology, enhancing the efficiency, is a topic which the <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> superintendent and the scientific and technical worker explore continuously. The present situation of the <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> statistics management informationization was analyzed. Mainly, {{the status of the}} <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> statistics management in Jiangsu Province was investigated. Subsequently, the <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> statistics management system based on the Web database was developed and the introduction on main function of the system was made.

40|$|This paper computes {{private and}} social {{rates of return}} to R&D capital in the three {{vertically}} linked sectors, primary agriculture, food processing, and the <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> in the United States. Using a cost function approach, the private rates of return to R&D ranged {{from an average of}} 21. 5 % per annum for <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> to 87. 5 % for agriculture. The social rates of return to R&D in food processing and <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> are larger than the private rates due to spillovers. We find that spillovers from public agricultural R&D mitigates the market's failure in <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> to fully appropriate the returns to its R&D capital.

40|$|<b>Farm</b> <b>machinery</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} capital {{demanding}} areas of a farm operation. The value of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> and motor vehicles in the United States in 1969 was approximately $ 32. 6 Billion, representing nearly 12 percent of the total assets of farmers. Efficient capital management is an essential element in a successful farm operation. With the increase in farm size and the adoption of labor saving, larger mechanized units, Nebraska farmers are left with limited amounts of short run capital available for yearly operating expenses. At the same time, farmers have been plagued with a substantial increase in interest rates since 1960. Even further alarming is that certain major lending agencies have restricted credit availability for intermediate term <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> financing, being more interested in short term lending. The primary objective of this study is to determine the least cost method of acquiring the long term use of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> for Nebraska farmers with respect to the alternative financing methods of (1) leasing, (2) credit purchasing, and (3) cash purchasing. Secondary objectives of this study are as follows: a) To determine what is being offered to Nebraska farmers in terms of lease and credit plans, and possible future expectations of the utilization of leasing. b) To determine the effect of various depreciation methods (with purchase agreements) on cost of acquiring the long term use of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery.</b> c) To determine the effect of an operator’s tax bracket on cost of acquiring the long term use of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery.</b> d) To determine the effect of an operator’s opportunity cost of capital on the cost of the long term use of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery.</b> Advisor:Thomas L.

40|$|<b>Farm</b> <b>machineries</b> play {{important}} role to the plantation sector {{in order to reduce}} the human labour and make the agricultural activities more efficiently and save the working hours at the field. In order to estimate repair and maintenance of <b>farm</b> <b>machineries,</b> there are several data needed such as horsepower of tractors, annual use of hours of tractors, age of the tractors, and repair costs of tractors. The study was conducted to develop repair and maintenance costs model of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> in oil palm and paddy cultivation. Field observation, interview, and secondary data extraction from the companies data has been used to obtain the data in this study. Multiple linear regression was used for the data analysis in SPSS to formulate the new model in estimating repair and maintenance costs of <b>farm</b> <b>machineries</b> afterwards. The result successfully develop of this study was the repair and maintenance costs model in oil palm and paddy has been developed with R-square value of 0. 898 and 0. 756 respectively. The sensitivity analysis of each of the two repair and maintenance costs model showed that all the variables correlated and significant to the respective repair and maintenance costs will have positive impact on the repair and maintenance cost. Other than that, this research also compared repair and maintenance costs of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> between oil palm and paddy. Conclusively, this study is quite useful for the strategic planning and make better allocation of the company to estimate of total cost in <b>farm</b> <b>machinery...</b>|$|R

Most of the manufacturer in the surveyed area has taken <b>farm</b> <b>machinery</b> production as a seasonal business or secondary business due to seasonal demand of <b>farm</b> <b>machinery.</b> Manufacturer gets technical assistance from non-government organizations (NGOs) only. Research stations provided limited range of technical support to the manufacturer. They are not getting financial support from any kind of sources. Production problems are classified as problem before going to production, on going production problem and post-production. Before going to production manufacturer face capital, setting up infrastructure, land, skilled labour, complexity in taking bank loan, political unrest, unhealthy environment, getting electricity connection, bureaucratic complexity and technical know-how of the worker. On going production problems include capital for bulk production, skilled labour, trained technicians, load shedding, double taxation system, raw materials supply, low quality of raw material. Post-production problems are marketing competition with below standard implement of other manufacturer, unauthorized enterprise makes same type of implement of below standard and sold at low price, seasonal demand, ware house, marketing set up, marketing facility.
