On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E

2500|$|Smith, poor fellow, {{has died}} of wounds. I passed {{him on his}} way down – though hit in seven places, his courage was wonderful.

2500|$|It can be <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{high degree}} of {{certainty}} {{that most of the}} time {{in the first half of}} 1948 the mass-exodus was the natural, thoughtless, pitiful movement of ignorant people who had been badly led and who in the day of trial found themselves forsaken by their leaders. Terror was the impulse, by hearsay most often, and sometimes through experience as in the Arab port of Jaffa which surrendered on the 12th of May and where the Irgunists, to quote Mr. John Marlowe, [...] "embellished their Deir Yassin battle honours by an orgy of looting". But if the exodus was by and large an accident of war in the first stage, in the later stages it was consciously and mercilessly helped on by Jewish threats and aggression towards Arab populations.|$|E

[...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars.

When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning.

2500|$|Anesthesiologist Isabella Herb {{found that}} a dose of 20% {{ethylene}} gas administered to a subject was a threshold. A dosage higher than 20% caused unconsciousness. [...] With less than 20% a trance was induced where the subject could sit up, hear questions and answer them logically, although the tone of their voice might be altered, their speech pattern could be changed, {{and they may have}} lost some awareness of their hands and feet (with some it was possible to have poked a pin or pricked them with a knife and they would not feel it). When patients were removed from the area where the gas accumulated they had no recollection of what had happened, or what they had <b>said.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> dosage of more than 20% the patient lost control over the movement of their limbs and may thrash wildly, groaning in strange voices, losing balance and frequently repeatedly falling. All of these symptoms match the experience of the Pythia in action, as related by Plutarch, who witnessed many prophecies.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{memorandum}} sent to Berlin demanding {{the removal of}} German ambassador Paul Wolff Metternich because he interceded {{on behalf of the}} Armenians, Talaat reaffirmed such a commitment: [...] "the work must be done now, after the war it will be too late." [...] By the end of the war, the subsequent German ambassador Johann von Bernstorff described his discussion with Talaat: [...] "When I kept on pestering him about the Armenian question, he once <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile: 'What on earth do you want? The question is settled, there are no more Armenians'". A similar statement by Talaat was made to Swedish military attaché Einar af Wirsén: [...] "The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. I can still see in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved." [...] Talaat is reported to have said the following to American ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. (as recorded in Ambassador Morgenthau's Story), who confronted Talaat on several occasions: [...] "I have accomplished more toward solving the Armenian problem in three months than Abdulhamid II accomplished in thirty years!" [...] Morgenthau then relates an exchange he had with Talaat: ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She <b>said</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E
