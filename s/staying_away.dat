5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{realizes that}} September's message was literal, {{and returns to}} his home, where he is knocked out by Jones' men. He is brought to the same {{facility}} as Olivia and tied up. As they prepare to torture him, Olivia begins to use her powers to activate the lights, {{not only on the}} box but within the facility, creating electrical sparks that kill one of Jones' men. As Jones and Nina retreat, Olivia frees Peter and they give chase, though Olivia suffers from a seizure, following excessive use of her powers. They catch up to Jones and Nina as they are crossing back to the parallel universe, but the two are able to escape. Peter contacts the authorities to bring medical help for Olivia. As they are waiting, Peter admits to Olivia that he fears what he has done to her memories, and has seen his original Olivia through the Observer's mind. He leaves her, believing that <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> from this Olivia would be for the best.|$|E

5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E

The government has made ongoing attempts at media censorship, including briefly shutting down nearly all Internet traffic.|$|E
25|$|Social distancing, another tactic, is <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> {{from other}} {{people who might be}} infected, and can include {{avoiding}} large gatherings, spreading out a little at work, or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community.

25|$|Tickets {{were aimed}} at being sold online or by telephone. They had a lower base price, but {{surcharges}} were charged to additional services, including in-flight meals. Surcharges were also charged by travel agencies who booked flights during an interim period. After this the tickets were not available via travel agents. The airline only operated point-to-point services, rather than the network model by Scandinavian Airline. Tickets were sold one-way and did not require a round trip and <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> over a Saturday to claim discounts. However, they did not support interlining.|$|E

25|$|In 1833, after <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> {{for three}} years, Charles Louis {{returned}} to Lucca and granted a general amnesty. This was {{in stark contrast}} to the attitude of others Italian states that opted for repression and imprisonment. The same year Thomas Ward, a former English jockey, arrived in Lucca and in few years he became Charles Louis' adviser and minister. Charles Louis studied and collected biblical and liturgical texts and was interested in different religious rituals. He had built a Greek Orthodox chapel at his villa in Marlia, and he also flirted with Protestantism, which was viewed unfavourably by other Catholic courts.|$|E
25|$|Many mass {{deworming}} {{programs also}} combine their efforts {{with a public}} health education. These health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as: washing your hands before eating, and <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> from water/areas contaminated by human feces. These programs may also stress that shoes must be worn, however, these come with their own health risks {{and may not be}} effective. Shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs, and the levels of education within that society. The wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions; such as areas between the toes.|$|E
25|$|Mick McCarthy {{resigned}} as Ireland manager in November 2002 after defeats to Russia and Switzerland in qualification for Euro 2004. The possibility of Keane {{returning to the}} squad for future qualifiers was raised, as Keane had not yet fully retired from international football, insisting that McCarthy's presence was the main incentive for <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> from the Irish squad. McCarthy's replacement, Brian Kerr, discussed with Keane {{the possibility of a}} recall, and in April 2004 he was brought back into the Irish team to face Romania on 27 May. Keane was not reinstated as captain, however, as Kerr decided to keep the armband with Kenny Cunningham. After the team's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football in order to help prolong his club career.|$|E
