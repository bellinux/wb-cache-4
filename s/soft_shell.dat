According to Sereno, [...] "Their crania are long, high and narrow, and their faces are taller with considerable alveolar prognathism." [...] This was a nomadic herding culture. Artifacts found in association include bones and tusks from fauna, projectile points, ceramics, ivory, bone and shell ornaments.

A clutch of up to 12 <b>soft</b> <b>shelled</b> eggs can be laid amongst leaf litter or in hollow palm trunks, and is sometimes attended by the female.

50|$|Like all crabs, fiddler crabs {{shed their}} shells as they grow. If {{they have lost}} legs or claws during their present growth cycle, a new one will be present when they molt.

Newly molted crabs are very vulnerable because of their <b>soft</b> <b>shells.</b> They are reclusive and hide until the new shell hardens.|$|R

25|$|Historian Allan Nevins, for instance, {{writes of}} {{political}} rallies in 1856 with turnouts of anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand men and women.

By 1858, they were mostly gone, and politics divided four ways. Republicans controlled most Northern states with a strong Democratic minority. The Democrats were split North and South and fielded two tickets in 1860. Southern non-Democrats tried different coalitions; most supported the Constitutional Union party in 1860.|$|R
