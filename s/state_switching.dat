2500|$|These {{consisted}} of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed {{the direction of the}} current on the negative half cycles. [...] They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. [...] Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. [...] These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. [...] Then a second set of rectifier contacts on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{method to}} produce a fast high voltage solid <b>states</b> <b>switch</b> using Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) is {{presented}} for discharge-pumped gas lasers. The IGBTs are connected in series to achieve a high voltage rating. An avalanche transistor is used as the gate driver. The fast pulse generated by the avalanche transistor quickly charges the large input capacitance of the IGBT, resulting in a switch out of a fast high-voltage pulse. The switching characteristic of fast-high voltage solid <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> has been estimated in the multi-stage series-connected IGBT with the applied voltage of several tens of kV. Electrical circuit diagram and the mythology of fast-high voltage solid <b>state</b> <b>switch</b> as well as experimental results obtained are presented.

50|$|<b>State</b> <b>switching</b> (a.k.a. {{phenotypic}} switching) is {{a fundamental}} physiological process in which a cell/organism undergoes spontaneous, and potentially reversible, transitions between different phenotypes. Thus, the ability to switch states/phenotypes (phenotypic plasticity) is a key feature of development and normal function of cells within most multicellular organisms that enables the cell to respond to various intrinsic and extrinsic cues and stimuli in a concerted fashion enabling them to ‘make’ appropriate cellular decisions. Although <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> is essential for normal functioning, the repertoire of phenotypes in a normal cell is albeit limited.|$|E

50|$|A {{ground-level}} {{power supply}} system known as Ground-level power supply or APS is {{an updated version of}} the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three metre neutral sections between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them. Older systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Wireless and solid <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> remove the mechanical problem.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to normal cells, a striking characteristic of cancer cells is the remarkable degree of phenotypic plasticity they exhibit.

Interestingly, unlike {{in the case of}} normal cells, <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> in cancer cells is widely believed to arise due to somatic mutations. However, there is growing concern that such a deterministic view of a phenomenon that is reversible is not entirely consistent with multiple lines of evidence which indicate that stochasticity may also {{play an important role in}} driving phenotypic plasticity.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s {{the advent of}} solid <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> {{technology}} saw a shift from the traditional methods of induction heating power generation. Initially this {{was limited to the}} use of thyristors for generating the 'MF range of frequencies using discrete electronic control systems. [...] State of the art units now employ SCR (silicon-controlled rectifier), IGBT or MOSFET technologies for generating the 'MF' and 'RF' current. The modern control system is typically a digital microprocessor based system utilising PIC, PLC (programmable logic controller) technology and surface mount manufacturing techniques for production of the printed circuit boards. Solid state now dominates the market and units from 1 kW to many megawatts in frequencies from 1 kHz to 3 MHz including dual frequency units are now available.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1950s {{there was}} {{widespread}} {{interest in the}} use of magnetic amplifiers as a solid <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> device. The amplifiers used the saturation points and hysteresis curves of a magnetic core to sum a number of inputs and settle to a single output state. The various logical functions were achieved by linearly adding the input signals on control lines and generating an output signal if the sum exceeded a fixed threshold, defined by the saturation property of the magnetic core. This process {{came to be known as}} [...] "Ballot Box Logic" [...] due to the way the inputs created a majority-rule on the output. One difference between magnetic logic and conventional tube or transistor systems is that it is the current that defines the logic levels, not voltage.|$|E
50|$|In GSD microscopy, {{fluorescent}} markers are used. In one condition, {{the marker}} can freely be excited from ground state and returns spontaneously via emission of a fluorescence photon. However, if light of appropriate wavelength is additionally applied the dye can be excited to a long-lived dark state, i.e. {{a state where}} no fluorescence occurs. As long as the molecule is in the long-lived dark state (e.g. a triplet state), it cannot be excited from the ground <b>state.</b> <b>Switching</b> between these two states (bright and dark) by applying light fulfills all preconditions for the RESOLFT concept and subwavelength scale imaging, and therefore images with very high resolution can be obtained. For successful implementation, GSD microscopy requires either special fluorophores with high triplet yield, or removal of oxygen by use of various mounting media such as Mowiol or Vectashield.|$|E
50|$|Two other {{approaches}} also exist {{to lower the}} power overhead of state changes. One {{is to reduce the}} operating voltage of the circuit, as in a dual-voltage CPU, or to reduce the voltage change involved in a state change (making a state change only, changing node voltage by a fraction of the supply voltage—low voltage differential signaling, for example). This approach is limited by thermal noise within the circuit. There is a characteristic voltage (proportional to the device temperature and to the Boltzmann constant), which the <b>state</b> <b>switching</b> voltage must exceed in order for the circuit to be resistant to noise. This is typically on the order of 50-100 mV, for devices rated to 100 degrees Celsius external temperature (about 4 kT, where T is the device's internal temperature in kelvins and k is the Boltzmann constant).|$|E
