50|$|The Certificate of Financial Responsibility (COFR) {{program was}} created to ensure that <b>tankers,</b> <b>barges,</b> and other vessels used to {{transport}} oil and chemical-based products on U.S. should bear any ensuing cleanup costs from spills or leaks.

50|$|The Severn Railway Bridge crossed {{just north}} of Lydney from Purton to Sharpness on the eastern bank. Built in the 1870s, it was damaged beyond repair {{by a pair of}} oil <b>tanker</b> <b>barges</b> in 1960. The barges hit Pier 17 {{bringing}} down two bowstring girders. There have been several plans to renew the link, most recently in the late 1990s as a millennium project.|$|R

40|$|The {{lighthouse}} tender CROCUS {{is tied to}} the South Dock on Kelleys Island. Lighthouse tenders carried {{passengers and}} supplies to lighthouses. The CROCUS was built at Shooter's Island, New York, and served in the lighthouse service from 1904 to 1939. From 1939 to 1946, the CROCUS was part of the United States Coast Guard. She was steel-hulled and first assigned to duty at the 10 th Lighthouse District and was based at Buffalo, New York. In 1932, she was converted to oil-fired boilers and transferred to Detroit. During WWII she was based in Toledo, Ohio, continuing her peacetime duties of servicing navigation aids. She aided in recovering the bodies of the crews of the tug "Admiral" and the <b>tanker</b> <b>barge</b> "Cleveco. " The men lost their lives when the vessels foundered in a storm in December 1942. The "Admiral" was towing the fully-loaded <b>tanker</b> <b>barge</b> from Toledo to Cleveland, Ohio. The "Crocus" was decommissioned in 1948. Photograph # 3287.

5|$|There {{were a few}} regular {{carriers}} left by the 1920s, one of whom ran Jackson's Navy, using {{horses to}} tow the barges, and steam tugs after 1930. When the company stopped trading in 1948, sugar beet traffic was carried to Ely in boats owned by the beet factory for another ten years. Fuel oil for the pumping stations was supplied by the <b>tanker</b> <b>barge</b> Shellfen until 1971, by which time the Well Creek was almost impassible.|$|R

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode.

Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century.

40|$|The {{turning circle}} {{manoeuvre}} of a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>tanker</b> like ship model is numerically simulated through {{the integration of}} the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations coupled with the equations of the motion of a rigid body.

The ship model is in its fully appended conguration, and it is characterized by the presence of two propellers and one rudder. Each propeller is taken into account by a model based on the actuator disk concept. It is shown that, in order to accurately predict the trajectory, the side force developed by the propeller should be taken into account; several models are tested.

50|$|Marine oil <b>tanker</b> and <b>barges</b> can {{transport}} this petroleum {{all around}} the world. These vessels are used because they can carry a lot of fuel, so the amount it costs per barrel to move this oil is very cheap. These tankers are also really {{the only way to}} move crude oil across the oceans. Usually the larger tankers are used to transport this fuel on a global scale, taking fuel from one continent to the other. Barges are a lot like <b>tankers,</b> however <b>barges</b> are a lot smaller and do not have any method of propulsion to move them. Barges are often pushed or towed by tugs. This makes barges very poor for transporting this oil for long distances. Barges are very poor for traveling across rough seas, so they are used in calmer waters. However, these barges are usually used for transporting the fuel shorter distances.|$|R
50|$|Grenadiers fifth war patrol, {{under the}} command of LCDR John Allison Fitzgerald, between 1 January and 20 February 1943, brought her {{considerably}} better fortune than earlier patrols. A 75-ton schooner fell victim to her deck guns 10 January, and two days later Grenadier sighted a small <b>tanker</b> with a <b>barge</b> in tow. Judging the target not worth a torpedo, she slipped silently into the column behind the two Japanese ships. At dusk she battle surfaced. With binoculars lashed to the deck guns as sights, she raked the <b>tanker</b> and <b>barge,</b> sinking them immediately. The remainder of her patrol, along the Borneo coast through shallow and treacherous waters, was hampered by fathometer failures. She conducted an aggressive attack on two cargo ships 22 January but did not sink them.|$|R
5000|$|Transportation: Oil and gas are {{transported to}} {{processing}} facilities, {{and from there}} to end users, by pipeline, tanker/barge, truck, and rail. Pipelines are the most economical transportation method and are most suited to movement across longer distances, for example, across continents. <b>Tankers</b> and <b>barges</b> are also employed for long-distance, often international transport. Rail and truck can also be used for longer distances but are most cost-effective for shorter routes.|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of new {{pipeline}} capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river <b>barge,</b> <b>tanker,</b> and other transportation methods. Other than ocean tankers, these alternatives are all more expensive than pipelines.|$|R
50|$|A typical non-convex {{problem is}} that of {{optimizing}} transportation costs by selection from a set of transportation methods, {{one or more of}} which exhibit economies of scale, with various connectivities and capacity constraints. An example would be petroleum product transport given a selection or combination of pipeline, rail tanker, road <b>tanker,</b> river <b>barge,</b> or coastal tankship. Owing to economic batch size the cost functions may have discontinuities in addition to smooth changes.|$|R

50|$|Marine Transfer Operations are {{conducted}} at many ports {{around the world}} between <b>tanker</b> ships, <b>barges,</b> and marine terminals. Specifically, once the marine vessel is secure at the dock a loading arm or transfer hose is connected between a valve header on the dock and the manifold header on the vessel. A marine transfer of petroleum products cannot be conducted unless it is supervised by a person-in-charge (PIC) on the vessel who is seafarer in the Merchant Marine and another person-in-charge on the dock.|$|R
50|$|The loading master person-in-charge (PIC) is {{the marine}} {{transfer}} operator at the marine terminal who supervises {{the movement of}} petroleum products between <b>tanker</b> ships, <b>barges,</b> and the terminal while the vessel is berthed at the dock. In this capacity the marine transfer operator ensures that all regulatory aspects concerning {{protection of the environment}} and maritime security are adhered to during marine transfer operations. Of particular importance is ensuring no water pollution occurs from a spill or a breach of security from the access of unauthorized personnel.|$|R
50|$|Refineries {{which use}} {{a large amount}} of steam and cooling water need to have an {{abundant}} source of water. Oil refineries therefore are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a sea shore, nearby a port. Such location also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil by pipeline are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals by pipeline. Pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and rail cars, road <b>tankers,</b> and <b>barges</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{flexible}} fabric barge concepts aims at an economical delivery system for fresh water {{that would be}} considerably cheaper than desalination plants, rigid ships, <b>tanker</b> trucks, conventional <b>barges,</b> aqueducts or pipeline transport.
