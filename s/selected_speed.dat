40|$|An {{investigation}} into the driver’s choice of speed at roadway sites with restrictive alignment is presented in this study. Specifically, the study focused {{on the effect of}} horizontal curve radii and sight distance on speed selection. Seven sites were examined in this study that are located along a 10 -mile stretch of a rural high crash corridor, US 191 north of Big Sky in southwest Montana. Two of the study sites have no restrictive geometry representing base conditions, another two have restrictive curve radii, and the other three have restrictive radii and sight distances. Vehicle speeds, classification, and headways were collected at each site. The <b>selected</b> <b>speeds</b> for free-moving vehicles were compared to the legal speed limit, advisory speed, and the speeds dictated by curve radius and sight distance when applicable. Study results found {{that the vast majority of}} observed <b>selected</b> <b>speeds</b> are notably higher than the speeds found using the alignment and sight distance design equations.

50|$|The {{focusing}} screen of the Canon EF cannot {{be replaced by}} the user. Early models feature a microprism circle, the later a split image screen with a microprism ring around it. Typical of the era, all viewfinder information is provided by mechanical arrangements, which are projected into the viewfinder by optics inside the camera housing. The range of selectable shutter speeds are always visible {{at the bottom of the}} viewfinder, with a fork outlining the currently <b>selected</b> <b>speed.</b> To the right is a scale with the aperture setting, where a needle points at the aperture the camera's exposure meter selects, and also automatically sets, provided the FD lens or FD new lens is set to the green A symbol (or green on older lenses). The largest opening the used lens is capable of is always properly shown, by shifting the whole scale up or down. The range goes from 1.2 to 5.6, in order to suit lenses from the Canon FD 55 mm 1:1.2 ASPHERICAL S.S.C. to the Canon FD 300 mm 1:5.6 S.C. The smallest aperture is not adjusted for. The camera always displays apertures up to f/22, but with a red line down to f/16, to remind the user that some lenses, like the Canon FD 50 mm 1:1.4 S.S.C. has its smallest aperture at f/16, while some, like the Canon FD 135 mm 1:2.5 S.C. can stop down to f/22.Later, when the Canon FD new lenses became available, the camera couldn't properly represent the new smallest aperture, like f/32. You had to estimate along the scale.The exposure scale also has a stopped down metering mark, where the needle should be aligned when using stopped down metering. Due to corrections taken for proper exposure with full sperture metering, stopped down metering with larger apertures than f/2.8 was not reliable.|$|E

In our research, we assumed that the higher the match load players achieve, the greater the impact of this load on the level of the <b>selected</b> <b>speed</b> abilities would be. We carried out a cross-sectional ex post facto research. The monitored group consisted of the players of the team playing in the first league (Fortuna League). Their average age was 22. 9 ± 4. 5 years. We conducted the measurements in the preparation periods during pre-season matches. We carried out a total of 63 individual measurements. We measured the level of the match load and the performance in 10, 20 and 30 meter runs from a standing start before the match and after the match. Except of outside defenders in 30 -meter run (W = 12; p = 0. 02) we did not confirm a significant impact of the match load on the level of the <b>selected</b> <b>speed</b> (acceleration) abilities. Its effect size reached from d = 0. 1 to d = 0. 6. In addition, the correlations between match load and performance changes in all three tests were nonsignificant (p ≥ 0. 5).

40|$|While {{speed is}} often cited as {{a major factor in}} {{collision}} experience, the relationship between speed and safety is very complex. While contributing to the severity of the collision, there is little evidence to indicate that travel speed is a cause of collisions. The desire to reduce the number and severity of collisions must begin with an understanding of the difference between driving too fast for the prevailing conditions, and driving faster than the posted speed limit. Although there has been considerable research on the effect of speed and speed limits on collisions, it is generally not clear exactly what measure or combination of measures influence the change in vehicle speed or the change in safety.
