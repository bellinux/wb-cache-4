The rate of chronic offending (offenders suspected of several offenses) is higher among indigenous Swedes than first-generation immigrants. Second-generation immigrants have higher rates of chronic offending than first-generation immigrants but lower total offender rates.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to study how contacts/relationships are established in prison, and whether this is of significance for co-offending. A further objective is that of studying co-offending among individuals classified as gang members. Data have been collected from the Register of Suspected Offenders for all individuals released from Swedish prisons {{over a period of}} six months (n= 3, 930). Data have also been collected for individuals deemed by prison service officials to be members of various gangs (n= 1, 310). Twelve individuals (four women and eight men) with experience of serving time in prison have been interviewed. The results of the register study show that it is uncommon for individuals who have spent time together at the same prison to be suspected of committing offences together subsequent to release. This was the case for two percent of the entire study population and three percent of the gang members. The co-offending of different gangs has also been studied by means of network analysis. There are substantial variations between different gangs as regards the proportion of <b>suspected</b> <b>offences</b> involving gang members and other individuals respectively, as reflected in both direct and indirect links. The interview study shows that there are different reasons for wanting to establish contacts/relationships with others. For some the intention is to maintain contacts of value for future crimes. A number of different reasons emerged however for why such contacts are discontinued. Inmates return to their old friends, they are re-arrested, women find themselves back in the worlds of men, a long time may pass between the individuals’ respective release dates, they may live a long way apart or drug use, leading to the breakdown of contacts as a result. The theoretical framework employed in the thesis proceeds from social exchange theory. For co-offending to take place subsequent to release from prison, the contact/relationship established in prison must be worth something. Trust, contacts with other criminals, the size of an individual’s criminal network, and criminal capital are all relevant in this context...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's (FSA) {{investigation of}} suspected insider trading offences is examined and analysed. The {{aim of the}} study is to describe FSA's investigative activity in insider cases during the 1990 ?s, a period of both increased activity on the Swedish stock market as well as changed regulation. The study places the investigation of insider offences into a wider context of regulation of the securities market. The empirical material consists of the chronological diaries kept in 344 insider cases between 1991 and 1999. The main theoretical theme in the study is case-processing activities in public bureaucracies, and the theoretical starting-point is sociological neo-institutional organization analysis, combined with an action-focused perspective of activities at the micro-level of organizations. Macro- and micro levels of organizational life are intertwined, and grass root level activities can be seen as parts of a transformation process where desicion-making in complex micro-settings contributes to the creation of macro-structures. Insider trading has gradually been subject to more extensive criminalization during the last three decades of the 20 th century, and the legal rules provide space for discretionary decisions. <b>Suspected</b> <b>offences</b> are sent to the prosecutor, since FSA has no authority itself to punish an illegal act. While a subordinate activity in terms of penal sanctions (the penal law perspective), the investigative activities at FSA can simultaneously {{be thought of as a}} proactive and transparency-achieving effort (the supervision perspective). The findings suggest that illegal insider trading should be thought of as a corporate phenomenon in terms of formal and informal rules about information handling and trading in the company's own securities, rather than an individually caused phenomenon disentangled from social and cultural factors. The investigating efforts at FSA are clearly made with one eye focused on the prosecutor and the possible successful prosecution of the case. The investigator often thinks the investigated behavior is highly inappropriate even though it cannot be proven illegal. While the private marketplaces have been given the main responsibility for the monitoring and detection of illegal behaviour on the securities market, the cases initiated by the marketplaces? own monitoring units often do not lead to referred investigations from FSA to the prosecutor. The majority of cases sent to the prosecutor are initiated by the FSA investigators themselves. An increased work load during the last years of the 1990 's resulted in longer investigation times, fewer requests for supporting information, and an increase in cases closed by FSA with reference to time-delay. At the same time a more selective and offensive investigative strategy was embraced by FSA, as a comparatively large number of cases were sent to the prosecutor after shorter periods of investigation. The underlying idea in the current securities market regulative model, with shared responsibilities among various public and private bodies, is that the different tasks in the process are possible to uncouple, given a functioning co-ordination between the market, the regulators and the prosecutor. The study points to institutional disparaties concerning both world views and incitaments that must be over-bridged in order to secure a functioning regulative order against market abuse. The findings stress that regulation is not merely a matter of how the law is written, but also how it is implemented in the every day activities at the micro-level of organizations...|$|E

40|$|The {{meaning of}} the rights {{enshrined}} in the Constitution provide a critical baseline for understanding the limits of government action—perhaps nowhere {{more so than in}} regard to the Fourth Amendment. At the time of the Founding, the Fourth Amendment prohibited the government from entering into any home, warehouse, or place of business, against the owner’s wishes, to search for or to seize persons, papers, and effects, absent a specific warrant. The only exception was when law enforcement or citizens were in active pursuit of a felon. 12 Outside of that narrow circumstance, the government was prohibited from search and seizure absent approaching a magistrate and, under oath, providing evidence of the <b>suspected</b> <b>offence</b> and particularly describing the place to be searched, and persons or things to be seized. Scholars’ insistence that the Fourth Amendment does not entail a general protection against government entry into the home does more than just fail to appreciate the context. It contradicts the {{meaning of the}} text itself, which carefully lays out the conditions that must be met by the government before it may intrude on one’s person, papers, and effects. Reclaiming this meaning is essential for understanding the scope of the original Fourth Amendment...|$|R
