40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} embodiment in a cohort of female <b>swimmers.</b> Relatively limited consideration has been given to body image in female <b>swimmers</b> and this study endeavoured to provide the first formal comparative insight into embodiment in adolescent <b>swimmers</b> and adult <b>swimmers.</b> Nineteen Scottish female <b>swimmers</b> took part in focus groups and interviews where they discussed issues related to body image; eight were adolescent <b>swimmers</b> aged between 14 and 18 [*]years and 11 were adult <b>swimmers</b> aged between 19 and 56 [*]years. The focus groups and interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. The analysis identified three body image themes associated with swimming: the impact of swimming on the body – muscularity but in moderation, body confidence as transient: age matters, and the influence of others. <b>Swimmers</b> developed muscular bodies that were considered contrary to the cultural thin ideal. There were clear differences between the different age groups in respect of the transiency of body satisfaction whereby adult <b>swimmers</b> transferred their swimming confidence into their social worlds but this was not the case for adolescent <b>swimmers.</b> Implications of the findings for coaches working with young female <b>swimmers</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{participation}} motives of youth athletes is vital if their needs {{are to be}} met and their sport involvement enhanced. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine {{the participation}} motives of a squad of competitive and non-competitive, youth-age, male and female <b>swimmers.</b> A qualitative interview technique was employed to identify the participation motives of 12 youth-age <b>swimmers.</b> The interview schedule was based on theories describing participation motivation, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Data was deductively analysed, with statements classified into the motivation categories described by Passer (1981). Consistent with previous studies on participation motives in youth sport, the <b>swimmers</b> cited multiple reasons for participation. Fitness was revealed to be the most important motive across the sample. Competitive <b>swimmers</b> were more competitively oriented than their non-competitive counterparts, while non-competitive <b>swimmers</b> emphasised improving strokes and excitement motives. Being in the water was an important motive identified by all non-competitive <b>swimmers,</b> indicating that they participate, in part, for the intrinsic joy being in the water brings. The motives cited by competitive <b>swimmers</b> suggest a more extrinsic motivational orientation, while the non-competitive <b>swimmers</b> are more intrinsically motivated. Male and female <b>swimmers</b> identified similar motives for participation. However, female <b>swimmers</b> identified stronger affiliation motives than male <b>swimmers,</b> who were more competitively oriented. Non-competitive male <b>swimmers</b> were notably more competitively and extrinsically oriented than their female counterparts. It is important that young <b>swimmers</b> 2 ̆ 7 reasons for participating, as well as the differences between competitive and non-competitive, and male and female <b>swimmers,</b> be identified, so that the needs of all youth-age <b>swimmers</b> can be realised and met...|$|R

50|$|Subcarangiform, Carangiform, Thunniform: These <b>swimmers</b> {{undulate}} {{the posterior}} {{half of their}} body and are much faster than anguilliform <b>swimmers.</b> At any point while they are swimming, a wavelength <1 {{can be seen in}} the undulation pattern of the body. Some Carangiform <b>swimmers</b> include nurse sharks, bamboo sharks, and reef sharks. Thunniform <b>swimmers</b> are very fast and some common Thunniform <b>swimmers</b> include tuna, white sharks, salmon, jacks, and mako sharks. Thunniform <b>swimmers</b> only undulate their high aspect ratio caudal fin, so they are usually very stiff to push more water out of the way.|$|R
