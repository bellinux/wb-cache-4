He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing.

40|$|Eleven {{species of}} Geothelphusa have been {{reported}} from southwestern Taiwan (Tainan, Kaohsiung and {{the northern part of}} Pingtung counties) : G. albogilva <b>Shy,</b> Ng, <b>and</b> Yu, 1994; G. ancylophallus <b>Shy,</b> Ng, <b>and</b> Yu, 1994; G. caesia <b>Shy,</b> Ng, <b>and</b> Yu, 1994; G. fili Chen, Cheng, <b>and</b> <b>Shy,</b> 2005; G. nanhsi <b>Shy,</b> Ng, <b>and</b> Yu, 1994; G. neipu Chen, Cheng, <b>and</b> <b>Shy,</b> 1998; G. olea <b>Shy,</b> Ng, <b>and</b> Yu, 1994; G. pingtung Tan and Liu, 1998; G. shernshan Chen, Cheng, <b>and</b> <b>Shy,</b> 2005; G. tsayae <b>Shy,</b> Ng, <b>and</b> Yu, 1994 <b>and</b> G. wutai <b>Shy,</b> Ng, <b>and</b> Yu, 1994. Comparisons of DNA sequences encoding parts of the mitochondrial large subunit (16 S) rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes revealed three major clades, of which one is the species G. ancylophallus, and the other two are species groups here referred to as the G. olea and G. pingtung clades. Geothelphusa ancylophallus is geographically restricted and adapted to an ecologically challenging habitat with an unstable water supply and uneven topology. The G. olea clade (G. olea, G. caesia, G. nanhsi, G. tsayae, and G. wutai) is widely distributed throughout central-western and southwestern Taiwan. The G. pingtung clade (G. pingtung, G. neipu and G. shernshan) is confined to southwestern Taiwan between the previously defined southernmost clades of G. tawu, G. albogilva, and G. ferruginea, and the G. olea clade to the north. It includes an isolated population on distant Chaishan Mountain near Taiwan Strait, which probably dispersed from the peripheral hills of the Central Range during the early Pleistocene. The available genetic evidence indicates that the differential coloration observed in members of the G. olea and G. pingtung clades is not reflected in mtDNA, appears to be dependent on environmental conditions, food, etc., and has little value as a taxonomic character. Possible geological events and climatic factors responsible for the historic isolation of the different freshwater crab clades in southwestern Taiwan are discussed in detail...|$|R

5|$|<b>Shy</b> <b>and</b> {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species {{is susceptible to}} being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E
