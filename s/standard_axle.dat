Carbureted engines came in , , [...] and [...] versions. As before, the base and optional units employed hydraulic lifters, a mild camshaft, forged-steel crankshaft, 10.5:1 compression, single-point distributor, and dual exhausts. The 300-bhp engine produced its extra power via a larger four-barrel carburetor (Carter AFB instead of the 250's Carter WCFB), plus larger intake valves and exhaust manifold. Again topping the performance chart was a [...] fuel-injected V8, available for an extra $430.40. The car's standard transmission remained the familiar three-speed manual, though the preferred gearbox continued to be the Borg-Warner manual four-speed, changing over to the Muncie M20 during the 1963 model year, delivered with wide-ratio gears when teamed with the base and 300-bhp engines, and close-ratio gearing with the top two powerplants. <b>Standard</b> <b>axle</b> ratio for the three-speed manual or two-speed Powerglide automatic was 3.36:1. The four-speed gearbox came with a 3.70:1 final drive, but 3.08:1, 3.55:1, 4.11:1, and 4.56:1 gearsets were available. The last was quite rare in production, however.|$|E

A deterministic long-term pavement performance model (LTPPM) is used to calculate exible pavement damage caused by traYcking from three realistic eets of commercial vehicles. The eets have been modelled using seven-axle group models representing steer axles, drive axles (single or tandem) and trailer axles (tandem or tridem) with either steel suspensions or air suspensions. Results are compared with the calculated exible pavement damage caused by a eet of 80 kN <b>standard</b> <b>axles</b> and predictions from the currently used method of traYc characterization for UK pavement design procedures. Results show that pavements that fail by rutting last longer when traYcked by the realistic vehicle eets compared with the eet of 80 kN <b>standard</b> <b>axles</b> whereas the pavements that are predicted to fail by fatigue last longer when traYcked by the eet of 80 kN <b>standard</b> <b>axles.</b> Results also show that current UK pavement design procedures are more sensitive to diVerences in the vehicle eet compared with LTPPM predictions...|$|R

40|$|Quantity road {{aggregates}} {{have become}} rare and costly {{in many places}} in India due to massive construction activities required {{for the development of}} new infrastructure facilities. The pavement industry looks for ways of improving lower quality materials that are readily available for use in roadway construction. Cement / lime treatment has become an accepted method for increasing the strength and durability of soils and marginal aggregates, reducing quantity of aggregates. Indian Roads Congress (IRC) developed a Special Publication (SP) for mix design of lime/cement treated base/subgrade. No pavement design guideline is presently available for cement/lime treated base. To overcome this problem, the objective of the present research work is to develop a pavement design chart using cement and lime stabilized base for rural roads with light to medium traffic (Traffic level up to 5 million <b>standard</b> <b>axles).</b> Based on this objective,the scope of the present research work is limited to develop a pavement design chart varying California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of subgrade and thickness of stabilized material as well as axle load repetition up to 5 million <b>standard</b> <b>axles</b> (MSA).

Results indicated that at known particular resilient modulus of stabilized base and CBR of subgrade, thickness of soil-cement base and that of soil-lime sub-base increase with increasing the allowable number of load repetitions.

40|$|Pavement design {{plays an}} {{important}} role in any improvement or rehabilitation. It is a responsibility of the road design Engineer to ensure that he has come up with an effective design, so that it will last for the design life. This effectiveness or the optimization is very important as otherwise it could lead to financial implications. The method adopted for the design of flexible pavements is the TRL, Road Note 31. The two main parameters considered in the design of the pavements under Road Note 31 are Cumulative Numberof <b>Standard</b> <b>Axles</b> (CNSA) (i. e. Traffic Class) and the sub-grade strength (i. e. California Bearing Ratio (CBR) % class). In this research study, flexible pavement designs of recently rehabilitated or improved set of roads were analyzed to check the effectiveness of the traffic forecasting on pavement design. As the subgrade strength of the pavements is a fixed parameter in all the cases, the only possible variable is the Traffic Class relevant to predicted CNSA. It was found in the study that the actual traffic growth rates of different modes of traffic which travels along the selected roads is different to the predicted rates at the time of design. It has also been shown and statistically proved that the Equivalent <b>Standard</b> <b>Axles</b> (ESA) values actually applied on these pavements by large trucks / heavy goods vehicles are significantly high, compared to the ESA values recorded at the design stage.

40|$|The present {{method for}} the {{structural}} assessment of flexible pavements {{was developed by}} the TRRL from data covering roads with cumulative traffic levels between about 2 x 10 ⁶ and 30 x 10 ⁶ <b>standard</b> <b>axles.</b> Almost all the data relates to well designed and drained sections, and {{there is a lack of}} validatory evidence for roads which have carried less than 1 x 10 ⁶ <b>standard</b> <b>axles.</b> This report describes the work carried out in extending the method to include lightly trafficked and undesigned roads and to assess the effect of groundwater movements on deflection measurements. Six deflectograph surveys over a three year period provided data for the definition of the relation between deflection and performance for over 400 km of lightly trafficked and largely undesigned roads. A technique for the determination of traffic loading using a portable weighbridge was developed. Information relating the variation of groundwater levels with deflection was obtained using piezometer installations and a deflection beam. Pavement construction was assessed by coring in the bound layers and in-situ and laboratory tests to determine subgrade types. Evidence to validate the use of the method on lightly trafficked and undesigned roads is presented, along with data which indicates that normally no direct link exists between changes in groundwater level and measured deflection on the roads investigated. Charts are given which allow the deflection-performance relationship and the overlay design procedure developed in the TRRL method to be used for lower traffic levels than was previously possible. A comparison is made between suggested techniques for the structural assessment and design of strengthening measures using the charts, with either the deflectograph or an alternative approach involving visual condition surveys and the deflection beam...|$|R

The GM version uses a paper gasket and the Ram version uses a re-usable rubber gasket. This attribute also makes the Dodge and GM axles appear very different, because of the different cover used.

Because of the gradients that the loco would face, Clayton provided two steam brake cylinders on the engine and a further one on the tender.In service, the cast iron brake blocks originally fitted wore very quickly, and Ferodo blocks were substituted.

40|$|Reliability {{of a road}} is {{mandatory}} since damaged will impede the traffic. Destruction is caused by various factors; {{one of the most}} important factors is excess load.

The approach estimates the quantity of timber that may be hauled through without critically damag-ing the flexible pavements. Seventy-two roads were classified on the basis of their surface conditions, subgradej material, and surface deflection as the strength parameter, for 40 and 60 t Gross Vehicle Weight. Using non-parametric statistical techniques, it was found that the surface quality of pavements was largely dependent on drainage conditions (co-efficient of determination rM 0. 841, and that a strong relationship (r = 0. 90) also existed between drain-age and the number of potholes. Pavements with peat subgrades were found to exhibit significantly higher critical deflections (5. 6 mm) than pavements with mineral subgrades (1 mm), coupled with their inherent variability, it is arguable that visual classi-fication may not be suitable for such pavements.
