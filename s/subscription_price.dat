40|$|Should a firm {{charge on}} a per-use basis or sell {{subscriptions}} when its service experiences congestion? Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per {{use for the}} service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion [...] raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with <b>subscription</b> <b>pricing</b> (by definition, with <b>subscription</b> <b>pricing</b> customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), {{and this is a}} disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that <b>subscription</b> <b>pricing</b> is more effective at earning revenue.

We show that the absolute advantage of <b>subscription</b> <b>pricing</b> relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. <b>Subscription</b> <b>pricing</b> becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e. g., some know they are "heavy" users and others know they are "light" users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates.

25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{was founded on}} November 23, 1901 by F.J. Wilcox under the name The Hamilton Herald in Hamilton, Washington. Wilcox envisioned rapid industrial development of Skagit Valley analogous {{to the development of}} the industrial region of Pittsburgh.

The industrialization of Skagit County fell below Wilcox's expectations, and in 1904 he sold the newspaper to an immigrant from Norway, Hans J. Bratlie who became its owner and editor.

500|$|In {{the early}} days, Greeley's chief {{assistant}} was Henry J. Raymond, who {{a decade later}} founded The New York Times. To place the Tribune on a sound financial footing, Greeley sold a half-interest in it to attorney Thomas McElrath, who became publisher of the Tribune (Greeley was editor) and ran the business side. Politically, the Tribune backed Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, who had unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination that fell to Harrison, and supported Clay's American System for development of the country. [...] Greeley {{was one of the}} first newspaper editors to have a full-time correspondent in Washington, an innovation quickly followed by his rivals. Part of Greeley's strategy was to make the Tribune a newspaper of national scope, not merely local. One factor in establishing the paper nationally was the Weekly Tribune, created in September, 1841 when the Log Cabin and The New-Yorker were merged. With an initial <b>subscription</b> <b>price</b> of $2 a year, this was sent to many across the United States by mail, and was especially popular in the Midwest. In December 1841, Greeley was offered the editorship of the national Whig newspaper, the Madisonian. [...] He demanded full control, and declined when not given it.|$|E
500|$|The user {{base for}} the PlayStation 2 version was {{truncated}} initially because of limited sales of the PlayStation 2's hard drive and network adapters that were needed for the game. The Japanese release of Rise of the Zilart was the number one selling game when it debuted in 2003 with 90,000 copies sold in the first week. The Treasures of Aht Urhgan, released three years later, sold over 103,000 copies for the PlayStation 2 in Japan during 2006. In the United States, Final Fantasy XIs computer version sold 340,000 copies ($15.5 million) by August 2006, after its release in October 2003. It was the country's 51st best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. The Final Fantasy XI All-in-One Pack was number 36 and Wings of the Goddess was number 40 on the top 50 best-selling Xbox 360 games in Japan as of December 2007. For the AprilSeptember 2004 financial period, Square Enix saw online gaming, particularly Final Fantasy XI, sales increase by 101 percent and operating profit increase by 230.9 percent. Revenues held steady from subscription services {{in the summer of}} 2006; in the fall, however, Square acknowledged that online subscription revenues were [...] "unsatisfactory", despite the steady performance of Final Fantasy XI. In December 2003, Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that there were over 200,000 subscribers to Final Fantasy XI, allowing the company to break even and start making a profit. There were between 200,000 and 300,000 active players daily in 2006. As of August 14, 2006 the Xbox 360 version was the sixth most played game on Xbox Live. In June 2012, Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that Final Fantasy XI had become the most profitable title in the Final Fantasy series. While many MMOs have switched to some form of free-to-play, including World of Warcraft, the base monthly <b>subscription</b> <b>price</b> point for Final Fantasy XI has remained the same since its debut in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Sega's initial {{momentum}} proved fleeting as U.S. Dreamcast sales—which exceeded 1.5 {{million by}} the end of 1999—began to decline as early as January 2000. Poor Japanese sales contributed to Sega's ¥42.88 billion ($404 million) consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 2000, which followed a similar loss of ¥42.881 billion the previous year and marked Sega's third consecutive annual loss. Although Sega's overall sales for the term increased 27.4%, and Dreamcast sales in North America and Europe greatly exceeded the company's expectations, this increase in sales coincided with a decrease in profitability due to the investments required to launch the Dreamcast in Western markets and poor software sales in Japan. At the same time, increasingly poor market conditions reduced the profitability of Sega's Japanese arcade business, prompting the company to close 246 locations. Knowing that [...] "they have to fish where the fish are biting", Sega of America president Peter Moore (who assumed his position after Stolar had been fired) and Sega of Japan's developers focused on the U.S. market to prepare for the upcoming launch of the PS2. To that end, Sega of America launched its own Internet service provider, Sega.com, led by CEO Brad Huang. On September 7, 2000, Sega.com launched SegaNet, the Dreamcast's Internet gaming service, at a <b>subscription</b> <b>price</b> of $21.95 per month. Although Sega had previously released only one Dreamcast title in the U.S. that featured online multiplayer (ChuChu Rocket!, a puzzle game developed by Sonic Team), the launch of SegaNet (which allowed users to chat, send email, and surf the web) combined with NFL 2K1 (a football game including a robust online component) was intended to increase demand for the Dreamcast in the U.S. market. The service would later support games including Bomberman Online, Phantasy Star Online, Quake III Arena, and Unreal Tournament. The September 7 launch coincided with a new advertising campaign to promote SegaNet, including via the MTV Video Music Awards of the same day, which Sega sponsored for the second consecutive year. Sega employed aggressive pricing strategies with relation to online gaming. In Japan, every Dreamcast sold included a free year of Internet access, which Okawa personally paid for. Prior to the launch of SegaNet, Sega had already offered a $200 rebate to any Dreamcast owner who purchased two years of Internet access from Sega.com. To increase SegaNet's appeal in the U.S., Sega dropped the price of the Dreamcast to $149 (compared to the PS2's U.S. launch price of $299) and offered a rebate for the full $149 price of a Dreamcast (and a free Dreamcast keyboard) with every 18-month SegaNet subscription.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Helm's {{best work}} was done through the paper she edited, Our Homes, during {{the last six years}} of her life. She {{undertook}} the publishing of this paper in January, 1892, soon after the formation of the Woman's Parsonage and Home Mission Society; this was one feature of the enterprise that elicited criticism. There was no money in the treasury for it, and many insisted that the organization was not large enough to sustain a paper. She felt confident, however, that it would add to the interest and extension of the work, and {{at a meeting of the}} Central Committee in September, 1891, the decision was made and she took measures to arrange for its publication. She came to Nashville and spent a number of days with Mrs. Harriet C. Hargrove and Arabel Wilbur Alexander while she made arrangements at the Methodist Publishing House, and formulated her plans for the first issue of the paper. She decided to make her paper an eight-page quarterly, the <b>subscription</b> <b>price</b> to be twenty-five cents yearly. Upon her return to Louisville she prepared the first issue at the home of Mrs. George P. Kendrick. Three years later, in order to be near the Publishing House, she made Nashville her permanent home. Her financial management of the paper was such that within six months of the time it was determined upon to have a paper it was put upon a paying basis. She never allowed herself or her work to accumulate debts. In 1893 her paper was issued monthly, beginning with the August number. The <b>subscription</b> <b>price</b> was increased to fifty cents.|$|E

40|$|Between 2006 and 2011, daily print {{newspapers}} in the U.

However, contrary to the expectation that firms respond to softening demand by lowering <b>prices,</b> {{newspapers in}}creased <b>subscription</b> <b>prices</b> by 40 - 60 % during this period. In this paper, we explain and quantify the factors responsible for these price increases. We calibrate models of readership and advertising demand using data from a top- 50 U. S. regional print newspaper. Conditional on these demand models, we calibrate the newspaper’s optimal pricing equations, and assess whether the increase in <b>subscription</b> <b>prices</b> are mainly rationalized by: a) the decline in readers’ willingness to pay (WTP) {{in the presence of}} heterogeneity among subscribers, or b) the newspaper’s reduced incentive to subsidize readers at the expense of advertisers, due to softening demand for newspaper advertising. We find that the decline in the ability of the newspaper to subsidize readers by extracting surplus from advertisers explains most of the increase in <b>subscription</b> <b>prices.</b> Of the three available subscription options (Daily, Weekend, and Sunday only), <b>subscription</b> <b>prices</b> increased more steeply for the Daily option, a pattern consistent with the view that newspapers are driving away low valuation weekday readers while preserving Sunday readership and the corresponding ad revenues. Thus, our research augments theoretical propositions in two-sided markets by providing a formal empirical approach to unraveling the relative importance of the role played by agents on the subsidy and demand side in determining prices...|$|R
