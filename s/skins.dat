5|$|The {{afternoon}} draw {{consisted of}} <b>skins</b> play. Allison Pottinger and Margaretha Sigfridsson {{played in the}} women's <b>skins</b> game. Pottinger held an early lead after four straight <b>skins,</b> but Sigfridsson capitalized on missed shots from Pottinger to win the last four <b>skins</b> and the game. Heath McCormick and Niklas Edin played in the men's <b>skins</b> game, where a series of carryovers saw Edin winning the last skin, worth {{three and a half}} points, and the game. A mixed team of John Morris, Beth Iskiw, Ben Hebert, and Jessica Mair played Tom Brewster, Anna Sloan, Scott Andrews, and Claire Hamilton in the mixed <b>skins</b> game. Morris, who skipped against Brewster, held control over the game and limited Brewster in scoring. Brewster won the last point on a draw to the button, giving Team World an 8–7 edge {{in the first round of}} <b>skins</b> play.|$|E
5|$|The evening draw also {{consisted}} of <b>skins</b> play. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott {{played in the}} women's <b>skins</b> game, in which Jones dominated, scoring four <b>skins</b> and winning four points for Team North America. Glenn Howard and Thomas Ulsrud played in the men's <b>skins</b> game. Ulsrud played a fairly open game, forcing carryovers for five ends until a misfire from Ulsrud led to Howard making the cup-winning shot, scoring three points with a tap for two points. Ulsrud won the remaining points in the game on a draw to the button. A mixed team of Kevin Martin, Heather Nedohin, Marc Kennedy, and Laine Peters played Eve Muirhead, Greg Drummond, Vicki Adams, and Michael Goodfellow in the mixed <b>skins</b> game. Martin skipped against Muirhead and controlled most of the game, securing four points on four <b>skins</b> before Muirhead took the last skin. Team North America took a 10½–4½ point edge {{in the second round}} of <b>skins</b> play, giving them a CAD$13,000 bonus for winning the <b>skins</b> rounds.|$|E

40|$|Reproducing <b>skin</b> colors pleasingly is {{essential}} for photographic color reproduction. Moving <b>skin</b> colors toward their preferred <b>skin</b> color center improves the <b>skin</b> color preference. Two main factors to successfully enhance <b>skin</b> colors are: a method to detect <b>skin</b> colors effectively and a method to morph <b>skin</b> colors toward a preferred <b>skin</b> color region properly. This paper starts with introducing a method to enhance <b>skin</b> colors using a static <b>skin</b> color detection model. It significantly improves the color preference for <b>skin</b> colors that are not far off from regular <b>skin</b> tones. To enhance a greater range of <b>skin</b> tones effectively, another method that automatically adapts the <b>skin</b> color detection model to the <b>skin</b> tone of each individual image is proposed. It not only enhances <b>skin</b> colors effectively, but also adjusts the overall image colors to produce more accurate white balance on the image...|$|R

5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic <b>skins</b> or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These <b>skins</b> are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These <b>skins</b> can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E

5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and <b>skins</b> games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. <b>Skins</b> games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win <b>skins</b> by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the <b>skins</b> games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning <b>skins.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Skin</b> can {{be damaged}} by the {{environment}} easily. <b>Skin</b> cream is an effective and rapid way to moisten the <b>skin</b> by changing the <b>skin</b> surface properties. Rat <b>skin</b> and pig <b>skin</b> are common animal models for studies and were used as <b>skin</b> samples in this study. The nano- and macroscale friction and durability of damaged <b>skin</b> were measured and {{compared with those of}} virgin (intact/undamaged) <b>skin.</b> The effect of <b>skin</b> cream on friction and durability of damaged and virgin <b>skin</b> samples is discussed. The effects of velocity, normal load, relative humidity and number of cycles were studied. The nanoscale studies were performed by using atomic force microscope (AFM), and macroscale studies were performed by using a pin-on-disk (POD) reciprocating tribometer.

40|$|Background and Objectives: (Pre) {{cancerous}} <b>skin</b> lesions accumulate more protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) upon {{topical application}} of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) than the surrounding normal <b>skin.</b> This {{might be the}} result of a higher percutaneous penetration of ALA into (pre) cancerous <b>skin.</b> Study Design/Materials and Methods: ALA penetration through (1) healthy <b>skin</b> with intact stratum corneum, (2) healthy <b>skin</b> with reduced stratum corneum (i. e. tape stripped <b>skin)</b> and (3) diseased <b>skin</b> with dysplastic and thickened epidermis (chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin)</b> was determined in an in vitro model with hairless mouse <b>skin.</b> Results: More ALA had penetrated through chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> than through normal non-exposed <b>skin</b> after 8 hours ALA application. The amount of ALA penetrated through chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> was smaller than through tape stripped <b>skin.</b> Conclusions: The stratum corneum barrier function is less effective in chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> than in normal non-exposed <b>skin,</b> but more effective than in tape stripped <b>skin.</b> A higher penetration rate of ALA into (pre) cancerous lesions may be (partly) responsible for the greater accumulation of PpIX in such lesions.

5|$|The main {{threat to}} {{crocodilians}} {{around the world}} is human activity, including hunting and habitat destruction. Early in the 1970s, more than 2 million wild crocodilian <b>skins</b> of a variety of species had been traded, driving down the majority of crocodilian populations, in some cases almost to extinction. Starting in 1973, CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals, such as the <b>skins</b> of crocodiles. This proved to be problematic in the 1980s, as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa, and it was legal to hunt them. At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983, it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it was reasonable to sell the lawfully hunted <b>skins.</b> In the late 1970s, crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries, started from eggs taken from the wild. By the 1980s, farmed crocodile <b>skins</b> were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians. By 2000, <b>skins</b> from twelve crocodilian species, whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed, were traded by thirty countries, and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished.|$|E

40|$|The memory colour {{reproduction}} {{is an important}} factor in judging image quality of photographic images of real life scenes. As the most important memory colour category, <b>skin</b> tone was extensively studied for preferred {{colour reproduction}} in this research. The methodology to study <b>skin</b> colour preference was then applied to study the colour preference of two other important colour categories: green foliage and blue sky. There are three essential parts for preferred <b>skin</b> colour enhancement: 1) building a <b>skin</b> colour model to detect <b>skin</b> colours or <b>skin</b> pixels; 2) finding a preferred <b>skin</b> colour region or a preferred <b>skin</b> colour centre; and 3) developing an algorithm to morph <b>skin</b> colours toward the preferred <b>skin</b> colour region. This study for <b>skin</b> colour enhancement started with the mathematical modelling of the <b>skin</b> colour region for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The modelling of <b>skin</b> colours was then applied to adjust <b>skin</b> colours of test images for psychophysical experiments that were to determine a preferred <b>skin</b> colour region. Finally, the <b>skin</b> colour modelling and the preferred <b>skin</b> colour centres were applied to adjust <b>skin</b> colours of digital photographic images for preferred colour reproduction. Two approaches were developed to model the <b>skin</b> colour distribution for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The first approach was to model a local colour region for general applications. A convex hull is constructed to fit the geometrical shape of a local region, and then the convex hull is approximated with mathematical formulae. The formulations and data fitting are adjusted with interactive 3 -D visualization. The approach is flexible for fitting data gamut with various mathematical forms for different purposes. The other approach was to model <b>skin</b> colours with elliptical shapes. Three elliptical <b>skin</b> colour models were developed for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The first one is to model the <b>skin</b> colour cluster using a single ellipse ignoring the lightness (or luminance) dependency. It is simple and efficient, and the <b>skin</b> colour detection accuracy may be adequate for many applications. In the second model, the <b>skin</b> colour ellipse is adapted to different lightness so that the shape of the ellipse fits the <b>skin</b> colour cluster more accurately. The model is more complex to train and is less efficient in computation, but it is more accurate in <b>skin</b> colour detection. In the third method, an ellipsoid is trained to fit the <b>skin</b> colour cluster. It is almost as simple to train as the first model, but the <b>skin</b> colour detection accuracy is improved. Finally, these models were applied to train mixed <b>skin</b> colours, African <b>skin</b> colours, Caucasian <b>skin</b> colours, and Asian <b>skin</b> colours.

25|$|The surgeon replaces missing {{parts with}} tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, {{cartilage}} with cartilage, bone with bone, and <b>skin</b> with <b>skin</b> that best match the native <b>skin</b> color and <b>skin</b> {{texture of the}} damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, <b>skin</b> flaps are preferable to <b>skin</b> grafts, because <b>skin</b> flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal <b>skin,</b> better resist tissue contracture, and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient <b>skin</b> to allow tissue harvesting, nasal <b>skin</b> is the best source of nasal <b>skin.</b> Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal <b>skin</b> flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.|$|R

5|$|The <b>skins</b> of wild {{cats and}} other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the {{beginning}} of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar <b>skins</b> had its largest boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 <b>skins</b> in 1967, through 7000 <b>skins</b> in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem.

40|$|Background: Ultraviolet {{radiation}} exposure during an individuals' lifetime is a known {{risk factor for}} the development of <b>skin</b> cancer. However, less evidence is available on assessing the relationship between lifetime sun exposure and <b>skin</b> damage and <b>skin</b> aging. Objectives: This study aims to assess the relationship between lifetime sun exposure and <b>skin</b> damage and <b>skin</b> aging using a non-invasive measure of exposure. Methods: We recruited 180 participants (73 males, 107 females) aged 18 - 83 years. Digital imaging of <b>skin</b> hyper-pigmentation (<b>skin</b> damage) and <b>skin</b> wrinkling (<b>skin</b> aging) on the facial region was measured. Lifetime sun exposure (presented as hours) was calculated from the participants' age multiplied by the estimated annual time outdoors for each year of life. We analyzed the effects of lifetime sun exposure on <b>skin</b> damage and <b>skin</b> aging. We adjust for the influence of age, sex, occupation, history of <b>skin</b> cancer, eye color, hair color, and <b>skin</b> color. Results: There were non-linear relationships between lifetime sun exposure and <b>skin</b> damage and <b>skin</b> aging. Younger participant's <b>skin</b> is much more sensitive to sun exposure than those who were over 50 years of age. As such, there were negative interactions between lifetime sun exposure and age. Age had linear effects on <b>skin</b> damage and <b>skin</b> aging. Conclusion: The data presented showed that self reported lifetime sun exposure was positively associated with <b>skin</b> damage and <b>skin</b> aging, in particular, the younger people.
