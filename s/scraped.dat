5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be <b>scraped</b> away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen <b>scraped</b> into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E

40|$|Marking {{behaviors}} of jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) were investigated by linking sign from transect surveys to species, sex, and individual detected by camera traps along trails in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize. The most commonly encountered big-cat signs were <b>scrape</b> marks. These were produced by cats raking {{the ground with}} their feet. <b>Scrapes</b> were associated more strongly with presence of male pumas than with female pumas or jaguars of either sex. Scats found in <b>scrapes</b> were genotyped to species level and indicated that jaguars produced larger <b>scrapes</b> than pumas and that pumas {{were more likely to}} <b>scrape</b> with their hind feet than with front feet. <b>Scrapes</b> were spatially clustered along trails, indicating that individuals <b>scrape</b> in response to other <b>scrapes</b> in the same area. High <b>scraping</b> frequencies were not associated with the presence of specific individuals, suggesting that scrape-marking behavior does not signal dominance in this area...|$|R

For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate.

5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is <b>scraped</b> against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scraping</b> and {{excavating}} parrotfishes {{are well}} known for their marked differences in jaw morphology and feeding behaviour. Despite the importance of parrotfishes to reef systems and the well-known differences within the group, few studies have compared the functional importance of <b>scraping</b> versus excavating parrotfishes in shaping coral reef benthic communities. We compared the abundance, depth and dynamics of <b>scraping</b> and excavating parrotfish grazing scars on massive Porites spp. colonies along a reef gradient at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef. <b>Scraping</b> grazing scars were more abundant at most study sites than excavating scars. Excavating grazing scars were relatively rare but exposed more coral skeleton than <b>scraping</b> scars. Approximately 70 % of excavating scars had some degree of filamentous algal growth in the scar compared with just 5 % of <b>scraping</b> scars. <b>Scraping</b> grazing scars on massive Porites spp. completely disappeared after 2 mo whereas excavating grazing scars remained almost unchanged over this period. Groups of excavating scars were more tightly clustered, exposed more coral skeleton and presented higher algal cover than grouped <b>scraping</b> scars. The deep, long-lasting excavating scars probably provide more suitable sites for the settlement of benthic algae and other invasive taxa on coral colonies. In contrast, the abundant and frequent grazing scars of <b>scraping</b> parrotfish may represent a more constant drain on energy supplies for coral colonies. These results highlight the differences between parrotfishes with distinct feeding modes and indicate that they differently impact not only algal communities but also coral colonies...|$|R
