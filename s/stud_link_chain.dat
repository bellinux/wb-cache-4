5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic <b>Chain</b> Jacks and <b>Stud</b> <b>Link</b> Anchor <b>Chain</b> to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R

40|$|Mooring {{systems of}} {{floating}} structures consist of long lengths of chain, rope or wire, {{or a combination}} of these elements. As part of a station-keeping system, the mooring lines have to keep the movements of the structure to a minimum. The mooring lines have to withstand the loads acting on the moored structure in addition to loads acting directly on the mooring components. If a mooring line fails, the floating structure can lose station and cause severe damage to structures and environment as well as economic losses and loss of lives. Awareness of corrosion, wear, fatigue and relevant loading conditions during design will improve the design and extend the service life of the structural components. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} find out how mooring chains work as structural components. The theory part of the report includes a study of offshore loading conditions, different types of mooring systems, causes of mooring line failure, failure detection of mooring lines and fatigue. However, there is a special focus on mooring chains. Offshore standards and recommended practices provide common <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> designs and minimum mechanical properties of links, but in order to study <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> as structural components, the stresses and strains are of importance. Normal stresses in <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> are calculated analytical using classic beam theory and curved beam theory. In addition, three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element models are applied for a more detailed investigation on the stress distribution in <b>chain</b> <b>links.</b> The presented analyses are limited to chains subjected to pure tension, although torsion and bending due to interlink friction may occur. Both <b>stud</b> <b>links</b> and studless links are analyzed in the computer program Abaqus 6. 12. Mooring components as <b>chain</b> <b>links</b> enter in operation with a residual stress field created by the required proof test. However, traditional design of mooring chains does not consider the presence of residual stresses [1 - 3]. This study shows that residual stresses play an important role. When residual stresses are added to the operational stresses, the resulting maximum tensile stress is 3. 65 and 3. 30 times the nominal stress for <b>stud</b> <b>links</b> and studless links respectively. The maximum tensile stress is located at the link surface at the crown section. Such tensile stress concentrations at the surface of a material are unfavorable due to fatigue crack propagation. Both whole links and worn links are modeled with Abaqus 6. 12, using solid elements. The worn links have a reduction of cross-sectional diameter of 2. 6 % to 13. 2 %. Wear will reduce the cross-sectional area and cause some sharp edges, but at the same time increase the contact area. The positive effects of wear seem to surpass the negative effects of wear when the wear is moderate. </p...|$|R

40|$|Unpredictable {{fracture}} of round steel <b>link</b> <b>chains</b> reduce the economic {{efficiency of the}} machines they are used in and increase the hazard potential for the operating personnel. In order to reduce such incidents appropriate measures for early detection are needed to determine an optimum time of repair or replacement. By steadily increasing strain, the currently applied, discontinuous and manually performed control processes does not present a satisfactory solution. They should be supplemented with new, {{the current state of}} the art considering approaches. This thesis addresses these issues and depicts the evaluation results of an individually developed measurement system for chains including the acquisition and processing of lifetime related variables. The focus hereby lies on standardized round steel <b>link</b> <b>chains,</b> which are preferably used in mining or in the hoisting equipment. Relevant damages to chains can be largely attributed to mechanical overstress of the base material. Typical damage patterns are fatigue fractures and forced fractures that are favoured depending on the environmental conditions, through wear and corrosion. As well-proven approach to estimate the remaining lifetime, the method of calculation of service strength was established. In adaptation to the use case chain, a component specific S-N curve and a nominal-stress-time-curve associated to collective stress are required. Subsequently, both are linked by the linear damage accumulation hypothesis. The chain specific S-N curve was created on the basis of previous trials of WBK Seilprüfstelle. The conducted dynamic fatigue trials respect a wide range of standardized chain sizes and rely on two different load assumptions. Thus a weighted consideration of the real load conditions is possible. By using the two parametric Markov counting algorithm, the collective normal stress will be calculated. Essential for this is an accurate load-time-curve that comprises of the real surrounding conditions precisely. For an accurate determination of the replacement state, the generated collective must represent the complete history of the <b>chain</b> <b>link.</b> This important requirement can only be achieved by a constantly working measurement system, which is directly connected to the focused link over the entire service life. A market research concerning established and free accessible measurement systems for chains revealed no satisfactory solution also complying with the elaborate chain specific requests. For this purpose, the development of a customized measurement system was focus of the public funded research project i-MaSS (integrated machine sensor system). For the integration of the miniaturized and energy-efficient prototypes in the chain strand, customized adapters are required. With regard to the minimal installation space available a conceptual division respective to the layout took place here. For chains with a wire gauge ≥ 30 mm (preferable mining chains) the developed adapter element looks like a <b>stud</b> <b>chain</b> <b>link</b> with a borehole in the middle. Wire gauges < 30 mm (e. g. hoisting chains) can not house the measurement systems directly as a consequence of the filigree geometry. In this regard an alternative solution was designed which can be mounted in the flow of force at the end of the chain strand. The testing of each adapter variant was performed on different test rigs for mining and hoisting chains separately. For the considered use case mining chain static test series were carried on a horizontally operating tension testing machine; dynamic analyses on a close to reality but unloaded armoured face conveyor test bench. The results obtained depict a linear and reproducible transmission behaviour of the complete measurement chain. The for chain hoists designed concept was trialled on a seven meter high test tower under realistic conditions. Hereby, the performed static and dynamic test series reveal a satisfying transmission behaviour, which is furthermore repeatable and analytically traceable. All test bench trials achieved acceptable results for both developed measurement concepts. Therefore, they can be used as a practicable tool for determining the load-time-curve of adequate quality. In conjunction with the deduced and for chains adapted calculation of service strength, it is now possible to estimate the remaining life time of standardized round <b>link</b> <b>chains</b> of different size more precisely...|$|R
