5|$|By the Hellenistic period, {{it became}} common for Greek states {{to finance the}} {{development}} and proliferation of ever more powerful torsion <b>siege</b> engines, naval ships, and standardized designs for arms and armor. Under PhilipII and Alexander the Great, improvements were made to <b>siege</b> artillery such as bolt-shooting ballistae and <b>siege</b> engines such as huge rolling <b>siege</b> towers. E.W.Marsden and M.Y.Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his successor Demetrius I of Macedon had the most powerful <b>siege</b> artillery of the Hellenistic world {{at the end of}} the 4thcenturyBC. The <b>siege</b> of Salamis, Cyprus, in 306BC necessitated the building of large <b>siege</b> engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of West Asia. The <b>siege</b> tower commissioned by DemetriusI for the Macedonian <b>Siege</b> of Rhodes (305–304 BC) and manned by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine stories. It had a base of , eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots, three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire, and mechanically opened windows (shielded with wool-stuffed leather curtains to soften the blow of ballistae rounds) of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.|$|E
5|$|Naim Frashëri, a {{prominent}} Albanian poet, wrote {{of how the}} <b>siege</b> of Krujë had saved Europe from Ottoman invasion. Today, Albanians take pride in the actions performed during the <b>siege.</b> The Skanderbeg Museum, in Krujë, has many commemorations to the <b>siege</b> and the film Skënderbeu (1953) stages the <b>siege.</b> It is {{the setting of the}} novel The <b>Siege</b> by Albanian writer Ismail Kadare.|$|E
5|$|The <b>siege</b> was the {{inspiration}} for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's original 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much; the whole story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film The <b>Siege</b> of Sidney Street. The <b>siege</b> was also the fictional inspiration for two novels, The <b>Siege</b> of Sidney Street (1960) by F Oughton and A Death Out of Season (1973) by Emanuel Litvinoff.|$|E
50|$|During French colonial rule, Pondichéry {{settlement}} had a {{total of}} 102 <b>Sièges.</b> Pondichéry commune had 18 <b>Sièges</b> while other 7 communes had 12 <b>Sièges</b> each. Karikal settlement had 74 <b>Sièges.</b> Chandernagore Municipality had 24 wards, Mahé Municipalité had 12 <b>Sièges</b> and Yanaon Municipalité had 12 <b>Sièges.</b> Then, they were called previously as <b>Sièges</b> instead of wards.|$|R

5|$|After Richard's death, King John of England {{failed to}} {{effectively}} defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. Château de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, {{as well as}} castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid <b>siege</b> to Château Gaillard, which was captured after a long <b>siege</b> from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the <b>siege</b> throughout the winter and King John {{made no attempt to}} relieve the castle, {{it was only a matter}} of time before the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the <b>siege</b> is Philippidos, a poem by William the Breton, Philip's chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention to the fate of the civilians of Les Andelys during the <b>siege.</b>|$|E
5|$|After some {{territorial}} disputes, {{war broke}} out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of Raška, {{and the city of}} Dubrovnik, at that time under Norman suzerainty. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid <b>siege</b> to it, but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the <b>siege</b> ultimately failed. How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while repelling the <b>siege</b> is also not known exactly.|$|E
5|$|An {{even greater}} Swedish force of 5000 {{soldiers}} (of which 3000 were cavalry) under Lars Kagg, Gustaf Horn and Harald Stake laid <b>siege</b> to Frederikshald in January 1660. They captured some forward defensive positions, but {{the sudden death of}} Charles X on February 13 was a probable cause for lifting the <b>siege</b> February 22.|$|E

5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to <b>siege</b> engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective <b>siege</b> engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred <b>siege</b> weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>siege</b> of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels {{to protect}} the soldiers and sappers as they {{went back and forth}} from the camp to the <b>siege</b> works. These included two <b>siege</b> towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds {{to protect the}} approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in <b>siege</b> technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay <b>siege.</b> It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long <b>siege</b> could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, <b>siege</b> castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the <b>siege</b> ended one way or another.|$|E
50|$|By 1142 {{both sides}} had become {{cautious}} of risking open battle, {{and the civil}} war became a war of <b>sieges</b> as each side attempted to capture strongholds held by the other. With Matilda's strongholds mainly confined to south west England, most of the <b>sieges</b> took place around that area.|$|R

5|$|In 1534, the Ottomans under Mihalbegović laid a months-long <b>siege</b> with a {{constant}} concentrated cannonade to the fortress. Ferdinand urged the Pope to send ships {{to relieve the}} Ottoman <b>siege.</b> Although the Ottomans eventually lifted the <b>siege,</b> Ferdinand was displeased that the Pope had provided no assistance {{in the defense of}} the fortress. In 1535, the Ottomans tried to seize the fortress by treachery, and again in 1536, but they failed on both occasions. During that year the Ottomans started a new <b>siege</b> which would last until the final fall of the fortress.|$|E

Following that he participated in the long and inconclusive <b>Siege</b> of Pskov, which ended with the Peace of Yam-Zapolsky in 1582. Though Zamoyski failed to capture Pskov, he drained the Russian resources, and the ongoing <b>siege</b> was {{a major reason for}} the final treaty, which was highly favorable to Poland.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} of sophistication in <b>siege</b> warfare and had developed a range of <b>siege</b> machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit-and-run tactics that destroyed Antony's <b>siege</b> train in 36BC. The situation changed with the rise of the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, <b>siege</b> towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sasanian siegecraft, military engineering, and organization, as well as ability to build defensive works.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} this was that English castle sieges grew in {{complexity}} and scale. During the First Barons' War from 1215 to 1217, the prominent sieges of Dover and Windsor Castle showed the ability of more modern designs to withstand attack; King John's successful <b>siege</b> of Rochester required an elaborate and sophisticated assault, reportedly costing around 60,000 marks, or £40,000. The <b>siege</b> of Bedford Castle in 1224 required Henry III to bring <b>siege</b> engines, engineers, crossbow bolts, equipment and labourers from across all of England. The <b>Siege</b> of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, during the Second Barons' War, was larger and longer still. Extensive water defences withstood the attack of the future Edward I, despite the prince targeting the weaker parts of the castle walls, employing huge <b>siege</b> towers and attempting a night attack using barges brought from Chester. The costs of the <b>siege</b> exhausted the revenues of ten English counties. Sieges in Scotland were initially smaller in scale, with the first recorded such event being the 1230 <b>siege</b> of Rothesay Castle where the besieging Norwegians were able {{to break down the}} relatively weak stone walls with axes after only three days. When Edward I invaded Scotland he brought with him the <b>siege</b> capabilities which had evolved south of the border: Edinburgh Castle fell within three days, and Roxburgh, Jedburgh, Dunbar, Stirling, Lanark and Dumbarton castles surrendered to the king. Subsequent English sieges, such as the attacks on Bothwell and Stirling, again used considerable resources including giant <b>siege</b> engines and extensive teams of miners and masons.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{began the}} <b>siege,</b> but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to take it, and the <b>siege</b> dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the <b>siege</b> when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the <b>siege</b> as quickly as possible.|$|E
