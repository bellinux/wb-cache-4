40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} the interfacial shear strength {{for the system}} sisal polypropylene, regarding {{the presence of a}} compatibilizer (maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene) as well as the grade of polypropylene, namely two homopolymers with different flow behaviour. Composites containing different concentrations of sisal fibre and compatibilizer were produced using a co-rotating twin screw extruder and subsequently injection moulded to retrieve test specimens. These specimens were investigated for tensile and notched impact properties, as well as the final fibre length in the composites was determined. With this data, a simple rule of mixtures model was applied to evaluate the tensile strength and notched impact strength for the interfacial shear strength. Further, <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> pull out tests have been carried out with sisal fibres from polypropylene. Data for interfacial shear strength, acquired by the <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> pull out tests fit the data acquired by the evaluation of the mechanical testing very well. Furthermore the presence of a compatibilizer improves the interfacial shear strength, as well as the polypropylene grade shows an influence, which is also found from the <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> pull out tests. In conclusion this shows good applicability of <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> pull out tests for estimating composite properties. However, one has to keep in mind several influences, due fibre orientation and processing method, when comparing the results from macromechanical measurements with <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> pull out tests. 1...|$|R

The results showed that 1) the TS increased with the decrease of the diameter of individual test pieces, due possibly to the stacks of multiple <b>single</b> <b>fibres</b> within the test pieces; 2) shear failure between <b>single</b> <b>fibres</b> in a test pieces {{played a significant role in}} the test results; 3) the TS was closely related to the number of both the inherent joints along the <b>fibre</b> length and <b>single</b> <b>fibres</b> contained in the test pieces; 4) the splits along the length and width of hemp fibres may complicate the test results, and 5) the optimized treatment prior to decortications may double the TS of hemp fibres compared to a normal retting processing. Reliable TS of <b>single</b> hemp <b>fibres</b> have been derived by a power regression, and the predicted TS were verified with an excellent agreement with experimentally tested results.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> stress-strain properties to variations in staple strength induced by both selective breeding for staple strength and nutritional manipulation. Merino weaners (n = 40), selected from ‘sound’ and ‘tender’ lines of staple strength selection flocks, were allocated to feeding regimes designed to induce liveweight changes simulating typical Mediterranean seasonal changes. Average staple strength differed by 5 N/ktex between ‘sound’ and ‘tender’ selection flocks and 18 N/ktex between extreme nutritional treatments. The force-extension properties of individual wool fibres (n = 100 per sheep) were measured using a <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> strength meter. After normalising for differences in fibre cross-sectional area {{at the point of}} break, the key parameters used to describe the stress-strain curve for each fibre were: Young’s modulus (GPa), yield stress (MPa), stress at 15 % strain (MPa), stress at break (MPa), strain at break (%) and work to break (MPa). The average stress-strain properties of <b>single</b> <b>fibres</b> differed widely between individual sheep. Stress at break ranged from 163 to 235 MPa (44 % range), strain at break ranged from 21 to 44 % (103 % range) and work to break from 43 to 71 MPa (65 % range). There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> properties between the staple strength selection flocks, nor was there any significant interaction (P > 0. 05) between staple strength selection flock and nutritional regimes. Nutritional regime had a significant effect on stress at break, strain at break and work to break, but none of the <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> stress-strain properties removed any appreciable variance in staple strength over and above that accounted for by differences in along- and between-fibre diameter variation. There appears to be little scope for improvement of <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> stress-strain properties as a means of increasing staple strength in normal production environments. Selection directly for staple strength or indirectly using the fibre diameter variability traits is an effective method to improve staple strength. A. N. Thompson and P. I. Hyn...|$|R
40|$|The tensile {{properties}} of natural plant fibres are commonly determined by <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> testing. The cross- sectional area {{used to determine}} the modulus and strength is usually obtained by measuring the fibre width and using this as the fibre diameter {{on the assumption that the}} fibres are circular in section. While the assumption of circularity is reasonably true for synthetic fibres, it is not correct for natural fibres and this can lead to substantial error when determining the {{tensile properties}} of the fibres. The present study determined the tensile properties of 113 flax technical fibres using an experimentally determined fibre area correction factor to account for the non-circularity of the fibres. The data was then compared with that obtained from back-calculation of the results obtained from longitudinal tensile testing of flax/vinyl ester unidirectional composites manufactured from the same material as that used for the <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> tests. Account was taken of the effect of fibre length on strength. The experimentally determined fibre area correction factor was found to be 2. 70.

During prolonged activity the jitter increased and blockings occurred more and more frequently. The size of the jitter and the degree of blocking also depended on the discharge rate. At a low rate the jitter was lower and the degree of blocking less than at the high rate.

40|$|International audienceThe fatigue of <b>single</b> {{thermoplastic}} <b>fibres</b> {{has been}} well documented to occur in a reproducible manner when they are subjected to certain cyclic loading conditions. The fatigue fracture morphologies of these fibres are very distinctive and differ markedly from other types of failure. This type of behaviour, which is clearly seen with the unambiguous tests on <b>single</b> <b>fibres,</b> must reflect behaviour of fibres in more complex structures which are subjected to cyclic loading. Only limited numbers of reports have, however, shown similar fracture morphologies with fibres extracted from fibre bundles embedded in a matrix material such as rubber. Usually the fractured ends of fibres taken from structures are seen to be shorter than those obtained in <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> tests and also they show more complex and confused crack growth. The present study reveals that the low thermal conductivity of the fibres, exacerbated when they are embedded in a rubber matrix, leads to very high temperature rises, which is not the case in <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> tests and under these conditions, crack initiation occurs across the fibre section instead of being restricted to the near surface region. Tests on <b>single</b> <b>fibres</b> at temperatures up to and beyond the glass transition temperature have shown how the fracture morphologies become modified. The fatigue process has been seen to become generalised throughout the fibre and failure occurs due to the coalescence of several cracks, some of which are initiated in the core of the fibre. In all cases, the cracks can be seen to have been initiated by solid inclusions in the fibres...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> {{composites}} using micro-Raman spectroscopy {{revealed that the}} primary interfacial degradation mechanism in graphite/epoxy composites after hydrothermal exposure is mechanical in nature. Mechanical degradation of the interface {{is the result of}} a complex state of stress created at the interface due to matrix swelling upon water absorption. The major component of such stresses is a radial tensile stress which causes a tensile failure of the interfacial bonds during exposure. To date, the effect of fibre volume fraction on the state of stress created at the interface due to matrix swelling has not been considered. In this paper, finite element analysis (FEA) is used to model bulk composites with different fibre volume fractions to determine the applicability of <b>single</b> <b>fibre</b> composite behaviour to that of bulk composites. The analysis showed that the mechanical degradation mechanism can operate at all possible volume fractions and that in the case of a non-homogeneous fibre distribution, regions with both very high or very low fibre content are more susceptible to environmental degradation.
