25|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralization of power relative to previous administrations. Modi personally selected the civil servants who served under his ministers, frequently giving them instructions without involving the ministers themselves. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policied frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances, or executive orders, to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. In 2014, the Prime Minister's Office prevented Gopal Subramaniam from being appointed to the Supreme Court. The stated reason was that his conduct in the 2G <b>spectrum</b> <b>allocation</b> scandal had been suspect: commentators stated it was because he had been the amicus curiae in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, which had implicated BJP leaders including Modi's aide Amit Shah. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

Raja's arbitrary action, [...] "though appear to be innocuous was actually intended to benefit some of the real estate firms who did not have any experience in dealing with telecom services and who had made applications only on 24 September 2007, i.e. one day before the cut-off date fixed by the C minister on his own".|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 By its nature, the {{satellite}} sector {{is the most}} “pan-European ” of all communications infrastructures and services. Unlike any terrestrial network, satellite networks can provide coverage to all parts of Europe. This strength of satellite networks, nonetheless, creates a great regulatory challenge. Due to wide satellite coverage, operators depend on harmonized <b>spectrum</b> <b>allocations.</b> The services that the operators provide depend on authorizations and <b>spectrum</b> <b>allocations</b> in each country of the planned coverage area. Frequency use, network operations, service provision {{and the use of}} radio terminal can be considered as the main elements which have been the target of a number of regulatory measures (licensing conditions and procedures) meant to help the development of satellite telecommunications and facilitate market access to satellite providers. This paper gives an overview of satellite regulatory framework in the European Union looking more particularly into measures for satellite licensing and authorizations adopted by the Italian administration. 1...|$|R

However, in January 2005, Antrix Corporation (commercial arm of ISRO) {{signed an agreement with}} Devas Multimedia (a private company formed by former ISRO employees and venture capitalists from USA) for lease of S band transponders (amounting to 70MHz of spectrum) on two ISRO satellites (GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A) for a price of , to be paid over a period of 12 years. The spectrum used in these satellites (2500MHz and above) is allocated by the International Telecommunication Union specifically for satellite-based communication in India.

40|$|Comprehensive and {{long-term}} spectrum reform {{can play a}} critical role in the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s development of a National Broadband Plan and in its consideration of Open Internet rules. More efficient and intensive use of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s spectrum resources would help provide a path to greater broadband deployment, competition and innovation for all consumers. Wireless and mobile technologies hold great promise to offer consumers new services to complement, extend, or even replace existing broadband offerings. A comprehensive review of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s spectrum policy is, therefore, necessary to ensure that wireless and mobile broadband services are not hamstrung by outdated rules or command-and-control <b>spectrum</b> <b>allocations.</b> <b>Spectrum</b> reform should include three main components. First, the FCC should focus on understanding how existing <b>spectrum</b> <b>allocations</b> are used currently while ensuring that all existing allocations are made available to providers in a timely manner. Second, the FCC should review its <b>allocation</b> and <b>spectrum</b> sharing rules to promote more efficient spectrum usage.

40|$|Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release 8 of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) was {{developed}} to provide extensive support for deployment {{in a variety of}} <b>spectrum</b> <b>allocations,</b> ranging from 1. 4 MHz to 20 MHz, for both paired and unpaired bands. For system bandwidth beyond 20 MHz, the only reasonable way to achieve LTE-Advanced highest target peak-throughput rate is to increase the transmission bandwidth, relative to Release 8.
