5|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} principles <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the basic idea {{of the rule of}} law.

5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the widespread Greco-Roman {{myth of the}} descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|Löwig {{isolated}} bromine from {{a mineral}} water <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> his hometown Bad Kreuznach in 1825. Löwig used {{a solution of}} the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with diethyl ether. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for {{a position in the}} laboratory of Leopold Gmelin in Heidelberg. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.|$|E

5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} smaller {{architectural}} works within cathedrals {{which have the}} curvilinear tracery. These include the arcading in the Lady Chapel at Ely, which also has the widest vault in England, the pulpitum screen at Lincoln and richly decorated doorways at Ely and Rochester. Characteristic of this period of Gothic is elaborate lierne vaulting in which the main ribs are connected by intermediate ribs which do not <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the wall and so are not major structural members. The vaults of Bristol are the most famous examples of this style, which {{can also be seen}} at York.|$|E

5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair is loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong {{opposition}} to Silent <b>Spring</b> <b>from</b> the chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Company (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).|$|E

East of the Highlandtown neighborhood, MD150 turns east onto Lombard Street, which crosses over three rail spurs that head south to Canton; one line splits from CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, {{while the other}} two <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and are operated by Norfolk Southern Railway. The state highway's run on Lombard Street ends at Ponca Street; Lombard Street continues east toward ramps to northbound I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. MD150 turns south onto Ponca Street, a four-lane divided highway that has a ramp to southbound I-895 toward the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. The highway follows Ponca Street to the Greektown neighborhood, where MD150 turns east onto Eastern Avenue and immediately crosses over I-895.|$|E
5|$|The arch {{was built}} {{as part of}} the Temple Mount's massive western {{retaining}} wall, which forms its eastern support. The voussoirs <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> a row of impost blocks which were cut to produce a dentil pattern. There have been some theories which speculate that the dentils were employed as part of a system used to shore up timber forms used during construction. However, this was a common decorative element employed in the region at the time, and archaeologists have noted that in this region of limited forests it is much more likely that packed earth, rather than expensive timbers, was used to support the form on which the arch was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The choir, of five bays, {{was built}} between 1283 and 1315 {{to the design}} of Richard Lenginour, and is an early example of Decorated Gothic architecture. The piers have {{strongly}} modelled attached shafts, supporting deeply moulded arches. There is a triforium gallery with four cusped arches to each bay. The sexpartite vault, which is a 19th-century restoration, is supported by clusters of three shafts which <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> energetic figurative corbels. The overall effect is robust, and contrasts with the delicacy of the pinnacled choir stalls, the tracery of the windows and the rich decoration of the vault which was carried out by the ecclesiastical designers, Clayton and Bell. The choir stalls, dating from about 1380, are one of the glories of the cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII {{sold it to}} Sir William Sharington for £783, who {{demolished}} {{the abbey}} church and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So {{as not to be}} incommoded by villagers passing close to his residence, he is said to have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an octagonal tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by walking across the leads of the roof. In each chamber is a central octagonal stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house stands over the <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and the house now has various grand reception rooms.|$|E
5|$|The French grand {{plan called}} for two French armies to press against the flanks of the {{northern}} armies in the German states while a third army simultaneously approached Vienna through Italy. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push southeast from Düsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau's army an easier crossing of the Rhine between Kehl and Hüningen. According to plan, Jourdan's army feinted toward Mannheim, and Charles quickly reapportioned his troops. Moreau's army attacked the bridgehead at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops—troops recruited that <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the Swabian circle polities, inexperienced and untrained—which amazingly held the bridgehead for several hours, but then retreated toward Rastatt. On June 23–24, Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard. After pushing the imperial militia from their post on the bridgehead, his troops poured into Baden unhindered. Similarly, in the south, by Basel, Ferino's column moved speedily across the river and proceeded up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and into {{the southern end of}} the Black Forest. Anxious that his supply lines would be overextended, Charles began a retreat to the east.|$|E

5|$|The French {{plan called}} for its two armies to press against the flanks of the Coalition's {{northern}} armies in the German states while simultaneously a third army approached Vienna through Italy. Specifically, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push south from Düsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau’s army an easier crossing of the Rhine and Huningen and Kehl. If all went according to plan, Jourdan’s army could feint toward Mannheim, which would force Charles to reapportion his troops. Once Charles moved the mass of his army to the north, Moreau’s army, which {{early in the year}} had been stationed by Speyer, would move swiftly south to Strasbourg. From there, they could cross the river at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000-man inexperienced and lightly trained militia—troops recruited that <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> the Swabian circle polities. In the south, by Basel, Ferino’s column was to move speedily across the river and advanced up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and spread into {{the southern end of the}} Black Forest. Ideally, this would encircle and trap Charles and his army as the left wing of Moreau's army swung behind him, and as Jourdan's force cut off his flank with Wartensleben's autonomous corps.|$|E
