40|$|The {{transmission}} of remote sensed images across communication channels {{has become very}} expensive due to recent advances in satellite technologies that generate terabytes of data every day. Therefore, the data compression techniques involved in data transmission have attracted great attention. Current data reduction methods are achieved mainly via the compression of individual data set in the spatial and spectral domains. In this thesis, we introduce temporal domain compression by exploiting the temporal relationship (including correlation and mutual information) between successive images. Rather than transmitting a complete image to end-users every time, only {{the differences between the}} current and previous image data, after prediction models are applied, are transmitted for data updating. This is motivated by the requirement of many applications for the interpretation of remote sensed images gathered over a regular period, e. g., every day or every week. This thesis explores three prediction models for the effective data compression of images taken between two dates. Firstly, a <b>single</b> <b>linear</b> <b>regression</b> model is developed for the images which are affected mainly by system or environmental noise. When the images do experience small portions of real changes, outlier removal techniques for generating a prediction model for the majority of unchanged data are proposed. Secondly, when there are significant real changed pixels in the image, we propose a multiple linear mixture model to improve the regression, and the experimental results show that it outperforms the <b>single</b> <b>linear</b> <b>regression</b> model in these situations. Also, an advanced approach for managing low-correlated data with high mutual information is proposed in which a non-linear elastic model is developed, and a codebook is generated to link the brightness levels in the most closely related successive images. These three prediction approaches are incorporated with spatial and spectral domain predictions and a 4 -D compression framework is developed. Their performances are compared with those of the JPEG 2000 standard. Entropy is used as the compression measure throughout this thesis as it is an indicator of the potentially lowest number of bits required to transmit the compressed image. The study is conducted using both simulated and several real multispectral data sets for algorithm evaluation. The results show that the entropy of the residual is reduced considerably using the proposed methods...|$|E

40|$|Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) can {{be defined}} as {{defaulted}} loan in which banks are unable to form profit. Usually loans falls due if no interest has been paid in 90 days. This will reduce the bank’s profit if customer did not pay the interest. But, there are few ways for customer if they cannot pay the interest, such as reschedule their loans. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the relationship between the NPLs with interest rate, inflation rate and unemployment rate. There is an significant and insignificant relationship between interest rate, inflation rate and unemployment rate with NPLs. This research is appertained with commercial banks in Malaysia. Data were collected from secondary data which published by Bank Negara Malaysia from February 2006 - December 2010 in monthly. The technique used is <b>single</b> <b>linear</b> <b>regression</b> method to see the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) will be used as dependent variables and interest rate (INT), inflation rate (INF) and unemployment rate (UNP) will be used as independent variables...|$|E

A number of fifty-five classes of properties or activities of different compounds sets were investigated. <b>Single</b> and multi-varied <b>linear</b> <b>regression</b> models using molecular descriptors as variables were identified. The models with estimation and prediction abilities and associated characteristics were stored into a database. A data mining analysis using classification and clustering were applied on the obtained database for searching and extracting useful information. The methodology applied in searching and extracting for information and the obtained results are presented.

40|$|Correlation {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} between binding affinity data values from the literature and physicochemical molecular descriptors of two series of single point mutated canonical inhibitors of serine proteases, namely bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY 3), toward seven enzymes. Simple quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based on either <b>single</b> or double <b>linear</b> <b>regressions</b> (SLR or DLR) were obtained, which highlight the role of hydrophobic and bulk/polarizability features of mutated amino acids of the inhibitors in modulating both affinity and specificity. The utility of the QSAR paradigm applied {{to the analysis of}} mutagenesis data was underlined, resulting in a simple tool to quantitatively help deciphering structure-function/activity relationships (SFAR) of different protein systems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the macroeconomic factors that contribute to the non-performing loan in Malaysia. The variables used to examine the relationship with the non-performing loan (NPL) are interest rate(INT), exchange rate(EXC) and inflation rate(INF). The data were collected from databases derived from Bank Negara Malaysia and Department of Statictics Malaysia on quarterly basis from 2005 to 2015. In the process of findings there are few types of analysis were tested using E-views Version 9. 5, such as unit root test, descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, <b>single</b> <b>linear</b> regression,multiple <b>linear</b> <b>regression</b> and more. The results indicate that exchange rate is the only significant factor that determine the non-performing loan in Malaysia. However, this result was not sufficient to be used since there are few diagnostic problems such as autocorrelation problem, heteroskedasticity problem and others. For future research, it is suggested that the researcher should think an advanced method to clean up all the problem, get the easier data and others...|$|R
