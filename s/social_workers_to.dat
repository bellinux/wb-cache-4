25|$|Addams and Starr {{were the}} first two {{occupants}} of the house, which would later become the residence of about 25 women. At its height, Hull House was visited each week by some 2,000 people. The Hull House was a center for research, empirical analysis, study, and debate, {{as well as a}} pragmatic center for living in and establishing good relations with the neighborhood. Residents of Hull-house conducted investigations on housing, midwifery, fatigue, tuberculosis, typhoid, garbage collection, cocaine, and truancy. Its facilities included a night school for adults, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a gym, a girls' club, a bathhouse, a book bindery, a music school, a drama group and a theater, apartments, a library, meeting rooms for discussion, clubs, an employment bureau, and a lunchroom. Her adult night school was a forerunner of the continuing education classes offered by many universities today. In addition to making available social services and cultural events for the largely immigrant population of the neighborhood, Hull House afforded an opportunity for young <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> acquire training. Eventually, Hull House became a 13-building settlement complex, which included a playground and a summer camp (known as Bowen Country Club).|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who have an understanding of financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E
500|$|Bowlby's quotable remark, that {{children}} thrived better in bad homes than in good institutions, was often taken to extremes leading to reluctance {{on the part}} of Children's Officers (the equivalent of child care <b>social</b> <b>workers)</b> <b>to</b> remove children from homes however neglectful and inadequate. In fact, although Bowlby mentioned briefly the issue of [...] "partial deprivation" [...] within the family, this was not fully investigated in his monograph as the main focus was on the risks of complete or almost complete deprivation.|$|E
500|$|Periyar wanted {{thinking}} {{people to}} see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued {{that the government was}} not for the people, but, in a [...] "topsy-turvy" [...] manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage {{of a small group of}} people.|$|E

500|$|The inquiry {{heard that}} many of the councils were understaffed, underfunded, and poorly managed. The chief {{executive}} of Brent council said its social services department was [...] "seriously defective". The inquiry was told that many cases at Brent social services were closed inappropriately before inspection by the social services inspectorate, that children were being placed unaccompanied in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and that children in need were turned away. The inquiry heard how Edward Armstrong had previously been ordered not to work with children over his handling of a case in 1993. Haringey and Brent councils diverted £18.7 million and over £26 million, respectively, in the two years 1997/98 and 1998/99, from its social services department into services such as education, for other purposes; both underspent their budgets for children's services, totalling £28m, by more than £10m in 1998–99, causing a deteriorating of child protection services. The inquiry heard how Haringey council failed to assign <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> 109 children in May 1999, a short period before they took on Climbié's case. Again in January 2002, Haringey council failed to assign <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> about 50 children. Haringey council wrote a letter to Laming claiming that social workers who gave evidence were being questioned more harshly than other witnesses. Laming condemned the letter, saying [...] "I will not tolerate any covert attempt to influence {{the way in which the}} inquiry is conducted." [...] Mary Richardson, the director of social services at Haringey from 1 April 1998 until 31 March 2000, had been responsible for a restructuring of the department which, according to the union UNISON, had [...] "virtually paralysed" [...] the child protection service. She received contact from twelve senior practitioners and team managers criticising the proposals as [...] "potentially dangerous and detrimental to the people to whom we offer a service". Richardson provided no substantive response to the memorandum. She did, however, say in the inquiry that the blame lay on [...] "part of all of the line management responsibility". Gurbux Singh, the former chief executive of Haringey council (before becoming the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality), said that there was nothing he could have done to prevent Climbié's death. Garnham contrasted this with Rossiter's willingness to accept responsibility, saying, [...] "that willingness to acknowledge error is at least at the root, is it not, of progress?" ...|$|E
