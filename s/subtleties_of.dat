5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E

25|$|Some {{examples}} of his empirical results include showing that, despite the apparent {{freedom of choice}} in the arts, people's artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their social position; and showing that <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> language such as accent, grammar, spelling and style – all part of cultural capital – are {{a major factor in}} social mobility (for example, getting a higher-paid, higher-status job).|$|E

25|$|Don Dale, Style Weekly (May 21, 2001) — Maury Chaykin {{makes an}} {{excellent}} Nero Wolfe in A new series based on Stout’s books.

25|$|Of a {{firm and}} unselfish but abrupt and passionate disposition, Ashkenazi {{everywhere}} aroused the discontent and {{hatred of the}} rich and the scholarly. Extensive learning, keen intelligence, and exceptional linguistic attainments, all combined to make him one of the most distinguished men of his day. All his contemporaries, even those who knew him only {{as the head of the}} Klaus at Altona, unite in praising his profound learning, his astuteness, his clearness of exposition, which never degenerated into the <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the pilpul, and his absolute disregard for the influence of money. He would suffer serious deprivation rather than accept pecuniary assistance; and this characteristic, interpreted by the wealthy of that day as obstinacy and arrogance, became to him a source of much suffering and enmity.|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a little harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E

25|$|The {{dispute over}} Fadak was narrated in various sources, {{some of which}} became almost legendary. Among these is {{the tale of the}} famed caliph of the Arabian Nights tales, Harun al Rashid, narrated in the 16th-century work Laṭā’if al-Tawā’if The <b>Subtleties</b> <b>of</b> People, in which Harun is {{described}} as feeling regret over the denial of Fadak to Muhammad's family. Harun inquired about the boundaries of the oasis from a descendant of Fatima in order to return it to its rightful possessors. The descendent cautioned that after drawing the borders of the garden of Fadak, Harun would no longer want to relinquish it. Nevertheless, Harun pressed on. The descendant replied that the first boundary of Fadak was Aden, the second Samarqand, the third the Maghrib, and the fourth the Armenian Sea. These borders outlined virtually the entire empire of Harun. That Harun himself initiated the process of returning Fadak and was not pressed by Muhammad’s descendants reveals that in the Shi’i conception, worldly possessions are of little to no importance to Muhammad's family or to the authority of the Imams.|$|E
500|$|Mehldau's trio was, in Hobart's words, [...] "the first {{successfully}} to add post-Beatles pop into the jazz repertoire without trivialising either", and shifted the [...] "traditional emphasis on bravura technique and group dynamics [...] to {{a focus on}} <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> touch and where-my-fancy-takes-me musings." [...] Such differences in repertoire and approach became common in small-group jazz. His combining of right- and left-hand playing, {{moving away from the}} more typical right-hand dominated playing, also influenced pianists.|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} is concluded by an instrumental postlude. The musicologist Julian Mincham {{notes that the}} fugue deviates from the [...] "traditional alternating of tonic and dominant entries... as a rather abstruse indication {{of the lack of}} clarity and expectation amongst the disciples, Bach is hinting at this in musical terms by having each voice enter on a different note, B-flat, F, C and G and briefly touching upon various related keys. The music is, as always, lucid and focussed but the departure from traditional fugal procedure sends a fleeting message to those who appreciate the <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the musical processes".|$|E

500|$|The {{rationale}} behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain.

[...] Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: [...] "For Asda... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its Harry Potter offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched in a few more minds." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cello Concerto (1932) was Bax's {{first attempt}} at a {{full-scale}} conventional concerto. It calls for a smaller orchestra than he customarily employed, with no trombones or tuba, and no percussion apart from timpani. Foreman points to many <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> scoring, but notes that it has never ranked high among the composer's mature works. The Violin Concerto (1937–38) is, like the last symphony, in a more relaxed vein than most of Bax's earlier music. Cardus singled it out as [...] "unusually fine", although Heifetz may have felt it not virtuosic enough. The composer described it as in the romantic tradition of Joachim Raff.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Hand of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Meyer's prose seldom {{rises above}} the serviceable, and the {{plotting}} is leaden." [...] The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, [...] "Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the Twilight books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward is {{something more than just}} an escape into banal mediocrity. We deserve something better to get hooked on." ...|$|E

500|$|Variety did not so qualify its review. [...] " [...] one {{of those}} rare {{instances}} where none can review it, or talk about it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same breath as the actors and director." [...] Variety also praised the cast, writing that [...] "Karloff manages to invest the character with some <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> emotion that are surprisingly real and touching... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [...] a diabolic characterization if ever there was one... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly." ...|$|E
500|$|The plan {{behind the}} scenes was to create an {{intriguing}} visual signature. [...] To serve the <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of [...] "skewing" [...] the sets. [...] "What I've tried {{to do with the}} sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural," [...] Willet explained. [...] "Nothing that calls attention to itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness—the unsettling feeling that something's not quite right". [...] To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set—one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.|$|E
500|$|The {{scandal and}} court case {{have been the}} subject of factual and fictional publications. Most biographies of Edward VII contain some details of the scandal, but the first book to cover it in detail did not appear until 1932. This was Teignmouth Shore's The Baccarat Case, {{published}} in the Notable British Trials series and incorporating a full transcript of the case. In 1977 Havers, Grayson and Shankland wrote The Royal Baccarat Scandal, which was subsequently dramatised in a play of the same name by Royce Ryton; the play was first produced at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Ryton's work was also broadcast in December 1991 as a two-hour drama on BBC Radio 4. In 2000 George MacDonald Fraser placed his fictional antihero, Harry Flashman, into the scandal in the short story [...] "The <b>Subtleties</b> <b>of</b> Baccarat", one of the three stories in Flashman and the Tiger.|$|E
