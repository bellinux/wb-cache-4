40|$|AbstractRecovery of {{tantalum}} resource from used {{tantalum capacitor}} in electric equipment {{is important because}} the production of tantalum have not been stable for the price and the quantity. However, recovery of tantalum <b>sintered</b> <b>compact</b> from tantalum capacitor is difficult since the compact strongly covered with the flame retardant resin made of halogenated compounds (mold resin). In this study, steam gasification with sodium hydroxide was applied for recovery of tantalum <b>sintered</b> <b>compact</b> by destroying mold resin and stabilization of halogenated compounds in sodium hydroxide to prevent exhausting halogenated gas. Mold resin can be decomposed by steam gasification with NaOH to recover the <b>sintered</b> <b>compact</b> of tantalum. Furthermore, most halogen gas generated from decomposition of mold resin can be trapped in sodium hydroxide not to exhaust halogen gas. These results suggested that recovery process of tantalum <b>sintered</b> <b>compact</b> from the used condenser using steam gasification with sodium hydroxide is expected as a feasible way to recycle the rare metal in electric equipment...|$|E

40|$|Imperial Users onlyThis Thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the compaction and the sintering of ceramic powders within the context of their "near net shape forming" into dense bodies. The operation of near net shape forming is the manufacture of ceramic parts with a required external dimensional tolerance combined with a defect free internal microstructure. The current study considers these requirements by focusing upon the fundamental facets of near net shape forming operations. The effects of the processing and material parameters on the compaction behaviour of agglomerated alumina powders have been investigated experimentally. It has been shown that the green compacts, formed from the agglomerated alumina powders by the uniaxial die pressing technique, possess certain density distribution patterns due to the frictional forces during the compaction process, and these density distributions depend primarily upon the properties of the agglomerates and the lubrication state of the die wall. The density distributions in the green compacts have been determined experimentally using the coloured layer technique and predicted using a first order model. Due to the inhomogeneous density distributions in the green compacts, the shrinkage of the compacts was not homogeneous. As a result, the shapes of the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts</b> were not geometrically linear scaled replicas of the green compacts and the shape distortions in the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts</b> have been characterised. It has been shown that there is a relationship between the extent of the shape distortions and the density distributions in the green compacts; that is, the more inhomogeneous green compacts the more is the shape distortions in the resulting <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts.</b> <b>Sintering</b> and grain growth equations, modified from established relationships, have been used for the sintering simulations in order to predict both the progression of the density and grain size of the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts.</b> In order to predict the overall shape of the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts,</b> a first order model has been developed by combining the predicted density distributions in the green compacts and the predicted density of the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts.</b> The extent of the shape distortions have been reduced by optimising the properties of the agglomerates and the state of the die wall lubrication condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Stoichiometric nanocrystalline Ni 3 Al was {{prepared}} by mechanical alloying of elemental Ni and Al powders under argon gas atmosphere for different time (4 - 48 h). The nanostructured Ni 3 Al powders were consolidated into bulk compacts and sintered {{in a small}} DTA furnace under flowing Argon to observe the exothermic reaction between the stoichiometric Ni and Al. The estimated crystallite size showed that the mechanically alloyed Ni 3 Al grain size decrease from 127 nm to 9. 36 nm with increasing mechanical alloying time from 4 h to 48 h. Agglomerations of the powder particles prevalently occurred as observed from the SEM micrographs. Saturation magnetization, Ms value of the mechanically alloyed powders decreases as milling time increases due to smaller amount of elemental nickel responding to the applied fields.

As an example, existing furnace installation utilizing Linde Sinterflex(R) technology allows monitoring and/or controlling the furnace atmosphere. This article describes the reduction of oxides and carbon potentials to enable optimisation of the production parameters...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} a novel {{approach}} of fabricating harmonic structure in Al alloy {{through the application of}} semi-solid reaction between Al and Si. The harmonic structured Al was prepared by powder metallurgy route, where the Al and Si powder were subjected to controlled mechanical milling followed by subsequent spark plasma sintering to make a compact. The <b>sintered</b> <b>compact</b> resulted in a network structure of hard interconnected silicon dispersed region combined with Al-Si solid solution phase, known as “shell”, enclosing the soft phase of pure aluminum matrix known as “core”. The harmonic structured Al compact demonstrated retention of both uniform and total elongation as compared to its heterogeneous bimodal structure counterpart, which is the typical feature of the harmonic structured material. The application of semi-solid reaction between Al and Si in fabricating harmonic structure proved to be effective in improving mechanical properties of Al alloy. Present work also discusses the deformation behavior of the sintered compacts, with respect to its strain hardening behavior...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigated}} the isothermal holding time {{dependence of the}} densification, microstructure, weight loss, and tensile properties of Fe-Mn-Si powder compacts. Elemental Fe, Mn, and Si powder mixtures with a nominal composition of Fe- 28 Mn- 3 Si (in weight percent) were ball milled for 5 h and subsequently pressed under a uniaxial pressure of 400 MPa. The compacted Fe-Mn-Si powder mixtures were sintered at 1200 °C for 0, 1, 2, and 3 h, respectively. In general, the density, weight loss, and tensile properties increased {{with the increase of}} the isothermal holding time. A significant increase in density, weight loss, and tensile properties occurred in the compacts being isothermally held for 1 h, as compared to those with no isothermal holding. However, further extension of the isothermal holding time (2 and 3 h) only played a limited role in promoting the sintered density and tensile properties. The weight loss of the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts</b> was mainly caused by the sublimation of Mn in the Mn depletion region on the surface layer of the <b>sintered</b> Fe-Mn-Si <b>compacts.</b> The length of the Mn depletion region increased with the isothermal holding time. A single α-Fe phase was detected on the surface of all of the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts,</b> and the locations beyond the Mn depletion region were comprised of a dual dominant γ-austenite and minor ε-martensite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The use of {{precipitation}} chemistry to synthesize hydroxyapatite (HA) normally yields nano-crystals with various morphology and sizes {{depending on the}} synthesis conditions (e. g., temperature, concentration, level of agitation, pH, etc.). This study involved the synthesis of HA nano-rods/whiskers by modifying an existing chemical route for HA synthesis. The nano-rods were characterised for their structure and morphology and subsequently sintered. The mechanical properties of the <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts</b> were also assessed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSingle-phase {{orthorhombic}} Ca 2 Si <b>sintered</b> <b>compacts</b> were synthesized by {{the spark}} plasma sintering technique. The electronic structures and Seebeck coefficient of Ca 2 Si were calculated using the first-principles total-energy calculation program. It {{was found that}} the Ca 2 Si compact showed a p-type conductivity of ∼ 10 − 2  S/cm with an activation energy of 0. 13 eV, and the experimental Seebeck coefficient is larger than 250  μV/K from 373 K to 573 K...|$|R
