40|$|In {{the design}} of control system of a wind tunnel, it is {{important}} to understand the importance of operations of mechanical systems in order to ensure that any emergencies that may arise during the running of the wind tunnel are properly handled by the system. In the NAL 0. 6 m blowdown wind tunnel, it is proposed to incorporate a Variable Mach number Flexible Nozzle (VMFN), using which the tunnel 13; can be started at a low Mach number and the required test Mach number (up to 4) can be reached by continuously (on-line) changing the nozzle contour using an Electroservohydraulic drive. Before stopping the tunnel, the VMFN would be reverted to the initial low Mach number condition. During the entire operation of the tunnel in such a scenario, it is essential that the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) maintains the specified or minimum stagnation pressure in the test section by following a safe trajectory. In order to determine a safe trajectory, a basic understanding of the variation of stagnation <b>pressure</b> in the <b>settling</b> chamber is called for, before the PRV control system is designed. In this paper, the problem is 13; formulated based on quasi-steady isentropic equations and programmed in C language to predict the timehistories 13; of <b>settling</b> chamber <b>pressure</b> and storage tank pressure for a given trajectory of the opening of PRV, as the VMFN throat is changed from Mach 1 to Mach 4 condition and vice versa. In order to validate the present methodology, the PRV trajectory measured during an experiment in the NAL 0. 6 m 13; wind tunnel was used as input to the program and the measured time-histories of <b>settling</b> chamber <b>pressure</b> and storage tank pressure are compared with the predicted values. Predictions of <b>settling</b> chamber <b>pressure</b> and the storage tank pressure relevant to VMFN operation indicate that <b>settling</b> chamber <b>pressure</b> rapidly builds up towards the storage tank pressure, apparently due to the constriction offered at the VMFN throat as VMFN throat is changed from M= 1 contour to M= 4 contour during the 13; start of the run. Minimum PRV opening area has been predicted to maintain the <b>settling</b> chamber <b>pressure</b> 13; higher than the estimated minimum value at high Mach numbers. For smaller openings of the PRV (lt; 0. 065 m 2), the predicted pressure falls below the minimum and is hence unsafe. From the predicted time history of free-stream dynamic pressure (q), it is noted that alarming increase in q can occur during starting and stopping transients, which can damage a test model in the tunnel, balance and such other components. Therefore, {{the design of}} test object and support system need to be adequately designed...|$|R

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} method to {{estimate}} the electrical constriction resistance of two mating metallic rough surfaces based on the finite element method (FEM). The FEM-based method generates a random array of three-dimensional orthogonal parallelepipeds to simulate the stochastic distribution of the asperities across the contact interface. The effect of the contact pressure is studied in detail, since once the contact materials and the topology of the contact area are <b>settled,</b> the contact <b>pressure</b> plays {{a critical role in}} determining the electrical constriction resistance. The proposed model is based on two critical variables, the contact pressure and the surface roughness of the mating surfaces, which must be measured in the laboratory to calibrate the model. Results provided by the FEM-based model are compared with experiments for three geometries, thus validating the accuracy of the proposed approach. Although the apparent contact areas of the analyzed specimens have a rectangular shape, the proposed method is also applicable to determine the electrical constriction resistance of other geometries. It is also proved that depending on the pressure applied to the contact interface, the electrical constriction resistance can be almost independent of the apparent area of contact. Although the aim of this work was to generate an electrical constriction resistance model for power connectors, it is also applicable to many other power devices.

40|$|The fluid-structure {{interactions}} between a flexible web and an externally pressurized air cushion are modeled {{allowing for the}} possibility of contact. The web is wrapped around a porous, cylindrical turn-bar at an oblique angle (helically). The turn-bar supplies pressurized air into the web/turn-bar clearance to float the web. The shell model, developed to represent the mechanics of the web, allows it to be wrapped around the cylinder in a helical fashion. The fluid mechanics of the air in the web/turn-bar clearance is a two dimensional form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations averaged in the clearance direction and augmented by non-linear source terms. Contact between the web and the reverser, which is undesirable in a turn-bar application, is included in the model in order to enable the analysis of the limiting cases. The coupled equilibrium between fluid mechanics, shell deflections and contact is found numerically. This paper describes the theory. Case studies are conducted {{in order to understand the}} mechanics of the coupled system, and to make design recommendations. It is shown that the helix-angle has a strong influence on the equilibrium configurations: increasing helix-angle results in increased web-reverser separation, while the air <b>pressure</b> <b>settles</b> to a lower value.

Finally, a pipes network, under the chambers, ensures the downstream evacuation of the sand trapped in the hoppers. Using adapted and theoretically justified similarity laws coupled with realistic scales for the models, the hydrodynamic behavior and solid transport phenomena in this complex system have been studied.

40|$|Among the {{numerous}} tribes of Indians living in Oklahoma the Seminoles offer some interesting phenomena for study which may contribute {{information on the}} subject of race mixture and its relationship to environment and health. The early history of the tribe in its original habitat of the Florida Everglades is not without romantic color, embodying as it does the Spanish occupation of the Southeastern United States and the stormy times before and after the War of 1812 that culminated in the Florida purchase. Many other tribes besides the Seminoles were occupying rich lands that European settlers coveted for plantations so that agitation for removal of the Indians by coercion gained increasing favor. Slavery augmented the conflict since negro deserters were continually seeking refuge among the Indians, especially in parts that now constitute Georgia and Florida. It is recorded that as early as 1785 bands of Cherokees, Choctaws, Delawares and Shawnees began migrating west to <b>settle</b> because of <b>pressure</b> from whites along the borders of their old domain and the scarcity of game. The transfer of Indians comprising the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek and Seminole tribes from their indigenous habitat to lands in what is now the state of Oklahoma was carried on with continuous difficulty until after 1840.

As for the results about the relationship between the LOCA area and the time from LOCA occurs until the fuel temperature rise start, the effect that RCIC operated was extremely big for LOCA area of up to 100 cm 2 for both type LOCA. In the case of main steam system LOCA, the core water level suddenly decreased for large LOCA of 2000 cm 2 area, however, if the irrigation into the reactor core was carried out 30 min after LOCA occurrence, the core had little damage. In addition, the H 2 concentration in the containment vessel did not exceed both limits of H 2 explosion nor detonation. The pressure of the containment vessel was around 3 kg/cm 2 of design value, so the soundness of the containment vessel was confirmed. On the other hand, for the recirculation system LOCA of 2000 cm 2 area, a drop of the core water level was extremely in comparison with main steam system LOCA, and the fuel assemblies were completely exposed during up to 30 min. to the irrigation from approximately 100 sec. after LOCA occurrence. Therefore, the fuel temperature during the irrigation had reached approximately 1900 ℃. Thus, the fuel cladding were damaged approximately less than 10 %, and H 2 concentration in the containment vessel was approximately 9 % which did not exceed H 2 detonation limit of 13 % but exceeded H 2 explosion limit of 4 %. However, the containment vessel internal <b>pressure</b> was <b>settled</b> around design <b>pressure</b> value of containment vessel. As the results, some core damage could not be avoided, but soundness of the containment vessel, which should take the role of "confine", was found to be secured...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{spray rate}} {{controllers}} along with {{technologies such as}} automatic section control (ASC) provide benefits such as overlap reduction on agricultural sprayers. However, product (liquid) dynamics within the boom plumbing affect off-rate errors and application uniformity during rate changes and ASC actuation. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare nozzle flow stability and uniformity across the boom when using two different boom shut-off valves (2 -way and metered 3 -way) on an 18. 3 -m sprayer boom. Pressure transducers were mounted at 1) the boom manifold, 2) randomly at 12 nozzle bodies across the spray boom, and 3) upstream and downstream of the flow regulating valve. Effective system flow rate was measured using two flow meter(s), one located upstream of the boom control valves (2 -way or metered 3 -way) and another mounted to measure the tank return flow for the metered 3 -way boom valve. Measured nozzle pressure was converted to nozzle flow using the manufacturer’s pressure-flow data. Results indicated that the 2 -way boom versus metered 3 -way valve response was significantly different. Significant differences in damping ratios were found when exiting (under-damped) and reentering (over-damped) of spray zones. For the metered 3 -way boom valve configuration, nozzle flow settled faster (0. 1 to 4. 2 s) virtually eliminating off-rate errors whereas the 2 -way boom valve configuration took up to 34. 3 s to settle with off-rate errors ranging from 3. 3 % to 11. 5 %. The delayed nozzle flow settling times were associated with <b>pressure</b> <b>settling</b> (0. 7 to 31. 4 s) downstream of the regulating valve for the 2 -way configuration. Ground speed and point row angle impacted nozzle flow settling times and off-rate errors. The increase in ground speed and point row angle increased nozzle flow settling time for the 2 -way valve setup, except that acceleration decreased settling times when exiting spray zones. The delayed response contributed to off-rate time which decreased as the sprayer accelerated and point row angle decreased for both the 2 -way (1. 7 to 19. 3 s) and metered 3 -way (2. 1 to 4. 4 s) boom shut-off valve setups...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1997 Dr. Matthew Daryl GreenThe concentration of fine particle suspensions is a crucial step in many industrial processes, two major processes that depend on this are the disposal of mine tailings as highly concentrated slurries, and the wet casting of ceramic components from highly concentrated suspensions. The thickening and filtration operations in these processes are still not completely understood. The successful design and operation consolidation equipment {{must be based on}} the properties of the target suspension. The quantitative characterisation of suspensions in settling and compression was the prime objective of this thesis. In a general consolidation model, the behaviour of suspensions in settling and con 1 pression is fully defined by two parameters; the compressive yield stress function and the hindered settling function. The compressive yield stress quantifies the strength of the suspension network in compression and determines the maximum concentration achievable for any given applied force. The hindered settling function quantifies the hydrodynamic drag forces experienced by consolidating particles in the suspension and determines the settling velocity and the time scale for the consolidation process. These suspension consolidation parameters were determined using a variety of techniques. For measurement of the compressive yield stress, two centrifuge based techniques and a pressure filtration technique were evaluated both independently and with each other - with good results. It was thus verified that the compressive yield stress is a material property of suspensions in compression. For measurement of the hindered <b>settling</b> function, two <b>pressure</b> filtration techniques were developed using a custom built apparatus. Measurements were successfully made using these techniques for the first time. The materials used in the study were three aqueous metal oxide suspensions systems; Zr 02, Ti 02 and A 120 3. The shear and compression rheology of these systems is fully controlled by manipulation of the particle surface chemistry which changes the suspension micro-structure. The validity of the general consolidation model was systematically studied using suspensions prepared under various conditions. Factors studied were the effects of flocculation state, initial concentration, steric stabilisation, suspension preparation methods and prior shear and compression history. These factors affected the compression rheology to varying degrees and were quantified. The conditions for maximum consolidation were determined. A correlation between shear and compression rheology also generated a useful empirical relationship {{that can be used in}} design and operation of consolidation equipment. Finally, the measurement of the compressive yield stress and hindered settling function of a suspension was applied to the prediction of the concentration profile and sediment height in an operating continuous thickener. With some refinement, the model and techniques used in this study are a viable means for design and optimisation of continuous thickeners based on the material properties of the suspension.

40|$|Discharging {{untreated}} wastewater will {{contaminate the}} surface waters {{and can lead}} to spread of diseases and long term ecological damage. The most common method for treatment is by the activated sludge process. In this process, nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus and COD are removed by bacteria grown in flocs. These bacterial flocs are separated from the treated water by settling. Due to the slow settling velocities of these flocs large settling tanks are needed. Settling tanks take up most of the required space for a wastewater treatment plant. Aerobic granular sludge is a compact technology designed to reduce area requirements, save energy while providing excellent effluent quality. Bacteria are grown in granules instead of flocs and have therefore a much higher settling velocity. This reduces the area requirement significantly. So much even so, that external settling tanks are completely omitted. To grow aerobic granules a few selection principles are needed. First, the influent is brought in contact with the biomass in an anaerobic environment. Here COD is converted by the bacteria into storage polymers. These storage polymers are then used for growth in the presence of oxygen hereby removing phosphorus and nitrogen from the bulk liquid. Secondly, a <b>settling</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied by which slow settling biomass is removed from the reactor, thus leading to the formation of granules. In previous research by the PhD students Janneke Beun (principle of aerobic granulation), Merle de Kreuk (basic process technology for granular sludge nutrient removal) and Mari Winkler and Joao Bassin (Microbiology and process engineering aspects of granular sludge) the basic concepts of the granular sludge technology were worked out. In this thesis the effects of several operational conditions on the conversion processes, formation and stability of aerobic granular sludge was studied. The quick implementation of the technology in practice also meant that several important subjects still needed further investigation. To ensure a well-functioning technology in domestic and industrial applications these subjects were studied in more detail (i. e. adsorption, effect of salinity, higher temperature and other substrates). Besides laboratory work also the start-up and performance of one of the first full-scale aerobic granular sludge reactors treating domestic wastewater is described. The ammonium adsorption properties of aerobic granular sludge, activated sludge and anammox granules have been investigated in Chapter 2. During operation of a pilot-scale aerobic granular sludge reactor, a positive relation between the ammonium influent concentration and the ammonium adsorbed was observed. Aerobic granular sludge exhibited much higher adsorption capacity compared to activated sludge and anammox granules. At an ammonium concentration of 30 mg N L- 1, adsorption obtained with activated sludge and anammox granules was around 0. 2 mg NH 4 +-N gVSS- 1, while aerobic granular sludge from lab- and pilot scale exhibited an adsorption of 1. 7 and 0. 9 mg NH 4 +-N gVSS- 1, respectively. No difference in the ammonium adsorption was observed in lab-scale reactors operated at different temperatures (20 and 30 ºC). In a lab-scale reactor fed with saline wastewater, we observed that the amount of ammonium adsorbed, decreased considerably when the salt concentration increased. The results indicate that adsorption or better: ion-exchange of ammonium should be incorporated into models for nitrification/denitrification, certainly when aerobic granular sludge is used. Salinity can adversely affect the performance of most biological processes involved in wastewater treatment (Chapter 3). The effect of salt (NaCl) on the main conversion processes in an aerobic granular sludge (AGS) process accomplishing simultaneous organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphate removal was evaluated in this chapter. Hereto an AGS sequencing batch reactor was subjected to different salt concentrations (0. 2 to 20 g Cl- L- 1). Granular structure was stable throughout the whole experimental period, although granule size decreased and a significant effluent turbidity was observed at the highest salinity tested. A weaker gel structure at higher salt concentrations was hypothesized to be the cause of such turbidity. Ammonium oxidation was not affected at any of the salt concentrations applied. However, nitrite oxidation was severely affected, especially at 20 g Cl- L- 1, in which a complete inhibition was observed. Consequently, high nitrite accumulation occurred. Phosphate removal was also found to be inhibited at the highest salt concentration tested. Complementary experiments have shown that a cascade inhibition effect took place: first, the deterioration of nitrite oxidation resulted in high nitrite concentrations and this in turn resulted in a detrimental effect to polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). By preventing the occurrence of the nitrification process and therefore avoiding the nitrite accumulation, the effect of salt concentrations on the bio-P removal process was shown to be negligible up to 13 g Cl- L- 1. Salt concentrations equal to 20 g Cl- L- 1 or higher in absence of nitrite also significantly reduced phosphate removal efficiency in the system. When aerobic granular sludge is applied for industrial wastewater treatment different soluble substrates can be present. For stable granular sludge formation on volatile fatty acids (e. g. acetate), production of storage polymers under anaerobic feeding conditions {{has been shown to be}} important. This prevents direct aerobic growth on readily available COD, which is thought to result in unstable granule formation. In Chapter 4 we investigate the impact of acetate, methanol, butanol, propanol, propionaldehyde and valeraldehyde on granular sludge formation at 35 °C. Methanogenic archaea, growing on methanol, were present in the aerobic granular sludge system. Methanol was completely converted to methane and carbon dioxide by the methanogenic archaeum Methanomethylovorans uponensis during the one-hour anaerobic feeding period, despite the relative high dissolved oxygen concentration (3. 5 mg O 2 L- 1) during the subsequent two-hour aeration period. Propionaldehyde and valeraldehyde were fully disproportionated anaerobically into their corresponding carboxylic acids and alcohols. The organic acids produced were converted to storage polymers, while the alcohols (produced and from influent) were absorbed onto the granular sludge matrix and converted aerobically. Our observations show that easy biodegradable substrates not converted anaerobically into storage polymers could lead to unstable granular sludge formation. However, when the easy biodegradable COD is absorbed in the granules and/or when the substrate is converted by relatively slow growing bacteria in the aerobic period stable granulation can occur. The influence of sludge age on granular sludge formation and microbial population dynamics in a methanol- and acetate-fed aerobic granular sludge system operated at 35 °C is investigated in Chapter 5. During anaerobic feeding of the reactor, methanol was initially converted to methane by methylotrophic methanogens. These methanogens were able to withstand the relatively long aeration periods. Lowering the anaerobic solid retention time (SRT) from 17 to 8 days enabled selective removal of the methanogens and prevented unwanted methane formation. In absence of methanogens, methanol was converted aerobically, while granule formation remained stable. At high SRT-values (51 days) γ-Proteobacteria were responsible for acetate removal through anaerobic uptake and subsequent aerobic growth on storage polymers formed (so called metabolism of glycogen accumulating organisms). When lowering the SRT (24 days), Defluviicoccus-related organisms (cluster II) belonging to the α-Proteobacteria outcompeted acetate consuming γ-Proteobacteria at 35 ºC. DNA from the Defluviicoccus-related organisms in cluster II was not extracted by the standard DNA extraction method but with liquid nitrogen, which showed to be more effective. Remarkably, the two glycogen accumulating organisms (GAO) types of organisms grew separately in two clearly different types of granules. This work further highlights the potential of aerobic granular sludge systems to effectively influence the microbial communities through sludge age control in order to optimize the wastewater treatment processes. Recently, aerobic granular sludge technology has been scaled-up and implemented for industrial and municipal wastewater treatment under the trade name Nereda®. With full-scale references for industrial treatment application since 2006 and domestic sewage since 2009 only limited operating data have been presented in scientific literature so far. In this study performance, granulation and design considerations of an aerobic granular sludge plant on domestic wastewater at the WWTP Garmerwolde, the Netherlands were analysed (Chapter 6). After a start-up period of approximately 5 months, a robust and stable granule bed (> 8 g L- 1) was formed and could be maintained thereafter, with a sludge volume index after 5 minutes settling of 45 mL g- 1. The granular sludge consisted for more than 80 % of granules larger than 0. 2 mm and more than 60 % larger than 1 mm. Effluent requirements (7 mg N L- 1 and 1 mg P L- 1) were easily met during summer and winter. Maximum volumetric conversion rates for nitrogen and phosphorus were respectively 0. 17 and 0. 24 kg (m 3 d) - 1. The energy usage was 13. 9 kWh (PE 150 ∙year) - 1 that is 58 – 63 % lower than the average conventional activated sludge treatment plant in the Netherlands. Finally, this study demonstrated that aerobic granular sludge technology can effectively be implemented for the treatment of domestic wastewater. BT/Environmental Biotechnolog...|$|R
