40|$|This thesis studies {{political}} elites’ {{beliefs about}} the ideal party leader. This ideal, like other human ideals, is characterized by ambivalence. The thesis explores the ambivalence expressed in party elites’ leadership ideal {{and how it can}} be understood. The study draws primarily on qualitative interviews with members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party elites in the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party in Sweden. Specifically, it analyzes <b>the</b> “life world” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party leaders, party secretaries, group leaders in the Swedish Parliament, and election committee chairmen. Building on classical and modern research on leadership and political parties, the thesis derives an analytical tool to guide the interviews which covers six aspects of party leadership: Characteristics, Leadership style, Tasks, Freedom of action, Representation, and Status. The empirical analysis shows that the elites’ party leadership ideal is ambivalent and different across the two parties. The ambiguities can be summarized as <b>dichotomies,</b> where <b>the</b> ideal leader should encompass both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy.</b> <b>The</b> Social Democratic Party elites’ ideal is represented by two dichotomies: the leader versus the team and the party versus the government. To bridge the ambiguities, the elite resort to <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> “anchoring”. This notion resolves conflicts between the leader and the surrounding team and the party and the government. <b>The</b> ideal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party’s elites includes four dichotomies: dogmatism versus pragmatism; idea versus person; appearance (outward-looking) versus action (inward-looking); and free versus constrained. Unlike <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Social Democratic Party, it is less evident how the Liberal Party’s elites accommodate the ambiguities. However, an emphasis on accountability and maintaining a balance between existing conflicts, partially remedies the dilemma. Also, <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> leadership within <b>the</b> Liberal Party is less problematic compared to the Social Democratic Party. In sum, while the Social Democrats’ ideal resembles the “friendly father figure”, the Liberals’ ideal is portrayed by the “superficial intellectual”.

We propose a conceptual map that organizes some major approaches to KM according to their assumptions {{on the nature of}} knowledge. The paper introduces the two major views on knowledge –objectivist, subjectivist- and explodes each of them into two major approaches to KM: knowledge as a market, and knowledge as intellectual capital (the objectivistic perspective); knowledge as mental models, and knowledge as practice (the subjectivist perspective). We argue that the dichotomy between objective and subjective approaches is intrinsic to KM within complex organizations, as each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> responds to different, and often conflicting, needs: on the one hand, the need to maximize the value of knowledge through its replication; on the other hand, the need to keep knowledge appropriate to an increasingly complex and changing environment.

40|$|An {{implicit}} dichotomy of {{the corporation}} exists in legal scholarship. On one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> rests the publicly held corporation suffering from a significant conflict of interest between its managers and dispersed shareholders; on the other side, the closely held corporation plagued by intershareholder conflict. This Article argues that understanding the agency problems that can exist within a firm demands a rejection of this traditional dichotomy and the theories of the firm built upon it. Using venture capital (VC) finance, this Article demonstrates how this dichotomy obscures how all firms [...] public and private [...] often face the same agency problems. Start-up companies receiving VC investment are uniquely situated to examine this dichotomy, as they represent closely held firms structured to transition quickly to public equity markets. Additionally, by separating investment from company management, VC investment creates many of the investor-manager conflicts inherent in public companies. By analyzing VC investment contracts, this Article reveals that start-up companies are indeed plagued by both vertical agency problems between investors and managers, and horizontal agency problems among VC investors themselves. Significantly, academic scholarship has ignored the potential for interinvestor conflicts, using instead an analytical framework associated with public corporations that focuses exclusively on investor-manager agency problems. In so doing, VC scholarship provides a clear {{example of how the}} dichotomy {{of the corporation}} forces scholars to wear blinders in analyzing the agency problems in firms.

40|$|Nature {{serves as}} an {{inspiration}} for engineering design, and, conversely, engineering principles have helped to usher in a quantitative frontier of biology. This intricate interdependency between engineering and biology is strongly evident in the single-molecule regime, where high-resolution tools are addressing previously intractable biological problems, while nanotechnology is being accelerated by advances in molecular biology. This thesis explores both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> {{in an effort to}} reveal <b>the</b> mechanics <b>of</b> two biological systems - M 13 filamentous bacteriophage and kinesin motor protein - and <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> their underlying parts. M 13 is a filamentous virus that has elicited <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engineering community for its use in phage display of combinatorial peptide libraries and more recently as a 1 D template for organizing and growing inorganic materials. Both applications rely on the direct link between genotype and phenotype, whereby each phage particle displays fusion molecules on its proteinaceous capsid and simultaneously carries the encoding DNA. A better understanding of its polymer mechanics is critical to <b>the</b> further development <b>of</b> future M 13 -based technologies. As a result, combined efforts in genetic engineering, optical trapping, and modeling were employed in <b>the</b> first characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biopolymer's single-molecule elasticity, revealing a persistence length (1265 nm) that places it squarely in the semiflexible polymer regime. Single-molecule stretching also revealed a mechanically robust and genetically versatile tether that could serve as a general "molecular handle" for single-molecule biophysics. As such, M 13 was further engineered to incorporate variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zinc finger, DNA-binding domain of transcription factor Zif 268 as minor coat fusions. (cont.) Single-molecule assays centered around the "zinc fingered-phages" are being developed to establish M 13 as a standalone, single-molecule building block for achieving universal connectivity and for unlocking future studies on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> protein-DNA interactions. Kinesin is an ATPase that "walks" processively along biofilament tracks to perform vital cellular processes. Whereas M 13 mechanics were studied in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> classical rod or polymer bending, our focus within kinesin mechanics is <b>the</b> molecular aspects <b>of</b> motility. While significant {{progress has been made in}} elucidating <b>the</b> broad features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinesin mechanochemical cycle, details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force generation mechanism remain a mystery. Com 3 bined efforts in molecular biology, optical trapping, and molecular simulation were employed to put forth a novel mechanism for the motor's power stroke, namely that it is produced when the conserved N-terminal cover strand forms a [beta]-sheet with the neck linker to yield the cover-neck bundle. In agreement with simulation, single-molecule motility data revealed impairment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force-generating capacity <b>of</b> cover strand mutants, as measured by a reduction in stall force from the wild-type. Motility data also suggest that targeting forcegenerating elements, such as the cover strand, is a plausible strategy for designing biological motors with tunable motile properties, bringing us one step closer to a complete blueprint of kinesin's parts and their collective functioning. by Ahmad Samir Khalil.

Lawrence Weiner said: [...] "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." [...] Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Robert Barry, Yoko Ono, and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the [...] "art" [...] <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ostensible <b>dichotomy</b> between art and craft, where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's [...] "written instructions" [...] make more sense alongside other conceptual art <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|R
40|$|The Implications of Belonging Abstract The {{efforts to}} explain the {{evolution}} of social and moral behaviour often focus exclusively on the positive social and moral traits, or the prosocial traits (in the parlance of evolutionary biology). The standard practice under extant evolutionary modeling has been to represent all social behaviour by the term altruism and all non-social or counter-social behaviour by the contrasting term - selfishness. Such a modeling scheme leaves the negative social/moral behaviours such has bigotry, racism, homophobia, patriarchy, bullying etc. unaccounted for or worse still, they are presumed erroneously {{to be on the}} selfishness <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy.</b> In this discussion, I put forward a hypothesis on social bigotry that appears at first to be counterintuitive, but which is supported by a very simple and compelling analysis. The analysis will show that bigotry and other negative social behaviours such as racism, homophobia, bullying etc., are driven by the same inherent human passion that makes the formation of social groups possible. The virtue or vice of that passion is therefore dependent upon the circumstance of its expression. Here is the conundrum: the idea of forming a group within a population or species involves the dual process of inclusion and exclusion. For, there is really no group if there is no distinction between who is in and who is out. This necessarily entails some criterion for picking out those within, from those without. Sensitivity to the most effective criteria for discriminating between group members and non-members would correlate positively with the formation of durable groups, and will therefore tend to be favoured by natural selection. Thus, as my research will show, members of every social group are necessarily inherently bigoted, nepotistic and in fact, hostile towards the outsider. It seems then that the social instinct necessarily has to be discriminatory, for the formation of social groups to be possible. In fact, Kurzban et al (2001, 15387) have cited numerous studies, in addition to their own, that suggest the existence of a cognitive machinery that has evolved to detect coalitional alliances. Prior to this research, evolutionary biologists had postulated the need for some detectible features to help social organisms distinguish between fellow altruists and non-altruists. It is the basis of the so-called “Greenbeard Hypothesis” (Dawkins, 1976 / 1989). The capacity to discriminate is in fact, a very prevalent feature of modern revolutionary models of sociality, and most successful models today invariable feature what is called “conditional altruism. ” This involves the selective dispensation of altruism or social cooperation on the basis of reciprocity, kinship and group affiliation. Thus, without this concomitant discriminatory feature of the sociality trait, the evolution of social groups is quite impossible. We yearn to belong and we value special relationships. But that virtue necessarily excludes. The paragons of patriotism are those who go out and kill others on our behalf. I explore how we minimize the negative consequences of belonging...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural {{resource}} and environmental management problems that face Australia, from the coastal zone to arid interior, {{are complex and}} long-term, both in their making and resolution. The responsibility for addressing these problems falls on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public- private <b>dichotomy,</b> often involving different levels of government, industry and community groups and individual citizens. In some instances these parties have sought each other out to work in partnership on a place or problem. Elsewhere, government agencies have facilitated formation of bilateral and multilateral {{natural resource}} and environmental management partnerships (e. g. coastcare and landcare groups; catchment, estuary, and coastal management groups), bringing together people of different backgrounds and interests for a similar purpose. In this paper I define terms commonly used in such settings (i. e. partnership, collaboration and cooperation) and argue for caution and careful reflection on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> government agencies and practitioners intent on facilitating bilateral or multilateral natural resource and environmental management partnerships. Building on the metaphor used in the title, I question <b>the</b> appropriateness <b>of</b> forming partnerships in all circumstances.

40|$|In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> {{feminist and}} postmodern thought, {{traditional}} conceptions of masculinity {{and what it}} means to be a “Real Man” have been critiqued. In Genevieve Lloyd's <b>The</b> Man <b>of</b> Reason, this critique takes <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> exposing <b>the</b> effect that <b>the</b> distinctive masculinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “man <b>of</b> reason” has had on <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> philosophy. One major feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> masculine-feminine <b>dichotomy</b> will emerge as a key notion for understanding <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper: <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> <b>of</b> reason-feeling, a parallel and a foundational aspect to <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> <b>of</b> masculinity and femininity. In exploring <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> symbolic conceptions of masculinity in ancient Greece, the Renaissance, and the present, one finds that <b>the</b> oppression <b>of</b> women is integrally linked to the traditional tie between masculinity and reason. There have been many efforts in recent feminist philosophy to rewrite or redefine “Woman” in such a way as to alleviate <b>the</b> oppression <b>of</b> women. I argue that <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> rewriting Woman for this purpose is problematic, primarily because any rewriting of this type must occur in the current historical context of hierarchical dualisms, like Man-Woman, masculine-feminine, male-female. These binary oppositions arguably find their roots in Pythagorean philosophy and can be traced through the Renaissance to our current historical context. It is these dualisms that have traditionally valued <b>the</b> masculine <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Man-Woman <b>dichotomy</b> more than <b>the</b> feminine. Further, it will be argued that <b>the</b> hierarchical dualism <b>of</b> Man and Woman is so pervasive that if we rewrite or redefine <b>the</b> inferior, deprivileged <b>side</b> <b>of</b> that dualism, we cannot correct its devalued status. Instead, we redefine that which is undervalued but retain its devalued status. This particular aspect of attempts to critique hierarchical dualisms like reason and feeling has been reflected in <b>the</b> writings <b>of</b> many feminists, male and female. This paper will show that in cases where women attempt to redefine <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> by revaluing <b>the</b> traditionally feminine (like feelings and emotions) over the traditionally masculine (like reason) their work is often mistakenly criticized for being purely political; conversely, when men attempt to redefine <b>the</b> same <b>dichotomy</b> in an attempt to allow men to “get back in touch with their feelings,” to be nurturers, their work is described in terms of providing a better epistemology. The current literature on masculinity explores alternatives to rewriting or redefining Woman that try to avoid <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> status remaining with redefinition. This alternative is rewriting or redefining Man. Through redefining Man, one may be able to reconceptualize <b>the</b> privileged <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hierarchical dualism in such a way that it is no longer privileged. Deprivileging, as well as redefining Man, is argued by theorists of masculinity to be possible because while <b>the</b> devalued status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a hierarchical dualism tends to keep the same status when redefined, it may be possible to redefine <b>the</b> privileged <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dualism in such a way that it loses its privileged status. Unfortunately, many of these attempts to rewrite or redefine masculinity have detrimental faults of their own. Finally, this paper will discuss more promising possibilities for new definitions of Man, as well as a vision for better interaction between <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> women and men in general...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} test Thalbourne's theory of psychopraxia (Thalbourne, 2000 a). The thesis begins with an introduction to <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> parapsychology in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> an argument against extreme skepticism (Chapter 1). It argues that skeptics have failed to produce cogent arguments to undermine the hypothesis that so-called paranormal phenomena exist. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parapsychological meta-analyses (Chapters 2 and 3) provides supporting evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that paranormal effects do exist. By argument and by experimentation, <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> anomalous phenomena is deemed justifiable, thus, establishing a rationale for investigation of paranormal phenomena, with particular focus on <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia. Chapter 4 introduces <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia - <b>the</b> term 'psychopraxia' is derived from two Greek words: psyche, which means 'soul' or 'mind' or 'self', and praxia, from which we get our word 'practice' (derived from prattein, meaning 'to accomplish' or 'bring about'). <b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia {{is an attempt to}} unify both normal and paranormal psychology, and motor action and cognition, so that the conceptual distinction between (i) ESP and PK, and (ii) normal information-acquisition and normal motor control might be 'eliminated' (Thalbourne, 1982, pp. 62 - 63) since both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dichotomy</b> are instances <b>of</b> action. <b>The</b> present thesis is an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> paranormal phenomena only. In Chapters 5 and 6, an experiment is described that uses an ancient Chinese form of divination known as the I Ching. The I Ching experiment was conducted to test the psychopractic hypothesis that <b>the</b> ESP-PK <b>dichotomy</b> can be unworkable in practice because either (a) an anomalous mental process (suggesting ESP), or (b) an anomalous physical process (suggesting PK), or both (a) and (b) might be involved in the I Ching process. Evidence was found that the I Ching may involve a paranormal component, but this process could not be explained exclusively as either ESP or PK. According to <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia, <b>the</b> ostensibly paranormal anomaly identified in the I Ching process is described as exosomatic psychopraxia (i. e., the psychopractic function working outside the mind/body complex). In Chapter 7 a forced-choice card-identifying experiment was conducted to test a basic proposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia known as the 'pro attitude', which is an orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self towards a specific and preferred outcome or goal. Participants had to locate 5 aces of spades in 5 'hands' of cards, while avoiding <b>the</b> aces <b>of</b> clubs. A significant negative relationship was found between spade hitting and club hitting, suggesting that 'compliant' pro attitudes and 'noncompliant' pro attitudes are incompatible. Post hoc evidence was also found that participants do not necessarily comply with the experimental protocol due to attitudes and dispositions that conflict with the protocol. In Chapter 8, another forced-choice experiment was run on computer to test <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pro attitude from a different perspective. Post hoc evidence was found that <b>the</b> pro attitude <b>of</b> 'converted' skeptics (i. e., skeptics who became believers) changed when an experimental treatment conducive to a change of pro attitude was introduced. There was also evidence that <b>the</b> pro attitude <b>of</b> 'entrenched' skeptics (i. e., skeptics who remained skeptics) did not change even when an experimental treatment ostensibly conducive to a change of pro attitude was introduced. The latter result suggests that the pro attitude may remain fixed over time. In Chapter 9 a free-response study was conducted to test vision-impaired participants against sighted participants. <b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia argues that compensation for an adverse condition (such as blindness) may take <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> paranormal functioning. Evidence of paranormal effects was found, but no evidence was found that the vision-impaired had an advantage over sighted participants. In support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compensation hypothesis, however, there was suggestive evidence that the totally blind performed better than all other participants combined. The so-called 'necessary condition' is another basic proposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia. In all the above four experiments, evidence was found, in the relevant experiments, that certain conditions were necessary and sufficient in bringing about paranormal effects in the respective experimental situations: (1) High scoring on four personality factors as measured on Cattell's 16 PF: Factor F (Liveliness), Factor H (Social Boldness), Factor EX (Extraversion), Factor IN (Independence); (2) Low scoring on Factor Q 4 (Tension); (3) Extreme scores on the Transliminality Scale (a measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tendency to experience psychological material coming into, and going out of consciousness); (4) Belief in paranormal processes; (5) Low scores on attitude towards horseracing; and (6) Relaxation. Two other conditions were introduced in Chapter 10 : (i) perceived simplicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apparatus and experimental procedure, and (ii) ease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paranormal task. These two conditions and six 'states of mind' (i. e., 'freshness', 'sobriety', 'attentiveness', 'confidence', 'fitness,' and 'energy level') were hypothesized as being conditions conducive to paranormal effects. In Chapter 11, suggestive evidence was found that simplicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental apparatus and procedure had a positive effect on paranormal performance. Two 'states of mind' ('freshness' and 'confidence') were found to correlate significantly with paranormal outcomes, but only in the I Ching experiment. These conditions were also found to be necessary and sufficient in bringing about hexagram hitting. In Chapter 12, <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> psychopraxia was argued as being important to <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> parapsychology because it offered (a) a philosophical critique on taken-for-granted assumptions about <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paranormal, (b) relatively unambiguous terminology, and (c) a process-oriented approach to investigations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paranormal by concentrating on conditions deemed necessary in bringing about paranormal effects. In its current form, the psychopraxia model needs clarification of its most crucial concepts ('self', 'pro attitude', and 'necessary conditions') before it can be regarded as a workable theory.

40|$|<b>The</b> view <b>of</b> {{physical}} space as functional is {{in conflict with}} a view of space that is determined imaginatively by memory and metaphor. This paper examines <b>the</b> contemporary conception <b>of</b> space (that is, space conceived purely as a scientific phenomenon) and demonstrates its inadequacies and limitations. <b>The</b> conception <b>of</b> space as functional is a remnant of our positivistic heritage which seems to leave no room for any deeper meaning. Accordingly, <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> meaning, truth, and legitimation (that is, empirical explanation or <b>the</b> generating <b>of</b> laws) are closely related to one another and to the procedures governing scientific activity. Thus, science becomes the model for meaning, truth and legitimation in all areas, including design and art. This is one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> false <b>dichotomy</b> I reject. To me, it is a reductionistic and impoverished conception of meaning, truth and legitimation-one that simply begs the question against other conceptions. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this perspective ('scientism') has been an impoverishment of our culture, particularly in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> landscape design. <b>The</b> other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> this <b>dichotomy</b> is equally unsatisfying. The postmodernist, following Derrida, rejects this reductionistic conception of meaning, but in doing so undermines their own position. For Derrida, words 'have multiple meanings [...] . they thus possess potential excess meanings [...] . Language always means more than it may be taken to mean in anyone context' (Lye 1993, p. 91). His emphasis on meaning as determined only in relation to other words, and his attempt to eliminate metaphysical notions like representation and absolute meaning, creates an illusion of instability which can lead to a paralysing ambiguity (Stephens 1994). <b>The</b> totality <b>of</b> meaning becomes inaccessible. One can never have more than an inadequate and approximate grasp of meaning. In Derrida's scheme, meaning is nothing more than textual relationships with no connection or grounding outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text itself. 'Everything is text, and all text is indefinitely ambiguous' (1989, p. 148). In this paper I will try to show that neither <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alternatives need be accepted, that there can be a conception of meaning that is neither verificationist (scientistic), nor empty (purely textual). This provides us with room to give levels <b>of</b> meaning to <b>the</b> world and to understand behaviour in a way which is neither scientific nor merely textual. I argue that for space to be intrinsically and authentically meaningful, design must be conceived imaginatively. This imaginative conception will involve and appeal to a metaphorical visual vocabulary which provides a non-literal, but authentic experience of time and space. As a result, an artifact may become an object of authentic aesthetic appreciation. I will illustrate this rather abstract conception with a variety of concrete examples, drawn primarily from landscape architecture using the wall and the ruin as an archetypal form of design language. This example offers a variety of interpretations and meanings, but ones which are necessarily underpinned by the notions (or criteria) of truth and falsity. I will consider the implications for design from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> designer and the participant. I believe this account opens up levels of meaning, truth and legitimation which help us to understand the true significance and value of design and, in particular, landscape design...|$|R
