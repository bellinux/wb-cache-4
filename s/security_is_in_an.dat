40|$|International audienceNetwork <b>security</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> daily {{evolving}} domain. Every day, new attacks, virus or intrusion {{techniques are}} released. Hence, network devices, enterprise servers or personal computers are potential targets of these attacks. Current secu- rity solutions like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and virtual private networks (VPN) are centralized solutions which rely {{mostly on the}} analyze of inbound network connec- tions. This approach notably forgets {{the effects of a}} rogue station, whose communications cannot be easily controlled unless the administrators establish a global authentication policy using methods like 802. 1 x to control all network com- munications among each device. To the best of our knowledge, a distributed and easily manageable solution for the global security of an enterprise network does not exist. In this paper, we present a new approach to deploy a distributed security solution where communication between each device can <b>be</b> control <b>in</b> <b>a</b> collaborative manner. Indeed, each device has its own security rules, who can be shared and improved through exchanges with others devices. With this new approach, called grid of security, a community of devices ensures that a device is trustworthy and that communications between devices progress in respect of the control of the system policies. To support this approach, we present a new communication model that helps structuring the distribution of security services among the devices. Like this, we can secure both ad-hoc, local-area or enterprise networks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decentralized manner, preventing the risk of <b>a</b> security breach <b>in</b> the case of a failure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel {{framework}} for reliably enforcing security in distributed systems.

A key novelty of our proposal <b>is</b> that <b>security</b> <b>is</b> enforced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decentralized though coordinated fashion. This provides the basis for reliably enforcing global security requirements without introducing unnecessary latencies or communication overhead. The novel contributions of this article include the concept of service automata and a generic formalization of service automata in CSP. We also illustrate how the generic model can be tailored to given security requirements by instantiating its parameters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stepwise and modular manner. ...|$|R

At that time, the boundary between what cryptography was permitted ("low-strength") and impermissible ("high-strength") for export from the United States was placed such that PGP fell on the too-strong-to-export side of the boundary.

By exploiting the synergy between cryptographic signature, {{forward error correction}} (FEC) and digital watermarking, the generated content-based message authentication code (MAC or keyed crypto hash) is embedded back into the video to reduce the transmission cost. The proposed scheme is secure against malicious attacks such as video frame insertion and alteration.

So far, no vehicular <b>security</b> architecture has <b>been</b> proposed which integrates existing individual solutions for vehicle registration, data integrity, authentication, and so on. By description of different architectural perspectives, we identify the stakeholders and their responsibilities. Then, we focus on the functional layer view and highlight the concepts which jointly secure the vehicular communication. Based on these concepts, we present an implementation approach which introduces the security concepts into the protocol stack of a vehicular communication system. The proposed security architecture follows a clean and modular design. It is the basis for our prototype implementation which will serve as a proof-of-concept. We will also submit this architecture to the ongoing standardization process of the Car 2 Car Communication Consortium (C 2 C-CC). I...|$|R

Results: Household food insecurity was associated with indicators of suboptimal health status in preschoolers.
