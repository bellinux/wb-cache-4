"It is not {{impossible}} that the lighter style of coloring introduced by Giotto {{may have been}} intended by him to counteract {{the effects of this}} varnish, the appearance of which in the Greek pictures he could not fail to observe. Another peculiarity in the works of the painters of the time referred to, particularly those of the Florentine and Sienese schools, is the greenish tone of their coloring in the flesh; produced by the mode in which they often prepared their works, viz. by a green under-painting. The appearance was neutralized by the red <b>sandarac</b> varnish, and pictures executed in the manner described must have looked better before it was removed."--Ib. p. 252.|$|E

On {{the white}} surface thus prepared, the colors, ground finely with linseed oil, were applied, {{according}} to the advice of Theophilus, in not less than three successive coats, and finally protected with amber or <b>sandarac</b> varnish: each coat of color being carefully dried by the aid of heat or in the sun before a second was applied, and the entire work before varnishing. The practice of carefully drying each coat was continued in the best periods of art, but the necessity {{of exposure to the}} sun intimated by Theophilus appears to have arisen only from his careless preparation of the linseed oil, and ignorance of a proper drying medium. Consequent on this necessity is the restriction in Theophilus, St. Audemar, and in the British Museum MS., of oil-painting to wooden surfaces, because movable panels could be dried in the sun; while, for walls, the colors are to be mixed with water, wine, gum, or the usual tempera vehicles, egg and fig-tree juice; white lead and verdigris, themselves dryers, being the only pigments which could be mixed with oil for walls. But the MS. of Eraclius and the records of our English cathedrals imply no such absolute restriction. They mention the employment of oil for the painting or varnishing of columns and interior walls, and in quantity very remarkable. Among the entries relating to St. Stephen's chapel, occur--"For 19 flagons of painter's oil, at 3s. 4d. the flagon, 43s. 4d." [...] (It might be as well, in the next edition, to correct the copyist's reverse of the position of the X and L, lest it should be thought that the principles of the science of arithmetic have been progressive, {{as well as those of}} art.) And presently afterwards, in May of the same year, [...] "to John de Hennay, for seventy flagons and a half of painter's oil for the painting of the same chapel, at 20d. the flagon, 117s. 6d." [...] The expression [...] "painter's oil" [...] seems to imply more careful preparation than that directed by Theophilus, probably purification from its mucilage in the sun; but artificial heat was certainly employed to assist the drying, and after reading of flagons supplied by the score, we can hardly be surprised at finding charcoal furnished by the cartload--see an entry relating to the Painted Chamber. In one MS. of Eraclius, however, a distinct description of a drying oil in the modern sense, occurs, white lead and lime being added, and the oil thickened by exposure to the sun, as was the universal practice in Italy.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{especially}} in the Late Medieval and Renaissance era, <b>sandarac</b> was used to make varnish. When [...] "varnish" [...] was spoken of in Renaissance Italy (Italian vernice) it usually meant <b>sandarac.</b> Copal and other resins displaced it as equally good, less expensive varnishing materials. Nevertheless the <b>sandarac</b> varnish is still valued today {{for use as a}} protective coating on paintings and antiques. It gives a coat which is hard, lustrous and durable. The varnish is made by melting the resin and mixing it with (e.g.) linseed oil. <b>Sandarac</b> resin melts at about 150°C. to a colourless or slightly yellow liquid. Its specific gravity is about 1.04.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sandarac</b> (or sandarach) is a resin {{obtained}} from the small cypress-like tree Tetraclinis articulata.

The glass harmonica produces the sound by friction from touching the rotating bells with wet fingers.With the terpodion, operating the keyboard pushes a wooden or metal arm against a rotating coated cylinder of wood or other material, producing sounds by friction. For the lower notes the arms are mainly made of wood and for the higher notes they are made of metal. The arms are adjustable so the pitch of each note can be adjusted within the tuning process. The terpodion rarely requires tuning.The rotating cylinder is made from box wood (Buxus sempervirens), but the patent states {{it could be any}} material.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>sandarac</b> resin (Tetraclinis articulata) {{has been}} long used for its properties, mostly as a varnish component. Called juniper resin until the nineteenth century, the real botanical origin of <b>sandarac</b> is still unclear.

It seems that <b>sandarac</b> was mainly coming from T. articulata but the use of some juniper resins before the twentieth century is not to be excluded. The second approach is a chemical one; we used gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to characterise the resin. As <b>sandarac</b> was the main component of the famous Italian varnish Vernice liquida, its characterisation is important for old paintings studies. However, although we could hope to differentiate <b>sandarac,</b> Juniperus communis and Juniperus oxycedrus resins by looking at their chemical composition, it appears that these resins are very similar.

40|$|The {{study of}} several {{different}} naturally aged films of organic painting materials, is described. Materials studied include drying oils (walnut, poppy seed and linseed oil) resin-based paint varnishes (the triterpenoid dammar and the diterpenoids <b>sandarac</b> and turpentine) and protein-based binding media (egg yolk and casein). A not expensive methodology for a rapid identification of binding media and varnishes, that applies {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) to Excitation Emission (EE) fluorescence spectra, is proposed. PCA was performed on a data matrix where the rows represent studied materials and columns the variables; the variables include the fluorescence intensities associated to different points (coordinates are λex/λem) in EE spectra.
