To this end, Morgan Solar has developed the Sun Simba, an innovative light weight and low cost CPV module. Under the “Advancing Photonics for Economical Concentration Systems” (APECS) project, outdoor CPV test and measurement systems were designed and constructed at the University of Ottawa and at Little Rock, CA. The performance and reliability of development stage Sun Simba modules installed at the University of Ottawa is assessed.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{formation}} of voids in solar cell solder joints leads to a worsening of their heat <b>sinking</b> <b>capabilities,</b> causing {{an increase in the}} average device temperature and thermal resistance. This phenomenon can be detrimental for the solar cell's performance, since the open-circuit voltage linearly decreases with temperature. The performances of silicon solar cells, in the presence of voids in the cell solder joint, are studied by means of numerical simulations and of an analytical thermal model which can assess the local temperature increase at cell surface due to a single isolated void in the solder joint. The results show that for small isolated voids the analytical model gives temperature peaks above the voids which match very well with the simulations result, within 5 % of relative error. The analytical model also gives an estimation of the whole device thermal resistance, {{in the presence of a}} regular pattern of non-interacting voids all with the same surface area. For a 10 × 7 pattern of small area voids the analytical value for the device thermal resistance matches well with the results of numerical simulations, with a maximum error of 17. 3 % at 70 % void coverage. To determine the temperature profile of the device surface we have implemented a thermal finite element analysis (FEA) which employs a detailed 3 D model of the real morphology of voids in the solar cell, obtained by X-ray inspection.

40|$|Abstract: This {{application}} note discusses {{how to build}} a high output drive voltage reference without sacrificing temperature drift, initial accuracy, and noise that cannot internally drive enough current. The task of driving a load with a reference requires some attention. After determining the supply voltage and output voltage, the parameters to consider include the output-voltage temperature coefficient, initial accuracy, drift, noise, line and load regulation, package size and type, power consumption, stability with various capacitive loads, and the required source and <b>sink</b> <b>capability.</b> A common problem is the need to source or sink more current than the reference can provide. A precision unitygain buffer amplifier offers an adequate solution in applications that can tolerate its additional drift, noise, and gain inaccuracy. A serious drawback, however, is the buffer's potential instability when driving capacitive loads, such as the well-bypassed reference inputs of an A/D or D/A converter. Attempting to guarantee the buffer's stability by introducing an isolation resistor, between op-amp output and capacitive load, further degrades the reference circuit's accuracy. Another alternative is to cancel the load, that is, to make it appear like a large resistance. If load resistance is made to appear large, the remaining load is composed of any capacitance that may be in parallel with the load resistance. The load may be cancelled by placing a negative resistance in parallel with the load's positiv...|$|E
40|$|An {{initiative}} {{led by the}} US Air Force {{concluded that}} advances in military fighter aircraft systems would require fuels with over 50 % improvement in heat <b>sink</b> <b>capability</b> over conventional JP- 8 fuel. This {{led to the creation}} of the "JP- 8 + 100 " program that demonstrated that the thermal stability of jet fuels (particularly JP- 8) could be enhanced through the use of particular additives used at relatively low concentrations. Additionally, flight-testing highlighted a significant reduction in fuel-related maintenance costs, arising from cleaner combustion. Inspired by the USAF success, and anticipated environmental and maintenance benefits, we attempted to design a conceptually new multifunctional species to enhance the thermal stability of jet fuels, without compromising other required essentials of jet fuel product quality, since one drawback found with classical dispersant additives has been a deleterious effect on water and solids separation characteristics. The present paper therefore describes the philosophy behind our additive development work, and gives results and conclusions of laboratory and large-scale tests conducted under this program. These demonstrate (a) the activity of the new type of additive in enhancing the thermal stability of JP- 8 fuel, and (b) the compatibility of additized fuel with existing conventional filter/water separation systems. © 2001 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

United Technologies Corporation (UTC) Integrated Total Aircraft Power System (ITAPS) methodologies were used to evaluate a baseline aircraft and several SOFC architectures. The technology benefits were captured as reductions of the mission fuel burn, life cycle cost, noise and emissions. As a result of the study, it was recognized that system integration is critical to maximize benefits from the SOFC APU for aircraft application. The mission fuel burn savings for the two SOFC architectures ranged from 4. 7 percent for a system with high integration to 6. 7 percent for a highly integrated system with certain technological risks. The SOFC APU itself produced zero emissions. The reduction in engine fuel burn achieved with the SOFC systems also resulted in reduced emissions from the engines for both ground operations and in flight. The noise level of the baseline APU with a silencer is 78 dBA, while the SOFC APU produced a lower noise level.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} effect of {{cooperation}} in an interference limited, narrow-band wireless sensor network. Cooperation among available sensors can potentially lead to significant capacity increases. However, in an interference limited setting with asynchronous transmissions, exploiting more available sensors to help active sources will cause more interference to other sensors. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} find the optimal tradeoff between the amount of cooperation and the amount of interference introduced to the network. In this work we quantify the amount of cooperation using the notion of relay zones for each active sensor. The sensors that lie in such a zone are allowed to cooperate with the source. We then use the physical interference model to determine the probability that a relay node correctly decodes its corresponding source. Through numerical and simulation studies, we investigate the optimization of the relay-zone radius to maximize the network sum-rate based on relay availability and the <b>sink</b> reception <b>capability.</b> We show that the overall system capacity increases significantly under the proposed scheme, compared with cases where relay nodes are not exploited or where the relay zone radius is suboptimal.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new computational method for embedding Lagrangian sink particles into an Eulerian calculation. Simulations of gravitational collapse or accretion generally produce regions whose density greatly exceeds the mean density in the simulation. These dense regions require extremely small time steps to maintain numerical stability. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes approach this problem by introducing non-gaseous, accreting sink particles, and Eulerian codes may introduce fixed sink cells. However, until now {{there has been no}} approach that allows Eulerian codes to follow accretion onto multiple, moving objects. We have removed that limitation by extending the <b>sink</b> particle <b>capability</b> to Eulerian hydrodynamics codes. We have tested this new method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analytic solutions. In analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method for evaluating the disk viscosity parameter α due to the numerical viscosity of a hydrodynamics code, and use it to compute α for our Cartesian AMR code. We also present a simple application of this new method: studying the transition from Bondi to Bondi-Hoyle accretion that occurs when a shock hits a particle undergoing Bondi accretion.

40|$|The {{problem of}} free {{convection}} fluid flow and heat transfer {{in a square}} cavity with a flush mounted heat source on its bottom wall and two heat sinks on its vertical side walls has been investigated numerically. Via changing {{the location of the}} heat sinks, six different arrangements have been generated. The cavity was filled with Cu-water nanofluid. The governing equations were discretized using the finite volume method and SIMPLER algorithm. Using the developed code, a parametric study was undertaken, and effects of Rayleigh number, arrangements of the heat sinks and volume fraction of the nanoparticles on fluid flow and heat transfer inside the cavity were investigated. Also for the middle-middle heat <b>sinks</b> arrangement, <b>capability</b> of five different water based nanofluids on enhancement of the rate of heat transfer was examined and compared. From the obtained results {{it was found that the}} average Nusselt number, for all six different arrangements of the heat sinks, was an increasing function of the Rayleigh number and the volume fraction of the nanoparticles. Also it was found that at high Rayleigh numbers, maximum and minimum average Nusselt number occurred for middle-middle and top-bottom arrangement, respectively. Moreover it was found that for the middle-middle arrangement, at high Rayleigh numbers, maximum and minimum rate of heat transfer was obtained by Cu-water and TiO 2 -water nanofluids respectively...|$|R
40|$|Diatoms often {{dominate}} planktonic {{communities in}} the ocean and phototrophic biofilms in streams and rivers, greatly contributing to global biogeochemical fluxes. In pelagic ecosystems, these microscopic algae can form chain-like microcolonies, which seem advantageous for nutrient uptake and protect against grazing, {{and at the same}} time reduce <b>sinking.</b> Despite the <b>capability</b> of many diatoms to form chains, their contribution to the architecture of phototrophic biofilms remains elusive. Here we propose a computational model to simulate the growth and behaviour of Diatoma chains in contrasting flow environments. This mass-spring mechanical model captures the natural behaviour of Diatoma chains well, emphasising the relevance of chain growth and entanglement for biofilm morphogenesis. The model qualitatively describes formation of intricate dome-shaped structures and of dreadlock-type streamers as observed in nature in multidirectional and unidirectional flow, respectively. The proposed model is a useful tool to study the effect of fluid dynamics on biofilm morphogenesis. BT/BiotechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|The PCA 9670 {{provides}} general-purpose remote I/O expansion via the two-wire bidirectional I 2 C-bus (serial clock (SCL), {{serial data}} (SDA)). The devices consist of eight quasi-bidirectional ports, 1 MHz 30 mA drive I 2 C-bus interface, three hardware address inputs and a reset input operating between 2. 3 V and 5. 5 V. 1 MHz I 2 C-bus Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) can support PWM dimming of LEDs, and higher I 2 C-bus drive 30 mA allows more devices {{to be on}} the bus without the need for bus buffers. The quasi-bidirectional port can be independently assigned as an input to monitor interrupt status or keypads, or as an output to activate indicator devices such as LEDs. The system master can read from the input port or write to the output port through a single register. The low current consumption of 2. 5 �A (typical, static) is great for mobile applications and the latched output ports have 25 mA high current <b>sink</b> drive <b>capability</b> for directly driving LEDs. The PCA 9670 has three hardware address pins and allows up to 64 of these PCA 9670 I/O expanders on the same I 2 C-bus without the need for bus buffers, supporting up to 512 I/Os (for example, 512 LEDs). The internal Power-On Reset (POR) and active LOW hardware reset pin (RESET) initialize the I/Os as inputs with a weak internal pull-up 100 �A current source. 2.

40|$|Cooling {{electronic}} chips {{to satisfy the}} ever-increasing heat transfer demands of the electronics industry is a perpetual challenge. One approach to addressing this is through improving the heat rejection ability of air-cooled heat sinks, and nonlocal thermal-fluid-solid modeling based on volume averaging theory (VAT) has allowed for significant strides in this effort. A number of optimization methods for heat sink designers who model heat sinks with VAT can be envisioned due to VAT's singular ability to rapidly provide solutions, when compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method {{appears to be an}} attractive multiparameter heat transfer device optimization tool; however, it has received very little attention in this field compared to its older population-based optimizer cousin, the genetic algorithm (GA). The PSO method is employed here to optimize smooth and scale-roughened straight-fin heat sinks modeled with VAT by minimizing heat sink thermal resistance for a specified pumping power. A new numerical design tool incorporates the PSO method with a VAT-based heat sink solver. Optimal designs are obtained with this new tool for both types of heat sinks, the performances of the heat sink types are compared, the performance of the PSO method is discussed with reference to the GA method, and it is observed that this new method yields optimal designs much quicker than traditional approaches. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the effectiveness of combining a VAT-based nonlocal thermal-fluid-solid model with population-based optimization methods, such as PSO, to design heat sinks for electronics cooling applications. The VAT-based nonlocal modeling method provides heat <b>sink</b> design <b>capabilities,</b> in terms of solution speed and model rigor, that existing modeling methods do not match. © 2014 by ASME...|$|R
