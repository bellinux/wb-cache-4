5|$|The Red Ensign of Singapore {{is a civil}} ensign used by privately owned, non-military {{ships that}} are {{registered}} in Singapore.

The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the Red Ensign is the only ensign to be used on <b>Singaporean</b> civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The ensign must be hoisted on all <b>Singaporean</b> ships on entering or leaving port.|$|E

5|$|Each {{flag of the}} National Olympic Committees {{represented}} {{was brought}} on stage by an athlete representative. Following Olympic tradition, the flag of Greece entered first as the originator of the games, and the flag of Singapore entered last as the host nation. The flag ceremony {{was followed by the}} singing of the Games theme song and remarks by Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee.

50|$|Singapore is the world's most religiously diverse nation, with <b>Singaporeans</b> {{following}} various {{religious beliefs}} and practices due to the country's diverse ethnic and cultural mix.

Other prominent faiths practised by <b>Singaporeans</b> include Taoism (10.9%), Chinese folk religion, and other Dharmic religions like Sikhism and Jainism. A small percentage of Singapore's population practices Zoroastrianism and Judaism. Only 0.9% of <b>Singaporeans</b> identify as atheist.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the architecture of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the <b>Singaporean</b> nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early <b>Singaporean</b> housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the architecture of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldPURPOSE: To investigate racial differences of lens transparency properties and the prevalence of lens opacification by age. METHODS: Lenses of randomly selected Asian (1, 038 Japanese and 517 <b>Singaporeans)</b> and Caucasian (1, 045 Icelanders) subjects were evaluated for their lens transparency property (LTP). The prevalence of lens opacification was determined with a newly proposed WHO cataract classification system. RESULTS: LTP increased with aging for all nationalities. Light scattering intensity was significantly higher in the <b>Singaporeans</b> followed by the Icelandic subjects. The prevalence of cortical opacification in <b>Singaporeans</b> {{was significantly higher than}} those of the other nationalities up to the age of 60, and the prevalence in Asians was significantly higher than that in Caucasians aged 60 - 69. Cortical opacification was more prevalent than the other types for both Japanese and Icelanders in their 50 s, 60 s and 70 s. Regarding the central optical zone, the prevalence in the <b>Singaporeans</b> was significantly higher than in the other two groups in their 50 s and 60 s. The prevalence of nuclear opacification in <b>Singaporeans</b> was markedly higher than those of the two other groups for all ages. Subcapsular cataract was the least prevalent type for all age groups and nationalities; however, the highest prevalence was observed in <b>Singaporeans.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Lens transparency decreased with age in the <b>Singaporeans</b> more markedly than in the other two groups. The high prevalence of nuclear opacification in <b>Singaporeans</b> is considered to be due to environmental rather than race-specific factors...|$|R

50|$|Launched by Minister Lim Boon Heng, Prime Minister’s Office, on 26 August 2008, the Speak Good English Movement 2008 {{targeted}} the workforce who {{were seen as}} the people both <b>Singaporeans</b> and international visitors would encounter most frequently. Frontline staff of the service and retail sectors were especially targeted.The message of the tagline of 2008 - 'I Can' was that 'I can help others improve their English.', 'I can take action to improve my English.' and I can speak good English if I want to.' In order to encourage willingness to speak and improve their proficiency of Standard English, the movement of this year initiated the classification of <b>Singaporeans</b> into 3 categories. 1. <b>Singaporeans</b> who can speak Standard English. 2. <b>Singaporeans</b> who cannot yet speak Standard English and are open to improving themselves. 3. <b>Singaporeans</b> who {{are not able to}} speak Standard English and do not see the importance of doing so.|$|R

2500|$|Mandarin {{is another}} widely spoken {{language}} among Chinese <b>Singaporeans.</b> As of 2010, {{it was estimated}} that 47.7% of Chinese <b>Singaporeans</b> speak Mandarin at home. Evidently, Singapore government's Speak Mandarin Campaign was launched in the 1980s with the intention of making Mandarin the lingua franca among the Chinese in Singapore. It was intentionally a way to unify the Chinese from different dialect groups. In the 1990s, this campaign began to target the English-speaking Chinese <b>Singaporeans.</b> As a result of this campaign, Mandarin became widespread in places such as residential areas, neighbourhood markets and even business districts. Mandarin is also often spoken in most [...] "traditional Chinese-based" [...] schools, despite the fact that English is their medium of instruction. Colloquially, as with all other languages spoken in Singapore, the Chinese <b>Singaporeans</b> prefer a localised flavour in mixing words from English, Hokkien, Malay, and some other varieties, into their Mandarin speech. Most young Chinese <b>Singaporeans</b> are capable of conversational Mandarin, but are weaker in their ability to write Mandarin.|$|R
