5|$|The Yellowstone saw war {{service for}} the Republic one more time on May 7, when it transported Houston and his {{prisoner}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna,</b> along with the government <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> tried to extinguish, to Galveston Island. From there, the government and <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> traveled to Velasco for {{the signing of the}} treaties. Houston had suffered a serious wound during the battle, and on May 28 boarded the schooner Flora for medical treatment in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Although {{signed by}} Pierce and <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna,</b> the treaty needed a 2/3 {{vote in favor}} of {{ratification}} in the US Senate, where it met strong opposition. Antislavery senators opposed further acquisition of slave territory. Lobbying by speculators gave the treaty a bad reputation. Some senators objected to furnishing <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> financial assistance.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna.</b> In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> {{dissolution}} of the Constitution of 1824 and <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> political shift to the right, issues such as {{lack of access to}} courts, the militarization of the region's government (e.g., response to Saltillo-Monclova problem), and self-defense issues resulting in the confrontation in Gonzales, public sentiment in Mexican and Anglo Texans turned towards revolution. <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> invasion of the territory after putting down the rebellion in Zacatecas provoked the conflict of 1836. The Texian forces fought and won the Texas Revolution in 1835–1836.|$|R

5|$|The Anglos in Texas began {{agitating}} for {{war against}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna,</b> and Bowie worked with William B. Travis, {{the leader of}} the War Party, to gain support. Bowie visited several Indian villages in East Texas in an attempt to persuade the reluctant tribes to fight against the Mexican government. <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> responded to the rumblings by ordering large numbers of Mexican troops to Texas.|$|E
5|$|As the fog lifted, Castañeda sent Smither {{to request}} a meeting between the two commanders. Smither was {{promptly}} arrested by the Texians, who were suspicious of his presence among the Mexican soldiers. Nevertheless, Moore agreed to meet Castañeda. Moore explained that his followers no longer recognized the centralist government of <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> and instead remained faithful to the Constitution of 1824, which <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> had repudiated. Castañeda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, {{but that he was}} honor-bound to follow orders.|$|E
5|$|Bowie perished {{with the}} rest of the Alamo {{defenders}} on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E

5|$|Following a coup in the Mexican government, Antonio Lopez de <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> became {{president}} and revoked many freedoms previously {{enjoyed by the}} Texans further deteriorating the government's relations with the region's settlers. Texas declared its independence and revolted in 1835. Following a number of battles with the Mexican army, the Texas army, {{under the leadership of}} General Sam Houston, finally defeated <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> in the Battle of San Jacinto, near modern Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned {{to keep them}} out of the hands of the Mexican army. <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E
5|$|After the Texas {{victory at}} the Battle of San Jacinto in April, 1836, Independence carried the Texas President and his captive, General <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna,</b> to Velasco, where the Treaty of Velasco was {{negotiated}} and signed.|$|E
50|$|The {{military}} {{defeat of}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> forces at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836 resulted in <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> capture, and him {{being forced to}} order all Mexican forces to withdraw from Texas soil. Urrea was infuriated and, after linking up with Vicente Filisola's forces, he wanted to continue {{the war against the}} Texans since the Mexicans still had over 2,500 troops in Texas against less than 900 of Sam Houston's Texans. But both Urrea and Filisola {{had no choice but to}} comply with <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> orders, so by the middle of June, Urrea and all Mexican forces had withdrawn from Texas.|$|R

5|$|Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress {{passed a}} series of laws that seemed to {{discriminate}} against Anglo colonists {{in the province of}} Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.|$|E
5|$|<b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> {{ordered that}} the Tejano {{civilian}} survivors {{be allowed to}} return to their homes in San Antonio. Dickinson and Joe were allowed to travel towards the Anglo settlements, escorted by Ben, a former slave from the United States who served as Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte's cook. Each woman was given $2 and a blanket and was allowed to go free and spread the news of the destruction that awaited those who opposed the Mexican government. Before releasing Joe, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> ordered that the surviving members of the Mexican Army parade in a grand review, in the hopes that Joe and Dickinson would deliver a warning to the remainder of the Texian forces that his army was unbeatable.|$|E
5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances {{coincided with}} a Mexican civil war. Texians aligned {{themselves}} with proponents of federalism advocating a stronger role for state governments, in opposition to a centralized government that set most policies at the national level. The federalists prevailed, and their favored general, Antonio López de <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna,</b> was elected president. In 1835, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> began consolidating power; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender. Many Texas settlers thought Travis's action was imprudent, and {{he was forced to}} apologize. Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest, local authorities did not enforce it.|$|E

5|$|The {{steamboat}} Yellowstone {{under the}} command of Captain John Eautaw Ross was impressed into service for the Provisional Army of Texas on April 2, and initially ferried patients across the Brazos River when Dr. James Aeneas Phelps established a field hospital at Bernardo Plantation. Three days later, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> joined with Sesma's troops, and had them build flatboats to cross the Brazos as the Mexicans sought to overtake and defeat the Texians. Wyly Martin reported on April 8 that Mexican forces had divided and were headed both east to Nacogdoches and southeast to Matagorda. Houston reinforced Baker's post at San Felipe de Austin on April 9, as <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> continued moving southeast on April 10.|$|E
5|$|At 10p.m. on March 5, the Mexican {{artillery}} ceased their bombardment. As <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> had anticipated, {{the exhausted}} Texians soon {{fell into the}} first uninterrupted sleep {{many of them had}} since the siege began. Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault. Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned {{on the outside of the}} columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements. Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Before {{fighting}} had officially erupted, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> {{had realized}} that stronger measures {{were needed to}} ensure calm in Texas. He ordered his brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos to bring approximately 500soldiers to Texas. Cos and his men arrived in Goliad on October 2. Three days later, after learning of the events at Gonzales, the soldiers left for San Antonio de Béxar.|$|E

5|$|In October, Texians engaged Mexican {{troops in}} the first {{official}} battle of the Texas Revolution. Determined to quell the rebellion, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> began assembling a large force, the Army of Operations in Texas, to restore order. Most of his soldiers were raw recruits, {{and a large number}} had been forcibly conscripted.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{convince}} other slaves in Texas to support the Mexican government over the Texian rebellion, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> spared Travis' slave, Joe. The day after the battle, he interviewed each noncombatant individually. Impressed with Susanna Dickinson, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> offered to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico City. Dickinson refused the offer, which was not extended to Juana Navarro Alsbury although her son was of similar age. Each woman was given a blanket and two silver pesos. Alsbury and the other Tejano women were {{allowed to return to}} their homes in Béxar; Dickinson, her daughter and Joe were sent to Gonzales, escorted by Ben. They were encouraged to relate the events of the battle, and to inform the remainder of the Texian forces that Santa Anna's army was unbeatable.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna</b> interviewed {{each of the}} {{survivors}} individually. He was impressed with Susanna Dickinson, the young widow of Alamo artillery captain Almaron Dickinson, and offered to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico City. Susanna Dickinson refused the offer, which was not extended to Juana Navarro Alsbury for her son who was of similar age.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the revolt}} began in October 1835, a {{majority}} of the Texas colonists remained loyal to Mexico. [...] "The Consultation", a meeting at San Felipe de Austin on November 7, 1835 resulted in a statement that the colonists were defending the republican principles of the Mexican Constitution of 1824. This statement emboldened <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> exiled opponents in the United States. Mexican General José Antonio Mexía and several other political opponents of <b>Santa</b> <b>Anna's</b> opponents fled to New Orleans, USA where they planned to resist the Centralist government.
