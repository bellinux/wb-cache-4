5|$|Exits are {{numbered}} <b>sequentially</b> (unlike other interstates in Maryland which use a milepost-based system), {{and in a}} clockwise (inner loop) direction, in accordance with AASHTO guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Most Python {{implementations}} (including CPython) {{include a}} read–eval–print loop (REPL), meaning they can {{function as a}} command line interpreter, for which the user enters statements <b>sequentially</b> and receives the results immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{signal is}} still hoisted on the Victory at her dry dock in Portsmouth on Trafalgar Day (21 October) every year, {{although}} the signal flags are displayed all at once, running from fore to aft, rather than hoisted <b>sequentially</b> from the mizzenmast.|$|E
5|$|When an SSD {{is writing}} {{large amounts of}} data <b>sequentially,</b> the write {{amplification}} is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled <b>sequentially</b> with data related to the same file. If the OS determines that file is to be replaced or deleted, the entire block can be marked as invalid, {{and there is no}} need to read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another block. It will need only to be erased, which is much easier and faster than the read-erase-modify-write process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection.|$|E
5|$|As {{the morning}} progressed {{and the light}} changed he would switch to <b>sequentially</b> later canvas settings, {{sometimes}} working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light. The process would be repeated {{over the course of}} days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase. Scanning, in which alternatives are presented to the user <b>sequentially,</b> became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included both digitized and synthesized speech.|$|E
5|$|In Your House (retroactively titled In Your House: Premiere, and <b>sequentially</b> {{known as}} In Your House 1) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which took place on May 14, 1995, at the Onondaga War Memorial in Syracuse, New York. It was the first pay-per-view of the In Your House series and consisted of ten professional wrestling matches.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{prior to}} modern DNA analysis developed remarkably prescient theories. The gene itself was first proposed and named W in 1948. In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting might be arranged <b>sequentially</b> along one chromosome, thus allowing for the varied expression of dominant white. He also proposed that other, distant genes might also influence the amount of white present.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{used more}} than one launch vehicle for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle {{combination}} series numbers: AS-10x for Saturn I, AS-20x for Saturn IB, and AS-50x for Saturn V (compare Mercury-Redstone 3, Mercury-Atlas 6) to designate and plan all missions, rather than numbering them <b>sequentially</b> as in Project Gemini. This was changed by the time manned flights began.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy {{authorized}} a {{total of}} nine U-101-class submarines, six numbered <b>sequentially</b> from U-101 to U-106, and another three, U-118 to U-120. Upon completion of the first six U-101 boats, the Navy intended to scrap its oldest six boats, U-1 to U-6, and drop the first two digits from the new boats so that, for example, U-101 would become the new U-1. In late 1917 and early 1918 the first three boats, U-101 to U-103, were laid down by Austriawerft at Trieste.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by <b>sequentially</b> inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} protagonist Chell waking {{up from a}} stasis bed and hearing {{instructions}} and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about the upcoming test experience. Chell then enters into distinct test chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, <b>sequentially.</b> GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person. Chell is promised cake and grief counseling as her reward if she manages to complete all the test chambers.|$|E
5|$|The track layout is {{such that}} each line has its own pair of tracks {{and a pair of}} double {{switches}} between these tracks, and each service has its own island platform serving these tracks. In regular operation, no service needs to cross over the tracks of another service. The tracks are numbered <b>sequentially</b> from east to west, with the N train at tracks 1 and 2; the Q at tracks 3 and 4; the F at tracks 5 and 6; and the D at tracks 7 and 8.|$|E
5|$|WrestleMania (<b>sequentially</b> {{known as}} WrestleMania I) was the inaugural WrestleMania {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event (only in selected areas), {{produced by the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The attendance for the event was 19,121. The event was seen by over one million viewers through closed-circuit television, making it the largest showing of an event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table <b>sequentially</b> starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E
5|$|Between 1951 and 1960 a {{national}} service scheme had operated and {{during this time}} the CMF's numbers remained reasonably steady. However, in 1960 the scheme was suspended and the Australian Army was reorganised {{with the introduction of}} the Pentropic divisional structure. As a result of this the CMF was greatly reduced and 14 infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while many others were amalgamated into the battalions of the six <b>sequentially</b> numbered multi-battalion State-based regiments. As a result of this, on 1 July 1960, the 2nd Battalion became part of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, and was reduced to a company-sized element of the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR), forming 'C' Company (City of Newcastle Company). Just prior to this, on 30 April 1960, the battalion had been afforded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after <b>sequentially</b> completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Flowering {{begins in}} February {{and is usually}} {{finished}} {{by the end of}} June. The species has an unusually low rate of flowering: even at the peak of its flowering season, it averages less than seven inflorescences per plant flowering at any one time. Individual flowers open <b>sequentially</b> from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the day than at night, with a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.|$|E
5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops {{incubating}} the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid <b>sequentially,</b> they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will {{need to be able to}} cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged <b>sequentially</b> {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} the longest on record, with both an unusually early start and unusually late ending. Most {{activity}} was from November through February. According to the Météo-France office (MFR) at Réunion, there were 21 tropical disturbances, 14 of which intensified into tropical depressions. There were 12named storms, beginning with Antoinette and proceeding <b>sequentially</b> until Lisette. In addition, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also warned on storms in the region, which identified five other tropical storms. Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute maximum sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph); of these, three strengthened further into intense tropical cyclones, with Daniella and Helinda tied for strongest storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, was {{the single}} bloodiest day in American {{military}} history. The outnumbered Confederate forces fought desperately and well. Despite significant advantages in manpower, McClellan was unable to concentrate his forces effectively, which meant that Lee was able to shift his defenders to parry each of three Union thrusts, launched separately and <b>sequentially</b> against the Confederate left, center, and finally the right. McClellan was also unwilling, due to Porter's opinion, to employ his ample reserve forces to capitalize on localized successes. Historian James M. McPherson {{has pointed out that}} the two corps McClellan kept in reserve were in fact larger than Lee's entire force. The reason for McClellan's reluctance was that, as in previous battles, he was convinced he was outnumbered.|$|E
5|$|The Chapels {{which were}} circumambulated <b>sequentially</b> are: the Dusum Sangye Lhakhang which housed statues of “Buddhas of Three Times” and Eight Bodhistavas; the Tamdrin Lhakhang housed the main image of Hayagriva; the Jhampa Lhakhang {{contained}} images of Maitreya, Eleven-faced Mahakarunika, and Tsongkhapa with his disciples amidst a coveted library; the Tsongkhapa Lhakhang {{with images of}} Tsongkhapa with his best students, main Lamas of Sera Je, Nagarjuna and other Buddhist commentators of India, gate keepers Havagriva and Acala; the Jampeyang Lhakhang to the north-east had two images of Manjushri, one in a Dharmacakramudra (teaching pose) looking towards the Debating Courtyard.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired oligonucleotide, the {{building}} blocks are <b>sequentially</b> coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15–25 bases in length.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed <b>sequentially,</b> similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} used {{approach}} to multiple sequence alignments uses a heuristic search known as progressive technique (also known as the hierarchical or tree method) developed by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1984. Progressive alignment builds up a final MSA by combining pairwise alignments beginning with the most similar pair and progressing to the most distantly related. All progressive alignment methods require two stages: a first stage in which {{the relationships between the}} sequences are represented as a tree, called a guide tree, and a second step in which the MSA is built by adding the sequences <b>sequentially</b> to the growing MSA according to the guide tree. The initial guide tree is determined by an efficient clustering method such as neighbor-joining or UPGMA, and may use distances {{based on the number of}} identical two letter sub-sequences (as in FASTA rather than a dynamic programming alignment).|$|E

25|$|Computer {{keyboards}} include {{control circuitry}} to convert key presses into key codes (usually scancodes) that the computer's electronics can understand. The key switches are connected via the {{printed circuit board}} in an electrical X-Y matrix where a voltage is provided <b>sequentially</b> to the Y lines and, when a key is depressed, detected <b>sequentially</b> by scanning the X lines.|$|E
