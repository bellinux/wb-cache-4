50|$|The siphon valve {{is simply}} {{based upon the}} <b>siphon</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> When the {{cross section of the}} channel is small enough, the liquid in the chamber is able to flow along the channel due to surface tension. Unlike {{hydrophilic}} or hydrophobic valves, surface tension acts as a pump in this model while centrifugal force acts as resistance instead.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In the era {{of water}} scarcity, saving toilet water {{is one of the}} most {{effective}} ways to save water. In this study, two-phase flow for the development of highly-efficient toilet has been analysed with VOF(Volume Of Fluid) method. Since the whole model requires extensive computing time, part of the whole model has also been adopted to reduce the analysis time. Four different rim models were considered for flow distribution analysis and sizes of rim holes were found to become more important rather than locations or numbers of rim holes in achieving flow distribution effectively. In addition, velocity and pressure of two-phase flow due to <b>siphon</b> <b>phenomenon</b> have been studied through the analysis of whole model. Therefore, this study provides...|$|E
40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of {{research}} reactors, the water level must be maintained above the required height. When a pipe ruptures, the <b>siphon</b> <b>phenomenon</b> causes continuous loss of coolant until the hydraulic head is removed. To protect the reactor core from this kind of accident, a siphon breaker has been suggested as a passive safety device. This study mainly focused on two variables: the size of the pipe rupture and the timing of air entrainment. In this study, the size of the pipe rupture was increased to the guillotine break case. There was a region in which a larger pipe rupture did not need a larger siphon breaker, and the water flow rate was related {{to the size of the}} pipe rupture and affected the residual water quantity. The timing of air entrainment was predicted to influence residual water level. However, the residual water level was not affected by the timing of air entrainment. The experimental cases, which showed the characteristic of partical sweep-out mode in the separation of siphon breaking phenomenon [2], showed almost same trend of physical properties...|$|E
