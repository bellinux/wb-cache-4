5000|$|It's {{difficult}} for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because of reduced sporulation from red oaks and <b>summerwood</b> cell development. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried in from upwind and the re-opening of oaks' 2011 earlywood cells. The oak wilt fungus {{is too large}} to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This increased the chances of infection to storm damaged oaks 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.One year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park [...] in Pine County, Minnesota. Wounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres, presents {{a serious threat to}} the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. The only way you get that broad of coverage for infection in mid-summer is, huge spore supplies and the re-opening of that years' early wood cells.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} wood-anatomical {{variables}} in a ring-porous oak (bur oak, Quercus macrocarpa Michx.) growing in southeastern Nebraska exhibit sensitivity to yearly variations in climate. Factor {{analysis of these}} variables reveals the existence of independent sources of variance that {{can be related to}} conductivity and vulnerability to water stress. The early and late woods vary in their response to climate, with vessel diameter being related negatively to precipitation in the spring wood and positively in the summer wood. The variables also exhibit sensitivity to temperature during the winter half-year. Ring width varies with <b>summerwood</b> characteristics and exhibits precipitation sensitivity somewhat less than <b>summerwood</b> vessel diameter, results that were found to hold in several other ring-porous species; the precipitation sensitivity of ring width appears to be indirect, being related to the positive association between precipitation and <b>summerwood</b> vessel diameter. Three variables [...] <b>summerwood</b> vessel diameter, springwood vessel diameter, and diameter of the largest springwood vessel [...] are representative of the three axes of variance among the variables and were incorporated into climate-reconstruction models. Multiple-regression models for precipitation October-May, total snow, and heating degree days were developed and tested. Equations incorporating the three diameter-related variables gave unsuccessful results when tested against independent climatic data. Equations for precipitation October-June incorporating <b>summerwood</b> vessel diameter only were successful in reproducing the independent data set (r =. 87, p =. 001). Vessel diameter of the summer wood thus holds most promise for future reconstruction work. Occurrence of trees with ring-porous wood is related to limiting climatic factors; percentages increase with decreasing precipitation and fall off in the poleward direction where winter temperature extremes become pronounced. Per cent of ring-porous species is a measure that can be applied to fossil floras to yield information on paleoclimates; an analysis of a Sangamon flora fron the Toronto area {{is an example of the}} application of this measure. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{discussion of}} variation in <b>summerwood</b> and springwood contents among conifers. Three methods of measuring these, by cross-sectional area of logs, by dry-weight fibre percentage, and by nominal specific gravity, are compared. High-summerwood tissues have a nominal specific gravity of 0 - 45 or over; low-summerwood tissues have a specific gravity below 0 - 45. All conifers have a low summer-wood content in their juvenile wood or core wood formed towards their stem-tips. In Pinus, Larix, and Pseudotsitga the <b>summerwood</b> percentage increases markedly with age, {{but only in the}} outer layers towards the butt; in Picea, Abies, and Tsttga similar increases occur, but high-summerwood tissues are seldom found. Within any species, and for any particular growth rate, low-summerwood tissues are characteristic of regions of high relative humidity where summer water deficits rarely occur, such as high alti-tudes, far northern latitudes, and the maritime climate of western Britain. High-summer-wood tissues develop where summer temperatures are high, with associated strong sunshine, low relative humidity, and frequent summer water deficits. High-summerwood tissues have greater strength in compression and bending, relativ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Three {{species of}} true firs in the Pacific Northwest [...] Abies gran-dis, grand fir; A. amabilis, Pacific silver fir; and A. lasiocarpa, subalpine fir [...] are {{severely}} damaged or {{killed by an}} imported insect pest, the balsam woolly aphid (Chermes (Adelges) piceae Ratz.), Infestations of this insect cause abnormalities in the wood and, in some cases, result in death of the tree. Wood samples were collected from five infested and five noninfested trees {{of each of the}} three species. Cross, radial, and tangential sections were taken from the wood samples, and samples were also macerated to separate the cells. Measurements were made of four anatomical characteristics: cell wall thickness, cell width, fibril angle, and tracheid length. Measurements were made of wood that was produced before infestation of the tree, wood of the same tree that was produced after infestation, and wood of noninfested trees. Wood produced after infestation in all three species is like compression wood in that the percentage of <b>summerwood</b> is greatly increased, tracheids are round in cross section, intercellular spaces are present, microscopic checking occurs in the cell waIIs, and false rings are present. The number of rays is almost double the number found in noninfested trees, and the diameter of the ray cells appears to be greater. Springwood cell walls of infested trees are sinuous in nature. Traumatic resin canals in tangential bands may be differentiated {{at any time during the}} growing season. Cell walls of the springwood of infested trees were significantly thicker than the springwood ceII walls of wood produced before infestation and also of noninfested trees for all three species, but there were no differences with regard to the <b>summerwood.</b> There were no significant differences in cell width for wood from each species. This was true for both springwood and <b>summerwood.</b> Fibril angle in the <b>summerwood</b> and transition area in infested trees of each species was two to three times greater than the angle found in wood produced before infestation and in noninfested trees. No differences in the fibril angle in springwood occurred. Tracheid length in infested wood was considerably reduced following infestation. Tracheids of wood produced before infestation, and in noninfested trees, were approximately one and one-half to two times longer than tracheids of infested trees...|$|E

The micrographie study of cross sections of Spruce wood (Piceaexcclsa Link.) shows that the larger is e ({{width of the}} annual ring) the larger are the variations of the radial and tangential sizes of theMis, and the shape of the cross section tends to turn hexagonal. f f we cali the relation between the springwood celi maximum andminimum tangential sizes t, and this same relation for radial sizes r,we obtain two curves t f (e) and r f (e), which are increasingf rom e = I mm, and which tend towards a level with inflexion pointand change in the orientation of the concavity at about e 2, 5 mm. The curve V r/t is approximately a horizontal straight line, ther curve being also higher than the t one.

As to the disorganization of the springwood structure, it is especiallymarked in thick rings.

This behavior is apparently suggested as “selection” mechanism, as indicated by the concentration of excavation and foraging activities on the softer part of the timber, i.e., the springwood. Both the foraging activities of individuals in the Spruce A timber in excavating tunnel-galleries and the nest-founding activities of the royal pair in the other two timbers were observed to occur on the springwood, and the termites were seen to avoid the <b>summerwood</b> (Figs.  2, 3, 4).|$|E

40|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 1900 :th century the paper making process was handicraft. The paper machines that have been developed since then are as impressing in size as fascinating {{when it comes to the}} technique. The process has always been improved to give a better paper for lower costs, with as short manufacture time as possible. Stratified forming has been a reality since 1830. From {{the beginning}} it was applied to board and paperboard. Now it is also the most common method for making tissue and one paper mill in Austria use it for fine paper. Stratified forming can be categorized as separate forming or simultaneous forming. Separate forming means using several headboxes and sometimes even several wires. Simultaneous forming means using only one stratified headbox. This method has many advantages over separate forming, inter alia improved economy, quality, wood exchange and higher runability of the paper machine. Several experiments have been done with simultaneous forming of different fibres by placing a fibre with high bulk in the middle layer and a smooth fibre on the surface layers. The results has shown that by using this method both the bending stiffness and surface properties are improved, or a lower grammage paper is obtained with maintaining quality. Simultaneous forming can also be used to stratify fillers in layers where they are most efficient. In that way both paper quality and economy is improved. Simultaneous forming is also used for fractionated pulp. Fractionation means separating springwood fibre from <b>summerwood</b> fibre, and placing them in separate layers.
