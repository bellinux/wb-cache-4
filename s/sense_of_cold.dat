40|$|International audienceThe human {{population}} is increasing {{at an alarming}} rate, whereas {{at the same time}} agricultural productivity is decreasing due to the effect of various environmental problems. In particular, cold stress is a serious threat to the sustainability of crop yields. Indeed, cold stress can lead to major crop losses. Various phenotypic symptoms in response to cold stress include poor germination, stunted seedlings, yellowing of leaves (chlorosis), reduced leaf expansion and wilting, and may lead to death <b>of</b> tissue (necrosis). <b>Cold</b> stress also severely hampers the reproductive development of plants. The major negative effect <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> stress is that it induces severe membrane damage. This damage is largely due to the acute dehydration associated with freezing during cold stress. Cold stress is perceived by the receptor at the cell membrane. Then a signal is transduced to switch on the cold-responsive genes and transcription factors for mediating stress tolerance. Understanding the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> stress tolerance and genes involved in the cold stress signaling network is important for crop improvement. Here, I review cold stress tolerance mechanisms in plants. The major points discussed are the following: (1) physiological effects <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> stress, (2) <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> temperatures and signal transduction, and (3) the role of various cold-responsive genes and transcription factors in the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> stress tolerance...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBeige fat, which {{expresses the}} thermogenic protein UCP 1, {{provides}} {{a defense against}} cold and obesity. Although a cold environment is the physiologic stimulus for inducing beige fat in mice and humans, the events that lead from the <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> {{to the development of}} beige fat remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the efferent beige fat thermogenic circuit, consisting of eosinophils, type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL) - 4 / 13, and alternatively activated macrophages. Genetic loss of eosinophils or IL- 4 / 13 signaling impairs cold-induced biogenesis of beige fat. Mechanistically, macrophages recruited to cold-stressed subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) undergo alternative activation to induce tyrosine hydroxylase expression and catecholamine production, factors required for browning of scWAT. Conversely, administration of IL- 4 to thermoneutral mice increases beige fat mass and thermogenic capacity to ameliorate pre-established obesity. Together, our findings have uncovered the efferent circuit controlling biogenesis of beige fat and provide support for its targeting to treat obesity...|$|R

For food they had the best part of a bag of biscuits weighing about a hundred pounds. Also there was the cask of rum, which the men had moved into their own hut. But that was not all, for there were plenty of shellfish about if they could find means to cook them, while the rocks around were covered with hundreds of penguins, including specimens of the great [...] "King penguin," [...] which only required to be knocked on the head. There was, therefore, little fear of their perishing of starvation, as sometimes happens to ship wrecked people. Indeed, immediately after dinner, the two sailors went out and returned with as many birds' eggs--mostly penguin--as they could carry in their hats. Scarcely had they got in, however, when the rain, which is the prevailing characteristic of these latitudes, set in, in the most pitiless fashion; and soon the great mountains with which they were surrounded, and those before them, were wrapped in dense veils of fleecy vapour. Hour after hour the rain fell without ceasing, penetrating through their miserable roof, and falling--drop, drip, drop--upon the sodden floor. Augusta sat by herself in the smaller hut, doing what she could to amuse little Dick by telling him stories. Nobody knows how hard she found it to have to invent stories when she was thus overwhelmed with misfortune; but {{it was the only way}} of keeping the poor child from crying, as the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> and misery forced itself into his little heart.

6000|$|The Highlanders, {{sheltered}} {{by their}} plaids, {{lay down on}} the heath comfortably enough, but the Lowlanders had no protection whatever. Rob Roy observing this, directed one of his followers to afford the old man a portion of his plaid; [...] "for the callant (boy), he may," [...] said the freebooter, [...] "keep himself warm by walking about and watching the cattle." [...] My informant heard this sentence with no small distress; and as the frost wind grew more and more cutting, it seemed to freeze the very blood in his young veins. He had been exposed to weather all his life, he said, but never could forget the cold of that night; insomuch that, in the bitterness of his heart, he cursed the bright moon for giving no heat with so much light. At length the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> and weariness became so intolerable that he resolved to desert his watch to seek some repose and shelter. With that purpose he couched himself down behind one of the most bulky of the Highlanders, who acted as lieutenant to the party. Not satisfied with having secured the shelter of the man's large person, he coveted a share of his plaid, and by imperceptible degrees drew a corner of it round him. He was now comparatively in paradise, and slept sound till daybreak, when he awoke, and was terribly afraid on observing that his nocturnal operations had altogether uncovered the dhuiniewassell's neck and shoulders, which, lacking the plaid which should have protected them, were covered with cranreuch (i.e. hoar frost). The lad rose in great dread of a beating, at least, when it should be found how luxuriously he had been accommodated at the expense of a principal person of the party. Good Mr. Lieutenant, however, got up and shook himself, rubbing off the hoar frost with his plaid, and muttering something of a cauld neight. They then drove on the cattle, which were restored to their owner without farther adventure--The above can hardly be termed a tale, but yet it contains materials both for the poet and artist.|$|E
60|$|XIII. Of these {{limitations}} the first consequence is, that positive shade {{is a more}} necessary and more sublime thing in an architect's hands than in a painter's. For the latter being able to temper his light with an under-tone throughout, {{and to make it}} delightful with sweet color, or awful with lurid color, and to represent distance, and air, and sun, by the depth of it, and fill its whole space with expression, can deal with an enormous, nay, almost with an universal extent of it, and the best painters most delight in such extent; but as light, with the architect, is nearly always liable to become full and untempered sunshine seen upon solid surface, his only rests, and his chief means of sublimity, are definite shades. So that, after size and weight, the Power of architecture may be said to depend on the quantity (whether measured in space or intenseness) of its shadow; and it seems to me, that the reality of its works, and the use and influence they have in the daily life of men (as opposed to those works of art with which we have nothing to do but in times of rest or of pleasure) require of it that it should express a kind of human sympathy, by a measure of darkness as great as there is in human life: and that as the great poem and great fiction generally affect us most by the majesty of their masses of shade, and cannot take hold upon us if they affect a continuance of lyric sprightliness, but must be serious often, and sometimes melancholy, else they do not express the truth of this wild world of ours; so there must be, in this magnificently human art of architecture, some equivalent expression for the trouble and wrath of life, for its sorrow and its mystery: and this it can only give by depth or diffusion of gloom, by the frown upon its front, and the shadow of its recess. So that Rembrandtism is a noble manner in architecture, though a false one in painting; and I do not believe that ever any building was truly great, unless it had mighty masses, vigorous and deep, of shadow mingled with its surface. And among the first habits that a young architect should learn, is that of thinking in shadow, not looking at a design in its miserable liny skeleton; but conceiving it as it will be when the dawn lights it, and the dusk leaves it; when its stones will be hot and its crannies cool; when the lizards will bask on the one, and the birds build in the other. Let him design with the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> and heat upon him; let him cut out the shadows, as men dig wells in unwatered plains; and lead along the lights, as a founder does his hot metal; let him keep the full command of both, and see that he knows how they fall, and where they fade. His paper lines and proportions are of no value: all that he has to do must be done by spaces of light and darkness; and his business is to see that the one is broad and bold enough not to be swallowed up by twilight, and the other deep enough not to be dried like a shallow pool by a noon-day sun.|$|E

40|$|Vernalization, <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> {{prolonged}} <b>cold,</b> {{is important}} for seasonal flowering in eudicots and monocots. While vernalization silences a repressor (FLC, MADS-box transcription factor) in eudicots, it induces an activator (TaVRN 1, an AP 1 clade MADS-box transcription factor) in monocots. The mechanism for TaVRN 1 induction during vernalization is not well understood. Here we reveal a novel mechanism for controlling TaVRN 1 mRNA accumulation in response to prolonged cold sensing in wheat. The carbohydrate-binding protein VER 2, a jacalin lectin, promotes TaVRN 1 upregulation by physically interacting with the RNA-binding protein TaGRP 2. TaGRP 2 binds to TaVRN 1 pre-mRNA and inhibits TaVRN 1 mRNA accumulation. The physical interaction between VER 2 and TaGRP 2 is controlled by TaGRP 2 O-GlcNAc modification, which gradually increases during vernalization. The interaction between VER 2 and O-GlcNAc-TaGRP 2 reduces TaGRP 2 protein accumulation in the nucleus and/or promotes TaGRP 2 dissociation from TaVRN 1, leading to TaVRN 1 mRNA accumulation...|$|R
