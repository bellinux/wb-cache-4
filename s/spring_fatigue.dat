5000|$|Some makes of air guns {{incorporate}} a gas spring (commonly {{referred to as}} a gas piston, gas ram, gas strut or nitro piston) instead of a mechanical coil spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlet and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts in effect as a pneumatic accumulator. Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures when cocked. The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term <b>spring</b> <b>fatigue,</b> smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster [...] "lock time" [...] (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy.

These unfavorable residual stresses are partially eliminated by the heat treatment. In this process, the spring is heated uniformly below the material transformation temperature. An experimental investigation has been conducted to assess the stress relief influence on helical <b>spring</b> <b>fatigue</b> properties. First, S–N curves were determined for springs treated under different conditions (times and temperatures) on a testing machine specially designed to do this task. Next the stress relief effect on spring relaxation induced by cyclic loading was evaluated.

The ASC development, funded by NASA s Science Mission Directorate, started as a technology development effort in 2003 and has since evolved through progressive convertor builds and successful testing to demonstrate high conversion efficiency, low mass, and capability to meet long-life Radioisotope Power System (RPS) requirements.

40|$|Condition-based health {{monitoring}} systems {{are a very}} important addition to machinery to monitor the system and assure it is running at the peak efficiency, to schedule maintenance, and prevent catastrophic failure. Many times these systems are combined with different sensors to predict when service is required for different wear parts and this keeps the machine running optimally. An accurate prediction of health is accomplished by measuring and analyzing different critical parameters and detecting when these parameters deviate from the nominal values. Recently, these systems have started to become more common on industrial compression technology. Typically, reciprocating compressor {{health monitoring}} systems only use indirect measurements, P-V diagrams, to monitor {{the health of the}} system. This research focuses on improving these monitoring systems. Specifically this research will focus on three different valve failure modes that are common in reciprocating compressors. They are liquid slugging, valve <b>spring</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and valve seat wear. These faults are investigated first through a system level model to better understand how different subsystem dynamics are related through the compressor. Also an instrument investigation is conducted to determine what types of sensors are the most effective at detecting these faults. The Bayesian classification method is used in conjunction with seeded fault training data to create a classifier that can determine the state of health of the machine. The classification approach can be integrated into health monitoring software to be used in different reciprocating compressors...|$|E
40|$|Automated manual {{transmissions}} {{based on}} dry clutch are wide spreading in modern automotive transmissions {{because of the}} possible improvements in performance and comfort with respect to manual transmissions. A key issue for an efficient control of electro-actuated dry clutch transmissions is {{the knowledge of the}} clutch torque transmitted during the engagement. The torque transmitted by the clutch can be directly measured by means of setups which are difficult to be implemented in commercial products. Therefore it is fundamental to define an accurate torque transmissibility model to be exploited for the estimation of the clutch torque. A possible estimator is based on the inversion of the driveline dynamic model like showed by Gliemo et al. (2006) and by Amari et al. (2009), but the robustness of this type of estimation drastically depends on the availability of the system parameters and on clutch disk acceleration and engine torque measurements. As proposed by Vasca et al. (2008), a possible alternative consists in using an analytical model describing the friction phenomena and providing the torque transmitted by the clutch starting from the throwout bearing position. Unfortunately, the nominal characteristic (torque vs position) is influenced by several variables. Some of them, such as friction pads wear and diaphragm <b>spring</b> <b>fatigue,</b> have a “long term” effect, like showed by Mauro et al. (2002). Other variables have a direct influence also on each engagement maneuver. These variables, such as slipping speed, pressure, slipping acceleration and temperature affect the friction coefficient, as tested by Senatore et al. (2011), Feng et al. (2010) and by LuK (1996), and the normal force (D’Agostino et al., 2012) (Cappetti et al., 2012). The difficulties in representing the contributions of the different variables in the clutch torque transmissibility characteristic lead to the definition of corresponding lumped models, so as in the works of Myklebust et al. (2012; 2013). In this paper a temperature dependent torque transmissibility model for dry clutch transmissions is proposed. The model estimates the clutch torque by considering separately the influence of the slipping speed and temperature on the friction coefficient and the influence of the temperature on the normal force determined by the flat spring. In order to estimate the temperatures of interest, two thermal models of a dry dual clutch transmission with a central disk are proposed. The temperatures estimated by means of the proposed thermal models are then used for the analysis of open loop and closed loop operating conditions in a realistic dry dual clutch transmission...|$|E

40|$|There was an {{accident}} to a fighter aircraft. Investigation revealed that the accident was caused due to loss {{of power in the}} engine as a result of failure in the main fuel pump (MFP). The MFP was multi-plunger type. On dis-assembly, the MFP was found severely damaged and there were fractures in one plunger and four springs. Through systematic metallurgical investigation and analysis, the sequence of events leading to the failure in the MFP was established. The primary failure in the MFP was the <b>fatigue</b> fracture of <b>springs.</b> The <b>fatigue</b> crack initiation could be attributed to pitting corrosion {{on the surface of the}} springs. Because of multiple fractures in one of the springs, there was impact load on the corresponding plunger, which resulted in generation of an overload crack. This crack had further propagated progressively by fatigue mechanism culminating in fracture and loss of material from the side wall of the plunger. Subsequently, there was fuel leakage internally in the MFP with the resultant reduction in the fuel delivery pressure. Due to insufficient fuel supply, there was winding down of the engine RPM leading to loss of thrust. After establishing the sequence of failure in the MFP, investigation was carried out to identify the cause for the corrosion on the surface of the springs. It was established that the raw material (wires) used for the manufacture of the springs had developed corrosion pits on the surface due to improper storage...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue cracks are {{observed}} {{much earlier than}} expected in ships and marine structures due to uncertainties in the fatigue design process, such as encountered sea environments and variability in S-N curves, etc. The current study presents the theoretical development and validation of a fatigue model useful for ship routing which may contribute to better utilisation of the materials and structures by more wise operation of them. During the theoretical development of the ship routing fatigue model, various models to estimate fatigue damage intensity, including both cycle counting calculations and spectral approximations, are reviewed. The proposed ship routing fatigue model {{is a function of}} operation profiles, i. e., heading angle and ship speed, as well as encountered wave environments (significant wave height), which are easily available in today’s commercial routing tool systems. Concerning the characteristics of ship response, the so-called narrow-band approximation is adopted and further simplified in order to estimate the fatigue damage in ships under an arbitrary stationary sea state. Long-term fatigue damage is estimated by a summation of fatigue damages in all encountered sea states during, for example, one voyage or a period of several years. Further, fatigue damage due to wave-induced vibrations (whipping and <b>springing)</b> and <b>fatigue</b> damage caused by various stress components are also studied and discussed. A validation using response from full-scalemeasurements and numerical analysis is presented. It shows that the proposed model works very well in comparison with the rainflow counting method. Finally, the proposed ship routing fatigue model is applied on real case scenarios, where its applicability in shipping industry is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|A {{discrete}} {{damage zone}} model (DDZM) is developed within the finite element framework to simulate mode-mix ratio- and temperature-dependent delamination in laminated composite materials undergoing {{high cycle fatigue}} loading. In the DDZM, discrete spring elements are placed at the finite element nodes along the laminate interface. Static and fatigue damage laws are used to define {{the behavior of the}} spring elements and model irreversible damage growth. The static damage model parameters are obtained from known material properties and fracture mechanics principles. The fatigue damage model parameters are obtained by calibrating the model to fit published experimental data, and the variation of fatigue parameters with mode-mix ratio is given by a quadratic relation. The DDZM predicts crack growth rates that are in agreement with those given from published literature in which a quadratic relation is used to obtain Paris law parameters for different mode-mix ratios, thus validating the approach. Temperature dependance is implemented using an Arrhenius relation for fatigue damage model parameters, and the critical fracture energy varies with temperature as well. Although the model captures the temperature effects on delamination for mode I and 50 % mode II, the prediction deviates from experiments for pure mode II, because the corresponding damage mechanism entirely changes with temperature. The DDZM converges upon mesh refinement, given that the mesh size used for calibrating model parameters is sufficiently small. The mechanisms driving static and fatigue damage for different static model parameters (i. e., initial stiffness and critical separation) and their influence on overall damage growth are also investigated. It was found that for a low initial <b>spring</b> stiffness <b>fatigue</b> damage dominates the total damage growth, whereas for a large initial stiffness static damage dominates. For intermediate initial stiffnesses, the growth of static and fatigue damage becomes sensitive to mesh size, and model convergence is difficult to attain...|$|R

The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 Carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 Carbine (and late production M1 Carbines) {{if it is to be}} used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines.
