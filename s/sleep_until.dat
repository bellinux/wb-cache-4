5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then <b>sleep</b> <b>until</b> midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E

The year is 2074 and most of humanity was killed by Radical-6 after it was unleashed by Free the Soul from a Mars mission test site in 2028. They re-enter the facility and discover a cold sleep pod. K explains that each person {{was brought to the}} facility to recreate the events that Zero Sr. and Akane had previously experienced.

5|$|Immortal Throne {{features}} multiple additions and alterations over Titan Quest. The main addition {{is a new}} Mastery titled Dream Mastery: {{available to}} new players {{from the start of}} the main campaign, it is a magic-focused skill that relies on illusion and stasis effects to disrupt enemy groups. Among the abilities available are putting nearby enemies to <b>sleep</b> <b>until</b> they are hit by a weapon strike, turning enemies on each other, and effects which make enemies take damage when they strike the player or faster health and energy recovery. In addition to extra quests, new items and equipment are included. An additional item slot for the player character is reserved for Artifacts, charms crafted for the player by Enchanters after the player discovers enough Arcane Formulae after defeating enemies. Artifacts are divided into three levels (Lesser, Greater and Divine), which grant a variety of status effects depending on their level. A separate type of item are Scrolls, expendable items that produce powerful effects and can be equipped in a similar fashion to healing potions. Additional sellers and storage Caravans are included in between towns. Multiplayer functions return from the original game, while adding refinements such as the ability to automatically join parties and engage in player-versus-player matches.|$|E
5|$|Aurora {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead <b>sleep</b> <b>until</b> she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

500|$|In Welsh folklore, {{the summit}} of Snowdon {{is said to be}} the tomb of Rhitta Gawr, a giant. This is claimed to be the reason for the Welsh name Yr Wyddfa, {{literally}} meaning [...] "the tumulus". Rhitta Gawr wore a cloak made of men's beards, and was slain by King Arthur after claiming Arthur's beard. Other sites with Arthurian connections include Bwlch y Saethau, on the ridge between Snowdon and Y Lliwedd, where Arthur himself is said to have died. A cairn, Carnedd Arthur, was erected at the site and was still standing as late as 1850, but no longer exists. According to the folklore, Arthur had Bedivere throw his sword Excalibur into Glaslyn, where Arthur's body was later placed in a boat to be carried away to Afallon. Arthur's men then retreated to a cave on the slopes of Y Lliwedd, where they are said to <b>sleep</b> <b>until</b> such time as they are needed.

500|$|In the Middle Ages, knighthood {{was often}} conferred with {{elaborate}} ceremonies. These usually involved the knight-to-be taking a bath (possibly symbolic of spiritual purification) {{during which he}} was instructed in the duties of [...] knighthood by more senior knights.

At dawn he made confession and attended Mass, then retired to his bed to <b>sleep</b> <b>until</b> it was fully daylight. He was then brought before the King, who after instructing two senior knights to buckle the spurs to the knight-elect's heels, fastened a belt around his waist, then struck him on the neck (with either a hand or a sword), thus making him a knight. It was this accolade which was the essential act in creating a knight, and a simpler ceremony developed, conferring knighthood merely by striking or touching the knight-to-be on the shoulder with a sword, or [...] "dubbing" [...] him, as is still done today. In the early medieval period the difference seems to have been that the full ceremonies were used for men from more prominent families.|$|E

If they are allowed to follow their own schedules, e.g. sleeping from 3:00am to 12:00 noon, their sleep is improved and they may not experience excessive daytime sleepiness.
