25|$|In April 2016, the Clinton {{campaign}} {{began to}} compile a list of 15 to 20 individuals to vet for the position of running mate, even though Sanders continued to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries. In mid-June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton's shortlist included Representative Xavier Becerra from California, Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro from Texas, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti from California, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, Labor Secretary Tom Perez from Maryland, Representative Tim Ryan from Ohio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. Subsequent reports stated that Clinton was also considering Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, retired Admiral James Stavridis, and Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado. In discussing her potential vice presidential choice, Clinton stated {{that the most important}} attribute <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> was the ability and experience to immediately step into the role of president.|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt {{was earning}} a {{substantial}} amount at the theater, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from Parc Monceau. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theater of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theater impresario named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that she give private performances {{in the homes of}} wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than her monthly salary with the Comédie. When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theater in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, saying that that Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of Phédre on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, Le Misantrhope and Les Précieuses.|$|E
500|$|Hill did {{not regard}} sport {{climbing}} {{to be real}} climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 {{and went back to}} traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, [...] "the thing I didn't like too much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn't start out training on artificial walls, and that's not really ever something that I wanted to do as a full-time profession". In her autobiography, she also comments on the [...] "bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions". <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) The Nose, a famous route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Lloyd travelled to New York {{where she}} re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song {{was about a}} young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, [...] "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; The Era observed that the line [...] "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but {{turned out not to be}} so. The Era described the character as being [...] "not so demure as <b>she</b> <b>looked,</b> <b>for</b> she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." [...] Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. [...] At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. [...] The Era commented that [...] "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success". [...] After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in Peckham in a production of Dick Whittington in which she played the title role. In it, she sang [...] "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being [...] "one of the pantomime songs of the year". The Music Hall and Theatre Review was equally complimentary, saying: [...] "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!" [...] During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in Dick Whittington. [...] The entertainment culminated with a song from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called The Squeaker, starring Joe Elvin.|$|E
500|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry II (1154–89), the motte-and-bailey was {{replaced}} with a stone castle. This new phase {{took the form of}} a shell keep with all the buildings constructed against the curtain wall. During the barons' rebellion of 1173–74, the Earl of Warwick remained loyal to King Henry II, and the castle was used to store provisions. The castle and the lands associated with the earldom passed down in the Beaumont family until 1242. When Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick died, the castle and lands passed to his sister, Lady Margery, Countess of Warwick in her own right. Her husband died soon after, and while <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a suitable husband, the castle was in the ownership of King Henry III. When she married John du Plessis in December 1242, the castle was returned to her. During the Second Barons' War of 1264–67, William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick, was a supporter of King Henry III. The castle was taken in a surprise attack by the forces of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, from Kenilworth Castle in 1264. According to 15th-century chronicler John Rous, the walls along the northeastern side of Warwick Castle were slighted, so [...] "that it should be no strength to the king". Maudit and his countess were taken to Kenilworth Castle and held until a ransom was paid. After the death of William Maudit in 1267, the title and castle passed to his nephew William de Beauchamp, 9thEarl of Warwick. Following William's death, Warwick Castle passed through seven generations of the Beauchamp family, who over the next 180years were responsible for most of the additions made to the castle. In 1312, Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall, was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, and imprisoned in Warwick Castle until his execution on 9 June 1312. A group of magnates led by the Earl of Warwick and Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, accused Gaveston of stealing the royal treasure.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sherrod, {{she did her}} job {{correctly}} {{by taking}} the farmer to a white lawyer who she thought could help him, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> another lawyer when needed. [...] Sherrod rejected claims that she was racist and said she [...] "went all out" [...] to help the man keep his farm. She said that the incident helped her learn to move beyond race, and she told the story to audiences to make that point.|$|E

2500|$|The {{final chapter}} of Charlotte's life {{was defined by}} her writing. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> ways to {{reconcile}} {{her relationship with her}} father, and writing was her only option. In 1754, Charke wrote her first novel, The History of Mr. Henry Dumont, Esq; and Miss Charlotte Evelyn and sold it for ten guineas. It was published in 1755, and the publisher's estimate of its value was apparently confirmed, as it did not sell especially well. [...] However, Charke, like her father, was still famous and infamous, and she began writing her autobiography, A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke (1755), which began to appear in instalments. [...] These sold very well, and the installments were collected and sold as a book, which went into two editions in the year. An abridged form appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine, as well. This {{was one of the first}} autobiographies ever written by a woman.|$|E
