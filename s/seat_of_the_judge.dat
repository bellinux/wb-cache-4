60|$|CAESAR (energetically). On my head be it, then; for it {{was well}} done. Rufio: had you set {{yourself}} in the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge,</b> and with hateful ceremonies and appeals to the gods handed that woman over to some hired executioner to be slain before {{the people in the}} name of justice, never again would I have touched your hand without a shudder. But this was natural slaying: I feel no horror at it.|$|E

60|$|I {{know not}} what {{time went by}} before I was put upon my trial, but that trial I can still see as clearly {{as though it were}} {{happening}} before my eyes. It took place in a long, low room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vast palace buildings that was lighted only by window-places set high up in the wall. These walls were frescoed, and at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room above <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> was a rude picture in bright colours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condemnation <b>of</b> Christ by Pilate. Pilate, I remember, was represented with a black face, to signify his wickedness I suppose, and in the air above him hung a red-eyed imp shaped like a bat who gripped his robe with one claw and whispered into his ear.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} Associate Justices {{in the supreme}} court and they are ranked based on their order of superiority.

6000|$|We {{passed through}} the gate which faces the Mediterranean, (called the [...] "Marine Gate,") and by the rusty, broken image of Minerva, still keeping tireless watch and ward over the {{possessions}} it was powerless to save, and went up a long street and stood in <b>the</b> broad court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forum <b>of</b> Justice. <b>The</b> floor was level and clean, {{and up and down}} either side was a noble colonnade of broken pillars, with their beautiful Ionic and Corinthian columns scattered about them.

Inside <b>the</b> main room, a row of horizontal windows has been set up behind <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges.</b> While <b>the</b> windows are at <b>the</b> head-height <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> on <b>the</b> inside, they are on ground level on the outside.

[...] The first court session in the new building at this location was held in February 2004. The court building is open to the public who want to attend hearings or view the art gallery in the court atrium.

5000|$|In {{introducing}} his work, Roy {{asserted that}} modern civilization faced a [...] "cultural and moral crisis" [...] that compelled thoughtful people {{to seek a}} return to society's [...] "humanist tradition." [...] Roy attributed this crisis to a negative byproduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th Century victory of skepticism and empiricism over other more immutable and deterministic belief systems — a process which not only [...] "set human spirit free" [...] but which also ushered in new forms of subjugation. [...] "If empiricism deposed reason from <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supreme <b>judge,</b> pragmatism subordinated moral values to practical considerations," [...] Roy declared.|$|R

50|$|The {{state has}} 146 Circuit Court judges divided among 41 {{judicial}} circuits with <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> to each circuit set by acts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alabama Legislature.

The largest circuit {{in the state}} is the 10th Judicial Circuit which encompasses Jefferson County (approximately 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's population) and is <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> 27 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges.</b> <b>The</b> smallest circuits are the 2nd, 3rd, 24th, 34th, 35th, 36th, 40th, and 41st which each contain just a single judge and represent many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest population counties in the state.|$|R
50|$|Three courtrooms, {{each with}} an entry lobby with marble {{wainscot}} walls, {{are located on}} the second floor. The courtrooms are paneled in polished gum wood and bronze chandeliers hang from the ceiling. Distinctive wall sconces that feature large white globes supported by either cast-bronze eagles or snakes illuminate the spaces. The central courtroom {{is perhaps the most}} impressive. Called the En Banc courtroom, it was designed to <b>seat</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active <b>judges</b> on <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> Appeals simultaneously so that they can hear important cases together. The plaster ceiling features medallions and other symbols and has been finished with a bronze glaze.|$|R
50|$|In 1651 <b>the</b> {{old house}} <b>of</b> Kocksche Kote, Bergen No. 5, which paid dues to <b>the</b> Abbey <b>of</b> St. Michael's in Lüneburg, became <b>the</b> {{official}} <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district <b>judge.</b> In 1653 <b>the</b> government bought the farmstead from <b>the</b> heirs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district <b>judge,</b> Cord Brase, and upgraded {{it into a}} district advocacy building (Amtsvogteigebäude). In 1709 the building, was completely rebuilt under district advocate, Jost Hinrich Wolff (Bergen's primary school is named after him). In 1852 there was a separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary from the administration within <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Hanover. From then on, Prussian law applied and there was both a district office (Amt Bergen) and a district court (Amtsgericht Bergen). In <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> these reforms, <b>the</b> Vogtei <b>of</b> Wietzendorf was split away from Bergen. <b>The</b> first district <b>judge</b> (Amtsrichter) was Ernst August Eggert von Estorff. On <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district court, which amounts to 6,480 m², there is an office building, a residential building, a district prison and several outbuildings. In 1945 there was a reform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German courts. The district court in Bergen became a branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district court <b>of</b> Celle. On 1 July 1973 the Bergen District Court was closed.|$|R
