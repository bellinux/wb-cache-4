5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United <b>States</b> <b>because</b> he had a criminal record in his home country.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E

5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern <b>states.</b> <b>Because</b> the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United <b>States</b> <b>because</b> of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a {{rotating magnetic field}} to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E

5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other <b>states,</b> <b>because</b> larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired {{a meeting}} in Louisville that {{advocated}} for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War. Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also denounced the election of Abraham Lincoln and his {{use of military force}} to subdue the southern <b>states.</b> <b>Because</b> Helm did not condemn his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.|$|E

Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight.

5|$|Squall lines, or solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to hail and high winds.

Although tornadoes can form anywhere on Earth, the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the United <b>States,</b> <b>because</b> downsloped winds off the north-south oriented Rocky Mountains, which can form a dryline, aid their development at any strength.|$|E

5|$|Florida's {{involvement}} in the U.S. Civil War was limited compared to other Confederate <b>states</b> <b>because</b> it had {{a fraction of the}} populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the USS Columbine, a Union paddle steamer used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. John Jackson Dickison captured, burned, and sank the USS Columbine, making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy. The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the Maple Leaf, which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near Julington Creek, south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including daguerreotypes and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.|$|E
5|$|HIStory debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 and Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts selling over 391,000 copies in its first week. The album was {{certified}} seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 22, 1999 in the United <b>States.</b> <b>Because</b> HIStory is double disc album, its CDs are therefore counted separately for certification purposes, meaning the album achieved platinum status in the United States after 500,000 copies were shipped, not one million. In Europe, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry certified HIStory six times platinum, denoting six million shipments within the continent, including 1.5 million in Germany and 1.2 million shipments in the United Kingdom. As of 2010, HIStory has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and is the best selling multiple-disc release, {{making it one of the}} best-selling albums of all time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery.

Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan.
