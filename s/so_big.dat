5|$|Cecil {{was drawn}} to {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, but still look similar to Bob. According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are both <b>so</b> <b>big.</b> There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E
5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was <b>so</b> <b>big.</b> The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth {{boarded a}} plane to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract that gave him $11,500 per year.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} side, the parekklesion {{represents}} {{the most beautiful}} building of the late Byzantine period in Constantinople.

25|$|According to the Prose Edda, Odin took Loki's three children, Fenrisúlfr, Hel and Jörmungandr. He tossed Jörmungandr {{into the}} great ocean that encircles Midgard. The serpent grew <b>so</b> <b>big</b> {{that he was able}} to {{surround}} the Earth and grasp his own tail, and as a result he earned the alternate name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent.

25|$|The tariff {{in effect}} {{prior to the}} {{enactment}} of the Morrill Tariff of 1861, had been written and approved by the South {{for the benefit of the}} South.

25|$|The German Army {{emptied the}} ship of movable {{property}} during 1940, {{they could do}} this because the ship was mostly above water. Rijkswaterstaat was thinking of salvaging Jan Pieterszoon Coen, since the ship was mostly intact and in shallow waters. But due {{to a series of}} storms, the ship sank deeper into the sand. In 1941, a 50-meter portion of the stern was removed <b>so</b> <b>big</b> ships could sail into the harbor again.|$|E
25|$|The most {{reliable}} calculation method is recursive calculation of f(x,n) from f(x,n-1) and f(x-1,n-1) using the recursion formula given below under properties. The probabilities of all (x,n) combinations on all possible trajectories {{leading to the}} desired point are calculated, starting with f(0,0) = 1 as shown on the figure to the right. The total number of probabilities to calculate is n(x+1)-x2. Other calculation methods must be used when n and x are <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that this method is too inefficient.|$|E
25|$|The Israelites {{made their}} way up the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan and his men took the field against them at Edrei, but God told Moses not to fear, as God would deliver Og, his men, and his country to the Israelites to conquer as they had conquered Sihon. So God {{delivered}} King Og of Bashan, his men, and his 60 towns into the Israelites' hands, and they left no survivor.

25|$|By the 1980s merengue was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> it {{was even}} beating out salsa on the airwaves. That decade was also notable for a boom in all-female orquestas, and Las Chicas del Can became {{particularly}} popular. Since then, musicians like Juan Luis Guerra, trained at Boston's Berklee school, Tono Rosario and former rocker Luis Díaz have brought merengue even further abroad, truly internationalizing the music. Guerra collaborated with African guitarists, experimented with indigenous Caribbean sounds, and explored Dominican roots music with típico accordionist Francisco Ulloa, while Díaz (an innovator since his work with 1970s folklore group Convite) fused merengue, rock, merengue típico, and bachata in his productions.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} material used for ab anbars were very tough and extensively used a special mortar called sarooj {{which was made}} of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions, depending on location and climate of the city. This mixture {{was thought to be}} completely water impenetrable. The walls of the storage were often 2 meters thick, and special bricks had to be used. These bricks were especially baked for ab anbars and were called Ajor Ab anbari. Some ab anbars were <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that they would be built underneath caravanserais such as the ab anbar of Haj Agha Ali in Kerman. Sometimes they would also be built under mosques, such as the ab anbar of Vazir near Isfahan.|$|E
25|$|Disneyland Paris has {{strict rules}} {{designed}} to prevent visitors from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not {{for the public to}} see. Numerous gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade cars etc. When gates around the park are open, anything that can be seen through them is considered part of the Disney magic. Therefore, from the second the gates are open, all of the crew must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex is <b>so</b> <b>big,</b> shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the park via roads behind the parks.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the other}} great boons to Australian heavy metal music was the Metal for the Brain festival. Established by Armoured Angel’s drummer Joel Green {{to raise funds for}} a friend {{severely}} brain-damaged after an assault, the first concert in 1991 featured six Canberra bands in the afternoon with a later performance by some punk bands including the Hard Ons. By the end of the decade, the event had stretched out to a 12-hour festival featuring 18 groups from around the country and by 2000 was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> it was forced to move to a larger venue. When the final Metal for the Brain festival closed in November 2006, more than 100 different bands from every major centre in Australia and several from overseas including Voivod had appeared at some time. Many bands considered it {{to be one of the}} pinnacles of their achievements.|$|E
25|$|In less {{developed}} countries, some traditional fishing villages persist {{in ways that}} have changed little from earlier times. In more developed countries, traditional fishing villages are changing due to socioeconomic factors like industrial fishing and urbanization. Over time, some fishing villages outgrow their original function as artisanal fishing villages. Seven hundred years ago, Shanghai, beside the Yangtze River delta, was a small fishing village. In recent times, fishing villages have been increasingly targeted for tourist and leisure enterprises. Recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits can be big business these days, and traditional fishing villages are often well positioned {{to take advantage of}} this. For example, Destin on the coast of Florida, has evolved from an artisanal fishing village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats. The tourist appeal of fishing villages has become <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that the Korean government is purpose-building 48 fishing villages for their tourist drawing power. In 2004 China reported it had 8,048 fishing villages.|$|E

25|$|During the {{remainder}} of the war, Jan Pieterszoon Coen sank deeper into the sea and her upper decks were severely damaged and deteriorated by the strong waves that constantly pounded the ship. The funnels and some decks had also collapsed during this period. After the war in May and June 1945, the Royal Netherlands Navy with help from the Royal Navy, destroyed {{what was left of the}} ship with depth charges. However, a lot of debris was left in the entrance and the Dutch government was forced to clean up the debris from the bottom of the sea in 1968 <b>so</b> <b>bigger</b> ships could sail into the harbor without problems.|$|R
