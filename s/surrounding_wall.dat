There are three sets of overhead doors on the main (south) facade of the building. A high brick wall encloses the entire complex, and sections of the corner utility structures {{are a part of}} the <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall.</b> There is a small building in the northeast corner of the complex; it is one bay square with a steep hip roof with spring eaves. It has single round windows near the root line, on two facades. The building's entrance, on the south facade, is made of wood. The building has a counterpart across the yard, with a low hip roof, a large brick chimney, and a stone water table and string course; it has overhead doors on the north facade.|$|E

25|$|Brooks was {{the author}} of three novels, one The Big Wheel, {{published}} in 1949 describing a newsmagazine much like Time. He also published ten non-fiction books on business and finance, the subject in which he specialized for The New Yorker. Brooks's best-known books were Once in Golconda: A True Drama of Wall Street, 19201938, about the scandal <b>surrounding</b> <b>Wall</b> Street banker Richard Whitney; The Go-Go Years, on the speculative bubble of Wall Street in the 1960s; The Takeover Game about the merger mania of the 1980s.; and of special note, Business Adventures, which has been cited as Bill Gates' favorite business book.|$|E

25|$|The actual date of {{construction}} of the first mosque in Djenné is unknown, but dates as early as 1200 and as late as 1330 have been suggested. The earliest document mentioning the mosque is Abd al-Sadi's Tarikh al-Sudan which gives the early history, presumably from the oral tradition as it existed in the mid seventeenth century. The tarikh states that a Sultan Kunburu became a Muslim and had his palace pulled down and the site turned into a mosque. He built another palace for himself near the mosque on the east side. His immediate successor built the towers of the mosque while the following Sultan built the <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
25|$|Purim {{is celebrated}} {{annually}} {{according to the}} Hebrew calendar on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Adar (and on Adar II in Hebrew leap years that take place every 2 to 3 years), the day following {{the victory of the}} Jews over their enemies. In cities that were protected by a <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall</b> {{at the time of the}} Biblical Joshua, Purim is instead celebrated on the 15th of the month of Adar on what is known as Shushan Purim, since fighting in the walled city of Shushan continued through the 14th day of Adar. Today, only Jerusalem and a few other cities celebrate Purim on the 15th of Adar.|$|E
25|$|On 6 February the Marines {{attacked}} the Provincial Headquarters {{which served as}} the command post of the PAVN 4th Regiment. While the Marines seized the <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall</b> easily the area between {{the wall and the}} building was covered by fire from every window and spider-holes in the grounds. An Ontos was brought forward to blast an entry into the building, but was disabled by a B-40 rocket and a Mule was brought forward to blow a hole in the building and the Marines advanced under cover of tear gas. Entering the building the Marines fought room by room, clearing the building, but many of the PAVN slipped away. With the building secured the Marines then cleared out the spider-holes methodically shooting their occupants. The Marines raised an American flag to celebrate their victory, but shortly thereafter were ordered to lower it, for in accordance with South Vietnamese law, no US flag was permitted to be flown without an accompanying South Vietnamese flag.|$|E

25|$|James King, {{a popular}} {{journalist}} and publisher, vehemently protested the administrative graft of Broderick which angered one of Broderick's biggest supporters, a supervisor named James Casey. While King {{was standing in}} front of his newspaper's building Casey shot King in the chest, causing a mortal wound which would ultimately launch the formation of a second Vigilance Committee in May 1856. Within two hours after Casey's shooting of King, a mob of 10,000 people surrounded the jail where Casey was being held. The vigilantes then demanded that the jail release James Casey into their custody, and the badly out-numbered jail guards acquiesced to their demands. King died six days after being shot, and subsequently Casey was put on trial by the Vigilance Committee. King's funeral attracted over 15,000 people, but by the time the funeral had ended Casey had already been convicted and hanged by the vigilantes. Now energized by wide public support, the Vigilance Committee set up shop in a large building near the wharf which included jail cells, court rooms, a <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall</b> to resist any military intervention, and was nicknamed Fort Gunnybags. During the two months that followed the hanging of Casey there was not a single murder in San Francisco, and less than a half dozen robberies. In August 1856 the vigilance committee decided to disband and give control back to the elected officials.|$|E
500|$|There {{were five}} other temples in the city, {{of which the}} most notable is the {{so-called}} [...] "Temple of Saturn" [...] that stood {{on the eastern side}} of Volubilis. It appears to have been built on top of, or converted from, an earlier Punic temple, which may have been dedicated to Baal. It is a sanctuary with a <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall</b> and a three-sided portico. In its interior was a small temple with a cella built on a shallow podium. The temple's traditional identification with Saturn is purely hypothetical and has not generally been accepted.|$|E
500|$|The {{spermaceti}} organ {{is like a}} large {{barrel of}} spermaceti. [...] Its <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall,</b> known as the case, is extremely tough and fibrous. The case can hold within it up to 1,900 litres of spermaceti. It is proportionately larger in males. This oil {{is a mixture of}} triglycerides and wax esters. The proportion of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with the age of the whale: 38–51% in calves, 58–87% in adult females, and 71–94% in adult males. [...] The spermaceti {{at the core of the}} organ has a higher wax content than the outer areas. [...] The speed of sound in spermaceti is 2,684m/s (at 40kHz, 36°C), making it nearly twice as fast as in the oil in a dolphin's melon.|$|E

500|$|The {{mirror is}} a {{perfectly}} defined unbroken pale rectangle within a broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws {{the attention of the}} viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the dwarf in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the opalescent sheen of the mirror's surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. Jonathan Miller points out that apart from [...] "adding suggestive gleams at the bevelled edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with the dimness of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>wall</b> that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen".|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} is distinctive and idiosyncratic in its layout, positioning, materials and architectural style.

[...] Several design motifs recur throughout, and high-quality internal fittings such as built-in furniture and an unusual staircase have been preserved.
