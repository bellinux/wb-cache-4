The study {{is based on a}} qualitative approach with detailed descriptions of eight interviews with HVB staff in the south of Sweden.

5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the <b>Social</b> <b>Inclusion</b> and Affirmative Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil. With this program, around 30% of admissions come from public schools, and the participation of minorities increased from 10% to around 30%.|$|E

25|$|Originating {{from the}} 12-Step Program of Alcoholics Anonymous, {{the use of}} the concept in mental health emerged as deinstitutionalization {{resulted}} in more individuals living in the community. It gained impetus as a social movement due to a perceived failure by services or wider society to adequately support <b>social</b> <b>inclusion,</b> and by studies demonstrating that many people do recover. A recovery approach has now been explicitly adopted as the guiding principle of the mental health or substance dependency policies of a number of countries and states. In many cases practical steps are being taken to base services on a recovery model, although a range of obstacles, concerns and criticisms have been raised both by service providers and by recipients of services. A number of standardized measures have been developed to assess aspects of recovery, although there is some variation between professionalized models and those originating in the psychiatric survivors movement.|$|E
