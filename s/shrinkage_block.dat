40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a <b>block</b> <b>shrinkage</b> method in the wavelet domain for {{estimating}} an unknown function in the presence of Gaussian noise. This shrinkage utilizes an empirical Bayes, block-adaptive approach that accounts for the sparseness of the representation of the unknown function. The modeling is accomplished by using a mixture of two normal-inverse gamma (N I G) distributions as a joint prior on wavelet coefficients and noise variance in each block at a particular resolution level. This method results in explicit and fast rules. An automatic, level dependent choice for the prior hyperparameters is also suggested. Finally, the performance of the proposed method, BBS (Bayesian <b>Block</b> <b>Shrinkage),</b> is illustrated on the battery of standard test functions and compared to some standard wavelet-based denoising methods...|$|R

This result does not contradict to known theoretical results about the rate deficiency of linear estimates; instead, {{it tells us}} that adaptive estimates that mimic an optimal linear oracle may be possible alternatives to threshold-adaptive wavelet estimates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Isotherms were {{obtained}} for nitrogen adsorption and desorption on seven halloysite-rich samples from New Zealand and Western Australia. Calculations from these isotherms indicate that halloysites with mainly small particles ( c. 0. 1 ~tm in width) had few if any pores in the mesopore range (2 - 50 nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that cylindrical pores originate from the central holes in tubular particles. The TEM also suggests that slit-shaped pores can originate from the <b>shrinkage</b> of <b>blocks</b> of layers upon dehydration of halloysite. Halloysites include a significant concentration of fine pores (Diamond, 1970; Jackson et al., 1971...|$|R

Much of the work to date has focussed on shrinkage of individual wavelet coefficients in isolation. In this paper we propose an empirical Bayes approach to simultaneous shrinkage of wavelet coefficients in a block, based on the block sum of squares. Our approach exploits a useful identity satisfied by the noncentral 2 density and provides some tractable Bayesian <b>block</b> <b>shrinkage</b> procedures.

40|$|Competition between synapses {{contributes}} to activity-dependent refinement {{of the nervous}} system during development. Does local competition between neighboring synapses drive circuit remodeling during experience-dependent plasticity in the cerebral cortex? Here, we examined the role of activity-mediated competitive interactions in regulating dendritic spine structure and function on hippocampal CA 1 neurons. We found that high-frequency glutamatergic stimulation at individual spines, which leads to input-specific synaptic potentiation, induces shrinkage and weakening of nearby unstimulated synapses. This heterosynaptic plasticity requires potentiation of multiple neighboring spines, suggesting that a local threshold of neural activity exists beyond which inactive synapses are punished. Notably, inhibition of calcineurin, IP 3 Rs, or group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) <b>blocked</b> heterosynaptic <b>shrinkage</b> without <b>blocking</b> structural potentiation, and inhibition of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) blocked structural potentiation without <b>blocking</b> heterosynaptic <b>shrinkage.</b> Our results support a model in which activity-induced shrinkage signal, and not competition for limited structural resources, drives heterosynaptic structural and functional depression during neural circuit refinement...|$|R
40|$|In many {{practical}} applications of nonparametric regression, {{it is desirable}} {{to allow for the}} possibility that the noise is correlated. In this paper, we focus on wavelet-based nonparametric function estimation and propose two distinct methods for estimating the correlation structure of the noise, one based in the time domain and the other based in the wavelet domain. Once the correlation structure has been estimated, there are various methods that may be used for reconstructing the unknown signal; we focus here on the empirical Bayes <b>block</b> <b>shrinkage</b> method proposed by Wang and Wood (2006).

40|$|O fenômeno da retração é {{a causa de}} muitas manifestações patológicas verificadas em edifícios, especialmente naqueles com alvenarias produzidas com blocos de concreto. O presente trabalho tem como meta avaliar experimentalmente o efeito de retração em alvenarias de blocos de concreto. Estudos foram realizados através de ensaios de retração em blocos de diferentes resistências e processos de cura e também através do monitoramento das deformações de pequenas paredes construídas com cada tipo de bloco. A partir do conhecimento preciso da retração da parede é possível prever a possibilidade do aparecimento de fissuras e determinar a necessidade da criação de juntas de controle para evitar patologias e também prever perdas de protensão em alvenarias protendidas. Como resultado do trabalho foi possível aprimorar o procedimento de ensaio de retração de blocos de concreto segundo normalização brasileira. A partir dos ensaios de paredes pode-se sugerir valores de coeficiente de retração a serem considerados em projeto. Também foi possível quantificar algumas características relativas ao fenômeno, como a maior retração observada em blocos produzidos com baixo controle de qualidade e em paredes executadas em idades recentes, o impedimento de retração na primeira fiada pela restrição da laje de apoio, a mesma ordem de grandeza para retração livre {{vertical}} e horizontal, entre outros. The shrinkage {{phenomenon is}} the cause of many verified pathological manifestations in buildings, especially in those with masonry produced with concrete blocks. The present work has as goal experimentally to evaluate the effect of shrinkage in masonry of concrete blocks. Studies had been carried through of <b>shrinkage</b> tests with <b>blocks</b> of different strength and processes of cure and also monitoring deformations of small walls constructed with each type of block. The walls had its deformations monitored for a period of one year, having been that the analyses had been formed taking in account the three first months of age. With the shrinkage tests are expected to get coefficients that allow the forecast of this effect in walls. From the necessary knowledge of the shrinkage of the wall it is possible to foresee the possibility of the appearance of cracks and to determine the necessity of the creation of control joints to prevent pathology and also to foresee losses of protension in prestressed masonry. As result of the work was possible to improve the procedure of test of <b>shrinkage</b> of concrete <b>blocks</b> according to Brazilian normalization. From the tests of walls it can be suggested values of shrinkage coefficient to be considered in project. Also it was possible to quantify some relative characteristics to the phenomenon, as the highest <b>shrinkage</b> observed in <b>blocks</b> produced with low quality control and in walls executed in recent ages, the impediment of shrinkage in the first row due to restriction of the support slab, the same order of magnitude for vertical and horizontal unrestricted shrinkage, among others...|$|R
40|$|Selective drugs {{targeting}} dysregulated oncogenic pathways {{are promising}} cancer therapies. Because the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) pathway is hyperactivated in human follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), {{we hypothesized that}} its inhibition could block cancer development and progression. We, therefore, analyzed {{the effect of a}} treatment with a specific mTORC 1 inhibitor (RAD 001) in a faithful mouse model of FTC with constitutive mTORC 1 activation (TRβPV/PVPten+/− mice). The treatment did not prevent capsular and vascular invasion of the thyroid and the occurrence of lung metastasis. However, it substantially decelerated thyroid tumor growth, thereby prolonging TRβPV/PVPten+/− mouse life span. RAD 001 efficiently inhibited mTORC 1 activity, as shown by the reduced phosphorylation of its downstream targets involved in the activity of the translation machinery, such as ribosomal S 6 kinase (p 70 S 6 K), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 E binding protein (4 E-BP 1) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF- 4 B and eIF- 4 G. Whereas mTORC 1 signaling inhibition did not alter cell apoptosis, it induced a significant decrease in cell proliferation that was associated with the reduced abundance and altered activity of key regulators of cell cycle progression. Altogether, our data indicate that mTORC 1 signaling {{plays a major role in}} the integration of the mitogenic signal in FTC. Therefore, our preclinical study with a relevant mouse model of FTC demonstrates for the first time that RAD 001 efficaciously stabilizes cancer growth although it does not prevent its fatal outcome. In conclusion, our work underscores that in the treatment of FTC patients, RAD 001 can only be used in combination with drugs and therapies inducing tumor <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>blocking</b> metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} faces {{two main}} challenges: more quality at lower {{prices and the}} need for the productivity improvement. In ship building industry, companies need to respond to market requirements efficiently, keeping their products competitive while reducing the cost. When considering complicated ship production processes up to final hull block erection, the productivity of each work station for hull assembly mainly depends on the dimensional quality of hull blocks. Poor dimensional accuracy leads to reworks such as re cutting, mechanical or thermal correction against misalignment, excessive welding for wide gap and thermal straightening and this will subsequently increases the total production cost. One of the major dimensional accuracy control activities is the shrinkage margin design, which means that the optimal excess of plate is calculated and assigned into ship production drawings in order to compensate for the accumulated welding <b>shrinkage</b> through <b>block</b> assembly phases. In Sri Lankan context the most common practise to compensate for shrinkage has been to add excess material, usually 50 - 100 mm on one or two sides of a block that would be trimmed at the erection stage. Normally, this added material would be adequate to compensate for any weld <b>shrinkage</b> incurred during <b>block</b> assembly. It is however, a commitment to rework. This has been adopted {{due to the lack of}} accurate and reliable weld shrinkage and distortion allowance data. Even though there are some research findings on shrinkage factors it can’t be directly apply for the Sri Lankan industry as shrinkage factors may vary from shipyard to shipyard due to facilities, welding equipment, joint design, welding sequence, ambient temperature, and type of material. This research project provides a comprehensive weld shrinkage factor identification that enables neat construction capabilities for the shipbuilding industry in Sri Lanka. A key component of the research is a predictive weld shrinkage factor based on current ship designs, materials, and construction practices. Through this study, the shrinkage factors will be identified by a statistical analysis of data. It will be done from the development of check sheets, establishing of checking procedures, data gathering, and finally the statistical analysis of data. Since variety of variables can affect the determination of a shrinkage factor, it has to be decided the most crucial factors for particular production process and consider only those factors as the variables. Even though there are three major processes (panel fabrication, block construction, block assembly) in ship building the data was analysed only for data collected from panel fabrication and sample testing. Finally two equations were derived for sample testing and panel fabrication separately by providing dedicated factor for each and every considered variable. The obtained results were validated again by means of another sample testing and the deviation is less than 0. 2 mm. The other processes were not considered due to complexity of the structures and data collection difficulty with in limited time frame. The block construction and assembly processes can be considered for the next step of this research and it can be done with the involvement of modelling software. From the modelling software the differences in each of complex blocks can be identified easily and measured values can be analysed against those differences. Then a comprehensive welding shrinkage compensation factor can be identified and it can be entered to the modelling software at the time of modelling the vessel...|$|R

As the same increases in tear film hyperosmolarity described in dry eye disease can increase corneal epithelial transient receptor potential vanilloid type- 1 (TRPV 1) channel activity, we evaluated its involvement in mediating an osmoprotective effect by L-carnitine against such stress. Methods: Using siRNA gene silencing, Ca 2 + imaging, planar patch-clamping and relative cell volume measurements, we determined if the protective effects of this osmolyte stem from its interaction with TRPV 1. Results: TRPV 1 activation by capsaicin (CAP) {{and an increase in}} osmolarity to ≈ 450 mOsM both induced increases in Ca 2 + levels. In contrast, blocking TRPV 1 activation with capsazepine (CPZ) fully reversed this response. Similarly, L-carnitine (1 mM) also reduced underlying whole-cell currents. In calcein-AM loaded cells, hypertonic-induced relative cell volume <b>shrinkage</b> was fully <b>blocked</b> during exposure to L-carnitine. On the other hand, in TRPV 1 gene-silenced cells, this protective effect by L-carnitine was obviated. Conclusion: The described L-carnitine osmoprotective effect is elicited through suppression of hypertonic-induced TRPV 1 activation leading to increases in L-carnitine uptake through a described Na+-dependent L-carnitine transporter...|$|R
40|$|In {{non-parametric}} function estimation, {{providing a}} confidence band {{with the right}} coverage is a challenging problem. This is especially the case when the underlying function has {{a wide range of}} unknown degrees of smoothness. Here we propose two methods of constructing an average coverage confidence band built from <b>block</b> <b>shrinkage</b> estimation methods. One is based on the James-Stein shrinkage estimator; the other begins with a Bayesian perspective and is based on a modification of the harmonic estimator. Simulation shows that these confidence bands have its coverage close to or above the nominal coverage even when the underlying function is rough and/or the signal to noise ratio is small. Both of the confidence bands perform consistently well across all test functions even though they have very different shapes and smoothness. ^ Furthermore, a minimax theory is developed for nonparametric average coverage confidence bands. We show that for the average coverage confidence band, the minimax rate of the expected average length in Sobolev space is of the order n-b 1 + 2 b, where β is the smoothness order of the Sobolev space. It is known that for many minimax optimality criteria, adaptivity is impossible. We also show that even for the average coverage confidence band, adaptivity is still impossible. ...|$|R
40|$|Utilization of {{construction}} and demolition (C&D) wastes as recycled aggregates {{in the production}} of concrete and concrete products have attracted much attention in recent years. However, the presence of large quantities of crushed clay brick in some the C&D waste streams (e. g. waste derived collapsed masonry buildings after an earthquake) renders the recycled aggregates unsuitable for high grade use. One possibility is {{to make use of the}} low grade recycled aggregates for concrete block production. In this paper, we report the results of a comprehensive study to assess the feasibility of using crushed clay brick as coarse and fine aggregates in concrete masonry block production. The effects of the content of crushed coarse and fine clay brick aggregates (CBA) on the mechanical properties of non-structural concrete block were quantified. From the experimental test results, it was observed that incorporating the crushed clay brick aggregates had a significant influence on the properties of blocks. The hardened density and drying <b>shrinkage</b> of the <b>block</b> specimens decreased with an increase in CBA content. The use of CBA increased the water absorption of block specimens. The results suggested that the amount of crushed clay brick to be used in concrete masonry blocks should be controlled at less than 25 % (coarse aggregate) and within 50 - 75 % for fine aggregates.

40|$|The {{bypass flow}} in a {{prismatic}} high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) is the flow that occurs between adjacent graphite blocks. Gaps exist between blocks due to variances in their manufacture and installation {{and because of}} the expansion and <b>shrinkage</b> of the <b>blocks</b> from heating and irradiation. Although the temperature of fuel compacts and graphite is sensitive to the presence of bypass flow, there is great uncertainty in the level and effects of the bypass flow. The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) program at the Idaho National Laboratory has undertaken to produce experimental data of isothermal bypass flow between three adjacent graphite blocks. These data are intended to provide validation for computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses of the bypass flow. Such validation data sets are called Standard Problems in the nuclear safety analysis field. Details of the experimental apparatus as well as several pre-test calculations of the bypass flow are provided. Pre-test calculations are useful in examining the nature of the flow and {{to see if there are}} any problems associated with the flow and its measurement. The apparatus is designed to be able to provide three different gap widths in the vertical direction (the direction of the normal coolant flow) and two gap widths in the horizontal direction. It is expected that the vertical bypass flow will range from laminar to transitional to turbulent flow for the different gap widths that will be available...|$|R
40|$|Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mal 3 is {{a member}} of the EB family of proteins, which are {{proposed}} to be core elements in a tip-tracking network that regulates microtubule dynamics in cells. How Mal 3 itself influences microtubule dynamics is unclear. We tested the effects of full-length recombinant Mal 3 on dynamic microtubules assembled in vitro from purified S. pombe tubulin, using dark field video microscopy to avoid fluorescent tagging and data-averaging techniques to improve spatiotemporal resolution. We find that catastrophe occurs stochastically as a fast (< 2. 2 s) transition from constant speed growth to constant speed shrinkage with a constant probability that is independent of the Mal 3 concentration. This implies that Mal 3 neither stabilizes nor destabilizes microtubule tips. Mal 3 does, however, stabilize the main part of the microtubule lattice, inhibiting shrinkage and increasing the frequency of rescues, consistent with recent models in which Mal 3 on the lattice forms stabilizing lateral links between neighboring protofilaments. At high concentrations, Mal 3 can entirely <b>block</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and induce very rapid rescue, making catastrophes impossible to detect, which may account for the apparent suppression of catastrophe by Mal 3 and other EBs in vivo. Overall, we find that Mal 3 stabilizes microtubules not by preventing catastrophe at the microtubule tip but by inhibiting lattice depolymerization and enhancing rescue. We argue that this implies that Mal 3 binds microtubules in different modes at the tip and on the lattice...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To purpose {{a method}} for {{predicting}} the shrinkage stress development in the adhesive layer of resin-composite cylinders that shrink bonded to a single flat surface, by measuring the deflection of a glass coverslip caused by the shrinkage of the bonded cylinders. The correlation between {{the volume of the}} bonded resin-composite and the stress-peak was also investigated. Methods. A glass coverslip deflection caused by the shrinkage of a bonded resin-composite cylinder (diameter: d = 8 mm, 4 mm, or 2 mm, height: h = 4 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, or 0. 5 mm) was measured, and the same set-up was simulated by finite element analysis (3 D-FEA). Stresses generated in the adhesive layer were plotted versus two geometric variables of the resin-composite cylinder (C-Factor and volume) to verify the existence of correlations between them and stresses. Results. The FEA models were validated. A significant correlation (p < 0. 01, Pearson's test) between the stress-peak and the coverslip deflection when the resin-composites were grouped by diameter was found for diameters of 2 and 4 mm. The stress-peak of the whole set of data showed a logarithmic correlation with the bonded resin-composite volume (p < 0. 001, Pearson's test), but did not correlate with the C-Factor. Significance. The described method should be considered for standardizing the stress generated by the <b>shrinkage</b> of resin-composite <b>blocks</b> bonded to a single flat surface.

40|$|KEY WORDS light transmittance; {{extracellular}} space; optic nerve; white matter; astrocytes ABSTRACT Measurements of extracellular space {{volume and}} imaging of intrinsic optical signals (IOSs) {{have shown that}} neuronal activity increases light transmittance by causing cellular swelling. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these volume changes and the contribution of astrocyte swelling to the changes in tissue volume are unclear. In this study, we have investigated IOSs in optic nerves to analyze the mech-anisms contributing to these signals in a system consisting of only axons and glial cells. We examined both intact optic nerves and enucleated optic nerves, which contained no axons and consisted primarily of astrocytes. Electrical stimulation of intact optic nerves evoked an increase in light transmittance, which was graded with increasing stimula-tion frequency and was mimicked by raising extracellular K concentration ([K]o). The stimulation-induced IOS grew in amplitude and had a time course similar to extracel-lular space <b>shrinkage.</b> Tetrodotoxin (TTX) <b>blocked</b> the electrically induced but not the high K-induced IOS. In enucleated nerves, light transmittance progressively increased in higher [K]o. The high [K]o-induced IOSs were reversibly depressed by furosemide and bumetanide, antagonists for Na-K- 2 Cl cotransport, but were unaltered by TTX. We also used a monoclonal antibody to the NKCC 1 form of the Na-K- 2 Cl cotransporter to show that NKCC 1 is expressed in optic nerves as shown in Western blotting and is colocalized in GFAP immunopositive astrocytes. In summary, these results indicated that KCl uptake into astrocytes via an Na-K- 2 Cl cotransporter during raised [K]o contributes to the generation of cellular swelling and the intrinsic optical signals.

40|$|Printing shrink labels with waterbased flexographic inks {{require a}} great deal of {{attention}} from the press operator. Lack of heat from the dryers can cause drying related problems, while an increase in the dryer temperature can shrink the material. Some press manufacturers recommend presses that are equipped with powerful dryers and expensive chill roll systems. Manufacturers also suggest the use of a corona treatment unit to improve ink adhesion. Newcomers, that do not wish to invest in new presses and equipment of this kind, struggle with finding a proper combination of press speed and dryer settings that may offer acceptable print results. The main objective of this research project was to establish an optimal press speed for a conventional flexographic printing technique that could output acceptable printing products for heat sensitive materials. To accomplish the research objective, a series of shrink film samples were evaluated from two main flexographic print runs. One run was performed using a corona treatment unit and another one without corona treatment. These print runs were executed using waterbased inks on a shrinkable film. Each run was divided into six press speed segments. For each segment, the press was set at a different speed. Following the print operation, a series of tests were conducted to determine the press speed boundaries that were best suited for printing without affecting the performance of the shrink film or inks. Samples were evaluated by employing an adhesion test, re-wetting test, <b>shrinkage</b> test, a <b>blocking</b> test and an offsetting test. Tests performed during the course of this research project established that shrink labels could be printed on a conventional waterbased flexographic press as long as the press uses corona treatment and that the maximum press speed does not exceed 150 feet per minute. Printing shrink films without corona treatment should not be performed since ink adhesion fails at all press speeds and blocking and offsetting issues are visible when press speed reaches 150 feet per minute...|$|R
40|$|Bypass flow in a {{prismatic}} {{high temperature}} gas reactor (HTGR) occurs between graphite blocks as they sit {{side by side}} in the core. Bypass flow is not intentionally designed to occur in the reactor, but is present because of tolerances in manufacture, imperfect installation and expansion and <b>shrinkage</b> of the <b>blocks</b> from heating and irradiation. It is desired to increase the knowledge of the effects of such flow, which has been estimated to be as much as 20 % of the total helium coolant flow. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations can provide estimates of the scale and impacts of bypass flow. Previous CFD calculations have examined the effects of bypass gap width, level and distribution of heat generation and effects of shrinkage. The present contribution examines the effects of graphite surface roughness on the bypass flow for different relative roughness factors on three gap widths. Such calculations should be validated using specific bypass flow measurements. While such experiments are currently underway for the specific reference prismatic HTGR design for the next generation nuclear plant (NGNP) program of the U. S. Dept. of Energy, the data are not yet available. To enhance confidence in the present calculations, wall shear stress and heat transfer results for several turbulence models and their associated wall treatments are first compared for flow in a single tube that is representative of a coolant channel in the prismatic HTGR core. The results are compared to published correlations for wall shear stress and Nusselt number in turbulent pipe flow. Turbulence models that perform well are then used to make bypass flow calculations in a symmetric onetwelfth sector of a prismatic block that includes bypass flow. The comparison of shear stress and Nusselt number results with published correlations constitutes a partial validation of the CFD model. Calculations are also compared to ones made previously using a different CFD code. Results indicate that increasing surface roughness increases the maximum fuel and helium temperatures as do increases in gap width. However, maximum coolant temperature variation due to increased gap width is not changed by surface roughness...|$|R
