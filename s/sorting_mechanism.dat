25|$|The {{development}} of schooling behavior was probably {{associated with an}} increased quality of perception, predatory lifestyle and size sorting mechanisms to avoid cannibalism.

It has been shown that small fish avoid joining a group with larger fish, although big fish do not avoid joining small conspecifics.

Jonathan Kaiman of The Guardian writes that Chinese parents and educators [...] "see their own system as corrupt, dehumanising, pressurised and unfair"; {{he went on to}} discuss the country's college admission exam (called the gaokao), writing that [...] "many parents consider the gruelling nine-hour test a <b>sorting</b> <b>mechanism</b> that will determine the trajectory of their children's lives." [...] In The New York Times, Helen Gao called China's educational system [...] "cutthroat" [...] and wrote that its positive reputation among admirers is largely built on a myth: While China has phenomenally expanded basic education for its people, quadrupling its output of college graduates in the past decade, it has also created a system that discriminates against its less wealthy and well-connected citizens, thwarting social mobility at every step with bureaucratic and financial barriers. A huge gap in educational opportunities between students from rural areas and those from cities {{is one of the main}} culprits. Some 60 million students in rural schools are 'left-behind' children, cared for by their grandparents as their parents seek work in faraway cities. While many of their urban peers attend schools equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and well-trained teachers, rural students often huddle in decrepit school buildings and struggle to grasp advanced subjects such as English and chemistry amid a dearth of qualified instructors. 'Rural students stand virtually no chance when competing academically with their urban counterparts,' Jiang Nengjie, a friend and independent filmmaker who made a documentary on the left-behind children, told me. In The Chronicle of Higher Education, Lara Farrar argued that the disabled are [...] "shortchanged" [...] in Chinese schools, with very little chance of acceptance into higher educational institutions.|$|E

50|$|In the {{development}} of mammalian visual system, axons from each eyes crosses through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and terminate in separate layers of striate cortex. However, axons from each LGN can only be driven by {{one side of the}} eye, but not both together. These axons that terminate in layer IV of the striate cortex result in ocular dominance columns. A study shows that The density of innervating axons in layer IV from LGN can be increased by exogenous BDNF and reduced by a scavenger of endogenous BDNF. Therefore, it raises the possibility that both of these agents are involved in some <b>sorting</b> <b>mechanism</b> that is not well comprehended yet.

40|$|During the US Industrial Revolution, {{educational}} expansion {{may have}} created skilled jobs through innovation and skill upgrading or reduced skilled jobs by mechanizing production. Such arguments contradict classic sociological work that treats {{education as a}} <b>sorting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> allocating individuals to fixed occupa-tions. I capitalize on state differences in the timing of compulsory school attendance laws to ask whether raising the minimum level of schooling: (1) increased school attendance rate; or (2) shifted state occupational distributions away from agricultural toward skilled and non-manual occupation categories. Using state-level panel data constructed from 1850 – 1930 censuses and state-year fixed effects models, I find that compulsory laws significantly increased school attendance rates, particularly among lower-class children, and shifted the categorical distribution toward skilled and non-manual occupations. Thus, rather than deskilling through mechanization, raising the minimum level of education seems to have created skilled jobs and raised the occu-pational distribution through skill-biased technological change.
