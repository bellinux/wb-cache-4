A {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between <b>specific</b> weight and <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> of wheat in diets offered to broilers up to 4 weeks of age was carried out using 10 varieties of wheat grown at 3 different locations; this gave rise to a range of specific weight from 59 to 76 kg/hl. 2.

5000|$|The Archaic {{time frame}} is defined {{culturally}} as {{a transition from}} a hunting/gathering lifestyle to one involving agriculture and permanent, if only seasonally occupied, settlements. In the Southwest, the Archaic is generally dated from 8000 years ago to approximately 1800 to 2000 years ago. [...] During this time {{the people of the}} southwest developed a variety of subsistence strategies, all using their own <b>specific</b> techniques. The <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> of weed and grass seeds was discovered and flat rocks were used to grind flour to produce gruels and breads. This use of grinding slabs in about 7500 BCE marks the beginning of the Archaic tradition. Small bands of people traveled throughout the area, gathering plants such as cactus fruits, mesquite beans, acorns, and pine nuts. Archaic people established camps at collection points, and returned to these places year after year. They lived primarily in the open, but probably also built temporary shelters. Known artifacts include nets woven with plant fibers and rabbit skin, woven sandals, gaming sticks, and animal figures made from split-twigs.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed at}} characterizing the {{relationships}} between the food web's structure and the <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> of basal food sources in a Northern Brittany (France) Laminaria digitata bed. Stable isotopes were used to identify the food sources consumed by benthic invertebrates, and the <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> of primary producers was assessed according to four descriptors (total organic matter, C/N ratio, proteins content, lipids content). Although the food web appeared to be based on a wide diversity of food sources, only Rhodophyta (red algae) and biofilms (epilithic and epiphytic) were heavily consumed by grazers. In contrast. Phaeophyta (brown algae), which are dominant in this habitat, have no specialized grazer (with the exception of Helcion pellucidum, specialized grazer of Laminaria digitata). This selective consumption {{may be related to the}} higher protein content and lower C/N ratio of Rhodophyta and biofilms, in comparison with Phaeophyta. Fresh brown algae are thus of poor <b>nutritive</b> <b>value,</b> but processes associated with their degradation are likely to improve this <b>nutritive</b> <b>value,</b> leading in the assimilation of detritus by filter-feeders, revealed by high delta(13) C in these consumers. Our results thus suggest that the <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> of basal food sources may be an important factor involved in the structuration of kelp-associated food webs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

Effects of {{irrigation}} amount and timing on alfalfa <b>nutritive</b> <b>value.</b> Transactions of the Asabe, 59 (4), 849 - 860. doi: 10. 13031 /trans. 59. 11456 Most hay producers in southwest Kansas irrigate their alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) because precipitation is insufficient for profitable rainfed production. However, water supplies {{in the central}} Great Plains are dwindling, particularly in the central and southern Ogallala Aquifer region. Irrigating many field crops in this region, including alfalfa, is therefore becoming a challenge. We determined the effects {{of irrigation}} quantity and timing on alfalfa forage <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> during a five-year field study of alfalfa in southwest Kansas. <b>Nutritive</b> <b>value</b> was quantified {{in the form of}} crude protein, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, total digestible nutrients, and relative feed value. In general, applying the highest amount of irrigation (610 mm during the growing season) resulted in the lowest forage <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> compared to lower amounts of irrigation (0, 200, and 380 mm irrigation). <b>Nutritive</b> <b>value</b> concentrations (g kg- 1) under full irrigation averaged 211 for crude protein, 316 for acid detergent fiber, and 422 for neutral detergent fiber, while concentrations (g kg- 1) in rainfed production averaged 225 for crude protein, 247 for acid detergent fiber, and 370 for neutral detergent fiber. Alfalfa <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> was not affected whether the same amount of irrigation water was applied either before green-up and between each cutting, or before green-up and between all cuttings except between cuttings 2 and 3. However, there was a tendency for lower forage <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> at the fourth cutting when irrigation was withheld between cuttings 2 and 3, and that saved water was added to the amount of irrigation applied to the fourth cutting. When averaged over irrigation treatments, alfalfa <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> was lower from the first and second cuttings than from the third and fourth cuttings. Annual yields, averaged over years, declined from 1. 53 kg m- 2 with 610 mm of irrigation to 0. 43 kg m- 2 for rainfed production. Annual yields were the same when irrigation was distributed over the growing season or withheld between the second and third cuttings. Irrigation amounts less than full crop requirement resulted in a 13 % higher dollar value product based on relative feed value, but decreasing irrigation from 610 to 380 mm reduced yield by 19 %. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers...|$|R
