5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for <b>salmon,</b> <b>trout,</b> and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to make a comparison between the characteristics of <b>salmoned</b> <b>trout</b> (Salmo truta) and salmon (Salmo salar) in terms of coloration (CIE L*a*b*), proximate composition, pH and sensory attributes of fresh and smoked fillets in order to obtain a possible alternative for the substitution of imported salmon for Brazilian <b>salmoned</b> <b>trout</b> as a commercial equivalent for retail sales. Results showed that no statistical difference was found for most of the sensory attributes analyzed and for pH.

In contrast, the Esociformes (pikes) are limited to freshwater in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Salmoniformes (<b>salmon,</b> <b>trout)</b> are found in both Northern and Southern temperate zones in freshwater, some species migrating {{to and from the}} sea. The Paracanthopterygii (cods, etc.) are Northern Hemisphere fish, with both salt and freshwater species.|$|E
25|$|The term rough fish {{is used by}} U.S. state {{agencies}} and anglers to describe undesirable predator fish. In North America, anglers fish for <b>salmon,</b> <b>trout,</b> bass, pike, catfish, walleye and muskellunge. The smallest fish are called panfish, because they can fit in a standard cooking pan. Some examples are crappies, rock bass, perch, bluegill and sunfish.|$|E

25|$|Although grizzlies are of {{the order}} Carnivora and have the {{digestive}} system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They {{have been known to}} prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears; though {{they are more likely to}} take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as <b>salmon,</b> <b>trout,</b> and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals. Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a [...] "New Irish Cuisine" [...] based on {{traditional}} ingredients incorporating international influences has emerged.

An example of this new cuisine is [...] "Dublin Lawyer": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream. The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in Europe. Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork, both a type of sausage, or blaa, a doughy white bread particular to Waterford.|$|E

The West Virginia Fish Commission's [...] "first and most expensive efforts" [...] involved the hatching and stocking {{of the salmon}} in West Virginia's streams. To accomplish this feat, White designed and built charcoal raceways to culture the salmon. The salmon were released into the South Branch Potomac River where they flourished and were caught by fishermen from Romney to Washington, D.C.

2500|$|The term coarse fish {{originated}} in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century.

Fish other than game fish were disdained as [...] "coarse fish". These days, [...] "game fish" [...] refers to Salmonids (other than grayling) — that is, <b>salmon,</b> <b>trout</b> and char. Coarse fish are made up mostly of the larger species of Cyprinids (carp, roach, bream) as well as pike, catfish, gar and lamprey. Coarse fish are no longer disdained; indeed, fishing for coarse fish has become a popular pastime.|$|E
