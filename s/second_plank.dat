5000|$|Privatisation was an {{enduring}} legacy of Thatcherism; it {{was accepted by}} the Labour administration of Tony Blair. Her policy was to privatise nationalised corporations (such as the telephone and aerospace firms). She sold public housing to tenants, all on favourable terms. The policy developed an important electoral dimension during the second Thatcher government (1983-90). It involved more than denationalisation: wider share ownership was the <b>second</b> <b>plank</b> of the policy, and this provides an important historical perspective {{on the relationship between}} Thatcherism and 20th-century conservatism. [...] Thatcher preached the goal of achieving an [...] "enterprise society" [...] in Britain, especially in widespread share-ownership, sale of council houses, declining controls imposed by trade unions, and expansion of private health care. These policies radically transformed many central aspects of British society.|$|E
50|$|Craig-y-nos was {{probably}} the first private house in Wales to be wired for electricity. The first in the UK was Cragside in Northumberland in 1880, {{a year after the}} invention of the electric light bulb by Thomas Edison. An Otto engine in the grounds created a 110 V DC system, with distribution provided by two bare copper wires placed in two adjacent grooves carved into a plank of wood, with a <b>second</b> <b>plank</b> placed over the top of it. This supplied power for Swan lamps throughout the castle, and an electrically powered orchestra organ which was controlled by a punched paper roll, situated in the French billiards room. The organ was the pride and joy of her second husband, French tenor Nicolini, thus dating installation prior to his death in 1898. Discovery and investigation into the system was only found by Mr J. A. Lea, the last Hospital Secretary.|$|E
5000|$|In Catholicism, {{justification}} {{is granted}} by God via the act (ex opere operato) of baptism firstly, {{by which the}} subject is formally justified and made holy by his own personal justice and holiness (causa formalis), instead of appropriated plainly by a living faith as under sola fide, and normally from the sacrament of reconciliation after if a mortal sin is committed. Christ can work apart and before the sacrament of baptism, as desire for eventual baptism is grace enough to be saved, since God is not tied to work by means of his instituted sacraments. Nevertheless, Christ instituted the sacrament of Penance for all sinful members of his Church: above all for those who, since Baptism, have fallen into grave sin, and have thus lost their baptismal grace and wounded ecclesial communion. It is to them that the sacrament of Penance offers a new possibility to convert and to recover the grace of justification. The Fathers of the Church present this sacrament as [...] "the <b>second</b> <b>plank</b> salvation after the shipwreck which {{is the loss of}} grace." [...] This {{is not the only way}} for sins to be forgiven, as in some cases these can also be forgiven by confessing to God alone. This is why the Catholic Church teaches that Christians outside of the Church can be saved, since in many cases other Christian denominations do not possess the priesthood instituted from Jesus Christ and thus lack access to the [...] "binding and loosing" [...] that priests of the New Covenant practice through the sacrament. A mortal sin makes justification lost even if faith (intellectual assent) is still present. The Catholic Church declared in the ecumenical Council of Trent that, [...] "If anyone says that the sinner is justified by faith alone,114 meaning that nothing else is required to cooperate in order to obtain the grace of justification, and that it is not in any way necessary that he be prepared and disposed by the action of his own will, let him be anathema." [...] in canon 9 of session VI. It also said in the VII session in canon IV, [...] "If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary unto salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or without the desire thereof, men obtain of God, through faith alone, the grace of justification;-though all (the sacraments) are not indeed necessary for every individual; let him be anathema (excommunicated)." ...|$|E

40|$|Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} {{on the basis}} of a {{dramatically}} different philosophy: The belief that the free market offered the best vehicle for the efficient allocation of scarce resources and that government intrusion in the economy, in all its forms, should be minimized. The pragmatic application of this philosophy took the form of a four point program. The first plank recognized that resources were being wasted because government was preempting activities better performed by the private sector. Thus, the level of real government expenditure had to be cut back, in order to decrease the amount of resources being extracted from the market. It was also recognized that the method by which government expenditures were financed was, itself, a source of disruption. The <b>second</b> <b>plank</b> dictated that the tax system be reformed so as to minimize the distortion of market information. Similarly, excessive cost inefficient regulation was inhibiting economic growth. The third portion of the program addressed this problem. Finally, it was recognized that markets could not function efficiently without a stable means of exchange. Volatile monetary policy had seriously undermined the ability of markets to function, and the President called for a slow, stable monetary polic...|$|E
40|$|The macro {{economic}} stabilisation in Azerbaijan {{has been}} successful. Following cessation of conflict with Armenia, and decline of GDP by 60 per cent from 1990 to 1995, {{the government in}} effect implemented a big-bang reform process in 1995. The inflation rate has now declined to the lowest rate of any transition country and important reforms in the monetary-fiscal mix have been undertaken. The <b>second</b> <b>plank</b> of first generation reforms, liberalisation, has also been successfully implemented with liberalisation of prices, the trade and foreign exchange regimes and virtual completion of small-scale privatisation, although {{the onset of the}} Russian crisis in 1998 has impacted negatively both internal and external balances. The paper presents the current economic picture for Azerbaijan and then assesses economic policy issues facing the country. Azerbaijan is well endowed with natural resources, particularly oil but also gas. The second part of the paper considers the question by focussing on policy issues related to the potential flow of oil-based monies into Azerbaijan. The possibility of the “Dutch Disease” syndrome impacting Azerbaijan through a rising real exchange rate on the non-oil sector is not considered to be a problem at present but is expected to become a policy concern in the medium- to long term. Structural reforms in public finance to deal with expected surpluses are lagging and are necessary in the next phase of the transition of Azerbaijan. Moreover, significant reforms are required in banking – privatisation, improvement in regulation and supervision and in the implementation of supporting legal rights, given the current lack of financial intermediation.

40|$|Objectives This {{paper has}} two objectives. The {{first is to}} examine the Israeli {{long-term}} care (LTC) system that is marked by rapidly increasing demands, and a multitude of public and private LTC arrangements. The second is to propose a reform to improve the system's efficiency and equity. Methods The paper studies the LTC services in Israel, and the private-public composition in funding, fund holding, and provision of LTC. It focuses on structural deficiencies in the organization of each of these functions separately, and in combination. Results In many countries LTC has evolved in a patchwork fashion that {{at some point in time}} needs rethinking and rationalization. Israel is a case in point. In spite of numerous LTC arrangements supported by the state, in the absence of a comprehensive strategy, these have not generated a coherent system that can deal efficiently and equitably with existing and fast growing LTC needs, on the one hand, and the resources available to it, on the other. The current system is fragmented. It provides limited coverage and insufficient benefits in a troublesome fashion to public. The findings suggest that Israel can achieve at least in the short term, universal entitlement to LTC at lower financial and social cost, than the current costs of the system. In the medium and long term, the country will need to consider the trade between the burden of direct care on households or the tax burden of publicly supported and organized care. Conclusions To remedy the situation the paper suggests a two-planked reform. The first is integration of the current fragmented publicly supported system while deciding on LTC either as a "social endeavor" under a separate authority responsible for implementing the public LTC budget, or as a "medical endeavor", putting this responsibility under the Israeli sickness funds. The <b>second</b> <b>plank,</b> building on the first, comprises extension of universal entitlement to LTC. Such an extension would increase public spending in the long term; simultaneously, it would relieve the tax-paying population of a substantial privately borne burden of a fast aging population.

5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in late 85/early 86 by guitarist Mark and drummer Mark Drew, who {{recruited}} other members, Geoff Bell (lead gtr), Barry (bass) and Cosmo Nasty (vox). After some progress on the regional gigging circuit, dissatisfaction within the band forced some personnel changes, Geoff and Barry being replaced by Dave and Nik. They released a début album, Gasoline Junkie in 1989 on the Long Pig label, distributed by What Goes On records. They then signed to Demon Records who issued <b>second</b> album <b>Plank</b> in 1990. They then moved to Kramer's Shimmy Disc label for two further albums, Animal Rites (1990) and Strange Weather (1991), with several line-up changes taking place (the Animal Rites line-up included Greg Seeger on drums and Mick Flanagan on keyboards). Later, John Galvin replaced Nik on bass. Animal Rites was described as [...] "mind-numbing" [...] by Factsheet Five, who described it: [...] "Imagine {{what would have happened}} if someone had handed Ravi Shankar an electric guitar instead of a sitar." [...] The band recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show in February 1990. The Animal Rites line-up also recorded a track for a compilation album, Knowing Where It All Leeds, with Jess on vocals, as well as a track for the ShimmyDisc Rutles tribute album with a guest secret collaborator from another contemporary Leeds band, and Jonny on vocals. Their Velvets cover I'm Sticking With You, was released on one of the Heaven and Hell Velvet Underground tribute albums. In November 1991 they received a setback when they were attacked on tour and had £5,000 worth of equipment stolen. After an EP in 1992 the band split up.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} morning, it {{was decided}} to cap the first and <b>second</b> shaft with <b>planks</b> and clay. This tactic seemed to work as the flames died down, but thick black smoke still arose from the third shaft as it was left open. The decision was made to put out the fire and a nearby stream was diverted to put out the fires by flooding the mine. This however made it impossible to recover the bodies until the mine was drained again. Two months after the explosion on 17 April 1857, the mine was finally drained and the recovery of bodies began. The recovered bodies were all placed in coffins and lined up in the yard to be identify by loved ones. Most of the bodies were badly burned or mutilated and were thereby unrecognizable. By 22 May, 100 bodies had been recovered, the others were being dug out of the collapsed roof. The corpses of horses down the mine were also slowing down the recovery process. The last body was recovered on 16 July 1857, it was later found out that most men died in the explosion, but that a large amount of the victims were also killed by suffocation by Afterdamp. In total 185 bodies were recovered, the remaining 4 could not be traced. The unrecognized bodies were buried in a large grave in Darfield church yard.|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 27 September 2017 Examining Board: Professor Marie-Laure Salles-Djelic, Sciences Po; Dr. João Rodrigues, University of Coimbra (external advisor); Professor Youssef Cassis, European Universiy Institute; Professor Lucy Riall, European University Institute (supervisor) The {{thesis is}} a close study of a {{transnational}} group of intellectuals, mainly economists, who met in Paris in 1938 and at Mont Pèlerin in 1947 with the explicit aim {{to create a new}} liberalism for the modern world. At times they would use neoliberalism as a description of the creed they were developing, later they would opt for classical liberalism, in a bid to highlight continuities in their approach to political philosophy. Was their liberalism classical or was it new? The verb to reinvent is used frequently in modern academe, but its meaning is somewhat unclear. In the history of political thought, however, and especially the history of liberalism, the term can become a useful tool for enquiry. One way or the other, all new creeds build on previous ones, but the intellectuals in question were involved in a conscious, explicit attempt to change liberalism. This involved restating certain aspects of what they perceived as “true liberalism” and updating these to a different social and historical context, while also purging liberalism of all they felt was wrong with it. The contextualization of the many layers of interpretation involved in making these arguments is the main topic of this thesis. The intellectuals in question argued that “economic planning” was what had led to the rise of dictatorships in Europe. They included the communist dictatorship in Russia and the fascist dictatorships in Germany and Italy as part of the same phenomenon, totalitarianism, and further claimed that democracies like the USA, Great Britain and France were headed in the same direction. In this way, other, tangential movements to reinvent liberalism under labels such as new liberalism or social liberalism also came under attack, as it was argued that they were taking society in a totalitarian direction through collectivism and economic planning. The latter concept was defined loosely as any government “intervention” in the economy or, more precisely, attempts at subverting the mechanisms of markets in order to improve on their outcomes, redistribute wealth or counter business cycles. This strong criticism of economic planning did not lead these thinkers to advocate a position of “laissez-faire”. On the contrary, the <b>second</b> major <b>plank</b> of their intellectual project was an attack on the ideas of laissez-faire liberalism, a creed they claimed was rigid and outdated. Their internal debates can be seen as an attempt to incorporate a theory of states into right-wing liberalism, and focused on how to use states to spread, protect and foster what they still saw as a largely self-regulating mechanism. The first part of the thesis traces this dual argument to books, articles, lectures and correspondence by and between the intellectuals involved, from the German language socialist calculation debates in the 1920 s, to the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947. The second part of the thesis uses some of the tools of micro history to conduct an in-depth study of this ten-day meeting in the Swiss alps. In the conclusion I argue that neoliberalism is best understood as a theory of modernity arising out of the historical conjuncture of Europe in the 1920 s, 30 s and 40 s. This theory was based on a novel conceptualization of markets as mediators of modernity, the only mechanism through which order and prosperity could be achieved in a modern mass-society. Neoliberals took this new understanding of markets and combined it with an embrace of state power as legitimate within a theory of liberalism when put to use in concordance with what was believed to be logic of markets. The work may contribute to a deeper understanding of neoliberalism, whether this is seen as a philosophy inspiring a political movement, a political rationality, or some sort of combination of the two...|$|R
