5|$|Rocket {{propellant}}: Solid {{fuel rocket}} propellant began during the 1200s during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty {{at a time}} when bows, arrows, and catapult-based projectile launchers were state of the art military technology in medieval Europe.

5|$|Initial {{development}} {{was conducted by}} Saunders-Roe, which merged into Westland Aircraft in 1964. Westland was subsequently the prime contractor for the Black Arrow, and assembled {{the first and second}} stages at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Bristol Siddeley produced the first and second stage engines at a factory in Ansty, Warwickshire. The engines were test fired at the factory before being shipped to the Isle of Wight, where they were integrated into the rocket and the first stage engines were fired again at High Down. Bristol Aerojet produced the third stage in Somerset, while the Explosives Research and Development Establishment produced its <b>solid</b> <b>propellant</b> in Waltham Abbey, Essex. The Rocket Propulsion Establishment, based in Westcott, Buckinghamshire, was responsible for the design and integration of the stage.|$|E

Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are propelled by three-stage <b>solid</b> <b>propellant</b> rockets and are equipped with 8–14 nuclear warheads. The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, {{with a range of}} 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, with a range of 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of the class is the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo. Ohio-class submarines that carry ballistic missiles receive orders from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska.|$|E

5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a <b>solid</b> <b>propellant</b> into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E

25|$|The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle, usually {{known by}} its {{abbreviation}} ASLV was a 5-stage <b>solid</b> <b>propellant</b> rocket with the capability of placing a 150kg satellite into Low Earth Orbit. This project was started by the ISRO during the early 1980s to develop technologies needed for a payload to be placed into a geostationary orbit. Its design was based on Satellite Launch Vehicle. The first launch test was held in 1987, and after that 3 others followed in 1988, 1992 and 1994, out of which only 2 were successful, before it was decommissioned.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the energy}} {{ultimately}} comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when {{a very high}} speed is required, such as ICBMs or orbital launch. For example, NASA's space shuttle fires its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000tonnes of <b>solid</b> <b>propellant</b> (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000litres of liquid propellant (106,261kg of liquid hydrogen fuel) to lift the 100,000kg vehicle (including the 25,000kg payload) to an altitude of 111km and an orbital velocity of 30,000km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle has a kinetic energy of about 3TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200GJ. Given the initial energy of 20TJ, the Space Shuttle is about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter.|$|E
25|$|The second {{satellite}} launch {{attempt on}} April 24, 1970 was successful. A CZ-1 {{was used to}} launch the 173kg Dong Fang Hong I (东方红一号, meaning The East Is Red I), also known as Mao-1. It was the heaviest first satellite placed into orbit by a nation, exceeding the combined masses of the first satellites of the other four previous countries. The third stage of the CZ-1 was specially equipped with a 40 m2 solar reflector (观察球) deployed by the centrifugal force developed by the spin up orbital insertion <b>solid</b> <b>propellant</b> stage. Therefore, the faint magnitude 5 to 8 brightness of the DFH-1 made the satellite (at best) barely visible with naked eyes was consequently dramatically increased to a comfortable magnitude 2 to 3.|$|E
25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, <b>solid</b> <b>propellant,</b> liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E
