Following a 24 -h fasting, 540 fish were randomly distributed to each of 18 tanks (30 fish/tank) under a semi-recirculation freshwater system. The GP of 0. 5 % (GP 0. 5), 1 % (GP 1), 1. 5 % (GP 1. 5), 2 % (GP 2) and 3 % (GP 3) {{was added to the}} control diet (GP 0) containing 43 % protein and 16 % lipid. After the feeding trial, weight gain (WG) of fish fed GP 1. 5, GP 2 and GP 3 were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those of fish fed GP 0, GP 0. 5 and GP 1. Feed efficiency and specific growth rate (SGR) showed a similar trend to WG. Protein efficiency ratio of fish fed GP 1. 5, GP 2, and GP 3 were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those of fish groups fed the other diets. A significant difference (p< 0. 05) was found in whole body composition (moisture, crude protein, crude lipid, ash, and fiber) of fish {{at the end of the}} experiment. Significantly higher (p< 0. 05) protein and lipid retention efficiencies (PRE and LRE) were also found in GP 1. 5, GP 2, and GP 3 groups.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the supplemental effects of dietary garlic extract (GE) on growth performance of juvenile <b>sterlet</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser ruthenus). The first experiment was designed to determine the optimum levels of garlic extract as growth promoter during 10 weeks. Three groups (two replicates/group) of 240 fish with mean body weight of 85 g were fed with diets containing 0 (control), 0. 5 and 1. 0 % of GE. The highest weight gain (%) and feed efficiency (%) were found in fish groups fed with diet containing 0. 5 % GE. Subsequently, the supplemental effects of dietary GE was studied on growth of juvenile <b>sterlet</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser ruthenus) with an average body weight of 59. 6 g.

40|$|Sturgeons are {{fish species}} with a complex biology. They are also {{characterized}} by complex aspects including polyploidization and easiness of hybridization. As {{with most of}} the Ponto-Caspian sturgeons, the populations of Acipenser ruthenus from the Danube have declined drastically during the last decades. This is the first report on mitochondrial point heteroplasmy in the cytochrome b gene of this species. The 1141 bp sequence of the cytb gene in wild <b>sterlet</b> <b>sturgeon</b> individuals from the Lower Danube was determined, and site heteroplasmy evidenced in three of the 30 specimens collected. Two nucleotide sequences were identified in these heteroplasmic individuals. The majority of the heteroplasmic sites are synonymous and do not modify the sequence of amino acids in cytochrome B protein. To date, several cases of point heteroplasmy have been reported in animals, mostly due to paternal leakage of mtDNA. The presence of specific point heteroplasmic sites might be interesting for a possible correlation with genetically distinct groups in the Danube River...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{characteristics}} of spermatogenic and oogenic cells during gametogenesis may reflect a corresponding alteration in aspects of components such as calcium, which plays prominent roles in regulating {{a broad range of}} physiological events in animal reproduction. Basic information regarding distribution of intracellular calcium in different germ cells may provide better understanding of processes of reproduction in fish. The monthly testicular development in the cultured breeding stock of sterlet, Acipenser ruthenus, using histological and serum sex steroid was studied. Results showed four distinct phases including resting, pre-spawning, spawning and post-spawning. Hormonal profiles of 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) showed peak, which indicated a seasonal pattern of gonadal development. The 11 -KT concentration increased considerably during the spermatogenesis (pre-spawning phase) and remained quite high throughout the pre-spermiation period. In the final phase of testicular development (spawning phase), the 11 -KT markedly dropped. This study provides basic knowledge of the reproductive biology in male sterlet and a complete guide for gonadal development, heretofore lacking in previous studies of sturgeon gonadal development. The intracellular distribution of calcium during different developmental stages of spermatogenesis was studied in sterlet, A. ruthenus, using a combined oxalate-pyroantimonate technique. The distribution of calcium was described in spermatogonium, spermatocyte, spermatid, and spermatozoon stages. Although calcium is appeared in the form of deposits in limited areas of the early stages cells (spermatogonium and spermatocyte), it is present as an unbound form in larger areas of spermatids and spermatozoa especially nucleus, which probably reflects changes in its physiological function and homeostasis of calcium during male gamete production. Similar to <b>sterlet</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> ultrastructural distribution of calcium during different developmental stages of spermatogenesis was described in a model organism, zebrafish (Danio rerio), using a combined oxalate-pyroantimonate technique. The subcellular distribution of intracellular calcium was detected as deposits mainly in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the spermatogonium and spermatocyte. Interestingly, large amount of calcium was transformed from isolated deposits into an unbound pool (electrondense mass) within the nucleus of the spermatid and the spermatozoon. The alteration of intracellular calcium at different stage of D. rerio spermatogenesis can be related to specific function of each germ cell types during male gamete development. Unbound calcium in the nucleus of mature spermatozoon can be used for condensation of chromatin and induction of calcium wave during egg activation and fertilization. Using a combined oxalate-pyroantimonate technique, the subcellular distribution of calcium deposits during stages of oogenesis in zebrafish was described. Calcium deposits were localized at different organells within the egg during oocyte development. At the first stage of oocyte development (primary growth), calcium deposits were localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus, and follicular cells. At the cortical-alveolus stage, calcium particles were transported from follicular cells into the cortical alveoli. In the main stage of oocyte development (vitellogenic stage), some cortical alveoli were compacted and transformed from flocculent electron-lucent to electron-dense objects with the progression of the stage. Calcium deposits were transformed from larger to smaller particles, coinciding with compaction of cortical alveoli. As a conclusion, results of this study provide new and convergent insight into information about the regulation and functional roles of calcium during fish gametogenesis which simply describe facilitate release of calcium from related organelles (nucleus and cortical alveoli) as main internal stores of calcium for calcium transport...|$|E

40|$|Populations of six {{sturgeon}} {{species in}} the Danube River (Beluga, Russian <b>sturgeon,</b> Stellate <b>sturgeon,</b> <b>Sterlet,</b> Ship <b>sturgeon</b> and Atlantic sturgeon) have experienced severe decline during the last several decades, mostly due to the unsustainable fishery, river fragmentation and water pollution. In the present study, the question of viability of Danube sturgeon populations and the poor knowledge of their ecology have been addressed through three different research activities: 1) statistical methods that infer extinction based on sighting records {{have been used to}} assess probability of extinction of the Ship and Atlantic sturgeon, whose presence n the Danube basin is uncertain; 2) assessment of microelement accumulation in sturgeon pectoral fin rays, especially of strontium and calcium, has been conducted as a method that can reveal migration patterns of anadromous sturgeons; 3) population viability analysis in a Vortex simulation model has been conducted in order to assess the state of the six Danube sturgeon species, their future risk of extinction and to determine the most suitable conservation and management measures. Methods for inferring extinction based on sighting records provided a significant probability that the Atlantic sturgeon is extinct, with extinction occurring somewhere between 1966 and 1970, and that the Ship sturgeon is probably still present in the Danube basin, but that extinction may occur within a few decades. A new model has been also developed within the present study, able to infer probability of extinction based on the trends in sighting intervals, since this issue was not adequately considered in the existing models. Although the analysis of the strontium to calcium ratio in sturgeon pectoral fin rays has revealed changes that might indicate probable migration of juvenile fish from the river to the sea, further studies are needed for improvement of this method. Population viability analysis has revealed a large sensitivity of the Danube sturgeon populations to changes in the natural mortality, fecundity, age at maturity and spawning frequency. It was also confirmed that the sturgeons are highly susceptible to even moderate levels of commercial fishery, and that their recovery is a multi-decadal affair. Stocking with adult individuals was shown to produce considerably greater effect on population persistence than stocking with juveniles, but the latter approach is probably still preferable since it avoids many inherent problems of aquaculture cultivation. This study represents the first population viability analysis of the Danube sturgeons...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To study some morphometric parameters, {{protein and}} {{lysozyme}} content in organs and serum in several sturgeon species reared in aquiculture at {{the ages of}} 3, 8 and 18 months, and to investigate the specific and age distribution of lysozyme in fish organs. Methodology. For the experiments we used sturgeon species of different age groups reared in the fish farm «Fortuna XXI» located in the Galerny Gulf of the Dіnprо river. The study objects were: bester (Huso huso×Acipenser ruthenus), age of 3, 8 and 18 months; Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), age of 3 months, Siberian sturgeon (A. baeri) and sterlet (A. ruthenus), age of 8 month. Following morphometric parameters were determined in the studied fish: weight (g), length (cm), absolute weight of liver, kidneys, spleen (mg), condition factor and relative weight (index, ‰) of organs. The lysozyme content was determined in serum and extracts of the tissues of fish organs by a diffusion method on the agar and protein content was determined by Louri's method. Findings. We detected significant differences in morphometric parameters, protein and lysozyme content in organs and serum of 3 -month bester and Russian sturgeon as well as specific differences of relative organ weight, protein and lysozyme levels in organs and serum of 8 -month Siberian <b>sturgeon,</b> bester and <b>sterlet.</b> A comparison of the investigated parameters in 3, 8 and 18 -month bester showed {{an increase in the}} condition factor with fish growth, significant changes of protein content in fish of different age groups, high level of lysozyme in kidneys and serum of 18 -month fish, redistribution of lysozyme contents in fish organs depending on age.

40|$|Sturgeon species (order Acipenseriformes) {{are prone}} for {{interspecific}} hybridization. Anthropogenic activities in river basins influence sturgeon reproduction by destruction of their natural spawning grounds. Consequently, spawning areas, {{as well as}} the time of spawning of sturgeon species overlap and different sturgeon species reproduce concurrently. This increases the probability of meeting of heterospecific gametes and pre-zygotic postcopulatory reproductive barriers, comprising of sperm competition and cryptic female choice, may {{play an important role in}} preventing undesirable interspecific hybridization. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of interspecific sperm competition and cryptic female choice during interspecific hybridization of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) and Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii). Reproductive characteristics (fertilization rate and hatching rate) were described in each of experimental and control groups showing similar values for competitive and non-competitive trials. Parentage assignment was performed in hatched larvae using combination of mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite DNA markers. Obtained results revealed higher fertilization success of sterlet spermatozoa, when these competed for fertilization with spermatozoa of Siberian sturgeon. Total reproductive success of starlet spermatozoa was 78. 9 % and Siberian sturgeon 21. 1 %. Contrary, when spermatozoa did not compete for fertilization, males of analysed species showed equal fertilization success. In the trials, where eggs of both studied species were mixed and fertilized by sperm from each species separately, eggs of any species did not show a tendency to bias fertilization by spermatozoa of conspecific males.
