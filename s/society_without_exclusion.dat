40|$|In social biology, it {{is often}} {{considered}} that an organized <b>society</b> cannot exist <b>without</b> <b>exclusion</b> behaviour towards newcomers from another nest. Unlike most vertebrate and invertebrate social species, social spiders such as Anelosimus eximius accept unrelated migrants without agonistic behaviour. Does it imply that spiders cannot recognize non-nestmates from nestmates or {{is there any evidence}} of recognition without aggression ? In order to answer this question, we studied behavioural differences between groups coming from single and mixed-nests in the overall context of swarming. Our study shows that the presence of non-nestmate conspecifics reduces the cohesion of the swarm groups during the settlement process and increases the spatial dispersion of spiders, the asymmetry in the spatial distribution being less pronounced. Individuals belonging to different nests are not as mutually attractive. This paper shows that, during the induced migration, two processes counteract each other: the amplification process resulting from the addition of silk drives individuals to form groups with non-nestmates and the recognition process reduces the cohesion of groups composed of non-nestmates. The collective decision-making during migration results from the balance between these two trends...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} {{excluding}} patients {{from the analysis}} of randomised trials are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects and higher heterogeneity between trials. DESIGN: Meta-epidemiological study based on a collection of meta-analyses of randomised trials. DATA SOURCES: 14 meta-analyses including 167 trials that compared therapeutic interventions with placebo or non-intervention control in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and used patient reported pain as an outcome. METHODS: Effect sizes were calculated from differences in means of pain intensity between groups {{at the end of}} follow-up, divided by the pooled standard deviation. Trials were combined by using random effects meta-analysis. Estimates of treatment effects were compared between trials with and trials <b>without</b> <b>exclusions</b> from the analysis, and the impact of restricting meta-analyses to trials <b>without</b> <b>exclusions</b> was assessed. RESULTS: 39 trials (23 %) had included all patients in the analysis. In 128 trials (77 %) some patients were excluded from the analysis. Effect sizes from trials with exclusions tended to be more beneficial than those from trials <b>without</b> <b>exclusions</b> (difference - 0. 13, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 29 to 0. 04). However, estimates of bias between individual meta-analyses varied considerably (tau(2) = 0. 07). Tests of interaction between exclusions from the analysis and estimates of treatment effects were positive in five meta-analyses. Stratified analyses indicated that differences in effect sizes between trials with and trials <b>without</b> <b>exclusions</b> were more pronounced in meta-analyses with high between trial heterogeneity, in meta-analyses with large estimated treatment benefits, and in meta-analyses of complementary medicine. Restriction of meta-analyses to trials <b>without</b> <b>exclusions</b> resulted in smaller estimated treatment benefits, larger P values, and considerable decreases in between trial heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Excluding patients from the analysis in randomised trials often results in biased estimates of treatment effects, but the extent and direction of bias is unpredictable. Results from intention to treat analyses should always be described in reports of randomised trials. In systematic reviews, the influence of exclusions from the analysis on estimated treatment effects should routinely be assessed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} exclusive contracts between health care providers and insurers in a model where some consumers choose to stay uninsured. In case of a monopoly insurer, exclusion of a provider changes the distribution of consumers who choose not to insure. Although the foreclosed care provider remains active {{in the market for}} the non-insured, we show that exclusion leads to anti-competitive effects on this non-insured market. As a consequence exclusion can raise industry profits, and then occurs in equilibrium. Under competitive insurance markets, the anticompetitive exclusive equilibrium survives. Uninsured consumers, however, are now not better off <b>without</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Competition among insurers raises prices in equilibria <b>without</b> <b>exclusion,</b> {{as a result of a}} horizontal analogue to the double marginalization effect. Instead, under competitive insurance markets exclusion is desirable as long as no provider is excluded by all insurers. ...|$|R
