40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Salting-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> was discov-ered in {{the nineteenth}} century and is widely used for protein {{separation}} and crystallization. It is gen-erally believed that salting-out occurs because at high concentrations salts and the protein compete for solvation water. Debye and Kirkwood suggested ideas for explaining salting-out (Debeye and Mac-Aulay, Physik Z; 1925; 131 : 22 – 29; Kirkwood, In: Pro-teins, amino acids and peptides as ions and dipolar ions. New York: Reinhold; 1943. p 586 – 622). How-ever, a quantitative theory has not been developed, and such a theory is presented here. It is built on Kirkwood’s idea that a salt ion has a repulsive interactionwith an image charge inside a lowdielec-tric cavity. Explicit treatment is given for the effect of other salt ions on the interaction between a salt ion and its image charge. When combined with the Debye-Hückel effect of salts on the solvation energy of protein charges (i. e., salting-in), the characteris-tic curve of protein solubility versus salt concentra-tion is obtained. The theory yields a direct link between the salting-out effect and surface tension and is able to provide rationalizations for the effects of salt on the folding stability of several proteins...|$|E
40|$|Modification of a lipid {{extraction}} method was used to demonstrate the ability of cal-cium to stabilize salivary proteins in an aqueous solution. Gel electrophoretic pat-terns showed that slowly migrating compon-ents were most affected. Several biologically active factors are implicated to be among those stabilized. Calcium has long been recognized as an element important to the activity and con-formation of proteins in body fluids, for example, salivary amylase. Whole saliva is, however, a complex mixture of biologically active factors and inorganic ions derived from the salivary glands and gingival sulcus fluid. 1 " 2 Some of these factors may influence the associations of calcium with salivary macromolecules. The role of inorganic ions to stabilize macromolecules in solution 3 or to cause them to precipitate 4, 5 has been ex-tensively studied although the processes in-volved are not yet thoroughly understood. Recently, a factor {{has been found that}} sta-bilizes dicalcium phosphate dihydrate in saliva, 6 whereas other studies have shown cal-cium to be bound to salivary macromolecules and to be complexed with inorganic con-stituents. 7, 8 Thus, it appears that organic components may stabilize particular in-organic relationships in saliva in addition to the more generally known phenomena of the salting-in and <b>salting-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins.</b> Lipids constitute one group of compounds that may alter the association of calcium with salivary proteins.

Somewater-soluble proteins have beenmigrated from the aqueous to the IL phase. When tetrabutylphosphonium 2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzenesulfonate {{was used as an}} IL, cytochrome c (Cyt. c) was found to be extracted from the water phase to the IL phase. Conversely, both horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and azurin remained in the aqueous phase. This selective extraction was comprehended to be due to the difference in solubility <b>of</b> these <b>proteins</b> in both phases. The separated aqueous phase contained a small amount of IL, which induced the <b>salting-out</b> <b>of</b> Cyt. c. On the other hand, condensed IL phase promoted the salting-in of Cyt. c. As a result, Cyt. c was preferably dissolved in the hydrated IL phase rather than aqueous phase. In the case of HRP, there was only a salting-out profile upon increasing the concentration of IL, which induced selective dissolution of HRP in the aqueous phase.

It is also of importance that by using of acetone the process of regeneration by distillation of the reaction solutions is characterized by the lowest energy consumption. A functional relationship between the solubility of molybdoferrates(II) and dielectric constant of the medium was established. By increasing the dielectric constant of the solvent solubility of molybdoferrates(II) rapidly increases.

40|$|Hydrophobic {{association}} and solvation of methane molecules in aqueous solutions of urea and sarcosine (sa) {{have been studied}} using MD simulations. The potentials of mean force (PMFs) between methane molecules in water, water-sa, water-urea and water-urea-sa mixtures show an enhancement of methane association on the addition of these osmolytes. These observations are well supported by calculation of equilibrium constants. Calculation of thermodynamic parameters shows that the association of methane is stabilized by entropy and favored by enthalpy. The hydrophobic solvation of methane is stabilized by enthalpy and destabilized by entropy. The calculated solvation free energies of methane in these mixtures show that methane is less soluble in the mixtures of urea and sarcosine than in water. The solubility is the least in the water-urea-sa mixture. Analysis of distributions of solvent and co-solvent around methane suggests that the local densities of both urea and sarcosine are diminished around the methane in the mixtures of these osmolytes. The selective reduction of both urea and sarcosine from methane surface suggests that both urea and sarcosine push methane molecules towards water and increase the interaction between methane molecules i. e., <b>salting-out</b> <b>of</b> methane...|$|R
40|$|The binding of {{acetylcholine}} to pure lipids, and lipids, {{proteins and}} lipoproteins extracted from synaptic membranes, was investigated by monolayer and n. m. r. techniques. No specific binding of acetylcholine could be detected at the concentration used, although its muscarinic and nicotinic antagonists [atropine and (+) -tubocurarine respectively] could {{be shown to}} interact with the membrane components. It is concluded that the binding of the nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists of acetylcholine is not necessarily indicative of the existence of a specific acetylcholine receptor. Measurements of the displacement of 45 Ca 2 + from monolayers of phosphatidylserine by acetylcholine and the variation of electrophoretic mobility of phosphatidylserine particles with concentration of acetylcholine indicated that in these systems acetylcholine was acting as a counterion at the negatively charged lipid interface. But studies of the salting-in and <b>salting-out</b> <b>of</b> negatively charged lipid aggregates showed that acetylcholine and other quaternary ammonium compounds did not here behave simply as counterions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} salts on the solvent-induced {{interactions}} between hydrophobic particles dispersed in explicit aqueous solution is investigated {{as a function}} of the salt’s ionic charge density by molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that aggregates of the hydrophobic particles can be formed or dissolved in response to changes in the charge density of the ions. Ions with high charge density increase the propensity of the hydrophobic particles to aggregate. This corresponds to stronger hydrophobic interactions and a decrease in the solubility (<b>salting-out)</b> <b>of</b> the hydrophobic particles. Ions with low charge density can either increase or decrease the propensity for aggregation depending on whether the concentration of the salt is low or high, respectively. At low concentrations of low charge density ions, the aggregate forms a “micelle-like ” structure in which the ions are preferentially adsorbed at the surface of the aggregate. These “micelle-like ” structures can be soluble in water so that the electrolyte can both increase the solubility and increase aggregation at the same time. We also find, that at the concentration of the hydrophobic particles studied (0. 75 m), the aggregation process resembles a first-order transition in finite systems. I...|$|R

The binary mixture of the ionic liquid betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide and water shows thermomorphic behavior with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which can be used to avoid the slower mass transfer due to the generally higher viscosity of ionic liquids. A less viscous homogeneous phase and mixing on a molecular scale are obtained when the mixture is heated up above 55 °C. The influence of the temperature, the heating and cooling times, were studied for the extraction of neodymium(III) with betaine.

Some of these salts lead however to the salting-in of [C 4 C 1 im][NTf 2] in aqueous medium at salt molalities lower than 0. 2 mol kg− 1. To attempt the development of a model able to describe the salt effects, comprising both the salting-in and salting-out phenomena observed, the electrolyte Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (ePC-SAFT) was applied using ion-specific parameters.
