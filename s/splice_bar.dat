50|$|In rail terminology, a fishplate, <b>splice</b> <b>bar</b> or {{joint bar}} is a metal bar that is {{bolted to the}} ends of two rails to join them {{together}} in a track. The name is derived from fish, a wooden bar with a curved profile used to strengthen a ship's mast. The top and bottom edges are tapered inwards so the device wedges itself between {{the top and bottom of}} the rail when it is bolted into place. In rail transport modelling, a fishplate is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity.|$|E

A total of 32 specimens were tested, consisting of {{an equal number of}} double pullout specimens and full-scale wall splice specimens. Both specimen types had the identical cross-section. Eight replicate specimens for each specimen type were constructed with both contact and non-contact lap splice arrangements. Grade 400 deformed reinforcing bars with a 300 mm lap splice length were provided in all specimens. The double pullout specimens were tested applying direct tension to the lapped reinforcing <b>bars.</b> The <b>splice</b> resistance and displacement were recorded during testing. All double pullout specimens with contact lap splices developed, as a minimum, the yield strength of the reinforcing bars and generally displayed evidence of a yield plateau. In contrast, the double pullout specimens with non-contact lap splices failed when only 46. 1 % of the theoretical yield strength of the reinforcing bars was recorded as the maximum splice resistance. The difference between the average value of the tensile resistance in the contact and non-contact <b>spliced</b> <b>bars</b> was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Wall splice specimens were tested under a four-point loading arrangement with the lapped bars located in the constant moment region. The applied load and specimen deflection were recorded until failure occurred. A numerical analysis was then performed to calculate the maximum resistance of the <b>spliced</b> <b>bars.</b> The specimens with contact lap splices developed the theoretical yield capacity of the reinforcing bars. In contrast, the wall splice specimens with non-contact lap splices developed an average tensile resistance of 78 % of the theoretical yield capacity. The difference between the average tensile resistances of the lapped bars in the two splice arrangements was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. On average, the contact and non-contact lap <b>spliced</b> <b>bars</b> in the double pullout specimens developed 8. 47 % and 41. 2 % less tensile resistance, respectively, as compared to the wall splice specimens with the identical splice arrangement. Both differences were identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Bond loss between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding grout was identified as the failure mode for both the double pullout and wall splice specimens with contact lap splices. In contrast, bond loss at the masonry block/grout interface was observed along the non-contact lapped bars in both specimen types, as identified by visual observations upon removal of the face shell and the surrounding grout.

40|$|There {{are very}} limited {{studies on the}} bond of spliced fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforcing <b>bars.</b> <b>Spliced</b> <b>bars</b> are necessary for the limitation of the available bar lengths (standard manufactured length of reinforcing bar). In addition, this type of splice is required at the construction joints. Furthermore, bundled bars are required instead of spaced bars in case of heavily reinforced concrete structures. By using bundled bars, the congestion of reinforcement can be avoided. The current standards for steel reinforcement (such as CSA A 23. 3 and ACI 318) cannot {{be used for the}} FRP bars due to the inherent differences in their mechanical properties and surface configurations. There are no design recommendations available regarding the use of <b>spliced</b> bundled FRP <b>bars.</b> The results of this research project will fill this gap. In this context, 33 large-scale concrete beams reinforced with single or bundled tensile <b>spliced</b> FRP <b>bars</b> were subjected to a four-point flexural test until failure. Two types of FRP bars were used, namely glass FRP and carbon FRP bars. The effects of the <b>bar</b> diameter, <b>splice</b> length, number of bundled bars, confinement by stirrups, and thickness of the concrete cover on the bond strength, bond stress distribution, cracking behaviour and mode of failure of the <b>spliced</b> FRP <b>bars</b> in concrete were investigated. Furthermore, the research presented herein evaluates the existing recommendations for the <b>spliced</b> FRP <b>bars</b> (CAN/CSA-S 6 - 00, ISIS-M 03 - 01, CAN/CSA-S 806 - 02, and ACI 440. 1 R- 03). In addition, the average bond stresses and the critical splice lengths for the FRP bars with different diameters were investigated. The flexural test results indicated that the FRP stress limit is directly proportional to the splice length. Moreover, the ultimate strength analysis method can be used to predict the maximum stress in the <b>spliced</b> FRP <b>bars.</b> The results of these experiments show that the transverse reinforcement (steel stirrups in this case) is effective at increasing the bond strength. An objective of this research work was to develop an equation to predict the maximum average bond stress of the tensile lap-splice of FRP bars embedded in concrete. The proposed equation, which relates the average bond stress to the thickness of the concrete cover, the FRP <b>bar</b> diameter, the <b>splice</b> length, the concrete compressive strength, and the transverse reinforcement ratio, agrees well with the test data.

40|$|AbstractConstruction using {{concrete}} {{is spreading}} widely {{and there is}} a need for concrete that is capable of flowing under its own weight without mechanical vibration or compaction and fill the places between reinforcement and the complicated form shapes. From here, Self-Compacted Concrete (SCC) appears for the first time.

This research studies the bond between HSSCC and <b>spliced</b> tension <b>bars</b> in beams. It is focused on observing the effect of some factors such as; reinforcement bar diameter and ratio, splice length and casting position on the beam flexural behavior. An experimental program consisting of sixteen simply supported beams divided into four groups is considered. All beams are of 1800 mm span and 200 × 400 mm cross-section cast with HSSCC. In twelve beams, the tensile steel was spliced in the constant moment zone, and four control beams without splice for comparison purpose.

30|$|These {{observations}} can {{be interpreted}} as follows. Two <b>spliced</b> <b>bars</b> were disconnected near the middle section of a sleeve. As a result, the middle part of the sleeve carried almost all the accumulative tensile loading transferred from the embedded bar and, therefore, resulted in peak stress. In the transverse direction, the strain condition depended on the combination of two factors. The first one was the Poisson effect because sleeves were tensile loaded longitudinally resulting in transverse shrinkage. The second factor was split expansion in the radial direction induced by the filled grout due to bar-grout bond, which caused the sleeves to dilate transversely. Consequently, different sleeve configurations influenced the two factors, resulting in various strain distributions in the transverse direction which can be different from the observation in this study (Einea et al. 1995; Ling et al. 2012).|$|R

It has been shown in different studies that the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete are comparable to those of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete. This paper describes the behaviour and design aspects of geopolymer concrete structural members.

40|$|The tensile {{resistance}} of No. 15 lap <b>spliced</b> reinforcing <b>bars</b> with varying transverse spacing and lap splice length was evaluated in full-scale concrete block wall splice specimens. The {{range of the}} transverse spacing between bars was limited to that which allowed the bars to remain within the same cell, and included the evaluation of tied <b>spliced</b> <b>bars</b> in contact. Two-and-a-half block wide by three course tall double pullout specimens reinforced with contact lap splices were initially {{used to determine the}} range of lap splice length values to be tested in the wall splice specimens such that bond failure of the reinforcement occurred. The double pullout specimens were tested in direct tension with six replicates per arrangement. Three values of lap splice length: 150, 200, and 250 mm, were selected from the testing of the double pullout specimens and tested in the wall splice specimens in combination with three values of transverse spacing: 0, 25, and 50 mm, with three replicates per configuration. A total of twenty-seven two-and-a-half block wide by thirteen course tall wall splice specimens reinforced with two lap splices were tested in four-point loading. Both the double pullout and the wall splice specimens were constructed in running bond with all cells fully grouted. The tensile {{resistance of}} the lap <b>spliced</b> <b>bars</b> in the double pullout specimens was measured directly. The contact lap splices with a 150, 200, and 250 mm lap splice length developed approximately 38, 35 and 29 % of the theoretical yield load of the reinforcement, respectively. The difference between the mean tensile resistances of the three reinforcement configurations tested in the double pullout specimens was found to be statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Different than expected, the tensile resistance of the lap <b>spliced</b> reinforcing <b>bars</b> in the double pullout specimens was inversely proportional to the lap splice length provided. For the short lap splice lengths used in this investigation, the linear but not proportional relationship between bond force and lap splice length known from reinforced concrete is believed to have caused this phenomenon. An iterative sectional analysis using moment-curvature response was used to calculate the tensile resistance of the lap spliced reinforcement in the wall splice specimens. The calculated mean tensile resistance of the reinforcement increased with increasing lap splice length, and was greater when the bars were in contact. Securing the bars in contact may have influenced the tensile capacity of the contact lap splices as higher stresses are likely to develop {{as a result of the}} bar ribs riding over each other with increasing slip. Results of the data analysis suggest that the tensile resistance of non-contact lap splices within the same cell is generally independent of the spacing between the bars. A comparison of the experimental results for the wall splice specimens with the development and splice length provisions in CSA S 304. 1 - 04 and TMS 402 - 11 indicate that both the Canadian and U.

Tests were carried out on full scale non-seismically detailed RC columns subjected to cyclic uniaxial flexure under constant axial load. Thirteen cantilever-type specimens with either continuous longitudinal reinforcement (smooth or deformed) or lap <b>splicing</b> of longitudinal <b>bars</b> at the floor level were constructed and tested. Experimental results indicated that TRM jacketing is quite effective as a means of increasing the cyclic deformation capacity of old-type RC columns with poor detailing, by delaying bar buckling and by preventing splitting bond failures in columns with lap <b>spliced</b> <b>bars.</b> Compared with their FRP counterparts, TRM jackets used in this study were found to be equally effective in terms of increasing both the strength and deformation capacity of the retrofitted columns.

40|$|Manufacturing, fabrication, and {{transportation}} limitations {{make it impossible}} to provide full length continuous bars in some reinforced concrete structures. In general, reinforcing bars are stocked by suppliers in lengths of 12 – 18 m. For that reason, and because it is often more convenient to work with shorter bar lengths, it is frequently necessary to <b>splice</b> <b>bars</b> in the field. Proper <b>splicing</b> of reinforcing <b>bars</b> is crucial to the integrity of reinforced concrete. ACI Code states: “splices of reinforcement shall be made only as required or permitted on the design drawings, in the specifications, or as authorized by the engineer. ” Great responsibility for design, specification, and performance of splices rests with the engineer who is familiar with the structural analysis and design stresses, probable construction conditions and final conditions of service can properly evaluate the variables to select the most efficient and economical splice method. Lap splicing, which requires the overlapping of two parallel bars, has long been accepted as an effective, economical splicing method. In projects with smaller bar sizes such as φ 19 mm and smaller, lap splices have performed well over the long run. Continuing research, more demanding designs in concrete, new materials and the development of hybrid concrete/structural steel design have forced designers to consider alternatives to lap splicing such as welded splices.

30|$|Four loading schemes {{were used}} in this study, i.e., {{incremental}} tensile (IT) loadings and repeated tensile (RT) loadings as well as cyclic loadings at high stress (CH) and at large strain (CL). The second loading scheme (RT) relates to a splice under service loads with a stress level of generally no more than 60  % of the yield strength of the <b>spliced</b> <b>bars.</b> The third and fourth loading schemes (CH and CL) are of special interest because they involve splices under frequent and rare earthquakes, respectively. Commonly, the stress level of the splices under frequent earthquakes did not exceed the bar’s yield strength. However, for the splices under rare earthquakes, the stress level of the splices generally can go beyond the bar’s yield strength and large plastic strain could occur. As a result, 90  % of the bar’s yield strength and two to five times of the bar’s yield strain in tension were defined as high stress and large strain, respectively, along with reversed loading of up to 33  % of the bar’s yield strength in compression.|$|R

The aim was to represent the bond phenomena and the beam test result through a numerical approach, comparing these results with International Codes and formulations proposed by the literature. According to the results, the evaluation of the bond behavior for self-compacting concrete and ordinary concrete could be well predicted by some formulations, but several other formulations and the International Codes were conservative giving underestimated test results.
