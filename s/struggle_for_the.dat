The good relations with Poland were reestablished under the reign of Stephen IV the Younger (15171527).

5|$|Jinnah was {{the central}} figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and his <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as she thought that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E

5|$|The Independent and Ledger offered {{different}} versions of events, the former more sympathetic to the Nelsons. According to the Independent, Laura grabbed another gun, a Winchester rifle hidden behind a trunk. L. D. grabbed the Winchester at the same time, and during the <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gun, it went off. A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He walked outside and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli {{captured}} Kars {{on behalf}} of the Georgian crown in 1206, but were repelled from the walls of Akhlat in 1209. This brought the <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Armenian lands to a stall, leaving the Lake Van region in a relatively secure possession of its new masters – the Ayyubids of Damascus. In 1209, the brothers Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli laid waste to Ardabil – according to the Georgian and Armenian annals – as a revenge for the local Muslim ruler's attack on Ani and his massacre of the city's Christian population. In a great final burst, the brothers led an army marshaled throughout Tamar's possessions and vassal territories in a march, through Nakhchivan and Julfa, to Marand, Tabriz, and Qazvin in northwest Iran, pillaging several settlements on their way.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set on}} a {{group of}} islands in a vast sea, a {{departure}} for the series. The player controls series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in a <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder's wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor's baton called the Wind Waker.|$|E

5|$|The {{highlight}} of the fighting became the bloody <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> large Raevsky redoubt {{near the village of}} Borodino. The French managed to capture this redoubt late into the day, gradually forcing the rest of the Russian army to pull back as well. The Russians suffered terrible casualties during the fighting, losing over a third of their army. French losses were also heavy, exacerbating the logistical difficulties that Napoleon encountered in the campaign. The exhaustion of the French forces, and the lack of information on the condition of the Russian army, persuaded Napoleon to remain on the battlefield with his army instead of ordering the kind of vigorous pursuit reminiscent of previous campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The race {{starts in}} Port Town, with the winners {{traveling}} {{in a boat}} to a large desert. Legend has it that four stone tablets are buried somewhere in the desert, and the contestants are sent out to dig for them {{and bring them to}} the Viscount.

Before he can investigate the matter further, Doctor Neo Cortex swoops in and snatches the map. As the two <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> map, the map is torn to shreds.|$|E
5|$|The real <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and ARVN {{forces in}} Cambodia was the effort at keeping their units supplied. Once again, {{the need for}} {{security}} before the operations and the rapidity with which units were transferred to the border regions precluded detailed planning and preparation. This situation was exacerbated by the poor road network in the border regions {{and the possibility of}} ambush for nighttime road convoys demanded that deliveries only take place during daylight. Aerial resupply, therefore, became the chief method of logistical replenishment for the forward units. Military engineers and aviators were kept in constant motion throughout the incursion zone.|$|E
