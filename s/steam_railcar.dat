5|$|Motor buses {{appeared}} in the district from 1924, and passenger numbers dropped. Cheap fares and a <b>steam</b> <b>railcar</b> did not halt the decline, although {{in the last days}} of operation, five trains were run on Saturdays, three on Wednesdays and two on other weekdays. The last trains ran on 15 July 1933, with all passenger services suspended from Monday 17 July. In addition to timetabled services, excursions were run, with Epworth, the birthplace of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism being popular. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway published a booklet entitled Epworth: What to see and how to get there to entice people to travel there from Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Excursions from the Isle of Axholme to Blackpool were popular, with over 600 passengers on such a trip in 1913, and 750 visiting the Great Yorkshire Show at Hull in 1922. Excursions to Blackpool continued to be run even after timetabled passenger services were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{the company}} looked at using petrol-electric autocars for the {{passenger}} services, but were advised {{that they would}} not be economic, as conventional trains would still be required on Wednesdays and Saturdays to cope with the volume of traffic. However, in July 1926 they conducted trials with a Sentinel-Cammell <b>steam</b> <b>railcar,</b> which was borrowed from the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), who had absorbed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, bought 13 steam railcars in 1926 and 1927, one of which was allocated to Goole shed for work on the Axholme Joint Railway. A similar vehicle was ordered in February 1930 specifically for the railway, and entered service in December. The steam power unit was built by the Sentinel Waggon Works in Shrewsbury, and the bodywork was built at Nottingham, at the former works of Cammell Laird, by then part of the Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. Before passenger services were withdrawn in 1933, it ran , working two return trips from Goole to Haxey Junction on weekdays, three on Wednesdays, and five on Saturdays. It was then sold to the LNER and continued in use until 1944.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, the Thames Expresss future looked {{positive}} {{as it was}} supplemented with another passenger service that ran from Thames to Frankton to provide a connection with the Night Limited that ran between Auckland and Wellington. [...] This extra service was sometimes a carriage train hauled by locomotives such as the UD class and sometimes a railcar service employing the experimental Sentinel-Cammell <b>steam</b> <b>railcar.</b> [...] However, {{the opening of the}} East Coast Main Trunk Railway through to the Bay of Plenty in 1928 significantly reduced Thames's importance as a terminus. [...] With the introduction of a direct express to the Bay of Plenty, the Taneatua Express, the Thames Express was superfluous and unnecessary, and accordingly ceased to operate. The Night Limited feeder service did not long outlive it, and by 1947, even the mixed trains to Thames had ceased to operate and passenger services to the town were never reinstated in any form.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{experience}} with the first <b>steam</b> <b>railcars,</b> Sentetsu imported two geared <b>steam</b> <b>railcars</b> from Sentinel-Cammell in England in 1929. These had a vertical boiler generating superheated steam of [...] pressure, which fed a single, horizontally mounted, 6-cylinder engine producing , and had a lightweight body integrated with the underframe. These <b>steam</b> <b>railcars</b> later proved very helpful in designing Sentetsu's first petrol-powered railcars. Both units remained in service until at least 1940, but their subsequent fate is unknown.|$|R

2500|$|Operations in {{its first}} few decades were typical of many rural branch lines. [...] A single mixed train {{departed}} Kurow for Oamaru {{in the morning and}} returned in the late afternoon, taking roughly three hours each way. [...] In 1926, the branch was the location for the trial of one of New Zealand's two steam railcars, the Clayton <b>steam</b> <b>railcar,</b> taking 1 hour and 45 minutes between Oamaru and Kurow. [...] It did not prove popular and it was replaced by a passenger train hauled by a steam locomotive on 10 November 1928 running to the railcar's schedule, but was withdrawn on 12 July 1930 due to the Great Depression. [...] Special passenger trains still ran on occasions, notably in 1931 for sightseers along the Public Works Department line to the under-construction Waitaki Dam. [...] For a few years, the PWD used its own rolling stock for school children at Kurow. This service ceased when the PWD line closed in the mid-1930s; it formally closed in late 1936 and the track was removed in April 1937. [...] NZR had closed its section from Kurow to Hakataramea on 14 July 1930.|$|E
