40|$|AbstractThe {{synthesis}} of oxy-polymerizable alkyd from non-drying {{palm kernel oil}} was studied. Three <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> of medium oil length were prepared using phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and glycerol at stipulated ratios. The prepared <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> were copolymerized with styrene using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as the free radical generator at 150 °C for 3 h. The <b>styrenated</b> <b>alkyds</b> and palm kernel oil-modified alkyds were all characterized for their physico-chemical properties following standard methods. The <b>styrenated</b> and unstyrenated <b>alkyds</b> were tested for drying schedule, solubility, adhesion, abrasion resistance and chemical resistance. All the resins showed good properties. The <b>styrenated</b> <b>alkyds</b> gave faster drying time, better adhesion, abrasion resistance, and chemical resistance. Unlike the unstyrenated alkyd which was only resistant to water, brine, and acidic media, the <b>styrenated</b> <b>alkyds</b> were also resistant to alkalis. Structural elucidation of the raw materials and their copolymers was done with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and GC–MS instrumental technique.

Three month later, the former was 4. 5 % and the latter was below 0. 5 %. The result that the degradation ratio of <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> was higher in soil with a high humus content suggested that the degradation of the coating material is microbiological. 2) There were no differences between <b>alkyd</b> and polyethylene <b>resins</b> in the number of microorganisms on the coating membrane surface and in the soil around the coating membrane, but the number of fungi in the former was about 100 times higher in the coating membrane and was about 10 times higher in the soil around the coating membrane than in the latter. In addition, using the trial box for the measurement of enzymatic activity, soil enzymatic activity concerned with the degradation of <b>alkyd</b> <b>resin</b> membrane was measured, and the results showed that the activity of the soil enzymes was high nearer the membrane. 3) Under field conditions, we took the buried membrane out of soils and observed its surface by electron microscopy.

40|$|RATIONALE: <b>Alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> are {{synthetic}} polyesters used as {{paints and}} coatings. Current approaches for their analysis {{do not allow}} the characterization of pentaerythritol and phthalic acid esters, whose detection is interesting to fully characterize the materials, e. g. for forensic or cultural heritage applications. METHODS: A combined analytical approach based on Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) /MS and flow injection analysis (FIA) /MS was adopted. GC/MS was used to characterize the fatty acid profile and the polybasic acids in extracts from industrial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins.</b> HPLC/MS and FIA/MS {{were used for the}} characterization of the triglyceride profile of the oil used to manufacture the resin and for the identification of reaction products deriving from the synthesis process. RESULTS: The multi-analytical approach was applied on two different industrial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> produced from two different oils. The GC/MS analysis was successful in characterizing the fatty acid profile and the aromatic fraction of the resin. The HPLC/MS analysis allowed us to characterize the pentaerythritol and phthalic acid ester and the triglycerides residues from the synthesis process, by studying their high-resolution tandem mass spectra. CONCLUSIONS: The application of liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to the study of industrial <b>alkyd</b> <b>resins</b> allowed us to characterize {{for the first time the}} esters formed by the transesterification reactions involving pentaerythritol, phthalic acid and triglycerides.
