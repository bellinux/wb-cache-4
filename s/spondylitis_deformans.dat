50|$|The Tyrannosaurus rex {{specimen}} AMNH 5027 has a deformity fusing the centra of {{the seventh}} and eighth back vertebrae's centra. The centra of the tenth neck and first back vertebrae are fused in a similar fashion. In 1923 Moodie reported a T. rex specimen as have <b>spondylitis</b> <b>deformans,</b> probably referring to the fused vertebrae of this specimens. Molnar still maintains {{that this is a}} congenital block vertebra. It had fractured ribs, too.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of osteophytes in the vertebral column {{is well known}} to anatomists, clinicians, anthropologists, and other students {{of the human body}} and {{has been the subject of}} a large number of publications. Despite this interest the real significance of osteophytes is as yet far from clear. They have been found to occur under many different conditions, pathological and otherwise. This paper is the result of a detailed study of the osteophytes that so fre-quently accompany the process of aging. The study was carried out in the hope that it might throw â€™ more light on the causes of their development and on their significance. The condition is described under many different names in the medical litera-ture, including <b>spondylitis</b> <b>deformans</b> 13, spondylosis deformans 1 O 5 polyspondylitis marginalis osteophytica 110, osteophytosis of the spine, hypertrophic spondylitis, spondylochondrosis, and hypertrophic osteo-arthritis.

40|$|The bony outgrowths of {{the spinal}} column as the {{causation}} of low-back pain 'have been studied, especially as "Spondylitis deformans", and numerous theories have been expounded. There are, however, certain pathological changes {{other than the}} so-called <b>Spondylitis</b> <b>deformans</b> among the above mentioned bony outgrowths. The location and figure of these outgrowths in dorsal and lumbal spinal column of dead and living bodies were studied macroscopically and roentgenologically in surveying possible correlations between low-back pain and these bony changes, which will be called "exostotic bony outgrowths". 1) Exostotic bony outgrowths in dorsal and lumbal columns were observed not only in, older ages but also in ages below 30. Although not verified roentgenologically, there are definite small outgrowths {{in many parts of}} the spinal column, prior to the time of the marked bony transformation, known as Spon-dylitis deformans. It is pointed out that in the majority of cases roentgenological figures fail to reveal exostotic bony outgrowths which exsist in most eases. 2) Most of the outgrowths were seen in the lower dorsal column and on the 4 th or 5 th lumbal column, hence it is clear that the majority of these exostotic bony outgrowths appeared in sites, in which "load" is exacted orthostatically, caused by the vertical position of the body or extension and/or contrac-tion of column. 3) Roentgenological appearance of bony outgrowths in living body were less than in bone specimens hence there are many unexpected bony outgrowths, 'which cannot be roentgenologically ascertained, in the living body...|$|E
