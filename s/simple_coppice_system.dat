40|$|Standards in {{chestnut}} coppice system: {{cultural heritage}} or coltural requirement? This paper aims at evaluating {{the role of}} standards in chestnut coppices from a biological and functional perspective. In addition to {{a detailed analysis of}} Italian regulations on the issue, the technical definition of the term is analysed: (i) as for the functional role of standards; (ii) to assess whether the required functions are technically necessary and are being actually performed. In this contex, the results of an experimental trial are reported. The goal of the trial were to assess the shoots’ parameters, the stand productivity, the dynamics of canopy cover in coppices with or without standards. In 2001, at harvesting operations in a coppice aged 30 with standards managed by the local community, two experimental plots 2500 m 2 each were established. The two theses being compared were: <b>simple</b> <b>coppice</b> and coppixce with standards (100 standards per hectare). The released standards were qualified immediately after final harvesting. Sprouting ability, growth pattern and stool vitality were surveyed in March 2004 (at age 2), in May 2008 (at age 6) and in April 2010 (at age 8). First results highlighted the evidence of statistically {{significant differences between the two}} thesis. The high number of standards effected negatively both vitality and growth pattern of the stools. <b>Simple</b> <b>coppice</b> recorded a lower shoot mortality, a higher diametrical growth and canopy cover degree as well; the heigth growth was, on the opposite, significantly lower. These results, although referred to a limited lifespan (1 / 3 of the rotation time) and to one site only, underline productive, ecological and environmental benefits and as a consequence suggest the widening of the experimental network and the development of new, more relevant and consistent rules, making acceptable the <b>simple</b> <b>coppice</b> as a possible silvicultural choice to be applied to chestnut coppices...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coppice</b> <b>systems</b> are {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} forms of woodland management known and on some sites their use {{has been documented}} for centuries. Distinctive assemblages {{of plants and animals}} are associated with such systems and are highly valued in nature conservation terms. The richness of such assemblages, and conversely, the species that do not thrive under coppice, are linked to the alternation of relatively short light and dark phases and the juxtaposition of stands at different stages in the coppice cycle. We review how and why the biodiversity of former coppice woods changes in response to abandonment and conversion to high forest. We focus on the situation in the UK, based on recent published literature searches and the authors’ extensive experiences of the practical issues involved in the conservation of <b>coppice</b> woodland <b>systems.</b> Vascular plants in the ground flora, invertebrates of open glades and scrub, and small birds of the understorey may have become more abundant in coppice than they would have been under ‘natural’ forest conditions. By contrast epiphytes dependent on mature trees and species of large-sized deadwood are less favoured by <b>coppice</b> management. <b>Coppice</b> <b>systems</b> developed to meet the local community needs. As social and economic conditions changed, so coppicing declined and the woods were transformed into high forest through neglect or deliberate management. High forests differ from coppice stands in their spatial and temporal dynamics and consequently in their wildlife particularly with respect to their vertical structure pattern; extent of open space and young growth; spatial heterogeneity; tree and shrub composition; and browsing levels. Three issues for the conservation of biodiversity arise from these changes: • What priority and resources should be given to halting further decline, by maintaining coppice compared to allowing sites to develop with more ‘natural’ high forest structures and dynamics; will associated high-forest species recolonise? • If we restore <b>coppice</b> <b>systems,</b> will the species assemblages present in the past also recover, under current and future changes in environmental conditions; i. e is the transformation reversible under current environmental conditions? • Are there other ways in which ‘coppice-associated’ species might be maintained?

The global diffusion of fossil fuels reduced this leadership and the <b>coppice</b> <b>system</b> turned, to some extent, to a reminder of the past. Nowadays, the ongoing global changes and the related green-economy issues call for resilient systems and effective bio-energy producers. These issues have caused a second turning point and the coppice has returned fifty years later to play a role. A review of the silvicultural system has been carried out with a special focus on the changes which have occurred in between, taking Italy as a consistent case-study. The analysis is mainly framed upon the long-term research trials established by the CREA-Forestry Research Centre in the late sixties, to find out adaptive management strategies and overcome the system’s crisis.

40|$|Conventional clear-felling and {{replanting}} {{is increasingly}} being recognised as inappropriate for those broadleaved woodlands {{which have a}} high value for landscape, amenity and for nature conservation. This prompted an investigation into 'non-plantation', 'uneven-aged' and 'irregular' silvicultural systems, which are, or could be, used in Britain. A new classification of such systems is proposed, with an initial division into coppice and high forest systems. The latter is then subdivided into 'clear-fell', 'shelterwood', and 'selection' systems. 'Group' and 'strip' variants {{of each of these}} three can then be identified. All systems can use planting, natural regeneration or a combination. For each system the following is presented: i) a description based on European use, ii) an account of British examples, iii) discussion of techniques, iv) analysis of profitability, v) evaluation of benefits for landscape, amenity and conservation. No really convincing examples of selection and shelterwood systems could be found in Britain, but some efficient group shelterwood and group selection systems exist. The failure of natural regeneration should be tackled by concentrating on prolific-seeding species such as ash and sycamore rather than oak and beech, and by more thorough preparation for good seed years especially by cultivation and careful management of overstorey density. Although establishment costs for shelterwood systems were lower than for clear-fell, the overall profitability for oak was similar. The Net Present Values of some 'low-input' options, such as <b>simple</b> <b>coppice,</b> were surprisingly high. Most profitable of all was an ash/sycamore shelterwood system.

Three of the comparisons represented high coniferous forestry (spruce in Britain, and pines in Finland and France), while a coppice-with-standard oak plantation was examined in Italy. While every comparison revealed that harvesting converted a mature forest carbon sink into a carbon source of similar magnitude, the mechanisms by which this occurred were very different according to species or management practice. In Britain, Finland, and France the annual sink (source) strength for mature (clear-cut) stands was estimated at 496 (112), 138 (239), and 222 (225) g C m− 2, respectively, with 381 (427) g C m− 2 for the mature (coppiced) stand in Italy. In all three cases of high forestry in Britain, Finland, and France, clear-cutting crippled the photosynthetic capacity of the ecosystem – with mature (clear-cut) GPP of 1970 (988), 1010 (363), and 1600 (602) g C m− 2 – and also reduced ecosystem respiration {{to a lesser degree}} – TER of 1385 (1100), 839 (603), and 1415 (878) g C m− 2, respectively.

40|$|Abstract- Ash-sycamore {{secondary}} forest {{is an important}} forest type that it is increasingly spreading in northern Italy. Nowadays, these forests are not managed with high forest system as they are left in natural evolution and subsequently managed with <b>coppice</b> <b>system</b> without improvement in timber quality. Remarkable potentiality and strong dynamism of these new spontaneous forests, able to colonize in short time fertile lands once used by agricultural activities, have been underlined in many sites. Research activities have shown interesting results in terms of high quality timber production by applying the target tree system. This management approach permits to improve the timber quality concentrating forest practices and production on a restricted number of trees (70 - 150 per hectare). This practice allows a considerable cost reduction and a good growth improvement. First thinning has to be realized at about 15 - 20 years when the dominant trees have average dbh of 9 - 12 cm, height of 12 – 16 m., and crowns deep enough and able to react to thinning and to maintain diameter growth about 1 cm. Remarkable socio-economic difficulties, land propriety fragmentation, lack of tradition and knowledge in high stand broadleaved forest management, hamper strongly the application of this method.

Conifer species usually provide a protective effect at higher altitude, while at lower altitudes broadleaf species are dominant. These forests are or were often managed as <b>coppice</b> <b>systems.</b> The high stem density of coppice stands, their rapid growth and the permanence of root systems in the soil can be considered as assets in terms of protective function. However, these considerations are poorly researched and there is generally a lack of studies investigating the suitability of coppice as protection forests. The issue is relevant, considering that many coppice stands in mountain regions have become uneconomic and are now abandoned and overaged. Whether and how to manage these forests stands is a key question for practitioners. In this contribution we analyze the implications of coppice management for slope stability and in particular to mitigate shallow landslides, focusing on root reinforcement, the main mechanism by which vegetation can reinforce slopes. We review available studies concerning root distribution and dynamics in coppice stands to formulate hypotheses about their contribution in terms of root reinforcement. Finally we highlight the lacks of knowledge and the further steps needed to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the coppices in protecting against shallow landslides...|$|R
40|$|Aspen {{management}} in the Intermountain West has conventionally relied {{on its ability to}} vegetatively reproduce, and has long been used to guide silviculture (e. g., <b>coppice</b> <b>systems).</b> Aspen is prolific in its sprouting response to overstory removal, capable of producing thousands of shoots per hectare. The successful reproduction of aspen is of considerable {{management in}}terest. Without intervention, current threats to the persistence of aspen communities may lead to the continued decline of aspen in the Intermountain West. Successful regeneration is defined as the timely recruitment of a new cohort of aspen stems such that they are no longer susceptible to herbivory or other detrimental factors associated with juvenility. In the broader context of aspen ecology, we can postulate three important drivers of successful aspen regeneration: (1) stand vigor, (2) disturbance history (e. g., management actions), and (3) climatic conditions. A multitude of interactions between these drivers likely ultimately determines the timing, quantity, and quality of aspen regeneration. We measured sites with known management histories on Cedar Mountain and southwestern Utah in order to quantify the success of regeneration based on a comparison of unique pre-treatment versus post-treatment stand conditions. By simultaneously exploring a multitude of factors that possibly affect aspen regeneration, this research: (1) sampled across multiple stand conditions (N= 103), elucidating a diversity of regeneration drivers; (2) identified multiple management scenarios for successful aspen regeneration; and (3) incorporated state-of-the-art knowledge regarding aspen regeneration ecology into a management guide...|$|R

The area of reach {{of the study is}} in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul state, which main economy is the tobacco crop, enclosing 13 cities that compose the performance area of the Management Committee of Rio Pardo Hydrographic Basin. The data collect were conducted during year 2008. In order to determine the size of the sample, it was made a sampling with its probability proportional to the size, where the criterion of the sample unity distribution took in consideration the numbers of trees per city and, inside the cities, the number of trees per class of property size. The sampling method utilized on the forest inventory was by Prodan, in addition to interviews taken with the producers The region is characterized by small agricultural producers, and 61. 4 % of the firewood used in the cure of tobacco leaves is acquired from others, moreover, the majority of the forestation possess reduced spacing (2. 26 m²/plant) and low survival indices, in order of the 34. 4 % after 7 years of the plantation. The wooden current supply is of 2, 781. 069 m³, what guarantees a supplying for only 3. 5 years.
