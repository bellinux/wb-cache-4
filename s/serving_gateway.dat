3000|$|Once the RN has {{achieved}} L 1 /L 2 synchronization with the target eNB (and {{in the second}} case, in addition to this, also when all the UEs have resynchronized with the RN), the RN sends a handover confirmation message (RRC connection reconfiguration complete) to the new donor eNB. This confirmation is a composite message that includes information about each UE that is being served through the RN. The new donor eNB then sends out a path switch request to the Mobility Management Entity (MME), which initiates a user plane update request to the <b>serving</b> <b>gateway.</b> User plane update is then performed by the <b>serving</b> <b>gateway</b> for each UE indicated in the composite handover confirmation message. A user plane update basically switches the downlink data path to the target eNB. The <b>serving</b> <b>gateway</b> then sends [...] "end marker" [...] packets to the source eNB, {{to indicate that the}} old path {{is not going to be}} used anymore for the concerned UEs. After the route update is performed, packets destined to the UEs served by the RN will be properly routed via the new donor eNB.|$|E
30|$|An {{example of}} an iRAT HO from LTE to 3 G is {{presented}} in Fig. 1. When a user fulfills the entering conditions 1 and 2 during a specific time interval, configured through the Time To Trigger (TTT) parameter, the iRAT HO procedure is launched by the eNodeB in order to transfer the connection to the target Radio Network Controller (RNC) and its nodeB (NB) in 3 G. To that end, the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and the <b>Serving</b> <b>Gateway</b> (S-GW) along with the <b>Serving</b> <b>Gateway</b> Support Node (SGSN) {{are in charge of}} executing the iRAT HO. As a result of iRAT HOs, the requested services are maintained by the legacy systems avoiding unexpected user disconnection. However, this has a negative impact on the user experience, since the service performance is reduced, (e.g., reducing the speed or increasing the latency). Cell affected by coverage holes with uRAT will have high number or iRAT HOs.|$|E

Neighbouring BSs (i.e., within the groups connected by the S 1 interface) are interconnected via the X 2 interface, which carries control information regarding handover and interference coordination. The X 2 interface is therefore highly suitable for ULIP related signalling.|$|E

30|$|The IMS {{model was}} used to deliver HDV {{and a set of}} RCSs in order to {{represent}} a realistic scenario in delivering the VoLTE service. The IMS model consisted of Proxy Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF), Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF), and interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF). These components were used for the signaling procedures of the VoLTE calls between different users in the network. The EPC was one entity which included all the main required core network parts; the Mobility Management Entity (MME), the <b>Serving</b> <b>Gateway</b> (S-GW), and the Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW). Internally, the voice packets were sent over real-time protocol (RTP) streams. Traffic was generated in the network model only when the application is active; therefore, the traffic duration equaled the simulation duration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: IEEE 802. 11 Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is an {{emerging}} low cost, decentralized community-based broadband technology, {{which is based}} on self-healing and multi-hop deployment of Access Points (APs), so that to increase the coverage area with maximum freedom to end-users to join or leave the network from anywhere anytime having low deployment and maintenance cost. Such kind of decentralized structure and multihop architecture increases its security vulnerabilities especially against the APs. One of such possible security attack is the placement of cloned AP to create serious performance degradation in IEEE 802. 11 WMN. In this paper, we discuss the different security vulnerabilities of AP in IEEE 802. 11 WMN along with possible research directions. We also propose a mutual cooperation mechanism between the multi-hop APs and <b>serving</b> <b>gateway</b> so that to detect and prevent the possibility of cloned AP. In this way the large scale exploitation of IEEE 802. 11 WMN can be eliminated...|$|E

40|$|Small cell (SCell) and Software Define Network (SDN) are two key {{enablers}} to {{meet the}} evolutional requirements of future telecommunication networks, but still on the initial study stage with lots of challenges faced. In this paper, the problem of mobility management in SDN-integrated LTE (Long Term Evolution) mobile backhaul network is investigated. An 802. 1 ad double tagging scheme is designed for traffic forwarding between <b>Serving</b> <b>Gateway</b> (S-GW) and SCell with QoS (Quality of Service) differentiation support. In addition, a dynamic localized forwarding scheme is proposed for packet delivery of the ongoing traffic session to facilitate the mobility of UE within a dense SCell network. With this proposal, the data packets of an ongoing session can be forwarded from the source SCell to the target SCell instead of switching the whole forwarding path, which can drastically save the path-switch signalling cost in this SDN network. Numerical results show that compared with traditional path switch policy, more than 50 signalling cost can be reduced, even considering {{the impact on the}} forwarding path deletion when session ceases. The performance of data delivery is also analysed, which demonstrates the introduced extra delivery cost is acceptable and even negligible in case of short forwarding chain or large backhaul latency...|$|E
30|$|Modern mobile {{networks}} are experiencing excessive traffic loads due the {{sharp increase in}} smart devices that are connected (e.g., smart phone, IoT devices, etc.) {{as well as the}} introduction of new services and applications. The rate of growth in network use is a challenge for current mobile network architectures due to the increase in complexity for operation and management, high upgrade costs, and slow time‐to‐market for new innovations and services. The 3 GPP LTE/EPC and LTE‐A standards were released to cope with the increased demand for high‐speed mobile networks. However, several issues related to the inherent design of these architectures necessitate radical changes. The 3 GPP technical specification (TS 23.401) [1] indicates that the LTE/EPC architecture is composed of four main entities including an eNB, a mobility management entity (MME), a <b>serving</b> <b>gateway</b> (SGW), and a PDN gateway (PGW). Two additional entities related to subscriber management as well as policy and charging management include a home subscriber server (HSS) and a policy and charging rule function (PCRF). The MME is the main control entity and is responsible for maintaining the mobility states of the UEs as well as setting up the bearer and forwarding path to carry the user traffic. The user data packets are then forwarded through the GTP tunnels (GPRS tunneling protocol) between the eNB and the PGW.|$|E
40|$|A Number of merits {{could be}} brought by network {{function}} virtualization (NFV) such as scalability, on demand allocation of resources, and the efficient utilization of network resources. In this paper, we introduce a framework for designing an energy efficient architecture for 5 G mobile network function virtualization. In the proposed architecture, the main functionalities of the mobile core network which include the packet gateway (P-GW), <b>serving</b> <b>gateway</b> (S-GW), mobility management entity (MME), policy control and charging role function, and the home subscriber server (HSS) functions are virtualized and provisioned on demand. We also virtualize {{the functions of the}} base band unit (BBU) of the evolved node B (eNB) and offload them from the mobile radio side. We leverage the capabilities of gigabit passive optical networks (GPON) as the radio access technology to connect the remote radio head (RRH) to new virtualized BBUs. We consider the IP/WDM backbone network and the GPON based access network as the hosts of virtual machines (VMs) where network functions will be implemented. Two cases were investigated; in the first case, we considered virtualization in the IP/WDM network only (since the core network is typically the location that supports virtualization) and in the second case we considered virtualization in both the IP/WDM and GPON access network. Our results indicate that we can achieve energy savings of 22 % on average with virtualization in both the IP/WDM network and GPON access network compared to the case where virtualization is only done in the IP/WDM network...|$|E

40|$|Software-defined {{networking}} (SDN) {{and network}} function virtualization (NFV) {{have emerged as}} the most promising candidates for improving network function and protocol programmability and dynamic adjustment of network resources. On the one hand, SDN is responsible for providing an abstraction of network resources through well-defined application programming interfaces. This abstraction enables SDN to perform network virtualization, that is, to slice the physical infrastructure and create multiple coexisting application-specific virtual tenant networks (VTNs) with specific quality-of-service and service-level-agreement requirements, independent of the underlying optical transport technology and network protocols. On the other hand, the notion of NFV relates to deploying network functions that are typically deployed in specialized and dedicated hardware, as software instances [called virtual network functions (VNFs) ] running on commodity servers (e. g., in data centers) through software virtualization techniques. Despite all the attention that {{has been given to}} virtualizing IP functions (e. g., firewall; authentication, authorization, and accounting) or Long-Term Evolution control functions (e. g., mobility management entity, <b>serving</b> <b>gateway,</b> and packet data network gateway), some transport control functions can also be virtualized and moved to the cloud as a VNF. In this work we propose virtualizing the tenant SDN control functions of a VTN and moving them into the cloud. The control of a VTN is a key requirement associated with network virtualization, since it allows the dynamic programming (i. e., direct control and configuration) of the virtual resources allocated to the VTN. We experimentally assess and evaluate the first SDN/NFV orchestration architecture in a multipartner testbed to dynamically deploy independent SDN controller instances for each instantiated VTN and to provide the required connectivity within minutes...|$|E
