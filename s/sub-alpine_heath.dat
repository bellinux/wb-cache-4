40|$|Question: In cold regions snow-cover {{duration}} {{is expected}} to decrease, especially in spring, {{as a consequence of}} climate warming. We investigated effects of changes in timing of snowmelt in relation to weather condition on Vaccinium myrtillus, a dominant shrub in heath vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that advanced snowmelt will enhance shrub growth in years with few frosts, but will reduce shrub growth in years with frequent frosts. Location: A <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>heath</b> in the Northern Apennines (Italy). Methods: We carried out two experiments. In the main experiment, snow was added to (+S) or removed from (–S) experimental plots in spring during three growing seasons (2004 - 2006), with a mean delay in snowmelt timing of about two weeks from –S to +S. In a companion experiment, we simulated a freezing event in late spring 2004. Results: During the snowmelt period, the –S plants experienced six to ten more frost events, compared with +S and unmanipulated controls (C), in 2004 and 2005 but not in 2006. In the first two years leaf production, leaf expansion and flowering were all significantly reduced in the –S plants, while shoot elongation was unaffected. In the companion experiment of artificial frost V. myrtillus presented similar responses. Conversely, the manipulations of snow did not affect either the hydric status or the nutrient status of plants and soils. Conclusions: The results overall supported our hypothesis, as shown by the differing effects of snow depth and timing of melt on V. myrtillus in the three years. Spring frost was the cause of reduced growth and reduced flower production in 2004 and 2005. However, advanced snowmelt will not decrease the cover of this dominant species. Therefore, the structure and the species dominance patterns in <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>heath</b> are not expected to change significantly in response to reduced snow cover. Support for this conclusion is provided by the capacity of V. myrtillus to recover vegetatively from frost injury through stimulated shoot elongation and by the low importance of sexual reproduction for propagating dominant ericaceous shrubs in closed heath communities...|$|E
40|$|Question: Our study {{aimed at}} testing {{to what extent}} water and/or {{nutrients}} affect community composition in <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>heath.</b> We hypothesized that nutrient addition will have an overall positive effect on heath vegetation but water addition will have greater effects and will probably reinforce the effects of fertilization in drier habitat conditions. Location: Monte Rondinaio, northern Apennines, Italy (44 ° 08 ' N; 10 ° 35 ' E, ca. 1850 - 1930 m a. s. l.). Methods: Nutrients and water were added during ﬁve growing seasons in two communities (HV community, moister; EV community, drier) and the biomass of all species was estimated non-destructively by the point-quadrat method. Results: Total above-ground biomass increased in both communities with fertilization due to increased graminoid biomass and decreased moss biomass, but was unaffected by irrigation. In the HV community species richness decreased as an effect of fertilization while in the EV community species richness was raised by irrigation. Conclusions: Our study partly supported our hypothesis since water addition had a stronger effect in the drier community. However, this effect was not revealed by changes in aboveground biomass but rather by differing responses of individual species in the two communities...|$|E
40|$|Question: Do {{soil water}} content and/or soil {{nitrogen}} (N) content and/or soil phosphorus (P) content affect {{the biomass of}} Vaccinium myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea in a <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>heath?</b> Location: Dolomites, northern Italy, 1800 m a. s. l. Methods: We determined above-ground and below-ground biomass of the shrubs at three sites, each on a different substrate type. At each site, we determined soil N- and P-contents. We also determined leaf water potential (Psi; 1), N- and P-concentrations in plant tissues and litter, as well as δ 13 C and δ 15 N in mature leaves. Results: V. myrtillus biomass was highest at the silicate site, V. vitis-idaea biomass was highest at the carbonate site. Both shrubs had low biomass at the peat site, possibly due to a toxic effect of waterlogging in wet soils. For both species, pre-dawn Psi; 1 indicated optimal hydration and midday Psi; 1 did not show any sign of water stress. Water use efficiency (WUE) did not differ among sites for any species. Whole-plant nutrient concentrations showed that, with increasing biomass, N was diluted in V. myrtillus tissues while P was diluted in V. vitis-idaea tissues. Foliar N-concentration was higher overall for V. myrtillus. Foliar P-concentration in V. myrtillus peaked at the silicate site. Foliar N : P ratios suggested that V. myrtillus was primarily P-limited and V. vitis-idaea primarily N-limited. Conclusions: Water content affected {{the distribution of the}} two shrubs in a similar way, higher P-availability in the soil enhanced V. myrtillus rather than V. vitis-idae...|$|E
