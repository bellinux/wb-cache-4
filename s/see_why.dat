5|$|Keeping this in mind, it is {{not hard}} to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> {{technical}} divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial divers normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. It is easy to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

5|$|One of the character's {{earliest}} storylines saw him becoming {{caught up}} in Karl and Susan Kennedy's marital problems, while treating their friend, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter). Rhys was with Jim when he died and he remained affected by his death for a long time. Rhys had a one-night stand with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), which left Kate feeling awkward around him. Rhys became determined to join the hospital's surgical training programme and was devastated when he missed out on a place. Rhys then romantically pursued Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and through his manipulative behaviour he forced her to quit the programme. Exploration of the character's backstory began after his mother was introduced and Barber believed this would allow the audience to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Rhys has become who he is.|$|E
5|$|In December 1946, it was {{announced}} that Halsey, Spruance and Turner had been awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. A message soon arrived from MacArthur stating that he could not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Kinkaid should not merit the same award, which had been recommended by Krueger during the war. The medal was duly presented by General Courtney Hodges in a ceremony on Governors Island on 10 April 1947. The Australian government chose to honor Kinkaid with an honorary Companion of the Order of the Bath, which was presented by the ambassador at a ceremony at the embassy in Washington on Australia Day, 26 January 1948. Kinkaid had already been created Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1944. In March 1948, he was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Leopold and presented with the Croix de guerre with Palm in a ceremony at the Belgian embassy in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E

25|$|From {{the above}} {{examples}} one can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> understanding of referred pain {{can lead to}} better diagnoses of various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what he termed centralization. He concluded that centralization occurs when referred pain moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations {{in support of this}} idea were seen when patients would bend backward and forward during an examination.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{note that}} for mammals in general, sound {{turns out to}} be the best medium in which to encode {{information}} for transmission over distances at speed.

25|$|To <b>see</b> <b>why</b> exponential-time {{algorithms}} {{are generally}} unusable in practice, consider {{a program that}} makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming {{for the sake of}} example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4×1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001n operations is practical until n gets relatively large.|$|E

25|$|In {{geometric}} topology, the Clifford torus is {{the simplest}} and most symmetric Euclidean space embedding of the cartesian product of two circles Sa1 and Sb1. It resides in R4, as opposed to R3. To <b>see</b> <b>why</b> R4 is required, note that if Sa1 and Sb1 each exist in their own independent embedding spaces Ra2 and Rb2, the resulting product space will be R4 rather than R3. The historically popular view that the cartesian product of two circles is an R3 torus in contrast requires the highly asymmetric application of a rotation operator to the second circle, since that circle will only have one independent axis z available to it after the first circle consumes x and y.|$|E
25|$|To <b>see</b> <b>why</b> exotic {{matter is}} required, {{consider}} an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands {{on the other}} side. The expansion goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within {{the vicinity of the}} neck. According to the optical Raychaudhuri's theorem, this requires a violation of the averaged null energy condition. Quantum effects such as the Casimir effect cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature, but calculations in semiclassical gravity suggest that quantum effects may be able to violate this condition in curved spacetime. Although it was hoped recently that quantum effects could not violate an achronal version of the averaged null energy condition, violations have nevertheless been found, so it remains an open possibility that quantum effects might be used to support a wormhole.|$|E
25|$|Apparently part of {{the royal}} agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the {{enhancing}} of royal control over Coimbra and its environs. The sole preserved document of the council was confirmed by a Martim, bishop-elect of Coimbra. Later {{in the same year}} a private document of Coimbra cited him, although still just as bishop-elect. Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the protégé of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic or Hispanic rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him it is difficult to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> he was never consecrated. This obscure dispute continued for in the following year (1089) one Julian appears as bishop and in 1091 a John. They are probably the same person. In the 1091 document the bishop was given permission to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.|$|E

25|$|Hermia and Lysander {{have escaped}} {{to the same}} forest in hopes of eloping. Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of killing Lysander. Helena {{continually}} makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man. Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately {{falls in love with}} Helena. Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes. Upon waking up, he sees Helena. Now, both men are in pursuit of Helena. However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia is at a loss to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> her lover has abandoned her, and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her. The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater. Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.|$|E
