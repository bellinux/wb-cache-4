5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak</b> NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E

In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidemic investigation, stool samples were collected and examined for infectious agents including parasites. Soil transmitted helminthes (STH), namely Ascaris lumbricoides (25. 7 %), Trichuris trichiura (31. 1 %) and hookworm (8. 1 %), and intestinal protozoa, which included Giardia lamblia (17. 6 %), Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar (9. 4 %), Blastocystis hominis (8. 1 %) and Cryptosporidium parvum (2. 7 %), were detected.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{emergence}} <b>of</b> providing care to diseased conspecifics {{must have}} been a turning point during <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> hominin sociality. On a population level, care may have minimized <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> socially transmitted diseases at a time of increasing social complexity, although individual care-givers probably incurred increased transmission risks. We propose that care-giving likely originated within kin networks, where the costs may have been balanced by fitness increases obtained through caring for ill kin. We test a novel hypothesis of hominin cognitive evolution in which disease may have selected for the cognitive ability to recognize when a conspecific is infected. Because diseases may produce symptoms that are likely detectable via the perceptual-cognitive pathways integral to social cognition, we suggest that disease recognition and social cognition may have evolved together. Using agent-based modeling, we test 1) under what conditions disease can select for increasing disease recognition and care-giving among kin, 2) whether providing care produces greater selection for cognition than an avoidance strategy, and 3) whether care-giving alters <b>the</b> progression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease through the population. The greatest selection was produced by diseases with lower risks to the care-giver and prevalences low enough not to disrupt the kin networks.

40|$|Cholera is a {{waterborne}} diarrheal {{disease that}} continues to plague the developing world. Individuals become infected by consuming water from reservoirs contaminated by virulent strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Epidemiological and environmental observations of a cholera outbreak in Dhaka, Bangladesh, suggest that lytic bacteriophage specific for V. cholerae may limit the severity of cholera outbreaks by killing bacteria present in the reservoir and in infected individuals. To quantify this idea and generate testable hypotheses, we analyzed a mathematical model that combines the epidemiology of cholera with the population dynamics of the bacteria and phage. Under biologically reasonable conditions, we found that vibriophage can ameliorate cholera outbreaks. If phage predation limits bacterial density before an outbreak, a transient reduction in phage density can disrupt that limitation, and subsequent bacterial growth can initiate a cholera outbreak. The <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak</b> depends on the density of phage remaining in the reservoir. If the outbreak is initiated instead by a rise in bacterial density, the introduction of phage can reduce the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak</b> and promote its decline.

For 18 study months, the rate and number <b>of</b> recurrences, <b>the</b> duration and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first confirmed recurrence, vaccine immunogenicity, and rates of local and systemic reactions were determined. <b>The</b> monthly rate <b>of</b> recurrences was not significantly improved, but <b>the</b> duration and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first study <b>outbreak</b> was reduced significantly by vaccination. Glycoprotein-specific and neutralizing antibodies were boosted by vaccination for <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The abalone Haliotis midae {{has been}} fished to near-extinction on the South African coastline, {{primarily}} {{to satisfy a}} growing international market. In order to meet demands, H. midae has been produced in South Africa by aquaculture for several decades, and the South African abalone aquaculture industry continues to expand. Internationally, abalone aquaculture has been actively affected by <b>the</b> <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> bacterial and viral diseases, which spread rapidly and lead to high abalone mortality. There is evidence that environmental stresses on abalone farms may lead to immunosuppression, and thereby increase <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> disease <b>outbreaks.</b> <b>The</b> water temperature on abalone farms fluctuates seasonally, and increased abalone mortality {{has been associated with}} warmer water during the summer months. However, the molecular mechanisms affecting the abalone during exposure to stress remain unclear. With advances in proteomics technology, it is possible to identify and quantify <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> several hundred proteins simultaneously. This study therefore aimed to gain insight into the H. midae stress response by using proteomic tools to identify proteins that are differentially regulated in haemocytes during exposure to acute heat stress. Identifying which biochemical pathways are involved in the abalone stress response will give some insight into the molecular mechanism by which H. midae responds to heat stress...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{large and}} severe {{outbreaks}} of native bark beetles has raised concern {{among the general}} public and land managers about potential risks of amplified fire activity in western North America. However, there are no field studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) infestation on subsequent fire severity in subalpine Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forests. We collected extensive field data in subalpine forests in the eastern San Juan Mountains, southwestern Colorado, to investigate whether fire severity changed across a range <b>of</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> early, gray-stage spruce beetle infestations. Using correlation and multivariate generalized linear regression analyses, we found that pre-fire spruce beetle severity was not correlated with or a significant predictor of most field measurements <b>of</b> fire <b>severity</b> or a remotely sensed estimate <b>of</b> fire <b>severity</b> under moderate and extreme burning conditions. However, under moderate burning conditions only, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> fire-killed stems and fire-killed basal area were weakly but positively correlated with <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> beetle infestation. In comparison to <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-fire beetle <b>outbreak,</b> we found that topography, live and dead basal area at time of fire, and short-term weather conditions exerted a stronger effect on fire severity. This suggests <b>the</b> beetle <b>outbreak</b> and fire were either independent of one another or factors unrelated to beetle outbreak overrode any effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outbreak</b> on fire activity. This finding of no effect agrees with retrospective studies using remotely sensed products to examine fire activity following other spruce beetle outbreaks, which similar to this study, concluded that <b>the</b> overriding influence <b>of</b> climate is essential for creating conditions conducive to large, high-severity fires in <b>the</b> subalpine zone <b>of</b> Colorado...|$|R
