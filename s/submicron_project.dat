40|$|This report {{outlines}} the history, current status, current developments, {{and plans for}} the message-passing concurrent computers, or multicomputers, developed in the <b>Submicron</b> Systems Architecture <b>Project</b> at Caltech. These systems include the Cosmic Cube and its commercial descendants, two second-generation cosmic cubes currently in development, and the Mosaic C, a fine grain multicomputer whose nodes are single VLSI chips. Section 1 introduces the physical architectures, with {{particular attention to the}} characteristics of the message-passing networks. Section 2 describes the programming environments for the first and second generation medium grain size "cubes. " Section 3 describes a fine grain concurrent object-oriented programming notation called Cantor, which currently runs on cubes and sequential systems, and which will be used for application programming of the Mosaic C...|$|R
40|$|A 200 GHz 16 channel {{receiver}} with polarization {{management was}} obtained with a 2 D grating coupler, 2 xAWGs and 16 Ge photodiodes. PDL was below 1 dB, BW above 20 GHz, receiver sensitivity {{in the order}} of 0. 08 A/W. DEMONSTRATOR FOR HELIOS <b>PROJECT</b> <b>Submicron</b> silicon photonics have generated an increasing interest in recent years, mainly for optical telecommunications or for optical interconnects in microelectronic circuits. The rationale of silicon photonics is the reduction of the cost and energy of communications systems through the integration of photonic components and an electronic integrated circuit (IC) on a common chip (telecommunications applications), or the enhancement of IC performances with the introduction of optics inside a high performance chip (core to core communications), or low cost sensors. By co-integrating optics and electronics on the same chip, high- functionality, high-performance and highly integrated devices can be fabricated with a well-mastered microelectronics fabrication process. The FP 7 HELIOS project aims to combine a photonic layer with a CMOS circuit by using microelectronics fabrication processes. A first goal was to develop high performance generic building blocks for a broad range of applications: WDM sources by III-V/Si heterogeneous integration [1], fast modulators [2, 3] and detectors [4], passive circuits and packaging. With these building blocks, different demonstrators are assembled. One of those is a 16 x 10 Gb/...|$|R
