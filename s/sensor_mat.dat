For children seated in a rearward facing child seat or OoP (“Out of Position“) situ ations the airb ag should not be fired. A <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> on the seat cushion is developed for the classif ication of the occupants on the passenger seat (“Occupant Classification System “ = OCS). The e mployed sensors in the mat are activated based on a resistive measuring principle so that a chara cteristic activation of sensors for particular “classes of occupants “ can be achieved. During the development of such a <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> for a particular seat model, a large number of tests with test persons, child seats and special buttock dummies are carried out in order to guarantee a reliable recognition of the seat’s occupancy.

However, for compression detection the simple state-of-the-art DE films are too insensitive. In order to close this gap, a novel class of DE sensors for compression measurements has been developed. The new sensor mats consist of two flexible elastomer profiles, between which an elastomer film is squeezed, converting the compression to a stretch load.

They result from the buttocks' soft tissues compression by the bony prominences. Unfortunately, the current clinical techniques, with - in the best case - embedded pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>mats,</b> are insufficient to prevent them because most are due to high internal strains which can occur even with low pressures at the skin surface. Therefore, improving prevention requires using a biomechanical model to estimate internal strains from skin surface pressures. However, the buttocks' soft tissues' stiffness is still unknown. This paper provides a stiffness sensitivity analysis using a finite element model. Different layers with distinct Neo Hookean materials simulate the skin, fat and muscles. With Young moduli in the range [100 - 500 kPa], [25 - 35 kPa], and [80 - 140 kPa] for the skin, fat, and muscles respectively, maximum internal strains reach realistic 50 to 60 % values.

Direction insensitive <b>sensors</b> (two <b>mat</b> <b>sensors</b> and one light beam sensor) were additionally tested as a reference. Bidirectional counting data of free people flow was collected for 36 days in one-hour resolution, including five hours of manual counting. Compared to the manual results, one of the light beam sensors had the most equally balanced directional overall counting errors (4. 6 % and 5. 2 %). The collected data of this sensor was used to model the air transportation energy consumption of visitor counting sensor-based DCV and constant air volume ventilation (CAV). The results suggest that potential savings in air transportation energy consumption could be gained with the modeled DCV as its total daily airflow during the test period was 54 % of the total daily airflow of the modeled CAV on average. A virtually real-time control of ventilation could be realized with minute-level counting resolution.

40|$|Dielectric {{elastomer}} sensors for {{the measurement}} of compression loads with high sensitivity are described. The basic design of the sensors exhibits two profiled surfaces between which an elastomer film is confined. All components of the sensor were prepared with silicone whose stiffness can be varied in a wide range. Depending on details of the sensor design, various effects contribute to the enhancement of the capacitance. The intermediate elastomer film is stretched upon compression and electrode layers on the elastomer profiles and in the elastomer film approach each other. Different designs of the pressure sensor give rise to very different sensor characteristics {{in terms of the}} dependence of electric capacitance on compression force. Due to their inherent flexibility, the pressure sensors can be used on compliant substrates such as seats or beds or on the human body. This gives rise to numerous possible applications. The contribution describes also some examples of possible sensor applications. A glove was equipped with various sensors positioned at the finger tips. When grabbing an object with the glove, the sensors can detect the gripping forces of the individual fingers with high sensitivity. In a demonstrator of the glove equipped with seven sensors, the capacitances representing the gripping forces are recorded on a display. In another application example, a lower limb prosthesis was equipped with a pressure sensor to detect the load on the remaining part of the leg and the load is displayed in terms of the measured capacitance. The benefit of such sensors is to detect an eventual overload in order to prevent possible pressure sores. A third example introduces a seat load sensor system based on four extended pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>mats.</b> The <b>sensor</b> system detects the load distribution of a person on the seat.

40|$|New {{designs of}} {{dielectric}} elastomer sensors (DES) which are capable to detect compression loads on rigid {{as well as}} on compliant surfaces are introduced in this paper. Currently, DES films exhibit only very poor sensitivity in terms of the change of electric capacitance upon increasing loads for compression measurements. In the new sensor mats, the compression load is converted to a tensile load which acts on an elastomer film located between two profiled elastomer components. In addition, the deformation of the elastomer profiles can also contribute to the sensor effect. All elastomer components were prepared of silicone. A number of parameters which have an influence on the characteristic dependence of capacitance on compression load are discussed. A main influence results from the shape of the elastomer profiles which stretch the elastomer film inside. Also very important are the number and the locations of electrode layers in the <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> between which the capacitance is measured. Finally, the hardness of the elastomer plays also a decisive role for the sensor sensitivity. This broad variability of the sensor design offers a high potential to tune the sensor characteristics.

40|$|Dielectric {{elastomer}} sensors (DES) offer extended {{possibilities for}} the detection of strains and forces under tensile load, using a capacitive measuring principle. However, for the measurement of pressure loads, they are very insensitive due to the small deformations. To close this gap, novel sensor mats have been developed, which react very sensitively to pressure loads. The basic design of the sensor mats consists of two elastomer profiles, between which an elastomer film is located. Under compression of the <b>sensor</b> <b>mat,</b> the profiles penetrate into each other and stretch the elastomer film strongly. This effect causes strong changes of the electrical capacitance. For the design of the sensor mats, multiple possibilities of variation are available, with which the characteristics of the dependence of capacitance on load can be influenced and tuned. This includes geometrical parameters such as the shape of the profiles and the location of the electrodes as well as materials parameters like the hardness of the profiles and the elastomer film. These correlations are outlined in the paper by means of some examples. The new sensor mats can be beneficially exploited in all scenarios, in which pressure measurements on extended compliant surfaces such as seats, beds or shoes are required...|$|E
40|$|Context: Asymmetrical loading between lower limbs can {{theoretically}} {{be explained}} as an inequality of strength, neuromuscular control, or subconscious reliance {{on one leg}} more than the other. Asymmetries are often identified utilizing costly equipment such as force plates and 3 D motion analysis cameras. It is important to establish less costly ways of identifying movement and loading asymmetries for clinicians to utilize. One qualitative assessment that may identify asymmetries is a ‘lateral hip shift’ during an overhead squat. Objective: To identify differences in lower extremity range of motion (ROM) and plantar foot pressures in individuals with and without a lateral hip shift during an overhead squat. Design: Cross-Sectional Observation. Setting: Lab. Participants: Twenty-nine (14 males and 15 females) physically active individuals participated in this study. Seventeen individuals with a lateral hip shift during an overhead squat (LAT; Age = 21. 2 ± 2. 1 years, Height = 175. 1 ± 9. 1 cm, Mass = 77. 6 ± 14. 2 kg) and twelve without (CON; Age = 20. 8 ± 2. 1 years, Height = 177. 4 ± 6. 8 cm, Mass = 77. 8 ± 11. 1 kg) were identified through screening. Interventions: Participants were screened for a lateral hip shift while performing five overhead squats to determine group allocation (LAT, CON). All ROM measures were performed in a randomized order followed by additional trials of the overhead squat while standing on the pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>mat.</b> Main Outcome Measures: Active, passive, and weight-bearing ROM for ankle dorsiflexion (DF) and passive hip abduction, internal, and external rotation were measured. Plantar pressure variables were captured via a pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> during the overhead squat, including side-to-side weight bearing %, anterior-posterior excursion (cm), left-right excursion (cm), and center of force (COF) distance (cm). Results: A significant group-by-limb interaction for active DF ROM, such that the LAT group had less active DF ROM with the knee flexed on the limb they shifted away from {{in comparison to the}} assigned CON limb (mean difference = 6. 87 º ± 0. 2). The LAT group also had less active DF ROM with the knee extended (3. 07 ° ± 1. 25) compared to the CON group (8. 30 ° ± 1. 49). No differences were observed on other ROM variables. The LAT group demonstrated greater movement in their center of force on the plantar pressure mat for total distance (mean difference = 24. 27 cm ± 0. 4) and LR excursion (mean difference = 2. 96 cm ± 3. 2).

Background: Accurately predicting pressure injury formation remains elusive. Exploring pressure gradients through pressure mapping systems may increase understanding of suspected deep pressure injury development. Methods: A nested prospective correlational exploratory study recruited 120 medical and surgical patients with convenience sampling. Patients were positioned supine with a 30 -degree head elevation, on a computer-linked pressure <b>sensor</b> mapping <b>mat.</b> Mean peak interface pressure and pressure gradients were calculated. Results: Large correlation coefficients were identified between peak interface pressure and pressure gradients at distances of 1. 5 cm and 2. 5 cm, indicating that the area {{at the base of}} the 2 ̆ 7 cone-like 2 ̆ 7 pressure damaged area remained essentially constant, rather than increasing with peak interface pressure. Conclusions: Pressure is experienced in a 2 ̆ 7 V 2 ̆ 7 shape rather than a 2 ̆ 7 U 2 ̆ 7 shape. Additionally, the area subjected to the highest pressure gradient is restricted in size and the impact of pressure reduces with distance from the point of peak interface pressure. The results suggest that with increasing peak interface pressure, the surrounding area becomes subject to higher gradients and shearing forces.

The secondary objective was to investigate the specific additional impact of pressure ulcers on patients’ well-being. Methods Design A multicentre, randomised, controlled, open, fixed sample, parallel-group trial with equal randomisation was undertaken. The trial used remote, concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. The main trial design was supplemented with a qualitative study involving a purposive sample of 20 – 30 patients who developed pressure ulcers, {{to assess the impact of}} the pressure ulcers on their well-being. In addition, a focus group interview was carried out with clinical research nurses, who participated in the PRESSURE Trial, to explore the experiences of their role and observations of pressure area care. Setting The study took place in 11 hospital-based research centres within six NHS trusts in the UK. Participants Acute and elective patients aged 55 years or older and admitted to vascular, orthopaedic, medical or care of the elderly wards in the previous 24 hours were investigated. Additional inclusion criteria were: (1) acute and elective patients with activity limitation/existing pressure ulcer on admission, who had an expected length of stay of 7 or more days; were bedfast or chairfast and completely immobile or had very limited mobility and/or had a pre-existing grade 2 pressure ulcer on admission; and gave their written informed consent to participate (or in unconscious or confused patients, the next of kin gave informed written relative assent); and (2) elective surgical patients with no activity limitation/existing pressure ulcer on admission, who were undergoing a surgical procedure with an average length of hospital stay of 7 or more days and/or expected to be bedfast or chairfast and immobile or to have very limited mobility for at least 3 days postoperatively; and gave their written informed consent to participate. Patients were excluded from the study where they had participated in this trial during a previous admission; had a pre-existing grade 3, 4 or 5 pressure ulcer on admission; were an elective surgical patient with a planned postoperative admission to the intensive care unit; were an elective surgical patient admitted more than 4 days before surgery; slept at night in a chair; or weighed over 140 kg (upper weight limit for overlay mattress) or less than 45 kg (lower weight limit for replacement mattresses with automatic <b>sensor</b> <b>mats).</b> Interventions Patients were randomised to either an alternating pressure overlay or an alternating pressure mattress replacement, with mattress specifications clearly defined to enable the inclusion of centres using products from different manufacturers, and to exclude hybrid mattress systems (which either combine foam or constant low pressure with alternating pressure in one mattress, or can be used as either an overlay or a replacement mattress).

Secondary end-points were healing of existing pressures ulcers, patient acceptability and cost-effectiveness. Results In total, 6155 patients were assessed for eligibility to the trial and 1972 were randomised: 990 to the alternating pressure overlay (989 after one postrandomisation exclusion) and 982 to the alternating pressure mattress replacement. Intention-to-treat analysis found no statistically significant difference in the proportions of patients developing a new pressure ulcer of grade 2 or above [10. 7...|$|R
40|$|Observations {{of marine}} air {{temperature}} (MAT) by Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) {{are known to}} contain significant biases due to solar heating of the <b>sensor</b> environment. <b>MAT</b> and humidity observations are usually made using wet- and dry-bulb thermometers housed in Stevenson screens, or with psychrometers. These instruments are typically mounted in the bridge wings or on the wheel-house top. If not sited carefully then the instruments can be poorly exposed to the undisturbed environmental conditions and have inadequate ventilation, leading to biased observations of both MAT and humidity. In this paper we use observations collected {{as part of the}} VOS Climate (VOSClim) project to investigate the relationship between instrument exposure and heating errors. The heating errors are estimated as the difference between the observed MAT and the collocated output of a numerical weather prediction model. The instrument exposures are assessed from hotographs of the instruments. Currently, photographs of the instruments and sufficient observations exist for 17 VOSClim ships. Two methods of assessing the instrument exposure using the observations are presented. The first method is based on the skewness of the distribution of estimated heating errors for individual ships. The second method is based on a correction developed to correct the heating errors and uses the ratio of the heating to cooling terms in the correction. When ships are ranked both on the skewness and on the ratio of the heating to cooling terms, there is a statistically significant correspondence between the rankings and the visual assessments of instrument exposure. The skewness of the distribution of estimated errors in MAT is proposed as a simple indicator of instrument exposure...|$|R
40|$|With our {{partners}} at the University of Virginia we {{are developing a}} system of sensors, to monitor the activity of seniors in their residences. We measure motion, footfalls, sleep and restlessness, we have stove <b>sensors</b> and sensing <b>mats,</b> all connected wirelessly to a computer which performs an initial evaluation and data transfer to a secure server for further study. Based upon the monitor data we will implement an intervention to ameliorate functional decline. Focus group studies determine the attitudes, concerns and impressions of the residents and staff. We find that senior's attitude to technology is healthy and they will try helpful approaches. In addition to the statistical comparisons, we model the data using hidden Markov models, integrate or fuse the monitor data with video images, and reason about behavior using fuzzy logic. The results of this work will additionally reduce the workload on caregivers, foster communication between residents and family,and give these seniors independence.

40|$|A {{well-established}} connection {{exists between}} increased gait variability and greater fall likelihood in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, a portable, validated means of quantifying gait variability (and testing {{the efficacy of}} any intervention) remains lacking. Furthermore, although rhythmic auditory cueing continues to receive attention as a promising gait therapy for PD, its widespread delivery remains bottlenecked. The present paper describes a smartphone-based mobile application ("SmartMOVE") to address both needs. The accuracy of smartphone-based gait analysis (utilizing the smartphone's built-in tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope to calculate successive step times and step lengths) was validated against two heel contact-based measurement devices: heel-mounted footswitch sensors (to capture step times) and an instrumented pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> (to capture step lengths). 12 PD patients and 12 age-matched healthy controls walked along a 26 -m path during self-paced and metronome-cued conditions, with all three devices recording simultaneously. Four outcome measures of gait and gait variability were calculated. Mixed-factorial analysis of variance revealed several instances in which between-group differences (e. g., increased gait variability in PD patients relative to healthy controls) yielded medium-to-large effect sizes (eta-squared values), and cueing-mediated changes (e. g., decreased gait variability when PD patients walked with auditory cues) yielded small-to-medium effect sizes-while at the same time, device-related measurement error yielded small-to-negligible effect sizes. These findings highlight specific opportunities for smartphone-based gait analysis {{to serve as an}} alternative to conventional gait analysis methods (e. g., footswitch systems or sensor-embedded walkways), particularly when those methods are cost-prohibitive, cumbersome, or inconvenient...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{injuries}} are a serious risk for patients admitted to hospital and {{are thought to}} result {{from a number of}} forces operating on skin tissue (pressure, shear and friction). Most research on interface pressure (IP) has taken place using healthy volunteers or mannequins. Little is currently known about the relationship between pressure injury risk and IP for hospital patients. This relationship was investigated with a sample of 121 adult hospital patients. Pressure injury risk was evaluated using the Waterlow Risk Assessment Tool (WRAT) and IP was measured at the sacrum using a Tekscan ClinSeat TM IP <b>sensor</b> <b>mat.</b> Other factors considered were body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, reason for hospital admission, comorbidities and admission route to hospital. Patients were classified according to WRAT categories ('low risk', 'at risk', 'high risk', 'very high risk') and then remained still on a standard hospital mattress for 10 minutes while IP was measured. Participants in the 'low risk' group were significantly younger than all other groups (p< 0. 001) and there were some group differences in BMI. IP readings were compared between the 'low risk' group and all of the participants at greater risk. The 'low risk' group had significantly lower IP at the sacrum on a standard hospital mattress than those at greater risk (p= 0. 002). Those at greater risk tended to have IP readings {{at the low end of}} the compromised IP range. This study is significant because it describes a new, clinically relevant methodology and presents findings that challenge clinician assumptions about the relationships between pressure injury risk assessment and IP...|$|E

Brazilian Journal of Biomotricity, v. 2, n. 3, p. 176 - 195, 2008. Assessing {{pressure}} and contact stress distributions between two adjacent surfaces {{is a well}} established research area in biomechanics. Typical applications of measuring the interface pressure include human-machine interfaces in ergonomics, joint congruency studies in orthopaedics, in-vitro cadaveric experimentation and the design of Orthotic-Prosthetic devices. Tekscan pressure sensors are widely used in both in-vivo and in-vitro experiments. An all-round efficient equilibration and calibration approach of the Tekscan sensor system {{is yet to be}} clearly defined in the literature and is attempted here for one type of Tekscan sensors. The response of individual sensels from two 5315 Tekscan sensors for quasi-static, repeated constant and dynamic loading was investigated with the use of two methods, namely the “Bladder Method” and the “Pin Method”. In the first method, uniform pressure was applied by a bladder-equilibrator, whereas in the second loads were applied in a sensel-by-sensel approach by means of a pin attached to a frame installed on a material testing machine. The “Pin Method”, although far more laborious, is a better method for equilibration and calibration of sensors, particularly when saturation is prevalent. The pin-method also provides a better characterization of the sensor drift. It was shown that when test conditions resulted in some of the sensels being saturating due to high pressure, the loss of load data from the <b>sensor</b> <b>mat</b> could be estimated using the individual sensel output...|$|E
40|$|Human gait can {{consist of}} both the walking and running aspects of the human {{locomotion}} pattern and may be analyzed from a kinetic and/or kinematic focus (Hamil 2 ̆ 6 Knutzen, 2009). Abnormal gait patterns often arise {{in part due to}} physical declines resulting from an injury, the aging process (Owings 2 ̆ 6 Grabiner, 2004), or due to neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease (Hausdorff et al, 1998). In order to compare gait throughout the lifespan, or throughout a rehabilitation process, it is important to determine the standards of a healthy population. The aim of this investigation was to establish the normative standards of specific temporal and spatial characteristics of gait in a healthy university-aged Canadian population. Twenty temporal measures and eleven spatial measures of gait were collected using the GAITRite® system (CIR Systems, Inc., New York, USA). Using a standardized protocol, participants (n= 225; 127 male, 98 female) were instructed to begin walking approximately two meters behind where the GAITRite® system pressure <b>sensor</b> embedded <b>mat</b> was located on the floor, and to walk across the mat using their normal gait pattern at their preferred pace. All participants were Canadian university-aged adults and consented to the data collection and analysis as part of a kinesiology laboratory based course. Descriptive statistics, reported by sex, were analyzed on twenty temporal measures [e. g. Mean Step Time Left (M= 0. 56 s, F= 0. 52 s), Mean Cycle Time Left (M= 1. 11 s, F= 1. 02 s) ] and eleven spatial measures [e. g. Mean Step Length Left (M= 82. 55 cm, F= 77. 26 cm), Mean Heel to Heel base of support Left (M= 10. 74 cm, F= 9. 16 cm) ]. The literature lacks an extensive analysis of temporal and spatial gait characteristics for a young, healthy Canadian population during unaltered conditions; which {{the results of this study}} can now provide. Future research and rehabilitation programs can apply these results when comparing to data collected in clinical and laboratory settings. References Hamill J, 2 ̆ 6 Knutzen KM.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 23 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 12 - 15 July 2004 "Getting recognition {{for the importance of}} transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The National Land Transport Transition Act 2000 requires that Current Public Records (CPTRs) be completed by each planning authority. The CPTRs consist of data on infrastructure, fleet, timetables, routes, passenger volumes, etc regarding public transport in the planning authorities region. However this data is collected manually and therefore time consuming and subject to inaccuracy. The main aim of this project is to explore possibilities of collecting most of the data required for transport planning electronically. A market survey was conducted to establish the need for automated passenger counting systems. The results showed that indeed {{there is a need for}} automated passenger counting systems. This paper contains a technology scan on the automated passenger counting systems that gives a basic understanding of these systems. Furthermore, an extensive research was undertaken to identify automated passenger counting systems developers. Ten systems developers where identified. A database of such developers was developed together with their contact details. Passenger counters can be categorized according to four groupings based on the key technology used for counting. The following groupings exist: ! Manual (Turnstiles) ! Infrared (IR) beams ! Infrared optic sensors ! Low ultrasonic frequency <b>sensors,</b> and ! Treadle <b>mats.</b> (Load cells) ! Video camera A field trial was undertaken with Infodev on the City of Johannesburg’s Metrobus. The main objective was to test the system on real life situation and its acceptability to passengers. It was found that people did not notice the presence of the sensors on top of the door. Also the system gave accuracy levels around 99 %.

40|$|Background. This {{study had}} two generals objective. 1) To analyse {{and study the}} {{kinematics}} characteristics in the Squat Jump and Countermovement Jump Tests, the variables studied were derived from accelerometry, angular velocity and displacement, using the inertial sensor incorporated in the iPhone 4 S. 2) To study and locate {{the correlation between the}} inertial <b>sensor</b> variables, contact <b>mat</b> variables and dynamometry. Methods. This is a cross-sectional study over 12 healthy young subjects. In attempt to locate the series of kinematic variables that had a significant relationship degree with the contact mat or dynamometry, was used Pearson's linear correlation with 95 % Zr. The statistical significance level was established at p< 0. 05. The subjects performed the Squat Jump and Countermovement Jump Tests three times, and the best record was analyzed and included in the study. Results. The best significant correlation localized in the Squat Jump test were between the minimum rate rotation in the z axis and jump fly time (r=- 0. 793; p= 0. 002) and jump height (r=- 0. 805; p= 0. 002). Others significant correlation in the Squat Jump test were between the maximum rate rotation in the x and: the right lower limb dynamometry (r = - 0. 660; p = 0. 020) and left lower limb dynamometry (r = - 0. 613; p = 0. 034). In the Countermovement test, the best relationship were between maximum acceleration in the x axis with jump fly time (r= 0. 819; p= 0. 001) and jump height (r= 0. 823; p= 0. 001). Others significant correlation in the Countermovement test were between the minimum rate rotation in the z axis and jump fly time (r=- 0. 671; p= 0. 017) and jump height (r=- 0. 667; p= 0. 018). Conclusions. The inertial sensor fitted in the iPhone 4 is able to study and analyze the kinematics of the Squat Jump and Countermovement Jump Tests in young healthy people. In this study had been localized significant quantitative relationship between kinematic variables and jumping contact mat or isotonic strength. This contribution of this cross-sectional study could be used to develop algorithms with the help of software to designed mobile apps, thus allowing their application in clinical practice.
