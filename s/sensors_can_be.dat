5|$|Surge can be {{measured}} directly at coastal tidal stations as {{the difference between the}} forecast tide and the observed rise of water. Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone. This was first tested for Hurricane Rita in 2005. These types of <b>sensors</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> placed in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.|$|E

25|$|EEG <b>sensors</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used in {{more places}} than fMRI, SPECT, PET, MRS, or MEG, as these {{techniques}} require bulky and immobile equipment. For example, MEG requires equipment consisting of liquid helium-cooled detectors {{that can be}} used only in magnetically shielded rooms, altogether costing upwards of several million dollars; and fMRI requires the use of a 1-ton magnet in, again, a shielded room.|$|E

Audio data and GPS tagging of smartphones enables identification of traffic density and possible traffic jams.

25|$|A pair of {{inertial}} sensors {{inside the}} controller, a three-axis linear accelerometer and a three-axis angular rate sensor, {{are used to}} track rotation as well as overall motion. An internal magnetometer is also used for calibrating the controller's orientation against the Earth's magnetic field to help correct against cumulative error (drift) by the inertial sensors. In addition, an internal temperature sensor is used to adjust the inertial sensor readings against temperature effects. The inertial <b>sensors</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used for dead reckoning in cases which the camera tracking is insufficient, such as when the controller is obscured behind the player's back.|$|E
25|$|Fibers {{have many}} uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical fiber. In other cases, fiber {{is used to}} connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a {{measurement}} system. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, {{or the fact that}} no electrical power is needed at the remote location, or because many <b>sensors</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> multiplexed along the length of a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an optical time-domain reflectometer.|$|E

25|$|A CMOS {{image sensor}} (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) {{is an image}} sensor {{consisting}} of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. Starting at the same point, they have to convert light into electrons by using the CMOS process. CMOS image <b>sensors</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in digital SLR cameras, embedded web-cams, video cameras, automotive safety systems, swallowable-pill cameras, toys and video games, and wireless video-security networks. The renowned American physicist and engineer Eric Fossum invented the CMOS image sensor while working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. On January 28, 1994, Fossum filed U.S. patent #5,471,515, which was issued to him on November 28, 1995.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors use an optical fiber cable, {{normally}} a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. Extrinsic <b>sensors</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used in the same}} way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E
25|$|The F-15I Ra'am {{is similar}} to the F-15E, but {{features}} several different avionic systems to meet Israeli requirements. To facilitate night-time strikes, the F-15Is were initially fitted with Sharpshooter targeting pods designed for Israeli F-16s. The Sharpshooter pod was less capable than the LANTIRN pods used on USAF F-15Es; Israel later purchased 30 LANTIRN pods. The F-15Is initially lacked Radar Warning Receivers, Israel installed its own electronic warfare equipment, the Elisra SPS-2110, as well as a new central computer and embedded GPS/INS system. All <b>sensors</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> slaved to the Display And Sight Helmet (DASH) helmet-mounted sight, providing both crew members a means of targeting which the F-15E lacks. The F-15I uses the APG-70I radar; its terrain mapping capability can locate targets difficult to spot while under adverse weather conditions. The radar can detect large airliner-sized targets at , and fighter-sized targets at , it has a reduced resolution one-third below the standard USAF APG-70. In January 2016, Israel approved an upgrade of the F-15I fleet that includes structural changes, an AESA radar, updated avionics, and new (unspecified) weapon systems.|$|E
