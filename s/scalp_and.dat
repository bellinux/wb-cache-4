5|$|Jackson {{also stated}} during the 1993 {{interview}} that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984. On January 24 of that year, Jackson was filming a Pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty pyrotechnics on stage that were intended {{to be part of}} one of many being filmed. He sustained second-degree burns to his <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain. He reportedly began taking the painkillers after refusing at first {{in order to deal with}} the intense pain.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, <b>scalp,</b> <b>and</b> back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E

25|$|Head lice are {{wingless}} insects {{spending their}} entire lives on the human <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> feeding exclusively on human blood. Humans are the only known hosts of this specific parasite, while chimpanzees host a closely related species, Pediculus schaeffi.

25|$|It was {{fashionable to}} pluck or shave the {{forehead}} {{to raise the}} hairlines. The hair was tied tightly on the <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> usually hidden inside the cone (possibly {{one end of the}} veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the free end being pulled through the hole {{at the tip of the}} cone). However some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin.|$|E
50|$|Trichoscopy is {{a method}} of hair <b>and</b> <b>scalp</b> {{evaluation}} <b>and</b> is used for diagnosing hair <b>and</b> <b>scalp</b> diseases. The method is based on dermoscopy.

25|$|Topically {{administered}} ketoconazole {{is usually}} prescribed for fungal infections {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used {{as a treatment for}} dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the <b>scalp)</b> <b>and</b> for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of Black hairstyles involve parting the natural hair into individual sections before styling. Research shows that excessive braiding, tight cornrows, relaxing, and vigorous dry-combing of afro-textured hair can {{be harmful to}} the hair and scalp. They have also been known to cause ailments such as alopecia, balding {{at the edges of}} the scalp, excessive dry <b>scalp,</b> <b>and</b> bruises on the scalp. Keeping hair moisturized, trimming ends, and using very little to no heat will prevent breakage and split ends.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{straightening}} the hair often involved applying caustic substances, such as relaxers containing lye, which {{needed to be}} applied by an experienced hairstylist {{so as to avoid}} burning the <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> ears. In the late 1890s/early 1900s, Madam C. J. Walker also popularized the use of the hot comb in the United States. Those who chose not to artificially treat their hair would often opt to style it into tight braids or cornrows. With all of these hairstyling methods, one ran the risk of damaging the hair shaft, sometimes resulting in hair loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{gold rush}} brought tens of {{thousands}} of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining damaged water supplies and killed fish; the deer left the area. The settlers brought new diseases such as smallpox and measles. The northern Yana group became extinct and the central and southern groups and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, leading to bounties on the natives by the settlers. Prices included 50 cents per <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> 5 dollars per head. In 1865, the massacre began while the Yahi slept in bed.|$|E

25|$|The café {{was very}} small, with the tables very close together, and was {{particularly}} busy that day, with many people {{waiting for the}} next ferry. The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia, who were at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing his <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> knocking him to the floor. He fired a fourth shot that killed Sargent's girlfriend, 21-year-old Kate Elizabeth Scott, by hitting her {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|Zindler made {{local and}} {{national}} headlines when he and reporter Larry Conners closed the Chicken Ranch in Fayette County, Texas, near La Grange, after he reported on it in 1973. The Chicken Ranch story was featured in a 1973 edition of Texas Monthly magazine, two 1974 issues of Playboy magazine, {{was the basis for}} the Broadway and film musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and served as the basis of the song La Grange by ZZ Top. The closing did not go well with the sheriff of Fayette County, Jim T. Flournoy, who later attacked Zindler in a fight that left Zindler with two fractured ribs, along with a snatched toupee. Reportedly, Flournoy waved the hairpiece in the air {{as if it were a}} prized enemy <b>scalp</b> <b>and</b> threw it in the street.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, 1990, Dahmer {{moved out}} of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Anthony Sears' skull, <b>scalp,</b> <b>and</b> painted {{genitals}} with him. Within one week of his moving into his new apartment, Dahmer had killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 {{with the promise of}} $50 for sex. At Dahmer's apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills and manually strangled him. The following day, Dahmer purchased a Polaroid camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which enabled him to then rinse the bones in his sink; he dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton—excluding the skull—in a container he filled with acid. He spray-painted Smith's skull and placed it alongside the skull of Anthony Sears.|$|E

A group of soldiers {{returned to the house}} and found Ruffner's body in the yard. He had been shot twice, <b>scalped,</b> <b>and</b> had several fingers cut off, presumably by a tomahawk. Inside the house, they found the bodies of the Zimmer family, also <b>scalped</b> <b>and,</b> in Kate's case, with a nearly-severed arm. The family had presumably served a meal to the Native Americans, as it was still laid out on the table.|$|R
