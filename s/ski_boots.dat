5|$|<b>Ski</b> <b>boots</b> are {{attached}} to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing).|$|E
5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E
5|$|The party's <b>ski</b> <b>boots,</b> {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E

50|$|During the 2000s, Denny re-entered the <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> {{market with}} the Apex <b>ski</b> <b>boot.</b> The Apex {{consists}} of two entirely separate parts, a semi-stiff boot that uses the Boa Closure System instead of laces or buckles, and an outer carbon fibre shell that provides the needed lateral support and mounting points for conventional downhill ski bindings.|$|R
25|$|Skiers in {{this class}} use two skis and no ski poles in para-Alpine and para-Nordic. While skiers are {{prohibited}} from using traditional ski poles, they may use mini poles {{so long as they}} are unable to hold a traditional ski pole without the use of a prostheses. Skiers are also allowed to use prostheses or orthoses in competition. FIS rules for <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and binding heights are followed for this class. Skiers {{in this class}} must wear a Slalom helmet in Slalom events and crash helmets during the Giant Slalom.|$|E
25|$|Para-alpine skiers in this {{classification}} {{have their}} choice regarding how many skis and ski poles {{they wish to}} use, along {{with the type of}} ski poles they wish to utilize, which may include outriggers. The rules FIS rules governing <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and bindings are not enforced for this class, with different requirements than rules that apply to that equipment for able-bodied competitors. For below the knee amputees in this class, their ski boot may have their prosthetic leg built into it. In para-Nordic skiing, skiers use two skis and have an option to use one or two ski poles.|$|E
25|$|LW6/8 skiers use two {{skis and}} one pole in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. The {{two types of}} skiing differ in that in para-Nordic a skier cannot use a {{prosthesis}} while use prostheses or orthoses are allowed in para-Alpine. FIS rules for <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and binding heights are followed for this class. Socks and other materials are used to pad and protect the stump of the arm {{as the use of}} a prosthesis is not allowed. Sometimes, a mitten or cork is used to protect the stump. If the limb is not properly protected, it may get frostbitten.|$|E

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one or two skis and two ski poles, except in para-Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two ski poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions. In training, skiers can also use cants, wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may be built into the ski boot for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class.|$|E
25|$|In para-Alpine, skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one skis and two ski poles. The para-Alpine ski configuration {{is sometimes called}} a 3 track. FIS rules for para-Alpine <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In para-Nordic, skiers compete with two skis and two poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiers in this classification may use outriggers. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base, and are fitted for the skier based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when the skier is standing. In the biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|In this classification, skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have difficulty walking in <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers {{with cerebral palsy}} have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tie more quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Telemark skiing uses a {{specialized}} type of equipment. Generally, Telemark skiers use flexible Alpine skis with specially designed bindings that fix only {{the toe of}} the <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> to the <b>ski,</b> thereby creating the [...] "free heel". Oftentimes the heel {{is attached to the}} front of the binding by a hinged cable, which holds the <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> firmly in the binding. These bindings are often non-releasable.|$|R

25|$|During wet or snowy weather, snow {{boots are}} worn {{to keep the}} foot warm and dry. They are {{typically}} made of rubber or other water-resistant material, have multiple layers of insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. <b>Ski</b> <b>boots</b> are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and {{designed to provide a}} way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of outriggers. The nature of their disability will dictate the type of equipment required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight. They are customised for {{the specific needs of}} the skier. The ski boot for below the knee amputees often has the prosthetic built into it, though for all competitors in this class, FIS rules for para-Alpine <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|LW1 {{classified}} skiers use outriggers, and two skis or one ski with a prosthesis. International Ski Federation {{rules for}} <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and binding heights are modified for this class {{and are not}} the same rules used for able-bodied skiers. Skiers in this class are allowed to use ski-tips in competition, using a setup sometimes called a Four Track. In training, they may use additional equipment. For example, skiers with cerebral palsy may use cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis depending on the nature of their disability. Skiers with an amputation may use a prosthesis. As skiers in this classification improve, they require less use of this equipment. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight, and are customised for the specific needs of the skier. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
40|$|A <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> is {{important}} to make progress in ski turning technique as an interface between a skier and a ski. Especially in alpine ski races, suitability of design of the boots for racers becomes more important to achieve accurate and quick lean of the leg in ski turns. This study is aimed at building a new design concept of a <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> that can improve the results of alpine ski races. In this paper, new design of an upper shell of a <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> that was adjusted to {{the features of the}} frame of alpine ski racers was experimentally examined. As a result, it was demonstrated that a front and a rear part of the upper shell of a <b>ski</b> <b>boot</b> should be separately adjusted to the length of a shank of each player for well-balanced quick lean of the leg in the ski turn. Finally, the effect of new design of an upper shell was examined in giant slalom and slalom tests by Japanese alpine ski racers of the first rank. Consequently, the results showed that lean angle during turns was increased and finish time was shortened when the skiers wore the newly designed boots...|$|R

500|$|In 1975 Bundy shifted {{much of his}} {{criminal}} activity eastward, from his base in Utah to Colorado. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in Snowmass Village, [...] southeast of Salt Lake City. Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She {{had been killed by}} blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon. A hundred miles (160km) northeast of Snowmass, on March 15, Vail ski instructor Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a secondary site near Rifle, Colorado, [...] west of Vail. Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{intelligence}} {{services and the}} Soviet military used deceptive measures to conceal from the United States their intentions in Operation Anadyr, {{which led to the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. According to CIA analyst James Hansen, the Soviet Army most likely used large-scale battlefield deception before the Cuban Missile Crisis [...] "more frequently and with more consistent success than any other army." [...] The soldiers involved in Anadyr were provided with winter clothing and informed they would be going to the east of the Soviet Union. On board ship, intelligence officers allowed the 40,000 soldiers involved on deck only during the hours of darkness. The force, including missiles, reached Cuba before US intelligence became aware of it. Anadyr was planned from the start with elaborate denial and deception, ranging from the soldiers' <b>ski</b> <b>boots</b> and fleece-lined parkas to the name of the operation, a river and town in the chilly far east. Once America had become aware of Soviet intentions, deception continued in the form of outright denial, as when, on 17 October 1962, the embassy official Georgy Bolshakov gave President John F. Kennedy a [...] "personal message" [...] from the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev reassuring him that [...] "under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba." [...] Hansen's analysis ends with a recognition of the Soviet advantage in deception in 1962. In Hansen's view, the fact that the Killian Report did not even mention adversarial denial and deception was an indication that American intelligence had not begun to study foreign D it did not do so for another 20 years. Hansen considered it likely that with a properly-prepared [...] "deception-aware analytic corps", America could have seen through Khrushchev's plan long before Maj. Heyser's revealing U-2 mission. In Hansen's view, it would take four decades before American intelligence fully understood the extent of Soviet deception before the Cuban Missile Crisis, especially the way the Soviets hid the truth of its strategic missile deployment behind a mass of lies, on [...] "a scale that most US planners could not comprehend".|$|E
2500|$|From {{the very}} beginning, the Soviets' {{operation}} entailed elaborate denial and deception, known as [...] "maskirovka". All {{the planning and}} preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were {{carried out in the}} utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission. Even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a cold region and being outfitted with <b>ski</b> <b>boots,</b> fleece-lined parkas, and other winter equipment. The Soviet codename was Operation Anadyr. The Anadyr River flows into the Bering Sea, and Anadyr is also the capital of Chukotsky District and a bomber base in the far eastern region. All the measures were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences.|$|E

2500|$|The American Teaching System is one {{learning}} {{method for}} competitors {{with cerebral palsy}} in this classification. Skiers first learn about their equipment, and {{how to put it}} on, before learning how to position their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. [...] This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns. Skiers with cerebral palsy in this classification have difficulty walking in <b>ski</b> <b>boots,</b> and sometimes require assistance when walking in them.
