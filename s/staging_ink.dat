In this paper, {{we focus on}} one- (1 D), two- (2 D), and three-dimensional (3 D) printing of conductive metallic inks {{in the form of}} flexible, stretchable, and spanning microelectrodes. Direct-write assembly 4, 5 is a 1 -to- 3 D printing technique that enables the fabrication of features ranging from simple lines to complex structures by the deposition of concentrated inks through fine nozzles (~ 0. 1 - 250 μm). This printing method consists of a computer-controlled 3 -axis translation <b>stage,</b> an <b>ink</b> reservoir and nozzle, and 10 x telescopic lens for visualization. Unlike inkjet printing, a droplet-based process, direct-write assembly involves the extrusion of ink filaments either in- or out-of-plane. The printed filaments typically conform to the nozzle size. Hence, microscale features (< 1 μm) can be patterned and assembled into larger arrays and multidimensional architectures. In this paper, we first synthesize a highly concentrated silver nanoparticle ink for planar and 3 D printing via direct-write assembly. Next,...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{functional}} heterogeneity within human natural killer (NK) cells {{has been}} revealed through {{the characterization of}} distinct NK-cell subsets. Accordingly, a small subset of CD 56 +NKp 44 +NK cells, termed NK- 22 cells, was recently described within secondary lymphoid tissue (SLT) as IL- 22 − when resting, with a minor fraction of this population becoming IL- 22 + when activated. Here we discover {{that the vast majority}} of stage 3 immature NK (iNK) cells in SLT constitutively and selectively express IL- 22, a TH 17 cytokine important for mucosal immunity, whereas earlier and later stages of NK developmental intermediates do not express IL- 22. These iNK cells have a surface phenotype of CD 34 −CD 117 +CD 161 +CD 94 −, largely lack expression of NKp 44 and CD 56, and do not produce IFN-γ or possess cytolytic activity.

5000|$|Conner uses {{mechanical}} pencils with [...]03 lead {{because she}} finds {{it easier to}} use than regular pencils that require her to stop and sharpen them frequently. When working {{on one of her}} own projects, such as The Pro, she prefers to letter the art herself, before the <b>inking</b> <b>stage,</b> as she appreciates the handmade, organic look and feel of hand lettering, in contrast to the computer lettering with which most books are currently produced. To ink her own artwork, she uses Staedtler [...]03, [...]01 and [...]005 technical pen, and will sometimes use a Copic [...]005 for extremely fine work, as these implements feel better in her hands than crowquills and brushes. As her artwork is open and lacks much shading, Conner feels that Paul Mounts is a compatible colorist for her work, as he achieves [...] "the right amount of bounciness or moodiness, depending on what's needed." [...] Conner has stated that her favorite things to draw are facial expressions and body language.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{artist who}} does her work almost entirely {{digitally}} is Fiona Staples, who switched to that process several {{years prior to}} beginning her work on Saga, though her process for that series is different from previous ones, for which she characterizes it as [...] "one intense, ongoing experiment." [...] She begins with thumbnails, roughly drawn on printed paper templates. During this stage Staples does not use reference, but does so later in the <b>inking</b> <b>stage.</b> During the thumbnail stage, she gives copious thought to the layouts and staging, making it, in her words, {{the most important part}} of the process. After scanning the thumbnails, she enlarges them and uses them as rudimentary pencils, and [...] "inks" [...] over them in Manga Studio, and later colors the art in Photoshop. One of the advantages Staples sees in working digitally is the ability to dispense with tight pencils in favor of making corrections in an ad hoc manner, as she finds penciling in great detail and drawing such art a second time in ink to be boring.|$|R
50|$|Deadline {{pressures}} {{and a desire}} for consistency in {{the look of a}} feature led to having one artist pencil a feature while one or more other artists inked it. At Marvel Comics, where the pencil artist was responsible for the frame-by-frame breakdown of the story plot, an artist who was skilled in story-telling would be encouraged to do as many books as possible, maximizing the number of books he could do by leaving the inking to others. By contrast, at other companies where the writer did the frame-by-frame breakdown in script form, more artists inked or even lettered their own work. Joe Kubert and Jim Aparo would usually pencil, ink and letter, considering the placing of word balloons {{as an integral part of}} the page, and artists such as Bill Everett, Steve Ditko, Kurt Schaffenberger, and Nick Cardy almost always inked their own work (and sometimes the work of other pencilers as well). Most artists, however — even experienced inkers of their own work like Lou Fine, Reed Crandall, Will Eisner, and Alex Toth — at times hired or allowed other artists to ink their drawings. Some artists could make more money by pencilling more pages and leaving the inking to others; different artists with different working methods might find it more profitable to both pencil and ink, as they could place less information and detail in the pencil drawings if they were inking it themselves and could put that detail in at the <b>inking</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{main tasks}} of this thesis were to {{evaluate}} a number of amperometric enzyme electrode chemistries for the selective and sensitive detection of L-lactate, and apply mass fabrication technologies to reproducibly manufacture sensors in a controllable manner. The sensors studied {{were based on the}} use of lactate oxidase with a range of modified-carbon electrodes. Noble metals, hexacyanoferrate (111) or Prussian Blue were used to modify carbon electrodes for the electro-catalytic determination of hydrogen peroxide, the product of the reaction of lactate oxidase with L-lactate. Tetrathiafulvalene was employed as an artificial mediator between the enzyme and the electrode. Polypyrrole was tested as a means of immobilising lactate oxidase and to achieve direct charge transfer to the underlying carbon electrode. The characteristics of the sensor responses to hydrogen peroxide, L-lactate and ascorbate were compared, in relation to the electrochemical electrode area. From this investigation, it was confirmed that screen-printed electrodes were more reproducible to manufacture than hand-fabricated electrodes. For screen-printed rhodinised-carbon electrodes, an operating potential of + 400 mV (SCE) was selected. Interference from ascorbic acid and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide were deten-nined to be 26 gA. mM-' CM- 2 and 27 gA. mM-'. CM- 2, respectively. Screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with platinum, rhodium or palladium were selected for further investigation. Rhodium on carbon performed the best in ten-ns of sensitivity and selectivity at low potentials, and different formations of rhodium-carbon complexes were studied. Although rhodium electroplated onto carbon screen-printed electrodes was examined, printing inks made from a preformed powder of rhodium on carbon-graphite proved to be the preferred route of electrode fabrication. Screen printing, ink-jet printing and Cavro solution deposition were employed to fabricate the amperometric enzyme electrodes. These sensors were composed of rhodinised carbon and lactate oxidase in a water-based electrode ink with a protective outer membrane layer. Each <b>stage,</b> from <b>ink</b> preparation to membrane composition, was developed empirically. The sensitivity, stability and reproducibility of the working electrode was improved by altering it to a homogeneous ink, consisting of carbon graphite powder, rhodinised carbon powder (5 % Rh by weight), hydroxyethyl cellulose (2 % w/v) and lactate oxidase in the weight ratio of 2 : 8 : 18 : 1. A layer of cellulose acetate (2 % w/v in a 1 : 1 solution of acetone to cyclohexanone) and an outer coating of a polyurethane called Pellethane (I% to 4 % w/v in dimethyl formarnide and tetrahydrofuran) improved the selectivity, sensitivity and detection range of the sensor, allowing it to operate in physiological solutions with reduced passivation from protein adsorption. The sensor design was revised to allow its passage through a catheter and operation within a blood vessel; it was manufactured on flexible material using screen printing and Cavro solution deposition techniques. These miniature sensors, with a working surface of 0. 5 x 15 mm, were capable of linearly measuring lactate up to 3 mM in buffer solutions with an average sensitivity of 44. 8 nA. mM- 1 L- actate. To test the sensor operation in physiological solutions, a flow injection system was employed. A planar three-electrode card used in this system was manufactured using screen printing and Cavro solution deposition techniques. L-lactate concentrations up to 6. 4 mM were sensitively and, after minor correction, accurately determined in undiluted plasma and whole blood samples. This thesis has therefore made progress toward mass fabricating an amperometric enzyme electrode device suitable for the deten-nination of L-lactate concentrations in vitro...|$|R
