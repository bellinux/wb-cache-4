2500|$|The Bar Kokhba revolt greatly {{influenced}} {{the course of}} Jewish history and {{the philosophy of the}} Jewish religion. Despite easing the persecution of Jews following Hadrian's death in 138 CE, the Romans barred Jews from Jerusalem, except for attendance in Tisha B'Av. Jewish messianism was abstracted and spiritualized, and rabbinical political thought became deeply cautious and conservative. The Talmud, for instance, refers to Bar Kokhba as [...] "Ben-Kusiba," [...] a derogatory term used to indicate that he was a false Messiah. It was also among the key events to differentiate Christianity as a religion distinct from Judaism. Although Jewish Christians regarded Jesus as the Messiah and did not <b>support</b> <b>Bar</b> Kokhba, they were barred from Jerusalem along with the other Jews.|$|E

50|$|Model B {{was derived}} with as few {{technical}} changes {{as possible to}} keep cost low. Other than the engine, and badging on headlamp <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> (later: grille) and hub caps, it was virtually indistinguishable from the V-8. Its intention {{was to be a}} price leader, and as it offered more than the popular Model A, this should have been a winning formula. In fact, the new and only slightly more expensive V-8 stole the show, and finally made it obsolete. The V8 engine was previously exclusive to Lincoln products, which in 1932 switched to V12 engines only.|$|E

50|$|Self-cleaning {{screen media}} was {{initially}} engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The {{idea was to}} place crimped wires side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the <b>support</b> <b>bars</b> (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires {{to be free to}} vibrate between the <b>support</b> <b>bars,</b> preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over <b>support</b> <b>bars</b> with woven wire. In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires). One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron. During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires. In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the <b>support</b> <b>bars</b> with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the <b>support</b> <b>bars</b> but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook. Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver. They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be {{a direct result of the}} higher vibration frequency of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in hertz) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in RPM), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.|$|R
50|$|Up {{until this}} time a number of Christians were still part of the Jewish community. Although Jewish Christians hailed Jesus as the Messiah and did not <b>support</b> <b>Bar</b> Kokhba, they were barred from Jerusalem {{along with the rest}} of the Jews. Traditionally it is {{believed}} the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish-Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis. After the suppression of the revolt the vast majority of Jews were sent into exile; shortly thereafter (around 200), Judah haNasi edited together judgements and traditions into an authoritative code, the Mishna. This marks the transformation of Pharisaic Judaism into Rabbinic Judaism.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two track carriers of aluminum alloy. Each track support {{consists of}} two end portions and two intermediate portions. It is not a scissors bridge, it is transported in its entire length. The storage beam is mounted between the two tracking beams, which is connected to a hydraulic ram. The laying of the bridge is {{carried out by the}} hydraulically operated bar with which the whole bridge is moved over the guide frame (<b>support</b> <b>bar).</b> For laying, the storage beam is first extended and placed with the tip on the ground (thus, no support shield is necessary). Then the bridge is moved along the storage beam. After laying down the bridge, the storage beam is detached and is retracted.|$|E

50|$|Around 1910, binocularity {{was tested}} using trial frames which sat on the patient's face or on a <b>support</b> <b>bar,</b> with extra testing devices added {{to the front of}} the frames, such as Maddox rods, {{rotating}} prisms, and phorometers. The refraction part of the exam was done with trial lenses that fit into the back of the same trial frame. Optometer was the generic name for devices, crude and simple, with rotating batteries of sphere and cylinder lenses placed in front of each eye, one at a time, so there was no testing for binocularity. When the optometer and phorometer were combined into single instruments, the modern refractor/phoropter was born, which happened in the middle 1910s when two companies in the New York City area began to market competing versions.|$|E
50|$|To {{benefit the}} safety of the drivers, NASCAR {{improved}} the roll cage that surrounds the driver after a large amount testing in the NASCAR Research and Development Center.

NASCAR later released cosmetic changes to the 2013 car, including the driver's last name on the windshield, the sponsor's logo placed on the roof, the team logo being moved from the headlights to the front bumper, and the reduction in size of contingency decals and car numbers due to the smaller size of the car. During the Autoweek's Racing Conference in Detroit, Michigan, NASCAR announced that the manufacturer logos will be placed on either side of the drivers' name to increase manufacturer identity.|$|E
50|$|G. George Fox {{argues that}} the hostile utterances of rabbis were towards those Christians who did not <b>support</b> <b>Bar</b> Kokhba and was due to anti-Jewish {{feelings}} which were caused by Gentile converts to Christianity. This however is controversial as only certain segments of the community ever accepted Bar Kokhba as the Messiah, while many Rabbis scorned such a proposition. Fox also {{argues that the}} persecution accusations and stories of early Christians matrydom are exaggerated by the Church. He asserts that it is unhistorical {{to assume that the}} matrydom of Stephen was representative of a widespread persecution of Christians because events of this nature weren't uncommon in that time. In support of this assertion, Fox argues that thousands of Jews were killed by Romans and it wasn't something new or novel. Thus the persecution hardly started before 70 A.D. and when it was started by Bar Kokhba, it wasn't not on purely theological grounds but also because of the disloyalty of Christians in the rebellion against the Romans.|$|E

50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Ravens {{took the lead}} with RB Willis McGahee getting a 2-yard TD run. However, the Browns responded as QB Derek Anderson (another former Raven) got a 1-yard TD run, while Safety Brodney Pool {{returned}} an interception 100 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore began to come back as kicker Matt Stover made 34-yard and 41-yard field goals, while QB Kyle Boller completed a 27-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling (his first career touchdown reception). Afterwards, Stover helped the Ravens retake the lead with a 47-yard field goal. Cleveland got into field goal range. Initially, Dawson's 51-yard attempt was ruled no good. However, {{it turned out that}} the ball bounced off the upright, then bounced off the <b>support</b> <b>bar,</b> and then went back into play. In the end, the Browns were awarded the field goal. In overtime, Cleveland sealed the win as Dawson made the game-winning 33-yard field goal.|$|E
5000|$|This {{commercial}} export {{version of}} the WASR is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO (which can also safely fire the [...]223 Remington round). It usually comes in the same configuration as the WASR-2. These have known problems with jamming or failure to feed. This {{may be due to}} low quality magazines, or their followers. The WASR-3 was originally supplied with surplus 5.45×39mm AK-74 magazines, which do not reliably feed the 5.56/.223 cartridge. People have used Wieger magazines with some success. Century Arms eventually began including Romanian copies of the reliable Wieger magazine with these rifles. Some switch the follower of an AK-74 magazine with one from Robinson arms. Israeli Galil steel magazines are also known to work without modification in the WASR-3. Some owners have also modified the rifle to accept Bulgarian Circle-10 5.56 magazines, or Polish Beryl 5.56 magazines. These sometimes require some material to be removed from the receiver center <b>support</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
50|$|At Mosul, Bar Wahbun and Bar Masih unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to convince John IV Sarugoyo, Maphrian of the East, to <b>support</b> <b>Bar</b> Wahbun, and subsequently travelled throughout Upper Mesopotamia until their capture at Dara.

Bar Wahbun and Bar Masih escaped from the monastery and Bar Masih travelled to Tagrit, aiming to usurp the maphrianate. The death of John IV in 1189 left the seat of maphrian vacant, and Bar Masih gained the support of Muhyi al-Din, a Muslim judge of Mosul responsible for collecting tribute from local monasteries, such as the Monastery of Mar Mattai, and key adviser to the governor of Mosul. He also levied the support of the archimandrite, several monks of the Monastery of Mar Mattai, Ignatius Gabriel Yuhanna bar Hindi, Bishop of Urmia, Yuhanna Ruwad Marqia, Bishop of Ba’arbaya, Saliba, Bishop of the Monastery of Mar Mattai, and Basilius Matta bar Shuwayk, bishop of Baghdad.|$|E
