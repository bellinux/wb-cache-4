Most of those companies are still being active, integrated into the new conglomerate.|$|E

In a poll to compile the list of the club's Greatest Ever Players, O'Leary was voted 14th. O'Leary assumes the role of a club ambassador for Arsenal.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was founded}} in Sparks, Nevada under the name [...] "Sub Shop" [...] in 1972 by two {{brothers}} from New Jersey. John Larsen, a Public Accountant who had been advising the brothers, purchased the company in 1975 and renamed it Port of <b>Subs</b> after <b>holding</b> a community-wide contest for its new name. Between 1975 and 1985, ten more shops were established before Port of Subs became a franchise. The shop currently has more than 140 locations throughout the western United States. It {{can be found in}} Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming.|$|R
5000|$|Sub-units, that is, company, {{squadron}} and battery, and formations (brigades, divisions, {{corps and}} armies) {{do not have}} a commanding officer. The officer in command of a <b>sub</b> unit <b>holds</b> the appointment [...] "officer commanding" [...] or [...] "OC". Higher formations have commanders or a General Officer Commanding (GOC). Area commands have a Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C Land Army; C-in-C British Army of the Rhine)The OC of a sub-unit is customarily a major, though again the rank of the appointment holder and the holder's appointment are separate and independent of each other.|$|R
5000|$|Seaquest is an {{underwater}} shooter {{in which the}} player controls a submarine. Enemies include sharks and submarines. The player must ward off the enemies while trying to rescue divers swimming through the water. The <b>sub</b> can <b>hold</b> up to eight divers at a time. Each time the player resurfaces, all rescued divers are emptied out in exchange for points. To add to the challenge, the submarine has {{a limited amount of}} oxygen. The player must surface often in order to replenish the oxygen, but if the player resurfaces without any rescued divers, they will lose a life. If the player resurfaces with the maximum amount of divers, they will gain bonus points for the sub's remaining oxygen. Each time the player surfaces, the game's difficulty increases; enemies increase in number and speed. Eventually an enemy sub begins patrolling the surface, leaving the player without a safe haven.|$|R
50|$|After Tuiwai's {{descendants}} {{had been}} subdued, Tui Devo then notified the chiefly delegation of Tuinaosara (who {{had been waiting}} at Moala with his relatives) {{to make their way}} to Nayau. Tuinaosara arrived at Nayau with his wife Adi Gelegeleavanua (daughter of Daunisai), they had two sons Buivaroro and Kalouyalewa, and subsequently a daughter Adi Keletu. The group entered Nayau from the western side where the village of Liku is today. The group eventually sailed around to the north eastern side of the island and resided at the highest mountain on the island called Delainayau (later called Delaiwawa today). They resided together with a share of Tuiwai's descendants who had inhabited that side of the island, and their Yavusa is called Maumi and their village called Narocivo today. There are three sub groups or mataqali within the Yavusa Maumi today: (1) Butonivanua - the clan of Delaiwawa within this <b>sub</b> group <b>holds</b> the chiefly title of Tui Naro (2) Vuinayau - this clan is where the Vaka ni Nayau originates from (3) Wailoli.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete {{solution to the}} H 2 and H ∞ problems for sampled-data systems. As opposed to previous work in the area, it is assumed here that all {{or some of the}} sampling function, the discrete-time controller and the hold function are available for design. The solution is obtained by transforming the problem to discrete-time using the wellknown lifting technique. It is then shown that the desired components of the sampled-data controller can be “peeled-off ” from the inherently infinite dimensional description in the lifted-domain. The procedure for doing this last step is central to the approach in the paper. Both new and revised solutions are presented in the paper. The solution to the H 2 problems is completely new. The solution to the H ∞ problems is presented in a unifying framework, and is more transparent than the previous existing in the literature. Transparency pays in the form of clearer results. In particular, a separation structure is established between the design of (<b>sub)</b> optimal <b>hold</b> and sampler. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{interstellar}} medium (ISM) {{is a key}} ingredient in galaxy formation and evolution as it provides the molecular gas reservoir which fuels star formation and supermassive black hole accretion. Yet the ISM {{is one of the}} least studied aspects of distant galaxies. Molecular and atomic transitions at (<b>sub)</b> millimetre wavelengths <b>hold</b> great promise in measuring macroscopic properties (e. g. masses, morphologies, star formation laws), as well as microscopic properties (e. g. gas densities, temperatures, cooling) of high-z galaxies. In this overview I summarize the growing number of high-z molecular line detections, highlighting some of the most intriguing results along the way. I end by discussing a few areas where future facilities (e. g. ALMA, EVLA, CCAT, LMT) will drastically improve on the current state of affairs. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{wireless}} networking {{optical communication}} is an emerging field. Another novel approach of optical communication using Narrow Line of Sight technique is discussed. Array of trans receivers {{are placed on}} the ceiling {{to communicate with the}} mobile nodes (users / trans receivers) instead of a single transmitter. An intelligent position tracking technique based on the informations available from prepositioned sensors and using them in simple geometric equations is described. Intelligent cell concept is used to facilitate the tracking system. The whole wide area is divided into several sub areas and some of the sub areas are designated as boundary <b>sub</b> areas which <b>hold</b> the data regarding the movement of the mobile nodes. The Diffie Hellman simple authenticated key agreement is used for secure communication...|$|R
