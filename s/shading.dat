5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of <b>shading</b> are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of <b>shading</b> is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner <b>shading.</b> Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E

5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. <b>Shading</b> is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of <b>shading</b> as a depth cue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Scattered UV {{radiation}} is present underneath <b>shade</b> structures due to scattering by {{the atmosphere and}} surroundings. Therefore, the side openings of a <b>shade</b> structure have a direct influence on where the <b>shade</b> is located {{and the level of}} scattered UV in the <b>shaded</b> area. UV exposures were assessed for the decrease in scattered UV beneath specific <b>shade</b> structures as a result of using two types of side on protection, namely, polycarbonate sheeting and vegetation. Anatomical facial dosimetry measurements conducted in the <b>shade</b> of a scale model <b>shade</b> structure during summer and winter showed significant decreases in UV exposure for summer and for winter when polycarbonate sheeting was added to specific sides of the <b>shade</b> structure. Broadband field measurements conducted in the <b>shade</b> of four <b>shade</b> structures with various amounts of vegetation covering different sides, showed that the positioning of vegetation for side-on protection is vital for decreasing the scattered UV in the <b>shade.</b> Adding suitable vegetation and or polycarbonate sheeting to specific sides of <b>shade</b> structures can significantly reduce scattered UV in the <b>shade</b> compared to <b>shade</b> structures that do not utilise any side-on protection. However, side on protection is of little use if the positioning of the <b>shade</b> structure itself is inadequate. The positioning of the <b>shade</b> structure in respect to full sun activities is of key importance particularly where these activities involve infants and children...|$|R
5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from <b>shading.</b> Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer <b>shading</b> and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer <b>shading</b> without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E

5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming).

40|$|There are no {{previous}} studies validating the accuracy and repeatability of ClearMatch photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the <b>shade</b> matches performed by a photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system (ClearMatch) with conventional visual <b>shade</b> matching method under simulated clinical conditions. Three <b>shade</b> matching methods were used to match twelve <b>shade</b> tabs under simulated clinical conditions using a Vita Classical <b>shade</b> guide: conventional visual <b>shade</b> matching using 3 human raters (VM – Visual method), photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system (CM - ClearMatch) using two different ways of normalizing the image (CM-A 2 and CM-ref respectively). <b>Shade</b> matching for all methods was completed at two separate sessions. The Kappa statistic was used to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater agreement. CIELAB values of the <b>shade</b> results were used to produce scatter plots as well as to calculate the color difference (delta E) between VM and CM groups. There was no inter-rater agreement between VM and CM-A 2 (k= 0. 000 and k= 0. 015 for the first and second sessions respectively) while VM and CM-ref showed weak agreement (k= 0. 244 and k= 0. 091 respectively). Intra-rater agreement was strong in all groups VM, CM-A 2 and CM-ref (0. 705, 0. 803 and 0. 681 respectively). CM-A 2 had 2 (8. 3 %) <b>shade</b> matches with a delta E of less than 2. 6 (clinically imperceptible), while CM-ref had 12 (50. 0 %) imperceptible matches. CM-A 2 had an additional 16 (66. 6 %) <b>shade</b> matches with delta E of less than 5. 5 (clinically acceptable), while CM-ref had 23 (95. 8 %) additional acceptable matches. There was poor agreement in exact <b>shade</b> matches between conventional visual <b>shade</b> matching method and the photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system. The repeatability of the photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system was shown to be comparable to conventional visual <b>shade</b> matching. Using conventional <b>shade</b> matching as the gold standard, the capability of this photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system to accurately <b>shade</b> match has not been achieved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shade</b> {{trees are}} {{significant}} in certification scheme of sustainable coffee production. They play an importance role on ecosystem functioning. This research is aimed to study ecosystem service of <b>shade</b> trees in some coffee agro-ecosystems particularly on nutrient cycling and land productivity. Four agro-ecosys tems of Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora), namely sun coffee (without <b>shade</b> trees), coffee <b>shaded</b> by Michelia champaca, coffee <b>shaded</b> by Gliricidia sepium, and coffee <b>shaded</b> by Erythrina indica are evaluated during 2007 — 2008. Smallholder coffee plantation in Sumberjaya Subdistrict, West Lampung, which managed under local standard were employed using Randomized Complete Block Design with 3 replications. The result showed that litter fall dynamic from <b>shade</b> trees and from coffee trees {{was influenced by}} rainfall. <b>Shade</b> trees decreased weed biomass while increased litter fall production. In dry season, <b>shade</b> trees decreased litter fall from coffee <b>shaded</b> by M. champaca. G. sepium and E. indica <b>shaded</b> coffee showed higher yield than sun coffee and M. champaca <b>shaded</b> coffee. Except for M. champaca <b>shaded</b> coffee, yield had positive correlation (r = 0. 99) with litter fall production and had negative correlation (r = — 0. 82) with weed biomass production. Biomass production (litter fall + weed) of sun coffee and <b>shaded</b> coffee was not significantly different. Litter fall of <b>shade</b> trees had significance on nutrient cycle mainly to balance the lost of nitrogen in coffee bean harvesting.
