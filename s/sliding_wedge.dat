25|$|Since {{it weighs}} only 400 pounds {{more than the}} Model 41 cavalry gun, it is {{possible}} that the Model 95 may have been intended to replace that weapon. However, its use on Saipan and its close resemblance to the heavier Model 90 may indicate that the latter weapon was too heavy for efficient horse-draft, and too complex for the capabilities of Japanese industry. Though the Model 95 was split-trailed, it actually weighed less than the improved Model 38 75mm gun. The Model 95 was much lighter than its Schneider prototype, and had a <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> rather than an interrupted thread breechblock. It incorporated all features of modern Japanese design.|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 47mm AT gun was a {{relative}} modern design {{compared to other}} Japanese Second World war designs, being relatively light and easy to handle. As with many Japanese designs, it had a very low profile and {{was intended to be}} operated from a kneeling or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner. The carriage appears to have adopted a number of design features from the Soviet ZIK 45 mm anti-tank gun, a number of examples of which were captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in 1939. It used a semi-automatic breech block with a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge.</b> When the gun was fired the spent shell casing was automatically ejected, and upon loading a fresh shell, the breech block closed automatically. A hydrospring recoil mechanism was housed under the barrel. The weapon had a split trail which opened to an angle of 60 degrees for firing to improve stability. Transport was by towing behind a truck or horse, via two steel disc wheels fitted with sponge rubber filled tires.|$|E

The tension on the <b>slide</b> <b>wedge</b> components can be invalidated with little delay, and is adjustable. The wedge pressure plate may have one or more wedge surfaces with a wedge angle corresponding to that of the <b>slide</b> <b>wedge</b> components.

The main battery was supplied with between 940–960 shells total, for approximately 115–120 shells per gun. As with other German large-calibre naval rifles, these guns were designed by Krupp and featured <b>sliding</b> <b>wedge</b> breech blocks, which required brass cartridge cases for the propellant charges. Under optimal conditions, the rate of fire was one shot every 18 seconds, or three per minute. The gun turrets were electrically trained and the guns were hydraulically elevated. Gun elevation was controlled remotely. The turrets required each gun to return to 2.5° elevation for loading. Tirpitz was eventually provided with time-fuzed shells to combat the repeated Allied bombing attacks.|$|E

50|$|The failure {{mechanisms}} are divided in orientation dependent and orientation independent. Orientation dependent {{failure mechanisms}} {{depend on the}} orientation of the slope with respect to {{the orientation of the}} discontinuities in the rock mass, i.e. <b>sliding</b> (plane and <b>wedge</b> <b>sliding)</b> and toppling failure. Orientation independent relates to the possibility that a slope fails independently from its orientation, e.g. circular failure completely through newly formed discontinuities in intact rock blocks, or failing partially following existing discontinuities and partially new discontinuities.|$|R
40|$|A {{tetrahedral}} {{wedge of}} rock can slide {{on one or}} both of the bounding discontinuity surfaces. The test to identify these two mechanisms is usually performed on a stereograph based on the orientation of the two discontinuities, their line of intersection and the slope face. An alternative stereographic method involves identifying the great circle, known as a π-circle, linking the discontinuity poles and comparing this plane with the slope face orientation. A kinematically feasible wedge is double plane sliding unless the following two criteria are met. 1) One of the poles is within the daylight envelope for the slope face and 2) that pole lies between the dip direction of the π-circle and the direction opposite to the slope direction of the excavation face. These criteria are readily observable on a stereograph. The boundaries for poles capable of forming single and double plane <b>sliding</b> <b>wedges</b> in combination with another pole can be marked as zones on the stereograph...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{assessment}} of the potential <b>sliding</b> of <b>wedge</b> blocks involves identification of the lines of intersection of the two planes on a stereograph. The stereographic envelope for kinematically feasible wedge intersections exists between {{the plane of the}} slope face and a friction circle. An alternative method of stereographic analysis is presented involving fitting great circles to a pair of poles representing the planes of the wedge. If the great circle passes through the polar daylight envelope for the slope face,without passing through the friction circle,wedge sliding on the pair of discontinuities is kinematically feasible. Thismethod is advantageous as 1) the distribution of discontinuity poles on a stereograph can be interpreted directly without showing the individual planes as great circles, 2) only pairs of discontinuities from opposing orientations are included, 3) geometric attributes of the potential wedges, such as symmetry and shape, can be assessed directly on the stereograph and 4) reduction of data to sets is not required prior to kinematic assessment...|$|R

40|$|Triggering {{mechanisms}} and rainfall threshold of shallow landslides were discussed based on field and laboratory surveys for the disaster by heavy rainfall on 20 Aug 2014 at Hiroshima, southwest Japan. Shallow landslides occurred {{in areas of}} maximum 3 h-rainfall > 160 mm/ 3 h with hourly rainfall intensity > 70 mm/h. Hillslopes with bedrock of granite and hornfels slid severely, while areas underlain by rhyolite suffered only sparse landsliding. Three types of landslide were identified in field observation: 1) planer translational landslide, 2) gash-out failure, and 3) <b>wedge</b> <b>sliding.</b> Lithological and subsurface structural factors seem to affect the occurrence of these different types of landslide. Majority of landslides in granite hillslopes and about half in hornfels were planer translational landslides. This type forms a sliding surface within soil layer along mechanical or hydraulic discontinuity {{at a depth of}} ~ 1 m. Other half of landslides in hornfels area was gash-out failure with scars of 1 – 3 m deep, outcropping an openwork gravel layer at the bottom. Water supply exceeding drainage capacity of this conduit may generate excess pore-water pressure, leading to fluidization of overburden. <b>Wedge</b> <b>sliding</b> was a minor type, with a shallow gullying of soil or a deeper slip surface in bedrock (~ 5 m), occurring along geologic discontinuity such as joints, faults and dykes. Prediction of potential sites, timings, and magnitude of such landslides requires detailed investigations of thickness and mechanical strength of potential sliding material, observation and modeling of subsurface hydrological processes...|$|R

40|$|Materials with {{negative}} Poisson's ratios (auxetic) exhibit the very unusual property of becoming wider when stretched and narrower when squashed. This thesis presents a global classification system for auxetics {{based on the}} geometry and deformation mechanisms. Analytical expressions for the mechanical properties of several new two and three dimensional auxetic structures are derived. These structures involve rotating polygons, chiral units, re-entrant units, <b>sliding</b> <b>wedges</b> and helices. It is observed that the auxetic behaviour is scale independent and hence the structures may be implemented at either the macro, micro or nano level. These auxetic structures are used to explain the negative Poisson's ratios {{in a number of}} auxetic materials. A chiral structure is used to model auxetic polyurethane foams having broken ribs. A three dimensional re-entrant hinging/stretching structure is used to model auxetic ex-PTFE. Both models offer significant improvements when compared to previous work. Auxetic structures are also used as models for designing novel nanostructural molecular auxetics. In most cases, the auxeticity of these materials is confirmed through detailed molecular modelling. For example, crystalline molecular polyphenylacetylene networks based on the 'rotating triangles structure' are predicted to exhibit Poisson's ratios as low as - 1, in accordance with their analytical models. These molecular networks are particularly interesting as they have all the six on-axis Poisson's ratios being concurrently negative. Their polycrystalline aggregates are also likely to be auxetic. The actual values of the mechanical properties are found to be dependent on the details of the molecular formulae (e. g. predicted single crystalline + 0. 25 >V_z_y>- 0. 97, 250 GPa>E_z> 2. 4 GPa). Some of these specific properties may be explained through the analytical models and offer the possibility of being able to design materials with tailor-made mechanical properties. Molecular systems based on other auxetic structures are also found to exhibit similar properties. A systematic study on zeolites also shows that several examples exhibit auxetic behaviour and in most cases, their auxeticity may be explained via the analytical models. For example, negative Poisson's ratios are predicted for THO, NAT, EDI, APD and ATT, five zeolites whose nanostructure may be described in terms of 'rotating squares' model. The auxetic behaviour in #alpha#-cristobalite was also explained through this model.
