50|$|Although The Co-operative Group {{incorporates}} the original Rochdale Society, the business' core {{for much of}} its history were its wholesale operations.

By 1872, it {{was known as the}} 'Co-operative Wholesale Society' (CWS) and it was wholly owned by the co-operatives which traded with it. The CWS grew rapidly and supplied produce to co-operative stores across England, though many co-ops only sourced around a third of their produce through the CWS. It was this continued and fierce competition with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established <b>significant</b> <b>branches</b> in Leeds, Blackburn, Bristol, Nottingham and Huddersfield alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits (Manchester), Boots (Leicester), Soap (Durham) and textiles (Batley). In an attempt to drive down the significant cost of transportation for produce the CWS even began its own shipping line which initially sailed from Goole docks to parts of continental Europe. One of the CWS' steamships, the Pioneer, was the first commercial vessel to use the Manchester Ship Canal. This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of World War One the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a tea plantation in India.|$|E

50|$|By 1860 {{there were}} more than 200 co-ops in the north west of England which were running in a similar manner to the Rochdale society. Private shopkeepers became resentful of the {{competition}} which they were experiencing from these new co-operative stores, often as they saw the dividend as an unfair competitive advantage, and so some powerful shopkeepers lobbied for wholesalers to stop supplying these new co-operative societies. Though few such boycotts actually occurred, this threat worried many people in the co-operative movement and so they endeavoured to create a co-operative wholesaler to supply at least some key products to co-operative stores. The North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited, later renamed the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) was launched in Manchester by 300 individual co-operatives in Yorkshire and Lancashire during 1863. The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society was founded in 1868.

40|$|Excerpt] Confronted by declining {{membership}} and market share {{as well as}} an erosion of bargaining strength and political influence, a sense of crisis now pervades many international unions. Some labor unions continue to adhere to programs and practices they have pursued for several decades. But others, faced with challenges so fundamental that their viability is at stake, have chosen to reexamine their basic policies and performance and to reorient their essential course. This paper evaluates the experience of four such international unions, all of which have recently embarked on strategic planning initiatives. Three of the unions – the Electrical Workers (IBEW), Carpenters (UBC), and Painters (IBPAT) – operate primarily in the private sector, representing workers in the construction industry but serving <b>significant</b> <b>branches</b> in other industrial sectors as well. The fourth is a large public –sector union, the Government Employees (AFGE). The membership rolls range from about 100, 000 members to more than 700, 000 members...|$|E

30|$|Sustainable {{governance}} lies at {{the very}} heart of the concept of sustainability. The earliest conceptual developments have embedded the responsibility of humans to regulate within limits into sustainability understanding; therefore, they have repeatedly highlighted the need for better governance. In addition to explicit discussions on sustainable governance (Adger and Jordan 2009; Jäger 2009), there are also other <b>significant</b> <b>branches</b> such as global governance (Lövbrand et al. 2009), governing commons (Ostrom 1990, 2007, 2010), adaptive governance (Folke et al. 2005), and reflexive and path-dependent governance (Voß and Kemp 2006; Leach et al. 2010). These address different means of conduct within identified limitations highlighting varieties of formal laws, and social, economic, and political practices with varieties of frameworks. Especially in a dynamic context where past, present, and future are important considerations, rules and regulation support concrete envisions of possible future solution spaces (Wiek and Binder 2005) at decision points. Depending on the existing policy and governing structures, these solution spaces would be envisioned differently in different contexts and mobilize different sustainability or unsustainability paths.|$|E

Comparison of intein sequences suggests that, in general, (i) inteins present in the same location within extein homologs from different organisms are very closely related to each other in paired sequence comparison or phylogenetic analysis and we suggest that they should be considered intein alleles; (ii) multiple inteins present in the same gene are no more similar to each other than to inteins present in different genes; (iii) phylogenetic analysis indicates that inteins are so divergent that trees with statistically <b>significant</b> <b>branches</b> cannot be generated except for intein alleles...|$|E
