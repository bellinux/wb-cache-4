25|$|The {{history of}} Jägermeister starts in 1878 with Wilhelm Mast, {{who was a}} vinegar {{manufacturer}} and wine trader {{in the city of}} Wolfenbüttel, Germany. His son, Curt Mast, born in 1897, was passionate about the production of <b>spirits</b> <b>and</b> <b>liqueurs,</b> always keen to help his father in the business even at an early age. When he was 37 years old, after he successfully took over his father's business, Curt Mast finally came up with the perfect recipe for his new herbal liqueur, which he called Jägermeister, in 1934.|$|E
2500|$|Often rules {{apply to}} all goods neutrally, but may have a greater {{practical}} effect on imports than domestic products. For such [...] "indirect" [...] discriminatory (or [...] "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional [...] "mandatory" [...] or [...] "overriding" [...] requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all <b>spirits</b> <b>and</b> <b>liqueurs</b> (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter {{if it was not}} cube shaped was disproportionate: it would [...] "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" [...] and labelling would protect consumers [...] "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as [...] "chocolate". It had to be [...] "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a [...] "chocolate substitute" [...] label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A 'neutral and objective statement' was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have [...] "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" [...] that [...] "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} {{in the production of}} <b>spirit</b> drinks <b>and</b> using them in the human diet, especially in the Southeast European and Mediterranean regions. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether <b>and</b> which <b>spirits</b> can serve, <b>and</b> to what extent, as a source of biologically active compounds in the human diet. Polyphenolic compounds are biologically active compounds of fruits, vegetables and derived beverages, which have been implicated in their antioxidant activity. Therefore, the total polyphenol content (TPC) and antioxidative properties of 46 <b>spirit</b> drinks <b>and</b> <b>liqueurs</b> produced in Croatia were examined. The total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity were estimated using spectrophotometric methods (Folin-Ciocalteu, DPPH and FRAP), while certain phenols were detected by the HPLC. It was established that spirit drinks aged in wooden casks, such as wine or plum brandy, contain polyphenols ranging from 40 - 90 mg GAE/L (gallic acid equivalents), whereas walnut or sour cherry liquors contain much more polyphenols ranging from 680 - 3360 mg GAE/L. The antioxidant activity of analyzed spirit drinks was in correlation with TPC. Walnut <b>and</b> sour cherry <b>liqueur</b> samples had very high antioxidant activity, within the range of those obtained with 1. 26 mM Trolox-DPPH assay and 9. 5 mM Trolox-FRAP assay...|$|R

30|$|The {{influence}} of sample volume may derive {{from a larger}} volume error at smaller volumes, rather than problems in the distillation itself. It is suggested to use volumes of more than 10  mL. This confirms our previous results on egg liqueur, which showed inacceptable precision if only 5 or 10  g of sample were used (Lachenmeier et al. 2005). While we found no significant differences for a volume of 200  mL, we believe that such high volumes should not be used, because especially for <b>spirits</b> <b>and</b> <b>liqueurs</b> with higher alcoholic strengths, the distillation time may {{not be sufficient to}} recover the complete amount of alcohol. For the same reason, we suggest to use a larger receiver volume than the original sample volume. The error increase due to dilution appears to be compensated by the more complete distillation.|$|E

There were {{significant differences in the}} mean concentrations of the majority of phenolic compounds among the samples. Gallic and benzoic acids were the most abundant and samples aged in Q. robur from Galicia (NW of Spain) had the highest concentration of most of the determined phenols. Grape marc distillates aged in Q. robur obtained the highest values of all sensorial attributes, whereas samples aged in Q. petraea and Q. alba obtained similar scores. Principal component analysis accounted for 88. 32 % of total variance, showing a good separation of aged distillates in terms of phenolic compounds and colour characteristics, according to the species and origin of the oak wood used in the ageing process.
