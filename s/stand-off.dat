5|$|A {{proposed}} {{variant of}} the B-52H was the EB-52H, which would have consisted of 16 modified and augmented B-52H airframes with additional electronic jamming capabilities. This variant would have restored USAF airborne jamming capability that it lost on retiring the EF-111 Raven. The program was canceled in 2005 following the removal of funds for the <b>stand-off</b> jammer. The program was revived in 2007, and cut again in early 2009.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Jurchens the Song dynasty was for centuries engaged in a <b>stand-off</b> against the Western Xia and the Khitan Liao dynasty. This balance was {{disrupted}} when the Song dynasty developed a military alliance with the Jurchens for the purpose of annihilating the Liao. This balance of power disrupted, the Jurchens then turned on the Song, resulting in the fall of the Northern Song and the subsequent establishment of the Southern Song.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{play-off}} loss to St. Helens, Noble {{announced his}} {{departure from the}} club after not being offered a new contract, and five days later Michael Maguire was revealed as the new head coach of Wigan. In Maguire's 2010 squad, Tomkins' position as Wigan's first choice <b>stand-off</b> was confirmed when he received the number 6 jersey from the departed Smith. The club also signed Wigan-born Paul Deacon during the pre-season, {{with the intention of}} having him mentor Tomkins in an assistant coaching role.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008 World Cup, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, England's {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a 32–22 loss to New Zealand at the semi-final stage. England responded to their exit from the tournament by replacing a number of veterans with younger players for the 2009 Four Nations. Tomkins, who was then playing at <b>stand-off</b> for Wigan, was included in a new-look squad which featured {{a quarter of its}} players aged 21 or below.|$|E
5|$|Over 34 total appearances, Tomkins {{improved}} on his 2009 {{record with}} 21 tries and four goals. In the league, he claimed four braces in total: once as a <b>stand-off</b> against Hull, {{and three times}} as a fullback against Salford, Hull again and Leeds. He also scored a try during the Grand Final against St. Helens. Despite finishing the season as Wigan's regular fullback, Tomkins maintained {{his place in the}} 2010 Super League Dream Team in the <b>stand-off</b> position. Also in the team was Joel Tomkins at second-row. This was the first time a Super League Dream Team had featured two brothers. At 2010's Super League XV awards evening, where his Wigan teammate Pat Richards was voted by his fellow Super League players as Man of Steel for having the biggest impact on the season, Tomkins retained his Young Player of the Year title. He also received 2010's Albert Goldthorpe Medal for 'best and fairest' player of the season. He was also named Rookie of the Year by the Rugby League International Federation during the 2010 Four Nations, in which he played for England.|$|E

5|$|Those B-52Gs not {{converted}} as {{cruise missile}} carriers underwent {{a series of}} modifications to improve conventional bombing. They were fitted with a new Integrated Conventional Stores Management System (ICSMS) and new underwing pylons that could hold larger bombs or other stores than could the external pylons. Thirty B-52Gs were further modified to carry up to 12 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles each, while 12 B-52Gs were fitted to carry the AGM-142 Have Nap <b>stand-off</b> air-to-ground missile. When the B-52G was retired in 1994, an urgent scheme was launched to restore an interim Harpoon and Have Nap capability, the four aircraft being modified to carry Harpoon and four to carry Have Nap under the Rapid Eight program.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} {{ammunition}} {{could be used}} for different purposes: plain spherical shot of stone or iron smashed hulls, spiked bar shot and shot linked with chains would tear sails or damage rigging, and canister shot packed with sharp flints produced a devastating shotgun effect. Trials made with replicas of culverins and port pieces showed that they could penetrate wood the same thickness of the Mary Rose's hull planking, indicating a <b>stand-off</b> range of at least 90m (295ft). The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating anti-personnel weapon when loaded with flakes or pebbles.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the federal}} {{government}} ordered the Yugoslav People's Army to secure border crossings in Slovenia.

40|$|The {{design of}} the 300 mK system for Herschel-SPIRE is complex, with many difficult, {{sometimes}} conflicting, requirements and constraints placed upon it. Five detector arrays, mounted from a 2 K box, are linked to a single 3 He sorption-cooler tip by a high-conductance copper strap network. This strap retains high thermal conductance, even though it incorporates an electrical break {{to comply with the}} SPIRE grounding scheme. It requires stiffness to withstand launch vibrations, but needs compliance to avoid transmission of loads to the detector arrays. The strap is stiffly supported by novel, compact cryogenic <b>stand-offs</b> which provide a high degree of thermal isolation from the 2 K stage. An additional complication is that the detectors reside in a 2 K environment, whilst the cooler tip is in a 4 K environment. Two of the cryogenic <b>stand-offs</b> also act as light-tight feed-throughs to pass the strap from the 4 K environment {{to the inside of the}} 2 K detector boxes. Active thermal control is provided on the 300 mK system to address the detector stability requirements. This paper describes the system, and gives results of the performance in SPIRE flight model ground tests...|$|R
