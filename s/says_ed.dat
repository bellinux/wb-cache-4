40|$|Background: Overcrowding in the {{emergency}} department (ED) is an increasing problem worldwide. In The Netherlands overcrowding {{is not a major}} issue, although some urban hospitals struggle with increased throughput. In 2004, Weiss et al. created the NEDOCS tool (National Emergency Department Over Crowding Study), a web-based instrument to measure objective overcrowding with scores between 0 (not busy at all) to above 181 (disaster). In this study we tried to validate the accuracy of the NEDOCS tool by comparing this with the subjective feelings of the ED nurse and emergency physician (EP) in an inner city hospital in The Netherlands. Methods: In a 4 -week period, data of a total of 147 time samplings were collected. The subjective feelings of being overcrowded and feeling rushed by the ED nurse and EP were scored on a survey using a 6 -point Likert scale on answering the question of how busy they would <b>say</b> the <b>ED</b> is right now. NEDOCS tool scores were calculated, and these were compared with the subjective feelings using the kappa statistic assessing linear weights according to Cohen’s method. Results: Of all the time samplings, approximately 80 % of the surveys were completed. The ED was rated as overcrowded 9 % of the time by the ED nurses and 11 % of the time by the EPs. The median NEDOCS score was 37 (0 to 120) and scored as overcrowded in 3 %. There was a good intrarater agreement for the ED nurse and EP fo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Spectrum sensing {{performance}} of a cognitive radio (CR) deploying the traditional energy detector (ED) degrades {{in the presence of}} random network interference where both the number and locations of the interferers are random, thus preventing correct detection of primary user (PU) in the band of interest. However, {{it is not clear how}} the ED performance in such random network interference can be improved. Moreover, the previous studies do not consider complete modeling of the wireless environment including the cumulative effects of path-loss, fading and random network interference. We thus take these effects into account and investigate the {{performance of}} the p-norm detector, which offers the flexibility of adapting p to the operating conditions (as against fixed p = 2 for ED). Such adaptability yields remarkable performance gains over <b>ED</b> (<b>say,</b> 15 % gain even at 10 dB lower (than that for ED) PU signal powers). Further, cooperative spectrum sensing with multiple CRs yields additional performance gains (say, 30 % better performance at optimal cooperative detection threshold) compared to single CR based sensing even under the cumulative effects of path-loss, fading and random network interference. Index Terms—Spectrum sensing, cognitive radio, energy de-tector, p-norm detector, multipath-fading, shadowing, random network interference. I...|$|R

[...] According to the letter which Moore published (Life, p. 178), and which is reprinted in the present issue (Letters, 1898, ii. 257), Byron interposed on behalf of a girl, who [...] "in compliance with the strict letter of the Mohammedan law," [...] had been sewn in a sack and was about to be thrown into the sea. [...] "I was told," [...] adds Lord Sligo, [...] "that you then conveyed her in safety to the convent, and despatched her off at night to Thebes."

[...] "An event," [...] <b>says</b> John Wright (<b>ed.</b> 1832, ix. 145), [...] "in which Lord Byron was personally concerned, undoubtedly supplied the groundwork of this tale; but for the story so circumstantially set forth (see Medwin's Conversations, 1824, pp. 121, 124) of his having been the lover of this female slave, there is no foundation. The girl whose life the poet saved at Athens was not, we are assured by Sir John Hobhouse (Westminster Review, January, 1825, iii. 27), an object of his Lordship's attachment, but of that of his Turkish servant."
