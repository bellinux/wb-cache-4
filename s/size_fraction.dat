30|$|The {{visibility}} of these signals in size-fraction spectra {{is to be}} accounted to either their undetectability under more intense resonance in the bulk RES 4 or to the conformational simplification in <b>size</b> <b>fractions</b> {{brought about by the}} HPSEC separation.

30|$|A {{lesser extent}} of {{overlapping}} of proton signals was noted in spectra of <b>size</b> <b>fractions</b> (Figure  1 B-G) {{in respect to}} RES 4. In these spectra, most peaks appeared narrower and more pronounced than in the bulk RES 4, due to the decreased molecular heterogeneity of <b>size</b> <b>fractions</b> {{as a result of}} the HPSEC separation. In particular, more intense and abundant signals were visible in the hydroxyalkyl region (3 to 5.2  ppm), which suggested the presence of hydroxy- or aminoalkyl protons CH-X (X: O/N) in the 1.50 - to 2.50 -ppm region next to sp 2 carbons, such as double bonds or carboxyl groups. In contrast with RES 4, all <b>size</b> <b>fractions</b> revealed intense signals for alkyl protons (0.7 to 1.4  ppm), to be ascribed to methylene chains or CH 2 groups in various lipid compounds, such as plant waxes and polyesters.

For relatively coarse grain <b>size</b> <b>fractions,</b> Y s has monotonic variation, i. e. {{with the increase in}} D ss or the decrease in P m, Y s increases. This indicates that the sediment producing behavior for fine sediments is different from that for relatively coarse sediments. The results all show that Y s for relatively coarse sediments depends on the eolian process more than on the fluvial process, and the coarser the sediment fractions the stronger the dependence of the Y s on the eolian process. The Y s -D ss and Y s -P m curves for fine grain <b>size</b> <b>fractions</b> show some peaks and the fitted straight lines for Y - D ss and Y s -P m relationships for relatively coarse grain <b>size</b> <b>fractions</b> show some breaks.
