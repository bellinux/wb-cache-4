40|$|Defined {{contribution}} {{plans are}} now the nation’s primary private retirement income program and repository of retirement savings. About {{two thirds of the}} assets held in such plans are invested in equities, {{as is the case in}} the defined benefit plans they largely replaced. Equities can dramatically reduce the cost of providing retirement incomes, given their high expected returns. But, as illustrated by the recent market crash, equities are also risky. The resulting losses (and gains) in retirement income are also distributed very unevenly in the nation’s 401 (k) -IRA system. The crash hardly affected the retirement prospects of the young: the bulk of the retirement income they will draw from 401 (k) s and IRAs will come from future contributions and future returns. Those at the cusp of retirement, by contrast, are heavily exposed: retirement savings are then at their peak and there is little time to adjust work, saving, and retirement plans in response to the market crash. This concentration of risk is highly troubling, as the 401 (k) -IRA system has become the nation’s primary private retirement income program, and has led to calls to reform. The challenge is to capture the higher expected returns equities offer in a way that provides reasonably secure and reliable incomes in retirement. One approach would make individual retirement accounts more secure and reliable through the use of mandates, defaults, guarantees, or risk-sharing arrangements. This brief offers a different approach, examining the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and how it manages the risk that comes with investing retirement <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> <b>equities</b> [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{began by}} posing {{two sets of}} {{research}} questions. The first set had two main aims. The first aim of the analysis is to uncover the role that power asymmetries play in institutional development (innovation, reproduction, change) and the second aim is to identify what accounts for institutional development, when and by whom. In order to answer these questions, I adopt a three-dimensional power perspective along with the historical analysis of ‘institutional complementarity’ domains. In regard to this question, the thesis argues that the mobilisation of power resources at all three levels {{can be an important}} indicator for understanding the process as well as the direction of institutional change. The second set of questions aims to clarify why the three national pension systems followed different trajectories, and whether these trajectories maintain their different routes or converge. The second aim is to explain why the three national pension funds followed different investment strategies, and whether these strategies continue to differ across the instituted actors. The thesis identifies that despite the original distinctive logics of the three pension systems, the recent pension reforms strongly promoted the individualisation of risk, the enhancement of privately managed funded schemes and the investment of the pension <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> <b>equities.</b> The rationale for diverting their investments as well as the logic of the pension system is essentially located in the ability of actors to collect pension savings and decide upon their investment. I argue that this power struggle was not merely a matter of redistribution but also over the control of financial capital and in principle over which logic dominated the investment of pension funds. The thesis explores historically the development of pension rights and the role of pension funds within the national political economies. The findings of the thesis identify that there has been an important shift in terms of power relations among employers, unions, financiers and state actors and along with these changes, the empirical findings suggest an empowerment of market tools for governing pension systems and funds. The argument of the thesis holds that institutional legacies of pensions systems retain their importance in framing policy solutions and responses {{but at the same time}} recognises that paths alone cannot explain the process of institutional development. Instead, I argue that institutional legacies should not be understood as path dependent drivers that nurture inertia or stability but instead as actively reproducing power dynamics that either enable or constraint actors’ ability to mobilise resources and exercise power. The thesis contributes to social policy and historical institutionalism literature in three ways. Methodologically the thesis contributes twofold to comparative social policy research. First, this research operationalises its holistic theoretical approach through the innovative application of ‘institutional complementarity’ as an analytical tool that examines neighbouring institutional domains of corporate governance, financial systems, political systems and industrial relations. Analytically, the diachronical approach and the explicit pursuit of ‘systemic process analysis’ are innovative attempts that posit time and sequence as part of the empirical reality and adopt an ‘open-ended’ understanding of causality. Finally, the thesis contributes empirically through the incorporation of the financial actors along with the other “usual suspects” (e. g. unions, employers, state actors) in triggering institutional change. It is interesting to note that despite the well documented literature on welfare state development, few studies explored historically and comparatively the role of financial actors...|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{questions}} on the historical {{mean and standard deviation}} of the return on equities and bonds and on the equilibrium demand for these securities are addressed {{in the context of a}} stationary, overlapping-generations economy in which consumers are subject to a borrowing constraint. The key feature captured by the OLG economy is that the bulk of the future income of the young agents is derived from their wages forthcoming in their middle age, while the bulk of the future income of the middle-aged agents is derived from their <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> and bonds. The young would like to borrow and invest <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> but the borrowing constraint prevents them from doing so.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present theoretical, methodological and {{practical}} aspects of internal rating model’s validation for commercial banks and quantify potential impact of foundation internal ratings based approach on financial performance of banks. The quality and the explanatory ability of internal rating systems can be different. Models used to measure credit risk are not perfect and give quite unreliable results, respectively; they contribute to the procyclical tendencies of the financial system. This article was based on the assumption that a suitably chosen rating system can significantly support long-term profitability and competitiveness of commercial banks. One part of the article also presents methodology of additional profitability on equity of the bank due to the usage of internal rating models. The analyses has proved that the usage of internal rating models increase profitability through substantial <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity,</b> which allows the banks to accelerate lending activities in the banking practice. A comparison of standardized approach and foundation internal rating based approach demonstrates that requirement of equity capital can be decreased from 30 to 40 %. Under the condition of the anticipated <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> of 30 %, the usage of internal rating model could increase the profitability on equity up to 13 %, depending on the structure of assets, amount of the interest margins and profitability ratio [...] Future usage of internal rating based approach is quite uncertain since it has shown its procyclical character and has significantly contributed to the acceleration of the global financial crisis by lower capital requirement. However, internal rating based approach implementation is very intensive in the credit risk management of the bank, therefore there is rather suggested a gentle modification in this area and not a complete elimination. It has been considered a neccessity to reassess its status in area of solvency, because of its intensive impact on reduction of equity capital...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we analyze {{expectations}} of the Dutch population aged 25 and older concerning the future generosity of the two main pillars of the Dutch system of income provision to the elderly – first pillar old age social security benefits (AOW) and second pillar occupational pensions (mandatory for almost all employees). As in many other European countries, sustainability of income provision in old age has become an important issue in public policy discussions due to the ageing of the population (Bovenberg and Gradus, 2008). Generous early retirement benefits are gradually being phased out and replaced by actuarially fair flexible retirement systems. The debate has been reinforced by the financial and economic crisis, leading to additional pressure on old age social security due to government budget concerns and due to pressure on occupational pensions caused by the reduced value of the assets of occupational pension funds that invest part of their clients’ pension <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity.</b> The idea of working after the normal retirement age of 65 years has gradually become a real option, although impediments currently remain (Van Solinge and Henkens, 2007), and current plans for reforms imply that sooner or later, the state pension eligibility age and the normal retirement age will shift from age 65 to 67; the main disagreement {{now seems to be}} on when this will happen, not whether it will happen or not. This makes it particularly interesting to analyze how different socio-economic groups forecast the future of the Dutch pension system and whether and how these forecasts have changed {{under the influence of the}} public discussion and the financial and economic crisis.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{quantification}} of potential impacts of credit risk management approaches on the financial performance using collaterals as techniques to reduce credit risk of commercial bank. The requirement to coordinate regulation of the capital adequacy has resulted from fears of central banks of the most developed countries that the capital held by banks to cover even a small loss is not sufficient. Due to the interconnection of financial markets, {{there is a possibility}} that transfer problems of individual banks and problems caused by external shocks could threaten the entire system. The article is focused on quantitative analyses of selected methods of credit risk management using collaterals in the intention of Basel II and quantification of their impact on determining the amount of equity that bank must hold. To set the optimal amount of equity related with the risk portfolio is the one of the most important precondition to increase efficiency and competitiveness of commercial banks. To explain better the usage of internal rating models and techniques reducing credit risk, the amount of capital requirements for the simulated portfolio are calculated and the obtained results within a standardized and foundation IRB approaches are compared. The achievement of higher capital requirements of Basel II doesn't automatically mean that a bank would be safe and also profitable. The equity growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving greater security of the banking sector. In the article, methods of analysis, synthesis, and analysis of causes, induction and deduction are used. In the empirical analysis two methods of Basel II have been used and the results of calculating capital requirements have been calculated. Finally, the methods of comparison have been applied and the question which method provides the highest demand for capital has been raised and compared with other methods. A simple and a comprehensive approach of Standardized Approach and foundation approaches of Internal Rating Based Approach with and without collateral instruments have been put into this comparison. The equation of approaches to credit risk management confirmed the specified hypothesis that quality internal rating system strongly supports the bank's financial performance. The calculations of the working team show that the use of internal rating models brings a significant increase in earnings and profitability through a significant <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> banking practice. The current results demonstrate that the requirement of capital could decrease by approximately 30 %, which means using of an internal rating model could increase the profitability on equity up to 13 %, depending on the structure of the assets, the amount of the interest margins and the profitability ratio. Even saving capital through "the improved credit risk management", which was considered one of the important stabilizing elements in this system, does not work in banking practice and therefore the system of internal ratings should be adjusted to the new regulatory conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the principal facts about wealth inequality {{and how it}} has been changing during the last fifteen years. A very sharp rise in the inequality in household wealth has taken place {{at least since the}} mid- 1980 s. I first examine the relation between wealth and income by illustrating how wealth is distributed within and across income groups and then attempt to uncover some reasons why wealth inequality has been expanding so rapidly. The reasons examined include the receipt of inheritances, rising income inequality, and capital gains, particularly those due to appreciation <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> markets. The subsequent impact of these capital gains on financial <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> other forms is also investigated. Two of the possible explanations [...] the receipt of inheritances and the uneven savings generated by the simultaneous rise in income inequality [...] were rejected as likely to be quantitatively unimportant. The principal culprit lies instead in the third reason: the uneven receipt both within and across income classes of capital gains, particularly those due to sharp price appreciation <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> markets. Capital gains in stocks then induced households to reduce their financial <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> other assets and therefore {{may have contributed to the}} recent secular decline <b>in</b> household <b>savings.</b> Throughout, this research relies on two longitudinal surveys that have pioneered the incorporation of household wealth modules into multipurpose social science surveys: the Panel Study of Income Dyunamics (PSID) and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). wealth inequality...|$|R
