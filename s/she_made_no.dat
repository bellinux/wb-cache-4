5|$|Alice Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her {{plea of not guilty}} to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|From 1904 to 1906, Duke Peter was {{appointed}} to a military post in Tsarskoye Selo, a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg. In Tsarskoye Selo, the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family, who lived at the Alexander Palace near her own residence. Olga prized her connection to the Tsar's four daughters. From 1906 to 1914, Olga took her nieces to parties and engagements in Saint Petersburg, without their parents, every weekend throughout the winter. She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called Shvipsik ("little one"). Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met Rasputin, a self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him. As Olga grew close to her brother's family, {{her relationship with her}} other surviving brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael {{and the rest of the}} family was essentially cut off.|$|E

25|$|In {{her first}} game playing with Energa Toruń, Lindsay faced off against Utex Row Rybnik. The game {{took place on}} October 17, 2007. Lindsay was only able to make 2 points in the game but was only on the court for 6 minutes and 41 seconds. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> rebounds or blocked shots. Energa Toruń lost the match to Utex Row Rybnik, making only 77 points. Utex Row Rybnik scored 84 points.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{publicity}} her appearances garnered, Wie made only one {{cut in a}} men's tournament: at the rain-shortened 2006 SK Telecom Open on the Asian Tour. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> cuts on the PGA Tour. After missing the cut at the 2007 Sony Open by 14 shots, many sports critics began to doubt whether she ever would. Wie's last appearance in a men's professional event was at the 2008 Legends Reno-Tahoe Open, an alternate event on the PGA Tour. Wie shot rounds of 73 and 80, missing the cut by nine strokes.|$|E

25|$|Between January and August 1914 Gayundah {{underwent}} a significant refit at the Cockatoo Dockyard in Sydney. Changes {{during this time}} included work on her forecastle, improvement of her accommodation and sea-keeping characteristics, and the replacement of her 8-inch gun by a 4.7-inch gun. With the outbreak of World War I, Gayundah was assigned to coastal patrols of Moreton Bay and {{the east coast of}} Australia. In July 1915, one of Gayundahs 12-pounder guns was removed. In 1917, due to the threat posed by German raiders such as SMS Seeadler, Gayundah patrolled off Port Jackson and in the Spencer Gulf, although <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> contact with enemy ships during this time.|$|E
25|$|Later she and Energa Toruń next faced {{off against}} Arcus SMS Pzkosz and again she {{continued}} in dominating fashion. The game {{took place on}} December 8, 2007. Aagin Lindsay scored more points in the game than either player on both teams. This time she scored an enormous thirty three points, even higher than her previous season high of twenty eight points just one game before. The second highest score of the game was made by fellow Energa Toruń team mate Anna Marczewska who {{was the only other}} player beside Lindsay to make a double score, but made only eleven points, which Lindsay's easily exceeded by almost triple. Lindsay also made 13 rebounds, one steal and one pass. Defensively <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> blocks in this game. Lindsay's evaluation {{at the end of the}} game (combining the points, passes, blocks and other plays the player made during the game) was easily the highest in the game and was double that of the second highest score of 16, at 43 points. She was fouled 10 times by the opposite team. Lindsay's dominating performance on the court and large contribution of points had all but enabled Energa Toruń to win the game. They won with a score of 80 points, securing their fourth victory. Arcus SMS Pzkosz was only able to score 45 points.|$|E
500|$|Alexandra {{retained}} a youthful appearance into her senior years, {{but during the}} war her age caught up with her. She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossips as having her face [...] "enamelled". <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> more trips abroad, and suffered increasing ill health. In 1920, a blood vessel in her eye burst, leaving her with temporary partial blindness. Towards {{the end of her}} life, her memory and speech became impaired. She died on 20 November 1925 at Sandringham after suffering a heart attack, and was buried in an elaborate tomb next to her husband in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{will had}} now been drawn out and {{completed}} {{for the third}} or fourth time, and <b>she</b> had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> secret of its contents either with Brooke or Dorothy. The whole estate she left to Brooke, including the houses which were to become his after his uncle's death; and in regard to the property <b>she</b> had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> further stipulation. [...] "I might have settled it on your children," [...] she said to him, [...] "but in doing so I should have settled it on hers. I don't know why an old woman should try to interfere with things after she has gone. I hope you won't squander it, Brooke." ...|$|R
500|$|Thatcher did [...] "little {{to advance}} the {{political}} cause of women" [...] either within her party or the government. Burns states that some British feminists regarded her as [...] "an enemy". June Purvis claims that although Thatcher had struggled laboriously against the sexist prejudices of her day {{to rise to the}} top, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> effort to ease the path for other women. Thatcher did not regard women's rights as requiring particular attention as she did not, especially during her premiership, consider that women were being deprived of their rights. She suggested that women should be shortlisted by default for all public appointments but had once proposed that those with young children ought to leave the work force.|$|E
500|$|Hill's {{principles}} were {{summed up}} in an article of 1869: [...] "Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless." [...] She was {{an outspoken critic of}} the principles of [...] "outdoor relief" [...] or the Speenhamland system of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as [...] "a profligate use of public funds." [...] Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up on references of prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> rules that could not be properly enforced.|$|E
500|$|When {{the prime}} minister, Stanley Baldwin, called a general {{election}} for December 1923, Wilkinson was adopted as Labour's parliamentary candidate for Ashton-under-Lyne. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> secret of her Communist affiliations, stating that [...] "we shall have only one class in this country, the working class". In a three-way contest she came third, behind the Conservative and the Liberal candidate. The general election resulted in a hung parliament, and a minority Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald took office. During its short term in power, the Labour Party proscribed the Communist Party and outlawed dual membership. Faced with a choice, Wilkinson left the CPGB, citing the party's [...] "exclusive and dictatorial methods which make impossible {{the formation of a}} real left wing among the progressives of the Trade Unions and the Labour Party". After this, she was selected as Labour's candidate for the constituency of Middlesbrough East.|$|E
5000|$|Michelle [...] "Shelly" [...] Barnett {{became a}} Messenger at age 12.

500|$|Adams {{was educated}} at the Douglas County High School. She was not academically inclined, but was {{interested}} in the creative arts and sang in the school choir. Although she competed in track and gymnastics, she harbored ambitions of becoming a ballerina and trained as an apprentice at the local David Taylor Dance Company. She disliked her experience in high school and kept mostly to herself. After her graduation, she moved to Atlanta with her mother. She did not intend to go to college, which disappointed her parents, and she later regretted not getting more of an education. Realizing, at age 18, that she was not gifted enough to be a professional ballerina, Adams inclined towards musical theater, which she found was [...] "much better suited to [...] personality". One of her first jobs was in a community theater production of Annie, but <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> money in it. To support herself, Adams worked as a greeter at a Gap store. She also {{took a job as a}} waitress at Hooters, where she had to work wearing tight gym outfits, and customers frequently misbehaved with her. Adams left the job soon after she had saved enough money to buy a used car.|$|E
2500|$|Beatrice Arthur {{later called}} her {{involvement}} with the film a [...] "tremendous embarrassment" [...] and expressed regret at having participated.

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1831, Martineau {{wrote on the}} subject [...] "Political Economy" [...] (as the field of {{economics}} was then known).

60|$|We {{have said}} that Moonlight was rather self-willed.
