50|$|The {{atmospheric}} oxidation of fluorotelomer alcohols can also result in anthropogenic perfluorinated carboxylic acids. In addition to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, fluorotelomer alcohols can degrade to form unsaturated carboxylic acids {{which have been}} detected in bottlenose dolphins.Fluorotelomer alcohols such as 4:2 FTOH, 6:2 FTOH, 8:2 FTOH, and 10:2 FTOH, {{have been identified as}} residuals in consumer products such as <b>stain</b> <b>repellents,</b> Zonyl FSE, and windshield wash, among others.

The Swedish Chemicals Agency, on commission by the government, has drawn up an action plan to achieve the environmental objective. The Action Plan's focus is mainly on achieving a non-toxic everyday environment for children. Thru identication of riskareas, the preschools in Gävle will be able to get a good structure for the work to be done. In this diploma work in Environmental technology an inventory of Chemical Smart preschools is conducted. Nineteen municipal kindergartens in the city of Gävle are examined, with the goal of identifying areas of risk and vulnerability of children to chemicals in the preschool environment. A collaboration with the department of Education Gävle ́s environmental strategist has provided contacts and economic opportunity for the staff at the individual preschools to participate during the inventory. The final report is submitted to the department and its preschools to use as the basis of the priorities in the work of chemical smart preschool. The implementation is done with an existing template from the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (Naturskyddsföreningen, 2013). The inventory is made in two stages, an interview before the inventory and inventory of chattels and some architectural details such as floor and wall surfaces. The inventory of chattels consists of approximately 100 questions asked and examined at each nursery, they are summarized in table format with descriptive text. Areas of risk are identified based on supported data from Swedish authorities or research in the subjected area. The discussion demonstrates the difficulties that arise in the choice of products when the contents are difficult to decipher or inaccessible. But also how the routines for cleaning, washing and airing can influence the identified risk areas. Risk areas according to the objectives and conclusions identified are depicted by type of substance or negative health effects. The identification gave six different areas: Flameproof, water and <b>stain</b> <b>repellents,</b> Chemicals from plastics, allergens, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, lead and mercury. These areas outline the types of product categories that are of concern and what kind of health risk they entail. ...|$|E
40|$|Perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS) {{and related}} perfluoroalkyl surfactants (PFAS) are ubiquitous contaminants of increasing public concern {{due to their}} environmental persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation. These perfluorinated compounds {{have been used for}} more than half a century in a wide variety of industrial and consumer products ranging from <b>stain</b> <b>repellents</b> such as Teflon® to aqueous fire-fighting foams and to grease-proof food packing. The public health and environmental risks posed by PFAS have driven environmental agencies and the industry to restrict their use to specific applications where they cannot be replaced by other chemicals. The sources and pathways of PFOS and its derivatives in the environment are not well understood. Analysis of environmental samples is critical to understand the fate, transport and persistence of these emerging contaminants. Techniques based on fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance (¹⁹F NMR) spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with suppressed conductivity detection were successfully developed to monitor the presence of PFAS in water samples. Chromatographic separation of C₄ to C₈ PFAS surfactants was achieved using a C₁₈ reversed-phase column and a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of boric acid and acetonitrile at mixing ratios ranging from 75 : 25 to 45 : 55 (v/v). The combination of these two techniques was very effective for characterization and routine quantification of PFOS and related chemicals. Analytical methods based on ¹⁹F NMR, HPLC-suppressed conductivity detection, and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were employed to characterize commercial PFOS samples. Linear and branched PFOS isomers in a percentage ratio of 75 : 25 were identified. Municipal wastewater treatment systems are one of the major sources of PFAS emissions into the environment. The presence of PFAS in sewage sludge from two wastewater treatment plants in Tucson, Arizona, was investigated. Sludge samples were washed with acetic acid and extracted with a mixture of acetic acid and methanol. The extract was cleaned and concentrated by means of solid phase extraction. LC-MS/MS operating in the selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode was employed to assess the presence of perfluorosulfonates, perfluorosulfonamides, and perfluorocarboxylates in sewage sludge samples. PFOS was the only perfluoroalkyl chemical detected in municipal sludge samples at a concentration of 77 ± 5 g kg⁻¹ sludge dry weight. Cost-effective treatment techniques for removing PFAS from industrial effluents are needed to minimize discharges of these pollutants. Reductive dehalogenation is widely applied to the degradation of highly chlorinated compounds. Hence, the susceptibility of PFOS and related compounds to biological and chemical reductive dehalogenation was evaluated in batch assays. PFAS were not reductively dehalogenated by different microbial consortia even after periods of incubation exceeding 2 y, confirming the high resistance of these compounds to microbial degradation. The anaerobic biodegradability of PFOS and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) samples exposed to electrochemical pretreatment with boron-doped diamond film electrodes was also investigated. The oxidation decreased the concentration of PFAS and dissolved organic carbon in solution, confirming the destruction of these compounds. However, the oxidative treatment did not enhance the susceptibility of PFAS to microbial degradation even after extended periods of incubation (> 1 y). In contrast, PFOS was reductively dehalogenated with a biomimetic system based on vitamin B 12 as the catalyst and Ti(III) citrate as the reducing agent. The optimal treatments conditions of the reaction were 260 μM vitamin B₁₂, 36 mM Ti(III) citrate, 70 °C and solution pH 9. 0. Interestingly, branched PFOS isomers were more prone to degradation by vitamin B₁₂ catalysis compared to the linear isomer. Removal of 3 mol Fper mol of technical PFOS and 12 mol F- per mol of branched PFOS isomers was achieved. Defluorination of PFOS was also observed at environmental relevant conditions of 30 °C and pH 7. 0, albeit at lower degradation rates. Fluoride and carbon dioxide were identified as the major products of the chemical defluorination. Traces of partially fluorinated volatile compounds were also detected in the headspace. The feasibility of removing PFAS compounds from aqueous streams by sorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC), zeolite, and wastewater treatment sludge was examined in batch isotherm experiments. The fluorocarbon chain and the functional group influenced sorption of the anionic surfactants, PFOS adsorbed more strongly to GAC than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and PFBS. Activated carbon showed the highest affinity for PFOS (Freundlich K(F) values of 36. 7 to 60. 9) followed by the hydrophobic, high-silica zeolite NaY (Si/Al 80, K(F) of 31. 8) and lastly anaerobic sludge (K(F) of 0. 95 to 1. 85). GAC sorption is a suitable treatment for the removal of anionic perfluoroalkyl surfactants when present at low concentrations. Fluoride has been identified as the major product of the reductive dehalogenation of PFOS and derivatives. Thus, the toxicity of inorganic fluoride towards the main microbial populations responsible for the removal of organic constituents and nutrients in wastewater treatment processes was also studied. Fluoride concentrations ranging from 18 to 43 mg L⁻¹ caused 50 % inhibition (IC₅₀) of the activity of propionate- and butyratedegrading microorganisms and of acetate-utilization by methanogens evaluated under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. All other microbial populations evaluated in this study, i. e., glucose fermenters, aerobic glucose-degrading heterotrophs, denitrifying bacteria, and H₂-utilizing methanogens tolerated fluoride at very high concentrations (> 500 mg L⁻¹). In the same manner, H₂-utilizing methanogens also tolerated PFOS and PFBS at concentrations as high as 200 and 500 mg L⁻¹, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Transparent liquid {{repellent}} coatings with exceptional {{wear and}} abrasion resistance are very demanding to fabricate. The {{most important reason}} for this is the fact that majority of the transparent liquid repellent coatings have so far been fabricated by nanoparticle assembly on surfaces in the form of films. These films or coatings demonstrate relatively poor substrate adhesion and rubbing induced wear resistance compared to polymer-based transparent hydrophobic coatings. However, recent advances reported in the literature indicate that considerable progress has now been made towards formulating and applying transparent, hydrophobic and even oleophobic coatings onto various substrates which can withstand certain degree of mechanical abrasion. This is considered to be very promising for anti-graffiti coatings or treatments since they require resistance to wear abrasion. Therefore, this review intends to highlight the state-of-the-art on materials and techniques that are used to fabricate wear resistant liquid repellent transparent coatings so that researchers can assess various aptitudes and limitations related to translating some of these technologies to large scale <b>stain</b> <b>repellent</b> outdoor applications...|$|R
30|$|Fluorocarbon based {{compounds}} {{forming a}} thin film coating around fibers are used for soil release or <b>stain</b> <b>repellent</b> finishes. They alter the fabric surface properties by lowering the surface tension of the fabric which repels spill on contact by providing hydrophobic barrier to water and soils (Easter and Ankenman 2004, 2005; Hashim 1986). They are organic compounds consisting of perfluorinated carbon chains with more fluorine than hydrogens attached to carbon, having thermal and chemical stability. They have alternating hydrophilic and oleophobic units along a single hydrocarbon polymer backbone that gets strongly adsorbed and even forms covalent bond to the treated surface and orients perpendicular to the surface providing a low surface energy ‘barrier’ to both water and oil-based staining agents (Grajeck and Petersen 1962; Buck and Schubert 2009; Read and Culling 1967; Mather and Wardman 2011). Hybrid fluorochemicals are used with dual action of both soil-repellency and soil-release properties in air and in water (Kissa 2001). Critical surface tension for fluorocarbon surfaces is 6 mN m- 1 (-CF 3) to 28 mN m- 1, for bleached cotton it is 44 mN m- 1 and surface tension value of water is 72.8 mN m- 1 (Latta and Sello 1981; O’Lenick 1999). Typically, textile fluorochemicals are cationic in nature but can also be in their non-ionic or anionic forms. They are aqueous dispersions of a fluorinated polymer with some processing aids such as organic solvents or surfactants selected according to desired performance properties required like repellency or release etc., along with new advancement which does not affect other properties of the fabric (Arunyadej et al. 1998; Easter and Ankenman, 2004; Hashim 1986).|$|R
40|$|This study makes a new {{estimate}} of the global historical production for perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF), and then focuses on producing a first {{estimate of}} the global historical environmental releases of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The total historical worldwide production of POSF {{was estimated to be}} 96 000 t (or 122 500 t, including unusable wastes) between 1970 − 2002, with an estimated global release of 45 250 t to air and water between 1970 − 2012 from direct (manufacture, use, and consumer products) and indirect (PFOS precursors and/or impurities) sources. Estimates indicate that direct emissions from POSF-derived products are the major source to the environment resulting in releases of 450 − 2700 t PFOS into wastewater streams, primarily through losses from <b>stain</b> <b>repellent</b> treated carpets, waterproof apparel, and aqueous fire fighting foams. Large uncertainties surround indirect sources and have not yet been estimated due to limited information on environmental degradation, although it can be assumed that some POSF-derived chemicals will degrade to PFOS over time. The properties of PFOS (high water solubility, negligible vapor pressure, and limited sorption to particles) imply it will reside in surface waters, predominantly in oceans. Measured oceanic data suggests 235 − 1770 t of PFOS currently reside in ocean surface waters, similar to the estimated PFOS releases. Environmental monitoring from the 1970 s onward shows strong upward trends in biota, in broad agreement with the estimates of use and emissions made here. Since cessation of POSF production by 3 M in 2002, a reduction in some compartments has been observed, although current and future exposure is dependent on emission routes, subsequent transport and degradation...|$|R

30|$|Despite, no {{differences}} being detected for second-degree burn {{at the middle}} sensor among fabric finish {{it is clear that}} the Teflon® treatment provides both plain and twill weave fabrics with greater protection against hot water penetration. Teflon® finishes may be applied to fabrics to make them hydrophobic and offer repellency to both water and oil. Repellency of the Teflon® treated surface to cold water has been well documented (Nilsson et al. 2010; Wi et al. 2009), but less so to hot water (Liu et al. 2009). In fact, Liu et al. (2009) found that a reduction in water repellency occurred as the water temperature was increased, which was due to the decrease in surface tension of hot water (Liu et al. 2009). In the current study, the surface tension of the fabrics to hot or cold water was not carried out. However, the results in the current study do show that the combined <b>stain</b> and water <b>repellent</b> Teflon® treatment can provide some protection from hot water exposure. Interestingly the Teflon® twill fabric had the highest air permeability (Fig.  3) of all the fabrics which may be explained by its lower mass and thickness (see Table  1). Therefore, the Teflon® treatment is unlikely to compromise thermal-related comfort properties as air permeability is an important predictor of thermal comfort (Epstein et al. 2013; Hatch et al. 1990) and well correlated with water vapor diffusion (Wen et al. 2012). The finding that fabric properties such as the ability of a fabric to repel liquid may be more important than how porous it is (as indicated by air permeability) has also been found in other research. For example, one permeable fabric (40 % Kevlar® aramid/ 60 % polybenzimidazole) had lower surface energy but higher air permeability than two other fabrics examined (100 % cotton; 88 % cotton/ 12 % nylon) yet it exhibited longer times to predicted second-degree burn injury and lower penetration of hot liquids (Lu et al. 2013 c, 2014).|$|R
