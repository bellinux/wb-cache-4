50|$|The {{advantage}} of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> {{is that it can}} be used with a minimum amount of control software. The disadvantages are that a relatively large area (floor space) is required compared with other product lifts and vertical transport takes {{a great deal of time}} on account of the number of cycles which the transport belt completes. Certain products can also become misshapen since they are transported at an angle. One only has to think of plastic bottles which are wrapped in clingfilm which can become permanently misshapen if the clingfilm has still not completely cooled. A product is only supported at two angles on a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> because of the lifting angle and the radius within which the transport conveyor is placed. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will not be possible with a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The drive motor of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> must always be controlled with a frequency regulator in order to prevent excessive slippage of the transport belt. It is also necessary to take account that products must not touch at intake. If products are touching each other at intake, the products can become jammed, which can result in the transport belt breaking down. It is, therefore, recommended that a good feed mechanism be provided for a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> In the case of most spiral conveyors, products must also be presented centrally, as the eccentric loading of spiral conveyors can cause excessive slippage. If a product becomes stuck for any reason, there is a good to a very good chance that the lamellae of the transport belt will disintegrate, which can cause a considerable loss in production along the whole of the production line, something which is associated with huge additional costs for replacements.|$|E
50|$|A {{continuous}} product lift or reciprocating elevator can {{be chosen}} for the upright transporting of products. Such lifts are found in two forms: an L-shaped conveyor or mat lift and a fork-lift. An L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is a goods lift in which the products lie on a support which is suspended between a number of chains. This {{means that there is}} a considerable risk of contamination (with oil or grease) where use is made of traditional chains. A possible disadvantage of such a lift is that it requires more control, but the area required is again appreciably less than with a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The difference in height which is able to be bridged with only one drive motor is almost unlimited. When bridging a greater height, it is necessary with spiral conveyors to place several systems one above the other. Another disadvantage of an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift {{is the fact that it}} is difficult to control the transfer of products on intake to the system, with the incorrect receiving of a product being able to cause considerable consequential damage and with considerable additional costs to be expected as a result of lost production just as in the case of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{discontinuous}} conveyor {{also called}} a reciprocating elevator, lifts the product on to a platform using a platform, roller conveyor or belt conveyor and then moves the platform with {{the product to}} another level. Because of the cycle time required for input and output as well as lifting/lowering movements, such a conveyor can only be used for smaller capacities. Continuous conveyors {{are more suitable for}} bigger capacities. There are two important solutions which can be used for this group. It is possible to choose a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> or a continuous product lift. Both solutions are able to handle several products at a time.|$|E
50|$|In {{similarity}} to vertical <b>conveyors,</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> {{raise and lower}} materials to different levels of a facility. In contrast, <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> are able to transport material loads in a continuous flow. Industries that require a higher output of materials - food and beverage, retail case packaging, pharmaceuticals - typically incorporate these conveyors into their systems over standard vertical conveyors due {{to their ability to}} facilitate high throughput. Most <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> also have a lower angle of incline or decline (11 degrees or less) to prevent sliding and tumbling during operation.|$|R

40|$|For placing {{small parts}} in {{readiness}} for assembly, about 80 percent of <b>spiral</b> vibration <b>conveyors</b> are used. For {{the greatest number}} of such parts, this is the most economical solution. This does not only apply to small parts which, for instance, may affect the safety of the supply p√ºrocess by getting jammed or interlocked. For such parts a solution has been found which features, among other things, a new substrate foil which is homogenous with the material...|$|R
50|$|All the {{aggregates}} like lime, sand, soil, coal ash, {{and other}} stuff are {{loaded into the}} batching hoppers by the loading machine. After measuring, the belt feeder transports the aggregates into mixing device. Meanwhile, stabilizing powders like lime, cement and others are transferred from powder material warehouse to the batch hopper by <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> and then moved to the belt feeder by powder material feeder. All the ingredients {{are going to the}} mixing device for final processing. At last, the feeding belt conveyor is waiting for the final product to deliver it to the storage warehouse.|$|E
50|$|Just like spiral {{conveyors}} also {{a vertical}} conveyor that use forks {{are able to}} transport material loads in a continuous flow. With these forks the load can be taken from one horizontal conveyor and put down on another horizontal conveyor on a different level. By adding more forks more products can be lifted at the same time. Conventional vertical conveyors have the restriction that the input and output of material loads must have the same direction. By using forks many combinations of different input- and output levels in different directions are possible. A vertical conveyor with forks can even {{be used as a}} vertical sorter. Compared to a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> a vertical conveyor - with or without forks - takes up less space.|$|E
50|$|In {{internal}} logistics, {{there are}} various ways for getting product flows up or down. A solution which is often used is the deployment of incline or lowering belts. When placed at an angle in order to bridge a height difference, such belt conveyors also {{have the advantage of}} covering a certain distance. A disadvantage is the loss of much useful floor space {{as a result of the}} presence of the necessary supports for the belt conveyor. A bigger distance over a smaller floor area can be bridged using a product lift or a vertical conveyor. A continuous conveyor or a discontinuous conveyor can be chosen as a vertical conveyor. Continuous conveyors can take the form of a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift or a product lift fitted with a fork.|$|E
40|$|Introduction <b>Spiral</b> <b>conveyors</b> {{effectively}} carry solid masses as free or partly {{free flow}} of materials. They create good throughput {{and they are the}} perfect solution to solve the problems of transport, due to their simple structure, high efficiency and low maintenance costs. This study aims to investigate the performance characteristics of conveyors as function of auger diameter, rotational speed and handling inclination angle. The performance characteristic was investigated according to volumetric efficiency. In another words, {{the purpose of this study}} was obtaining a suitable model for volumetric efficiency changes of steep auger to transfer agricultural products. Three different diameters of auger, five levels of rotational speed and three slope angles were used to investigate the effects of changes in these parameters on volumetric efficiency of auger. The used method is novel in this area and the results show that performance by ANFIS models is much better than common statistical models. Materials and Methods The experiments were conducted in Department of Mechanical Engineering of Agricultural Machinery in Urmia University. In this study, SAYOS cultivar of wheat was used. This cultivar of wheat had hard seeds and the humidity was 12...|$|R
50|$|When the City & South London Railway {{opened in}} 1890 {{access to the}} {{platforms}} was by two hydraulic lifts, each capable of carrying 50 passengers. The later extensions had electric lifts and five were provided at Bank. Access to the Waterloo & City Railway in 1898 was by slopes and steps, and the Great Northern & City Railway (GN&CR) used both hydraulic and electric lifts. The Central London Railway provided electric lifts {{when it opened in}} 1900, and the opening of Bond Street station was delayed as the lifts were not ready. The UERL controversially imported 140 electric lifts from Otis Elevator Company in the U.S. for its three lines. Each carrying about 70 passengers, they were provided at every station except Gillespie Road (now Arsenal) and Embankment, where access was provided via the District's station. Hydraulic lifts were provided at Finsbury Park, powered from the GN&CR pumping station. and at Holloway Road there was an experimental <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor,</b> but this was never used by the public. Each lift was manned, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.|$|E
50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift and a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor.</b> A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift, input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} separation achieved in a column crystallizer which utilizes a <b>spiral</b> <b>conveyor</b> was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of variables associated with continuous flow operation. A system that exhibits negligible solid solubility was used. Several feed mixtures containing less than 31, 000 p. p. m. weight cyclohexane in benzene were employed. The principal variables evaluated in this study in a column of constant length were the feed position, internal crystal rate, and flow rates of terminal streams. A mathematical model is developed which considers axial dispersion and mass transfer between the liquid adhering to the crystals and the bulk liquid. The model satisfactorily explains the effect of the variables associated with continuous flow operation and shows that axial dispersion is more dominant in continuous flow than in total reflux operation. It is shown that multiple pass or cascade operation is necessary to produce material of purity higher than a critical level which is related to the feed composition. This occurs because of impurities in the crystal phase which are likely caused by volumetric inclusions...|$|E
