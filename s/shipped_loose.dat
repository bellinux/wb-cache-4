Amundsen planned to freeze the Maud into the polar ice cap and drift towards the North Pole (as Nansen had done with the Fram), and he did so off Cape Chelyuskin. But, the ice became so thick that the ship was unable to break free, although it was designed for such a journey in heavy ice.

50|$|On a ship, cargo must be stowed evenly so {{that the}} ship sits upright. All ships are {{vulnerable}} to cargo shifting, causing the ship to develop a list to one side. However sailing ships are particularly vulnerable because the ship naturally heels over {{in reaction to the}} force of the wind on the sails. If the cargo is not adequately secured the cargo may fall to the leeward side of the <b>ship.</b> <b>Loose</b> cargos (e.g. grain) flow downhill like water if not adequately secured (e.g. by shifting boards) and are particularly prone to shifting. If a large quantity of cargo shifts the ship may develop such a heavy list that she capsizes. A catastrophic cargo shift caused the loss of the tall ship Pamir in 1957.|$|R

The troops went ashore immediately, and the attack {{transport}} began unloading cargo and taking on casualties. During her stay in the Ryūkyūs, Bowie witnessed a number of air raids but did not come under attack herself. On 15 May, the attack transport left Okinawa in a Hawaii-bound convoy. She made two stops, one at Ulithi and the other at Guam, before arriving back in Pearl Harbor on 3 June. She remained there overnight and, on the 4th, headed for the west coast. Bowie reached San Francisco, California, on 10 June and disembarked the casualties and other passengers. Later in the month, she loaded cargo and took on troops. The <b>ship</b> <b>loosed</b> her moorings on 17 June and {{stood out of}} San Francisco Bay. On her way across the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines, Bowie stopped at Eniwetok and Ulithi for fuel.

500|$|On 11 July the {{activity}} on Moreno's ships indicated to British observers at Gibraltar that the combined squadron was readying for sea, and the British working parties repairing Saumarez's squadron correspondingly redoubled their efforts. The {{arrival of a}} light easterly wind which would favour passage back to Cadiz encouraged both Moreno and Saumarez to prepare for departure to the Atlantic base on the following day. At 12:00 on 12 July, Caesar warped out of Gibraltar dockyard with her band playing the popular song [...] "Heart of Oak" [...] to the answering strains of [...] "Britons, Strike Home!" [...] from the dockside as crowds again turned out in their thousands to watch the coming battle. By that time however, Moreno's forces were already at sea: at dawn on 12 July the leading Spanish <b>ships</b> <b>loosed</b> their sails and by 12:00 the French and Spanish squadron had begun to gather at their rendezvous point off Cabrita Point {{at the mouth of}} Algeciras Bay. At 15:00, Saumarez set sail, his pennant flying from Caesar and followed by ships of the line Superb, HMS Spencer, HMS Venerable and HMS Audacious, frigates Thames and the Portuguese Carlotta and several smaller vessels. Both Saumarez and Linois expected reinforcements sent by Lord Keith to arrive during the day, but none appeared.|$|R
