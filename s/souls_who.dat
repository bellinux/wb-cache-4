5|$|Purgatory is a {{temporary}} condition for the purification of <b>souls</b> <b>who,</b> although destined for Heaven, are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter Heaven immediately. In Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. <b>Souls</b> <b>who</b> did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E

25|$|In the Vaishnava traditions {{the highest}} Heaven is Vaikuntha, which exists above the six heavenly lokas {{and outside of}} the mahat-tattva or mundane world.

25|$|Gods can be thus {{categorized}} into embodied gods {{also known}} as arihantas and non-embodied formless gods who are called Siddhas. Jainism considers the devīs and devas to be <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve moksha.|$|E
25|$|Some sects {{who hold}} to the {{doctrine}} of baptismal regeneration also believe in a third realm called Limbo, which is the final destination of <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> have not been baptised, but who have been innocent of mortal sin. Souls in Limbo include unbaptised infants and those who lived virtuously but were never exposed to Christianity in their lifetimes. Christian Scientists believe that sin brought death, and that death will be overcome with the overcoming of sin.|$|E
25|$|Very few Druzes {{are able}} to recall their past but, if they {{are able to}} they are called a Nateq. Typically <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> have died violent deaths in their {{previous}} incarnation will be able to recall memories. Since death is seen as a quick transient state, mourning is discouraged. Unlike other Abrahamic faiths, heaven and hell are spiritual. Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as the bitterness of being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.|$|E

25|$|Catholic Christians {{teach that}} there is a supernatural realm called Purgatory where <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> have died in a state of grace but have yet to expiate venial sins or {{temporal}} punishments due to past sins are cleansed before they are admitted into Heaven. The Catholic Church also professes a belief in the resurrection of the body. It is believed that, before the Final Judgement, the souls of all who have ever lived will be reunited with their resurrected body. In the case of the righteous, this will result in a glorified body which can reside in Heaven. The damned, too, shall reunite body and soul, but shall remain eternally in Hell.|$|E
25|$|Siddhahood is the {{ultimate}} goal of all souls. There are infinite <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> have become siddhas and infinite more who will attain this state of liberation. According to Jainism, Godhood is not a monopoly of some omnipotent and powerful being(s). All souls, with right perception, knowledge and conduct can achieve self-realisation and attain this state. Once achieving this state of infinite bliss and having destroyed all desires, the soul is not concerned with worldly matters and does not interfere in the working of the universe, as any activity or desire to interfere will once again result in influx of karmas and thus loss of liberation.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church {{understands the}} death and resurrection of Christ Jesus to be real {{historical}} events, {{as described in the}} gospels of the New Testament. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was in his humanity (that is, in history) crucified, and died, descending into Hades (Sheol), the place of the dead, as all humans do. But He, alone among humans, has two natures, one human, one divine, which are indivisible and inseparable from each other through the mystery of the incarnation. Hades could not restrain the infinite God. Christ in His divine nature captured the keys of Hades and broke the bonds which had imprisoned the human <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> had been held there through their separation from God.|$|E
50|$|According to the Jain {{concept of}} divinity, any <b>soul</b> <b>who</b> destroys its karmas and desires, {{achieves}} liberation/Nirvana. A <b>soul</b> <b>who</b> destroys all its passions and desires has {{no desire to}} interfere in the working of the universe. If godliness {{is defined as the}} state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods (Tirthankara).|$|R

25|$|In Dante's fourteenth-century work La divina commedia (The Divine Comedy), Purgatory is {{depicted}} as a mountain in the Southern hemisphere. It is apparently the only land there. <b>Souls</b> <b>who</b> loved God and man half-heartedly find themselves at Mount Purgatory, where there are two levels, then Seven Levels representing the Seven Deadly Sins with ironic punishments. For example, on the first level for Pride, the penitents are weighed down by huge stones. This forces them to look down in humility at the pavement, which depicts examples of sinful Pride such as Arachne. When they reach the top, souls will find themselves at Jerusalem's antipode, the Garden of Eden itself. Thus, cleansed of all sin and made perfect, they wait in this Earthly paradise before ascending to Heaven.|$|E
25|$|A human's karmic acts {{result in}} merits and demerits. Since {{unconscious}} things {{generally do not}} move except when caused by an agent (for example, the axe moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues {{there must be a}} conscious supreme Being who knows the merits and demerits which persons have earned by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits. Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences. Thus, there must be a theistic administrator or supervisor for karma, i.e., God.|$|E
25|$|There are sixty four Indras in Jaina literature, each ruling over {{different}} heavenly realms where heavenly <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> {{have not}} yet gained Kaivalya (moksha) are reborn according to Jainism. Among these many Indras, the ruler of the first Kalpa heaven is the Indra who is known as Saudharma in Digambara, and Sakra in Śvētāmbara tradition. He is most preferred, discussed and often depicted in Jaina caves and marble temples, often with his wife Indrani. They greet the devotee {{as he or she}} walks in, flank the entrance to an idol of Jina (conqueror), and lead the gods as they are shown celebrating the five auspicious moments in a Jina's life, including his birth. These Indra-related stories are enacted by laypeople in Jainism tradition during special Puja (worship) or festive remembrances.|$|E

25|$|On {{the surface}} of the west face of the {{pedestal}} and from left to right we first see the devil himself, a frightening figure. He is trying to tempt Jesus who is appearing before Pontius Pilate. Next, we are shown the resurrected Christ who has emerged from the tomb. Here the date 1604 is inscribed. Next, we see the young Jesus engaged in discussions with the two lawyers. Then Jesus is shown holding the hands of two lost <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> he has rescued from the open mouth of hell ("Abandon all hope ye who enter here") from which flames emerge and other lost souls writhe in agony, including the legendary Kattell Gollet. A demon sits above the mouth orchestrating proceedings and another with horns is with the others in the mouth itself.|$|E
25|$|Much later, on {{the ruined}} world of Adeki, the Seventh Doctor {{found one of}} several Gwanzulums, beings who used their shapeshifting powers to pass {{themselves}} off {{as some of the}} Doctor's past companions, including Katarina. Before he realized the ruse, the false Katarina tried to have him take her off the planet. Later, Ace comes across the ghost of Katarina {{in the form of an}} eternally frozen girl of ice, in the Doctor's guilty mind. In Katarina's afterlife, she finds herself without a coin and unable to cross the River Styx. However, due to the intervention of the Doctor (or her idea of him), she found her way not only to Asphodel where all <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> had done neither good nor evil would go, but to the Elysian Fields, the abode of the blessed.|$|E

According {{to the terms of}} the contract, Sam would serve the Devil by using various tools, called vessels, to recapture <b>souls</b> <b>who</b> have escaped from Hell. After capturing an escaped soul with a vessel, he would then drop the vessel and soul at a portal to Hell, which was the local Department of Motor Vehicles in the show. Also, the Devil would grant Sam a unique power to aid in a particular soul's capture; the type of power ranged from telekinesis to a tattoo hinting the soul's location.|$|E
