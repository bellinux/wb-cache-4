2500|$|In January 2015, a {{customer}} named Ricardo Brown received a bill from Comcast {{with his name}} changed to [...] "Asshole Brown". Brown's wife, Lisa, believed a Comcast employee changed the name {{in response to the}} Browns' request to cancel their cable service, an incident in which she was refused a cancellation unless she paid a $60 fee and instead was routed to a retention specialist. Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing it to the attention of numerous customer <b>service</b> <b>outlets</b> for the company by explaining that Ricardo is the legal name of the customer, so the Browns turned to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott. Elliott posted the facts of the incident, along with a copy of the bill, on his blog.

The Browns instead requested a full refund for their negative experience and Comcast agreed to refund the family {{the last two years of}} service and provide the next two years of service at no charge. Comcast released a statement explaining: [...] "We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change.

40|$|Abstract—Installing a {{financial}} <b>service</b> <b>outlet</b> (e. g. {{automated teller machine}} (ATM)) is an expensive affair due to the need of dedicated network connectivity. In the existing model, the users are forced to trust a <b>service</b> <b>outlet</b> to be authentic. A spoofed outlet can collect the account information and use it in some way later. In this paper, we propose a new model that would overcome these cost and security related issues of the conventional Financial Service Model. In a developing economy like India, whose 70 percent population of 1. 15 billion is in rural areas with limited or no network connectivity, this model can help the banks reach the masses. I...|$|R
