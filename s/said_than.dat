25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E

Following a 2015 CBO report that reached a similar conclusion, Paul Krugman wrote: [...] "But the truth is that this report is much, much closer to what supporters of reform have <b>said</b> <b>than</b> it is to the scare stories of the critics--no death spirals, no job-killing, major gains in coverage at relatively low cost." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{past decade}} has shown that {{harnessing}} consumer power to effect positive environmental change is far easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done. The so-called [...] "green consumer" [...] movements in the U.S. and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and {{to remain in the}} forefront of shoppers' minds. While public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies, consumers' efforts to do so in real life have remained sketchy at best.|$|E

500|$|In a 2009 poll by GamePro, 21% {{of voters}} chose Mortal Kombat as their {{favorite}} fighting game series, ranking it third after Street Fighter and Tekken. In 2012, Capcom's Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono {{said he is}} {{getting a lot of}} requests for Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat and understands why people want it, [...] "but it's easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done. Having Chun Li getting her spine ripped out, or Ryu's head bouncing off the floor...it doesn't necessarily match." [...] In 2014, martial artist Frankie Edgar opined Mortal Kombat has been far superior to Street Fighter.|$|E
500|$|The album's production, almost solely done by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, {{was praised}} by several critics. Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic gave a {{considerable}} amount of attention to the album's production, saying that [...] "Dr. Dre and Yella meld together P-Funk, Def Jam-style hip hop, and the leftover electro sounds of mid-80s Los Angeles, creating a dense, funky, and thoroughly unique style of their own." [...] Birchmeier would also write that some songs—"Eazy Duz It", [...] "We Want Eazy", [...] "Eazy-er <b>Said</b> <b>Than</b> Dunn", and [...] "Radio"—are all heavily produced and have [...] "layers upon layers of samples and beats competing with Eazy-E's rhymes for attention." [...] Rapper Kanye West also touted Dr. Dre's production on the album.|$|E
500|$|Eazy-E's music career {{started in}} 1986 with the hip hop group N.W.A, {{where he would}} perform on {{all four of the}} studio albums. In 1988, before Ice Cube left N.W.A, Eazy {{released}} Eazy-Duz-It as his first solo effort. Eazy-Duz-It peaked at number 41 on the Billboard 200 and became Eazy's most successful album, selling 2.5 million albums in the US by 1994. In 1992 it was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. The album's first single, [...] "Eazy-er <b>Said</b> <b>Than</b> Dunn", would go on to peak at number 84 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. [...] "Eazy-Duz-It" [...] was released in 1989 and only charted on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. [...] "We Want Eazy" [...] was also released in 1989 and charted on both the Hot Rap Tracks chart and the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart.|$|E

500|$|Anniemal {{focuses on}} heavily layered beats, {{with a strong}} 1980s influence. Annie was {{influenced}} by 1980s dance-pop, and on [...] "No Easy Love", she includes a sample of Shakatak's 1982 song [...] "Easier <b>Said</b> <b>Than</b> Done". Unlike many of her contemporaries, Annie avoids using an ironic or kitschy in her take on 1980s music. The songs' styles span genres including bubblegum pop, electro, disco, R, dance-pop, and rock. Annie's DJing experiences taught her about sound and production and affected her music. She stated {{that she wanted to}} make a pop album that would not quickly become dated, [...] "an album that you could listen to in five years and it wouldn't sound terrible." [...] Annie considered excluding [...] "Greatest Hit" [...] from Anniemal to achieve this but ultimately included it because she felt it did not sound as if it were five years old.|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is <b>Said</b> <b>Than</b> Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{very little}} attention from {{radio and television}} stations, but got support from Los Angeles's hip-hop underground. [...] On May 20, 1989, it peaked at #41 on the Billboard 200, and since 1989, was in various places on the chart for over 90 weeks. It peaked at #12 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart on March 11, 1989. Since the album's release, it {{has been on the}} chart during 51 different weeks. On February 15, 1989, the album was certified Gold (500,000 sales) by the Recording Industry Association of America, and on June 1, 1989, it was certified Platinum (1,000,000 sales). It received its peak certification by the RIAA of Double Platinum (2,000,000 sales) on September 1, 1992. In 1989, it had sold over 650,000 copies, and by early 1995, Eazy-Duz-It had sold 2.5 million copies. On February 11, 1989, [...] "We Want Eazy" [...] charted on the R/Hip-Hop Songs at number 43. It stayed on the chart for over 15 weeks. The song also charted at number seven on the Hot Rap Songs chart. [...] "Eazy-er <b>Said</b> <b>Than</b> Dunn", the album's 3rd single, peaked at number 84 on the R/Hip-Hop Songs charts on May 6, 1989, where it would maintain some lower position on the chart for six weeks. [...] "Eazy-Duz-It" [...] charted on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number 39. In August 2015, a couple weeks after the release of the N.W.A. biopic film, Straight Outta Compton, the album re-entered the chart at #32 on the Billboard 200, out-peaking its original peak position in 1989 when it charted at #41 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

[...] During {{the second phase of the}} campaign, from June to August, the Japanese secured central Taiwan by occupying Miaoli and Changhua.

In the same document he sought to define his relationship to the Secretary of War and establish his primacy over the bureau chiefs, including his successor as Chief of Engineers. This was easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done. Most issues were not fully resolved until early the next century." ...|$|E

Historian Stephen Ambrose said Indian dead totaled 10 Lakota, 2 Cheyenne, and one Arapaho, {{some of them}} {{killed in}} [...] "friendly" [...] arrow fire rather than soldier's bullets. George Bent, a Cheyenne-Anglo man, said 14 Indian warriors were killed. White Elk said only two Cheyenne were killed, but he saw 50 or 60 Lakota dead – more, he <b>said,</b> <b>than</b> {{were killed in the}} Battle of the Little Big Horn 10 years later.

2500|$|The concept {{itself was}} {{certainly}} not a new one, but putting it into practice under the military dogma and commander egos {{of the day was}} easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done. Throughout 1942 in particular, the coordination and flexibility exercised between Coningham's Western Desert Air Force (WDAF) and the 8th Army has been contrasted with the more rigid relationship between the Luftwaffe and German ground forces. During the first week of July, 1942, WDAF flew 5,458 sorties against Axis forces, using the innovative tactic of leap-frogging airfields, and Erwin Rommel informed Berlin on 4 July that he was abandoning his El Alamein offensive to concentrate on defence. [...] Later, the tactic of bombing known as Tedder's carpet was developed.|$|E
2500|$|By a {{handbook}} or a portolan chart, a navigator {{could see}} immediately that, for example, Pisa lay 85 miles southeast ("Scirocco" [...] {{in the traditional}} compass rose nomenclature) of Genoa, and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that bearing for that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat. [...] A mariner wishing to sail from Majorca to Naples could tell the latter was due east ("Levante") by some 600 miles – but the island of Sardinia lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route. [...] This is easier <b>said</b> <b>than</b> done, as geographical coordinates did not exist during this era. [...] The only way to determine the exact position of the ship at sea would be to calculate via past bearing and distance travelled.|$|E

2500|$|According to Badu, the album's closing track, [...] "Out My Mind, Just in Time", is a three-{{movement}} song: [...] "The first {{movement is}} called 'Recovering Undercover Over-lover.' It actually {{sums up the}} whole album, because I'm talking about love and emotion – 'I need you to do this,' 'I {{want you to do}} this,' 'You make me feel like this,' 'Why don't you feel like this?' It's typical of how you feel in relationships. The second movement is called ... 'Easier <b>Said</b> <b>Than</b> Done,' and it's about {{how hard it is to}} change after you've been in a relationship for so long. And then the third movement is called 'But Not This Time,' because even though I've done things a certain way for so long, I won't do that this time". Andy Kellman of AllMusic described the song as being innocently as a piano ballad, before changing into a [...] "psychedelic, slow-motion soul-jazz" [...] song that sees Badu becoming [...] "increasingly fragmentary and tripped-out" [...] before being [...] "renewed." ...|$|E
2500|$|But its implied {{homosexuality}} {{resulted in}} the severance of several friendships with women who felt she had betrayed their sexuality. Garbo also ended their friendship at this time. Eva Le Gallienne in particular was furious, denouncing de Acosta as a liar and stating that she invented the stories for fame. This characterization is inaccurate since many of her affairs and relationships with women, including that with Le Gallienne, are confirmed in personal correspondence. An exception to this was Marlene Dietrich, who continued to correspond with her and loved the book. According to critic Patricia White, [...] "If she craved being seen, MdA was more careful about what she <b>said</b> <b>than</b> she is given credit for. She wrote a name-dropping memoir, but for something attacked for exaggeration, it barely alludes to homosexuality". In any case, she gained a reputation that was not appreciated by everyone. But as Alice B. Toklas, lover of Gertrude Stein and de Acosta's long-term friend, wrote to a disapproving critic, [...] "Say what you will about Mercedes, she's had the most important women of the twentieth century".|$|E
