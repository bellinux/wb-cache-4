Fokker immediately received a provisional order for 400 production aircraft, which were named D.VII by Idflieg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Interior brick-infill {{partitions}} {{are usually}} considered as non-structural components, and only their weight is {{accounted for in}} practical structural design. In this study, the brick-infill panels are simulated by compression struts to clarify their effect on the progressive collapse potential of an earthquake-resistant RC building. Three-dimensional finite element models are constructed for the RC building subjected to sudden column loss. Linear static analyses are conducted to investigate the variation of demand-to-capacity ratio (DCR) of beam-end moment and the axial force variation of the beams adjacent to the removed column. Study {{results indicate that the}} brick-infill effect depends on their location with respect to the removed column. As they are filled in a <b>structural</b> <b>bay</b> with a shorter span adjacent to the column-removed line, more significant reduction of DCR may be achieved. However, under certain conditions, the brick infill may increase the axial tension of the two-span beam bridging the removed column.

40|$|Indianapolis has a {{long-term}} vision to be a world-class caliber city. A key component to any world-class city is the sport component and stadiums in particular. With the impending {{end of the}} Indianapolis Colts contract with the city, they are demanding a new stadium {{in order to continue}} to reside in the state's capitol city. Some residents are concerned where the money will come from for a $ 685 million stadium while others feel as though providing a new stadium when the existing RCA Dome is in fair shape is a waste of funds. It is this public diversity that may very well kill the idea of a new stadium in Indianapolis and, in turn, lose the Indianapolis Colts. There is a larger underlying issue at hand besides an NFL team. The Indianapolis Convention Center is home to many top-notch events that have begun looking for other places to host their events. The problem is that the convention center is much smaller than it needs to be to host such events and without a change, the city will lose many of the activities that bring in large amounts of money. Hoosier stadium is a cure for these problems aesthetically, economically, and socially. First and foremost, the existing RCA Dome will be imploded. While this may seem wasteful it is important to create room for an expanded convention center. The focus of this thesis is the new stadium itself, not the convention center, so its role in this design is merely conceptual. The chosen site for the new stadium is just south of the existing RCA Dome where a large parking lot now resides. This site was chosen because it is in the most need of positive development as the surrounding area is beginning to become run-down. Thus, the theme for this thesis project, "Catalyst for A World-Class Downtown" becomes apparent. The idea is for the stadium to become an icon of the city; a place where businesses and corporations will want to move their headquarters near. The stadium itself will have the ability to hold nearly eighty thousand people and will utilize a retractable roof design. There will be a permanent roof over the seats in the stadium to protect fans from the elements but the portion over the field may be opened should the Colts management se fit. The capacity of the building will allow Indianapolis to potentially host a Super Bowl in the future; a venture which would bring in millions of dollars to the city. The most important aspect of the new stadium is to make people feel as though their tax dollars are being used to their benefit. The exterior concourses of the stadium attempt to accomplish this by having been expanded by one, thirty foot <b>structural</b> <b>bay</b> to create room for mall space. This mall in the concourse will be completely flexible meaning that there are no permanent walls and rooms other than the concession stands and restrooms located {{on the inside of the}} concourse. In the summer, the exterior windows are operational to allow this mall space to become "open-air". In addition, these concourses will be used year round and in conjunction with landscaped gardens all around the facility. Therefore, the garden areas become a wonderful transition from the city to the stadium. On a normal business day, it will not be uncommon for business men and women from the surrounding area to enjoy lunch in these gardens and possibly take part in shopping at the stadium mall. Solving the larger issue of constant connectivity to the city is a more tedious task but one that has been attained by the addition of a light rail system. The light rail system is incorporated to the North side of the stadium and utilizes a fully functional station and mall area. Users of the train will board from the second level on a balcony-like platform that overlooks the happenings below. In addition, it is possible to see the on-field activities while waiting for the train. Should the stadium personnel not want train users to see the activities on the field, there are electrically tinted windows that will turn opaque on cue. The train route will go straight to the airport to the West and through the city to the East. This stadium station will then become the main light rail hub for the entire city as it resides between the new convention center and stadium. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B.

40|$|The {{car body}} {{structures}} of modern trains are often formed of extruded aluminium panels. Their acoustic properties, particularly the sound transmission loss, {{have an important}} influence on the interior acoustic environment. In order to study the acoustic performance of extruded panels, their Sound Transmission Loss (STL) is studied using the coupled Wavenumber Finite Element method (WFE) and Wavenumber Boundary Element method (WBE). The damping of a typical structure is first measured in the laboratory to give suitable input values for the model. The predicted STL is compared with corresponding measurements of the sample panel, with good agreement above 400 Hz. Based on the validated model, an extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of different reinforcement rib styles on the STL. The effect of using extruded panels with rectangular, triangular and trapezoidal truss-core sections is studied in detail. Among the parameters studied, the number of bays in a given width has a great influence on the sound insulation. Considering practical use, both the mass and stiffness of each case are also considered. To give increased understanding of the STL behaviour, the dispersion curves are also studied. It is found that structures with better STL usually have fewer free wavenumbers below the acoustic wavenumber. For {{the same number of}} <b>structural</b> <b>bays,</b> a panel with triangular stiffening has the highest strength but also the largest mass, whereas a structure with rectangular stiffening has the least strength and lowest mass. In the evaluation, the weighted STL Rw and the spectral adaptation term Ctr are considered. The results are also considered relative to a mass law adjustment of the STL. It is found that the three cases which give the best results are a triangular rib panel with 4 or 5 bays in a 1  m width, and a trapezium case with 5 bays and inclination angle 25 °. These have an Rw that is 2 – 6  dB better than the reference panel, a smaller mass and a higher stiffness...|$|R

Therefore, resistance development of the C- 8 methoxy quinolone moxi¯oxacin was compared with that of its <b>structural</b> analogue <b>BAY</b> y 3118 (chlorine moiety at the C- 8 position), with Staphylococcus aureus used as the test organism. The spontaneous emergence of resistance was quanti®ed by counting the number of colonies growing on drug-free medium compared with moxi¯oxacin- or BAY y 3118 ±containing media. The multistep emergence of quinolone resistance was encountered by growing S. aureus over 8 passages in drug-containing medium.

Spontaneous mutation frequencies of for moxi¯oxacin and for BAY y 3118 were observed. Multistep resistance to moxi¯oxacin 211 276 3 10 4 3 10 developed slowly (2 -fold rise) but rapidly against BAY y 3118 (116 -fold rise). No resistance against moxi¯oxacin developed in this model, whereas resistance to BAY y 3118 began to develop after 4 h.

40|$|Industrialized {{building}} {{emerged as}} a consequence of the need for the economical and rapid provision of healthy and safe living environments. In both Europe and developing countries, concrete panel systems were gradually established as the primary building prefabrication method. However, concrete panel buildings demonstrated in time resistance to change, lack of adaptability to diverse sites and contexts and inefficiency in the use of the relatively expensive cement and steel. Open systems offer an alternative direction to industrialization in construction. In open systems, the differentiation of permanent from non-permanent elements and the organization of only the permanent ones in the form of a rationalized structural system (characteristic of open systems}, allow for the variable position and material composition of all walls. Nevertheless, conventional frame systems are not easily adaptable to diverse sites, since <b>structural</b> interdependency of <b>bays</b> and the need for alignment of elements allow only limited variability of building form. The developed Slab-Column System, presented herein, is a rationalized structural system which goes a step beyond conventional frames. Besides offering the possibility for flexible and changeable divisions of its structural platforms, the system is adaptable to a diversity of site conditions, thus broadening the applicability of large-scale prefabrication. by Floris Panayides.
