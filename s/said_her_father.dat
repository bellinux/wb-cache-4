2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of her {{indeterminate}} sentence, Spencer became eligible for hearings to consider her suitability for parole in 1993. In practice, very few people convicted {{on a charge of}} murder were able to obtain parole in California before 2011. , she has been unsuccessful at four parole board hearings. [...] At her first hearing, Spencer said she had hoped police would shoot her, and that she had been a user of alcohol and drugs {{at the time of the}} crime, which contradicted the results of drug tests done when she was taken into custody. In her 2001 hearing, Spencer for the first time <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> had been subjecting her to beatings and sexual abuse; he said the allegations were not true. The parole board chairman said that, as she had not previously told any prison staff about the allegations, he doubted whether they were true. In 2005, a San Diego deputy district attorney cited an incident of self-harm from four years earlier when her girlfriend was released from jail, as showing Spencer was psychotic and unfit to be released. The self-harm is commonly reported as scratching the words [...] "courage" [...] and [...] "pride" [...] into her own skin; however, Spencer corrected this during her parole hearing as [...] "runes" [...] reading [...] "unforgiven" [...] and [...] "alone." [...] In 2009, the board again refused her application for parole, and ruled it would be 10 years before she would be considered again.|$|E

She was overwhelmed to the point that she called for a meeting with all major television stations in Mexico and had them ask all the questions they wanted to ask, saying that if they did not ask then, they would never get answers because she planned on closing that chapter in her life because it was very painful to talk about something so private.|$|R
