5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early {{investigation}} of this phenomenon, he attributed the <b>skin</b> <b>damage</b> to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as <b>skin</b> <b>damage</b> in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

2500|$|Potatoes {{are usually}} cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set {{is the process}} by which the skin of the potato becomes {{resistant}} to <b>skinning</b> <b>damage.</b> Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer <b>skinning</b> <b>damage</b> during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures [...] with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.|$|R

40|$|Aloe vera gel {{has been}} widely used for healing of burn wound andradiation-induced photo-skin damages under the {{duration}} of grade< 2 mucositis, and positive or negative response to in vivo γ-rayradiation-induced tissue alterations and a possible prophylacticefficacy of aloe vera were comparatively evaluated in the review. Since aloe vera wound dressing gel reduced γ-ray radiation-inducedskin reactions in C 3 H mice by daily application for at least 2 -weeksbeginning immediately after radiation, a possible participation ofaloe polysaccharides in aloe vera gel was demonstrated for γ-rayradiation-induced <b>skin</b> <b>damages.</b> In vitro and in vivo insulin permeationenhancements by aloe vera gel were clearly revealed from theviewpoint of drug delivery system, and the treatment of insulinresistant mice with the polyphenol-rich aloe vera extract diminishedtheir insulin resistance. Modified aloe vera polysaccharides withaloe phenolic chromones, aloesin groups, decreased in insulinlevel observed in subjects in condition of pre-diabetic/metabolicsyndrome. Therefore, the possible prophylactic efficacy of aloevera extract for γ-ray radiation-induced <b>skin</b> <b>damages</b> may beresulted from synergistic effects taking place between phenolicingredients; chromones and aloe polysaccharides as adjuvants. Thepro-inflammation studies on insulin response, resistance and/orsensitivity of aloe phenolic ingredient(s) and polysaccharides areneeded to confirm possible prophylactic benefits of aloe vera gelfor photo/γ-ray radiation-induced <b>skin</b> <b>damages,</b> wound healing-andregeneration, and the prevention of age-related pathology...|$|R

25|$|Skin {{disease is}} {{encountered}} where excess porphyrins accumulate in the skin. Porphyrins are photoactive molecules, {{and exposure to}} light results in promotion of electrons to higher energy levels. When these return to the resting energy level or ground state, energy is released. This accounts for the property of fluorescence typical of the porphyrins. This causes local <b>skin</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{ozone layer}} has {{little effect on}} the longer UV {{wavelengths}} called UV-A (315–400nbsp&nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term <b>skin</b> <b>damage</b> in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see ultraviolet for more information on near ultraviolet).|$|E
25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), eating food or {{drinking}} water contaminated {{with high levels}} of coal tar creosote may cause a burning in the mouth and throat, and stomach pains. ATSDR also states that brief direct contact with large amounts of coal tar creosote may result in a rash or severe irritation of the skin, chemical burns of the surfaces of the eyes, convulsions and mental confusion, kidney or liver problems, unconsciousness, and even death. Longer direct skin contact with low levels of creosote mixtures or their vapours can result in increased light sensitivity, damage to the cornea, and <b>skin</b> <b>damage.</b> Longer exposure to creosote vapours can cause irritation of the respiratory tract.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{negative}} pressure mechanical ventilators {{are still in}} use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in England such as St Thomas' Hospital in London and the John Radcliffe in Oxford. The prominent device used is a smaller device known as the cuirass. The cuirass is a shell-like unit, creating {{negative pressure}} only to the chest {{using a combination of}} a fitting shell and a soft bladder. Its main use is in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function. However, it was prone to falling off and caused severe chafing and <b>skin</b> <b>damage</b> and was not used as a long-term device. In recent years this device has re-surfaced as a modern polycarbonate shell with multiple seals and a high-pressure oscillation pump in order to carry out biphasic cuirass ventilation.|$|E

40|$|Neoplastic {{disease and}} its {{therapeutic}} options {{have a huge}} impact on the patient's quality of life from both the emotional and the working point of view. Sociological research has revealed that gender also {{plays an important role in}} the emotional reaction to the disease. When faced with a neoplastic disease, men and women show significantly different reactions: women, as wives and mothers, are more subject and vulnerable to stress and they can have major psychological implications for the severe impact on body image. In 2002, at the Dermatological Clinic of the University of Naples "Federico II", Corrective Dermacosmetological Laboratory was activated to teach the most suitable techniques in order to disguise skin imperfections by means of an easily reproducible maquillage. Since 2010 the Laboratory is activating to help oncologic patients learn the best way of hiding temporary or permanent <b>skin</b> <b>damages</b> that cause serious discomfort because of the aesthetic modifications of their image. The corrective dermacosmetological camouflage is a technique aiming to learn to oncologic patients the best way of hiding temporary or permanent <b>skin</b> <b>damages</b> related to chemotherapy and radiotherapy: it is also important to contain any cicatricial results. At the laboratories of Naples 36 patients have been treated, 31 women and 5 men, aged between 19 and 72 years. The camouflage technique depends basically on the use of a number of opaque covering non irritant, hypoallergenic creams and powders of superior duration if compared to standard cosmetics. Results were supported by photos showing the excellent results achieved with this technique. Furthermore, an improvement in psychological problems caused by <b>skin</b> <b>damages</b> related to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery therapy was observed in all patients...|$|R
25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} (MIC) {{is extremely}} toxic. The {{threshold limit value}} set by the American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms includes coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as <b>skin</b> <b>damage.</b> Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung edema, emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air).|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} process, {{triggered}} primarily by UVB, {{there is an}} increase in production of melanin (melanogenesis), which is the body's reaction to direct DNA photodamage (formation of pyrimidine dimers) from UV radiation. Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning, and typically becomes visible two or three days after exposure. The tan that is created by increased melanogenesis typically lasts for a few weeks or months, much longer than the tan that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin, and is also actually protective against UV <b>skin</b> <b>damage</b> and sunburn, rather than simply cosmetic. Typically, it can provide a modest Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that tanned skin would tolerate up to 3 times the UV exposure as pale skin. However, in order to cause true melanogenesis-tanning by means of UV exposure, some direct DNA photodamage must first be produced, and this requires UVB exposure (as present in natural sunlight, or sunlamps that produce UVB).|$|E
25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. <b>Skin</b> <b>damage</b> from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the erythemal action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E

500|$|Welders wear {{protective}} clothing, including {{light and}} thin leather gloves and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the absence}} of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in stick welding or shielded metal arc welding, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very strong. Potential arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or arc eye and <b>skin</b> <b>damage</b> similar to strong sunburn. [...] Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light. Modern helmets often feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to the bright light of the struck arc.
