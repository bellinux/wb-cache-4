KGaA, Düsseldorf, Germany [...] in Europe in the 1970s where experiments with hot-melts {{were used to}} seal connectors and create <b>strain</b> <b>reliefs</b> for wires. The first commercial use of the Low Pressure Molding process was in the automotive industry. The driving force was to replace toxic and cumbersome potting processes, faster cycle times, lighter parts and environmentally safe components. Since then Low Pressure Molding has spread out to other areas such as industrial products, medical, consumer products, military, wire harness and any unique product {{that needs to be}} sealed and protected against the environment. Basically, where {{there is a need to}} seal and protect an electronic device there may be an opportunity to use Low Pressure molding as the solution. Automotive sensors in-cabin and even under hood, USB thumb drives, RF ID tags, moisture sensors, motor control boards, consumer products. In essence the process acts as a middle ground between plastic injection molding which subjects components to high pressure and temperatures that can often damage them and potting with resin a process that involves waste and lengthy curing times.|$|E

40|$|Titanium {{aluminide}} (TiAl) is {{a lightweight}} intermetallic compound {{with a range}} of exceptional mid-to-high temperature mechanical properties. These characteristics have the potential to deliver significant weight savings in aero engine components. However, the relatively low ductility of TiAl requires improved understanding of the relationship between manufacturing processes and residual stresses in order to expand the use of such components in service. Previous studies have suggested that stress determination at high spatial resolution is necessary to achieve better insight. The present paper reports progress beyond the current state-of-the-art towards the identification of the near-surface intragranular residual stress state in cast and ground TiAl at a resolution better than 5 μm. The semi-destructive ring-core drilling method using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used for in-plane residual stress estimation in ten grains at the sample surface. The nature of the locally observed <b>strain</b> <b>reliefs</b> suggests that tensile residual stresses may have been induced in some grains by the unidirectional grinding process applied to the surface. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|E

40|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>relief</b> in lattice {{mismatched}} heteroepitaxy {{is mediated}} by formation and/or propagation of dislocations. Due to their technological significance, {{the process of}} <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> in materials with face-centred cubic (fcc) lattices has been analyzed by several researchers 1, 2 following the work by Matthews and co-workers in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s 3 - 6.

This assumption has been used in all subsequent analyses of <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> in lattice mismatched heteroepitaxy [1, 2]. Based upon the known three-dimensional atomic structure of the dislocations in fcc lattices, we show that the assumption is not valid for the 60 degree dislocations that form/expand via the conservative glide process. For compressively (tensilely) strained films the assumption is valid only for the 90 degree dislocations that form/expand via aggregation of vacancies (interstitials).

The defects that are incorporated in the Gd films, with increasing film thickness, lead to an in-plane lattice relaxation.

40|$|The <b>strain</b> <b>relief</b> of heteroepitaxial bcc-Fe(001) films, {{deposited}} at 520 - 570 K onto MgO(001), {{has been}} investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. In accordance with real-time stress measurements, the tensile misfit strain is relieved during coalescence of flat, mainly 2 - 3 monolayers (ML) high Fe islands at the high thickness of similar to 20 ML. To accommodate the misfit between merging strain-relaxed islands, a network of 1 / 2 [111] screw dislocations is formed.

Methods: The ONHs of 9 subjects with POAG (pre-TE IOP: 25. 3 +/- 13. 9 mmHg; post-TE IOP: 11. 8 +/- 8. 6 mmHg) were imaged (1 eye per subject) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Heidelberg Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) before (0. 05), suggesting biomechanical variability across subjects.
