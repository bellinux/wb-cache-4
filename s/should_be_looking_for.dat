5|$|At a {{drive-in}} restaurant, Vinnie and Crazy {{make out}} with their girls. When Roz spots a car that she thinks Boogaloo is in, Crazy is quick to drive off after it. Crazy ends up shooting two of the black gang members in an alley, much to Vinnie's shock. Solly investigates {{the death of the}} two black gang members. He questions Boogaloo, who tells him that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the Stompers.|$|E
25|$|Before Johnson's brigades {{could start}} their {{attack on the}} advance Union position, at Ayres's request, Warren moved a brigade from Brigadier General and Brevet Major General Samuel W. Crawford's {{division}} toward White Oak Road {{in order to secure}} Ayres's position and to disperse the Confederate pickets. At 8:15a.m., Warren advised Ayres that Sheridan had implied in correspondence to him that Merritt's force had been dislodged from White Oak Road and that Ayres <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> an attack from the west or the north. Due to the condition of the roads and Gravelly Run, Crawford's men did not get into formation until 10:00a.m.|$|E

When investigating the case, Mulder and Dana Scully visit Dr. Terrance Berube (Ken Kramer), a scientist working in Gaithersburg, Maryland, whose car was being driven by Secare. That night, Deep Throat meets a second time with Mulder and insists he continue, despite Mulder's uncertainty on what he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> That night, Berube is confronted by the [...] "Crew Cut Man" [...] (Lindsey Ginter), who kills him and makes the death look like a suicide.|$|E

500|$|Tyndall had {{observed}} the electoral success achieved by Jean-Marie Le Pen and the French National Front during the 1980s, {{and hoped that}} by learning from their activities he could improve the BNP's electoral prospects. He saw the issue as being one of credibility among the electorate, declaring that [...] "we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> ways to overcome our present image of weakness and smallness". He ignored the significant impact that had been achieved by the French NF through moderating its policies and thereby gaining greater respectability among the electorate. While Tyndall had sought to keep skinheads and football hooligans out of the BNP, he still kept a range of Holocaust deniers and convicted criminals close to him. He expressed the view that [...] "we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves {{in order to make}} our features more appealing to our public". Conversely, in the early 1990s a 'moderniser' faction emerged in the party that favoured a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. They were impressed by Le Pen's move to disassociate his party from biological racism and focus on the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups. Tyndall opposed many of the modernisers' ideas and sought to stem their growing influence in the party, ...|$|E
2500|$|Successful guerrilla {{fighting}} {{needs the}} self-confidence and initiative {{of millions of}} free men, the support at risk and at heavy sacrifice of almost all the population, {{and a feeling of}} close comradeship and solidarity between the guerrilla troops and any regular army and air force supporting them. The Nazis cannot get these qualities at their service, in any of the occupied countries of Europe, even in Italy. We can. And therefore we should not think of guerrilla warfare only in terms of the present heroism of the Soviet Union, or a possible future resistance to invasion in this country. We should think of it also in terms of our own invasion of the Continent. We <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> ways of fighting, and combinations between ways of fighting that can enable a democratic force invading Hitler's Europe to mobilize and use the enormous power of the [...] "hundred million allies" [...] who can be ours.|$|E

50|$|Poverty {{and hunger}} in Africa are the {{greatest}} constraints to mental development and creativity.

50|$|Although {{treatment}} of an uncomplicated fracture of nasal bones is not urgent—a referral for specific treatment in {{five to seven}} days usually suffices—an associated injury, nasal septal hematoma, occurs in about 5% of cases and does require urgent treatment and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> during the assessment of nasal injuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem with}} modern society {{is that too}} many people attempt to cure their {{feelings}} of homelessness by seeking knowledge {{in the fields of}} science and art.

5000|$|The {{difference}} between anomalistic psychology and parapsychology is {{in terms of}} the aims of what each discipline is about. Parapsychologists typically are actually searching for evidence to prove the reality of paranormal forces, to prove they really do exist. So the starting assumption is that paranormal things do happen, whereas anomalistic psychologists tend to start from the position that paranormal forces probably don't exist and that therefore we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> other kinds of explanations, in particular the psychological explanations for those experiences that people typically label as paranormal.|$|E

50|$|Most {{of these}} {{theories}} implicates Aboriginal use of fire {{as a component}} of the changes to both plant and animal communities within Australia during the last 50,000 years. Clearly, Aboriginal people had some effect, but the significance of that effect is far from clear. It seems likely that the introduction of the intensive use of fire as a tool did indeed follow, but was not directly a consequence of, the extinction of the megafauna. If, as has been suggested, the megafauna remained in some areas until the Holocene, then we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> evidence within the last 10,000 years for changes induced by new Aboriginal burning patterns (Wright, 1986).|$|E
