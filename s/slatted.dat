5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally <b>slatted</b> grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
25|$|Timber tiers {{accommodate}} the seating, {{which is of}} <b>slatted</b> timber fixed on steel frames to the tiers. The seating is accessed {{from the front of}} the stand via three sets of brick and concrete steps, set symmetrically in the centre and toward either end, each of which has a double staircase. These have the same decorative iron balustrade as the main stand. Between the staircases at the front of the stand are concrete seating tiers with <b>slatted</b> timber benches. Behind the seating tiers the rear brick wall has arched openings with the same decorative metal balustrade as the stairs and front and sides of the stand. There is a rear promenade at this level, but several tiers of later timber seating have been installed here, restricting pedestrian circulation.|$|E
25|$|Sow stalls {{contain no}} bedding {{material}} and are instead floored with <b>slatted</b> plastic or metal to allow waste to be efficiently collected below. This waste is then flushed into open-air pits known as lagoons. A {{few days before}} giving birth, sows are moved to farrowing crates where {{they are able to}} lie down, with an attached crate from which their piglets can nurse.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 2008 the SCG Trust {{hosted the}} first 'Victor Trumper Day', a {{sporting}} and cultural retrospective organised by Sydney school teacher David Strange to honour {{the life of}} Trumper on the 131st anniversary of his birth. Former internationals and celebrities including Greg Matthews, Stuart MacGill, Greg Page, Mick Molloy and Tim Farriss wore <b>slatted</b> pads, sausage gloves and 1907 skull caps to recreate the Golden Age of cricket and raise money for charity in Trumper's name.|$|E
25|$|These {{consist of}} a number of {{uncovered}} stands, curved around the northern perimeter of the Main Arena, between the northeast end of the John MacDonald Stand and the Marshalling Yards at the northeast end of the arena. They are of concrete construction (concrete seating tiers supported on concrete piers), with brick or concrete in-fill to the sides. The seating consists of curved, <b>slatted</b> timber benches and is accessed via subways beneath the stands. The sub-floor beneath the northern-most stand provides kiosk space, with metal roller doors between the concrete piers opening to Ring Road. The sub-floor beneath the middle stand is utilised as the Cattleman's Bar. Sections of the seating on the northernmost of these open-air stands have been in-filled recently to provide access for horsemen entering the show ring for special display riding. There is a large sign {{at the back of the}} northern stand, with the lettering: MACHINERY HILL, which can be viewed from all over the show ring.|$|E
25|$|This {{building}} was a 1918 motor car garage. At one end it contains restored horse-drawn vehicles. There is {{a reproduction of}} an 1890 garden seat omnibus, with wooden, <b>slatted</b> seats on top, like garden seats. These vehicles have not {{been used in the}} UK since 1931. This reproduction has hydraulic disc brakes for safety. There is a brougham, a 19th-century gentleman's light one-horse carriage. This design {{is said to have been}} named after Lord Chancellor Brougham in the early 19th century. There is also a steamer, or Shand Mason steam fire pump of ca.1880. A team of horses pulled it, and steam powered it, at 250 gallons per minute. Firemen could get it ready in 7 minutes. It was successful enough for the manufacturers to export it worldwide - for example to the Warsaw Fire Guard - but it was expensive in coal and horses, and was superseded by motor pumps in ca.1900.|$|E
25|$|In a {{concentrated}} animal feeding operation (CAFO), {{it is considered}} normal for {{a large number of}} animals to continuously occupy a very small area. The aisles that animals use to move around are consequently constantly coated with a moist layer of manure and urine from the many animals, leading to ailments such as foot rot due to the constant wet exposure. The manure and urine is usually just scraped off into gutters below <b>slatted</b> surfaces, and the surfaces and gutters are rarely washed completely clean, so molds, bacteria, and insects can grow and thrive in the potentially infectious waste. Feeding areas in a CAFO are also rarely stripped bare and washed with a disinfectant, as this would reduce the time available for animals to eat continuously, so molds and bacteria are also able to become established where the animals eat. The close confinement and lack of general environmental cleanliness leads to easier spread of infection and increased sickness, requiring the regular feeding of antibiotics to keep the confined animals healthy but which also leads to antibiotic resistance for bacteria constantly present in the CAFO.|$|E
25|$|The {{stand now}} {{comprises}} only one level of timber tiered seating (originally two), with <b>slatted</b> timber benches and back rests, supported on steel frames {{bolted to the}} floor. The seating is accessed via three sets of brick and concrete stairs {{at the front of}} the stand. These are located at either end of the structure and in the middle, the central stair having a double staircase. Set into the front brick wall of each staircase is an inscribed stone plaque. That at the southeast end reads: This stone was laid by CE McDougall, President 18th Nov 1922 J Hutchinson, Builder. That in the centre stair reads: This stone was laid by His Excellency, Sir Matthew Nathan PC, GCMG, Governor of Queensland 18th Nov 1922 Richard Gailey Jnr FOIA, Architect. That on the northwest stair reads: This stone was laid by Ernest Baynes, Chairman, for and on behalf of the Council 18th Nov 1922. This stone also records the names of the 13 other RNA Councillors of the day and the Secretary. The front and staircase balustrades are of decorative cast iron with timber handrails, but the side balustrades are a later metal grille. At the top of the seating, later fire-exit doors have been cut in the brick rear wall at either end – these lead to fire-escape stairs.|$|E
500|$|TNA {{released}} a poster {{to promote the}} event featuring Raven and Rhino. A thirty-minute pre-show was <b>slatted</b> to take place prior to the telecast. Unbreakable was dedicated to the [...] "unbreakable spirit of the American people." ...|$|E
500|$|Genesis was {{announced}} in early-August 2005 on TNA's official website. It was planned for November13 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. This event caused a change in TNA's PPV schedule, as the November 2004 PPV event was titled Victory Road. This was a small change as TNA intended {{to stick with the}} other names used for PPVs throughout 2005. A promotional poster for the event was released prior by TNA featuring Jeff Hardy. TNA created a section covering the event on their website. A thirty-minute pre-show was <b>slatted</b> to take place prior to the telecast featuring two wrestling matches: Shark Boy versus the debuting Nigel McGuinness, and The Diamonds in the Rough (David Young, Elix Skipper, and Simon Diamond) versus Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens). TNA promoted the debut of a newly signed wrestler to occur at Genesis, which the promotion called a [...] "major acquisition." [...] Genesis was dedicated to World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Eddie Guerrero, who died the day of the event.|$|E
500|$|During the 1950s, Holden {{dominated}} the Australian car market. GM {{invested heavily in}} production capacity, which allowed the company to meet increased post-war demand for motor cars. Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden's {{ability to deal with}} rugged rural areas. 48-215 sedans were produced in parallel with the 50-2106 coupé utility from 1951; the latter was known colloquially as the [...] "ute" [...] and became ubiquitous in Australian rural areas as the workhorse of choice. Production of both the utility and sedan continued with minor changes until 1953, when they were replaced by the facelifted FJ model, introducing a third panel van body style. The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained iconic status and remains one of Australia's most recognisable automotive symbols. A new horizontally <b>slatted</b> grille {{dominated the}} front-end of the FJ, which received various other trim and minor mechanical revisions. In 1954 Holden began exporting the FJ to New Zealand. Although little changed from the 48-215, marketing campaigns and price cuts kept FJ sales steady until a completely redesigned model was launched. At the 2005 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, Holden paid homage to the FJ with the Efijy concept car.|$|E
2500|$|Outbound lumber traffic {{declined}} from 50,000 tons in 1906 [...] to 11,000 tons in 1919. [...] Pulpwood traffic increased as smaller spruce trees were harvested. The Phillips shop converted {{two-thirds of the}} flat cars for loading with 4-foot-long (1.2 meter) pulpwood logs by installing high, <b>slatted</b> sides and ends loosely resembling a stock car with doors and roof removed.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{force-feeding}} period, {{the birds}} are kept in individual cages, with wire or plastic mesh floors, or sometimes in small groups on <b>slatted</b> floors. Individual caging restricts movements and behaviours by preventing the birds from standing erect, turning around, or flapping their wings. Birds cannot carry out other natural waterfowl behaviours, such as bathing and swimming. [...] Furthermore, ducks and geese are social animals and individual cages prevent such interactions.|$|E
2500|$|... (In addition, <b>slatted</b> mouldboards are {{preferred}} by some farmers, {{though they are}} a less common type. They consist {{of a number of}} curved steel slats bolted to the frog {{along the length of the}} mouldboard, so that there are gaps between the slats. They tend to break up the soil more than a full mouldboard and improve soil movement across the mouldboard when working in sticky soils where the solid mouldboard does not scour well.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} an oast dates from 1574. It {{was a small}} building of [...] by [...] in plan, with walls [...] high. The central furnace was some [...] long, [...] high and [...] internal width. The upper floor was the drying floor, and only some [...] above the ground floor, hops being laid directly on the <b>slatted</b> floor rather than being laid on hessian cloth as was the later practice.|$|E
2500|$|The North American A-36 Apache (listed in {{some sources}} as [...] "Invader", but also called Mustang) was the ground-attack/dive bomber {{version of the}} North American P-51 Mustang, from which it could be {{distinguished}} {{by the presence of}} rectangular, <b>slatted</b> dive brakes above and below the wings. A total of 500 A-36 dive bombers served in North Africa, the Mediterranean, Italy and the China-Burma-India theater during World War II before being withdrawn from operational use in 1944.|$|E
2500|$|In about 1925 {{at least}} one Udet 8 was fitted with full-span Lippmann/Handley Page slats coupled to full-span ailerons which were lowered {{together}} as camber increasing flaps when the slats were deployed. It was one {{one of the earliest}} German aircraft to have slats. The <b>slatted</b> Udet 8 was recorded as a Udet 8a or Udet 8B in contemporary journals, though a modern source states that the U 8a (D-839) had a new wing with an area increase of [...] and a Sh-12 engine. D-839 is recorded as a U 8b in a reconstructed register.|$|E
2500|$|The rest {{house is}} entered via arched {{openings}} {{to the north}} and south elevations. [...] Inside the ceiling is pressed metal painted powder blue with gold plastic stars affixed; the floor has been painted red. Along the east and west walls are two long timber <b>slatted</b> seats. [...] On the walls are five World War I honour boards of metal set into concrete mouldings, one of which is reserved for the names of the dead. [...] In raised letters it reads: [...] "TO THE MEMORY OF OUR GALLANT BOYS WHO FELL IN THE WORLD'S WAR 1914–1919". [...] The boards record the names in alphabetical order with no military ranks or honours indicated. There is also an honour board for World War II and a plaque for Korea.|$|E
2500|$|Lautner first defined an {{architectural}} {{solution to the}} scale, function, and public space of car-oriented suburban architecture in his remodel of Henry's in Glendale in 1947. Googie's Coffee Shop, designed in 1949, stood {{at the corner of}} Sunset Strip and Crescent Heights, next to the famous Schwab's Pharmacy; regrettably it was demolished in 1989. It was distinctive for its expansive glass walls, arresting angular form, prominent roofline, and exuberant signage oriented to car traffic: an advertisement for itself. Another key Lautner work in the Googie genre was Henry's Restaurant (1957) in Pomona; its vaulted roof, resembling an inverted boat hull, arched over the interior booths and the large exposed beams (made from glue-laminated timber) carried through to the exterior, where they supported a <b>slatted</b> awning that shaded the drive-in area. Other architects spread the Modern aesthetic of the coffee shop/drive-in in such as Tiny Naylor's (Lautner employer Douglas Honnold), Ship's (Martin Stern, Jr.), and Norm's and Clock's (Armet and Davis.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of turkeys are reared indoors in purpose-built or modified buildings {{of which there are}} many types. [...] Some types have <b>slatted</b> walls to allow ventilation, but many have solid walls and no windows to allow artificial lighting manipulations to optimise production. [...] The buildings can be very large (converted aircraft hangars are sometimes used) and may contain tens of thousands of birds as a single flock. The floor substrate is usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon the controlled build-up of a microbial flora requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult domestic turkeys are usually maintained between 18 and 21°C. High temperatures should be avoided because the high metabolic rate of turkeys (up to 69W/bird) makes them susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking densities. [...] Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth. [...] Light intensity is usually low (e.g. less than one lux) to reduce feather pecking.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1973 model year, Chargers {{received}} new {{sheet metal}} (though {{at first glance}} only the rear roof [...] "C-Pillars" [...] looked different) and were in fact longer, wider, and slightly taller than the 1971-72 cars. Also new were vertically <b>slatted</b> taillights and new grilles. Hidden headlights were dropped, even as an option. The 318 was still standard, with the 340 (available only on the Rallye), 360 (2-barrel only), 400 (low power 2-barrel/single exhaust and high performance 4-barrel/dual exhaust) and 440 remaining as options. The SE models had a new roof treatment that had a [...] "triple opera window" [...] surrounded by a canopy-style vinyl roof. All other models had a new quarter window treatment, discontinuing its AMC Gremlin-style window {{in favor of a}} more conventional design. Total sales this year were around 108,000 units, the highest ever for the 1971-74 Charger generation, though more than 60 percent of the cars had the non-high performance engines. The 1973 Chargers, and all Chrysler products, were equipped with 5mph bumpers, front and rear.|$|E
2500|$|A single {{prototype}} was built, the LP500 (where the 'LP' {{stands for}} 'longitudinale posteriore', which means 'longitudinally in the rear' in Italian and refers to engine orientation and placement, whereas the 500 {{stands for the}} [...] engine displacement they intended to use). Painted bright sunflower yellow, the concept car {{proved to be a}} stunner at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971. Sporting Gandini's original design concepts, the car's design required extensive modification to qualify for mass-production. The two most notable changes were necessary because air-intake proved insufficient to cool the engine. The prototype had <b>slatted,</b> 'gill-like' intake ducts on the rear shoulders, and these were replaced with massive [...] "air box" [...] scoops that extended out from the vehicle's streamlined body. In addition, NACA style air ducts were cut into the body of the car beneath the B pillar, which required eliminating the prototype's traditional door handles and replacing them with handles of a unique configuration set into the portion of the ducts carved into the scissor doors. Aluminium-honeycomb sheeting, a concept utilized in the prototype design, was also dropped in preparation for production.|$|E
2500|$|As styling {{development}} commenced it was realised that {{to design}} another coach {{to match the}} success of the Panorama Elite series was to be a challenge. Looking at the existing range of Panorama Elite III it was decided to use the Elite's most striking feature, notably the size of the windows and the curves that departed in every direction. The front of the coach was to follow closely with Elite by utilising the same double headlights with a panel between them (although the centre panel depended on the chassis requirements). The slats again horizontal but were fewer in number and thicker. The sides of the grill were squared up and were of stainless steel and not aluminium. A chrome bumper with [...] overriders at the bottom with two steps to allow access to the windscreen. Pantograph wipers with speed control were added. The dome was <b>slatted</b> on the early models but was not popular so was removed and simplified from Supreme IV. The side profile again had angles going in all directions although the main change to the side was that the windows curved into the cant rail almost like the Mercedes-Benz O302 bodies. The effect was to catch the light and highlighted the whole coach at roof level. The rear was like Panorama Elite with vertical lozenge shaped lights but the units themselves were slightly bigger, squared, more definite.|$|E

60|$|I {{looked about}} the loft {{for the best}} means of {{accomplishing}} my purpose. As I have said, the place was over a carpenter shop. The roof was sloping to the floor, and at each end was a small window heavily <b>slatted.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dane rose stiffly, but {{he could}} see little except the belts of {{thinning}} haze which dimmed the waters ahead. He could hear the thunder of breakers on the invisible foot of the cliff. The light was growing each moment, the breeze dying fast, and presently the damp lugsail <b>slatted</b> against the mast.|$|E
60|$|From {{the room}} came a murmur of voices, and without {{speaking}} further the detective motioned for the Rover boys {{to join him}} beside the window. Although the <b>slatted</b> shutter was up, evidently {{the glass of the}} window had been let down its full length, for those outside could hear what was said within with ease.|$|E
60|$|He {{was heading}} eastward, and {{presently}} reached a wharf facing {{the harbor and}} not a great distance from the Congress Street bridge. Here there was a high board fence and a <b>slatted</b> gate, which for some reason stood partly open. Without a second thought, he slipped through the gateway, slid the gate shut, and snapped the hanging padlock into place.|$|E
60|$|She climbed {{with him}} to the flat roof of the apartment-house a {{detached}} world of <b>slatted</b> wooden walks, clotheslines, water-tank in a penthouse. He poked at things with his toe, and sought to impress her by being learned about copper gutters, the desirability of passing plumbing pipes through a lead collar and sleeve and flashing them with copper, and the advantages of cedar over boiler-iron for roof-tanks.|$|E
60|$|Just {{now she was}} tossing on {{the bosom}} of a big ocean, with nothing to keep her afloat but a miserable wooden {{hen-coop}} that had a plank bottom and <b>slatted</b> sides, through which the water constantly splashed and wetted her through to the skin! And {{there was nothing to}} eat when she became hungry--as she was sure to do before long--and no fresh water to drink and no dry clothes to put on.|$|E
60|$|The lashed wheel {{groaned and}} kicked softly, the riding-sail <b>slatted</b> {{a little in}} the shifts of the light wind, the {{windlass}} creaked, and the miserable procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened, whimpered, and at last wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on his tongue, spoke of the beauty of watchfulness, and slashed away with the rope's end, punishing the dories as often as he hit Harvey. At last the clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the tenth stroke little Penn crept on deck. He found two boys in two tumbled heaps {{side by side on the}} main-hatch, so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to their berths.|$|E
60|$|They found His Excellency {{seated in}} a great easy-chair, {{under the shadow of}} a <b>slatted</b> veranda, the floor whereof was paved with brick. He was clad, for the sake of coolness, only in his shirt, breeches, and stockings, and he wore {{slippers}} on his feet. He was smoking a great cigarro of tobacco, and a goblet of lime juice and water and rum stood at his elbow on a table. Here, out of the glare of the heat, it was all very cool and pleasant, with a sea breeze blowing violently in through the slats, setting them a-rattling now and then, and stirring Sir Thomas's long hair, which he had pushed back for the sake of coolness.|$|E
6000|$|... "The coat armour was {{everywhere}} used, and varied {{in form and}} style in almost every centre. There were two ways in which this was most commonly made. One of these was the <b>slatted</b> cuirass or corslet, which was formed {{of a series of}} narrow slats of wood set side by side vertically and fastened in place by interfacings of raw hide. It went all round the body, being hung from the shoulders with straps. The other was a kind of shirt of double or treble elk hide, fastened at the side with thongs. Another kind of armour, less common than that just described, was the long elk- hide tunic, which reached to and even below the knees and was sleeved to the elbow." ...|$|E
60|$|Daylight {{paused for}} nothing, {{heading for the}} door and pulling down his ear-flaps. Kama stood outside by the sled, a long, narrow affair, sixteen inches wide and {{seven and a half}} feet in length, its <b>slatted</b> bottom raised six inches above the steel-shod runners. On it, lashed with thongs of moose-hide, were the light canvas bags that {{contained}} the mail, and the food and gear for dogs and men. In front of it, in a single line, lay curled five frost-rimed dogs. They were huskies, matched in size and color, all unusually large and all gray. From their cruel jaws to their bushy tails they were as like as peas in their likeness to timber-wolves. Wolves they were, domesticated, it was true, but wolves in appearance and in all their characteristics. On top the sled load, thrust under the lashings and ready for immediate use, were two pairs of snowshoes.|$|E
60|$|In these gardens, and set {{close to}} the street, stood several pretentious villas and mansions, the <b>slatted</b> blinds and {{curtains}} of the windows of which were raised to admit of the freer entrance of the cool and balmy air of the night. From within there issued forth bright lights, together with the exhilarating sound of merry voices laughing and talking, or perhaps a song accompanied by the tinkling music of a spinet or of a guitar. An occasional group of figures, clad in light and summer-like garments, and adorned with gay and startling colors, passed him through the moonlight; so that what with the brightness and warmth of the night, together with all these unusual sights and sounds, it appeared to Jonathan Rugg that he was rather the inhabitant of some extraordinary land of enchantment and unreality than a dweller upon that sober and solid world {{in which he had}} heretofore passed his entire existence.|$|E
