5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of <b>Sardinia</b> show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In <b>Sardinia,</b> the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E

5|$|A. n. wolterstorffi, {{described}} by Otto Kleinschmidt in 1900, is resident in <b>Sardinia</b> and Corsica. It {{is the smallest}} of all the races, darker on the upperparts and more barred below than the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{interaction}} was also intense with the Italian peninsula {{and the western}} Mediterranean. Mycenaean products, especially pottery, were exported to southern Italy, Sicily and the Aeolian islands. Mycenaean products also penetrated further into <b>Sardinia,</b> as well as southern Spain.|$|E
5|$|From <b>Sardinia,</b> Italian Piaggio P.108 bombers {{attacked}} Gibraltar several times, {{mainly in}} 1942. The last raids on Gibraltar were {{done during the}} 1943 Allied landing in Algeria, when those bombers hit successfully even the Oran port.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May 1771, Louis Stanislas married Princess Maria Giuseppina of Savoy. Marie Joséphine (as she {{was known}} in France) was a {{daughter}} of Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy (later King Victor Amadeus III of <b>Sardinia),</b> and his wife Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Tripoli was {{a battle}} between the navies of the Kingdom of <b>Sardinia</b> and Vilayet of Tripoli on 26 September 1825 during the Sardinian-Tripolitanian war of the same year. In order to resist Tripolitanian demands for {{increased}} tribute, the Sardinian king sent a squadron to force Tripoli to a favorable peace treaty. The Tripolitanians refused to change their demands {{and as a result}} the Sardinian squadron assaulted the city of Tripoli, sinking several vessels and landing a force to attack the city. Suffering heavy naval losses the Tripolitanian government quickly agreed to a favorable peace treaty with <b>Sardinia,</b> thus ending the war on favorable terms for the Sardinians.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} water pipit is the mountains of southern Europe and Asia from Spain to central China, along with the Mediterranean islands of <b>Sardinia</b> and Corsica.|$|E
5|$|The {{main unit}} began its work in August 1976 in <b>Sardinia.</b> Don McLaughlan, {{then head of}} public {{relations}} at Lotus Cars, heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype Lotus Esprit with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences. While moving the car between shoots, Lotus test driver Roger Becker impressed with {{his handling of the}} car {{and for the rest of}} filming on <b>Sardinia,</b> Becker became the stunt driver.|$|E
5|$|Because silver was {{extensively}} used as {{a decorative}} material and an exchange medium, lead deposits came to be worked in Asia Minor since 3000BCE; later, lead deposits were developed in the Aegean and Laurion. These three regions collectively dominated production of mined lead until c. 1200BCE. Since 2000BCE, the Phoenicians worked deposits in the Iberian peninsula; by 1600BCE, lead mining existed in Cyprus, Greece, and <b>Sardinia.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, while Belisarius remained in Carthage strengthening its walls, Gelimer established {{himself and the}} remnant of his army at Bulla Regia. By distributing money {{he had managed to}} cement the loyalty of the locals to his cause, and sent messages recalling Tzazon and his men from <b>Sardinia,</b> where they had been successful in re-establishing Vandal authority and killing Godas. While waiting for Tzazon's arrival, the Vandal king's army also increased by the arrival of more and more fugitives from the battle of Ad Decimum, as well as by a contingent of his Moorish allies. Most of the Moorish tribes of Numidia and Byzacena, however, sent embassies to Belisarius, pledging allegiance to the Empire. Some even offered hostages and asked for the insignia of office traditionally awarded to them by the emperor: a gilded silver staff and a silver crown, a white cloak, a white tunic, and a gilded boot. Belisarius had been furnished by Justinian with these items in anticipation of this demand, and duly dispatched them along with sums of money. Nevertheless, it was clear that, as long as the outcome of the war remained undecided, neither side could count on the firm loyalty of the Moors. During this period, messengers from Tzazon, sent to announce his recovery of <b>Sardinia,</b> sailed into Carthage unaware that the city had fallen and were taken captive, followed shortly after by Gelimer's envoys to Theudis, who had reached Spain after the news of the Roman successes had arrived there and hence failed to secure an alliance. Belisarius was also reinforced by the Roman general Cyril with his contingent, who had sailed to <b>Sardinia</b> only to find it once again in possession of the Vandals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the granite rocks of the Mont Blanc massif were an {{important}} source of stone for constructing buildings; one hundred Italian stonemasons were brought to the Chamonix valley by Charles Albert of <b>Sardinia</b> for reconstructing the towns of Sallanches and Cluses, both of which had at that time just been destroyed by fires.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{ordered that}} no more {{transport}} flights be made. Albert Kesselring complained that this would deny the Axis forces vital supplies, and Göring once again permitted flights. This time they were to travel via <b>Sardinia,</b> {{but no more than}} 60–70 flights would be allowed per night; some 250 had been mounted daily before Flax. The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after her}} accession, {{a number of}} European sovereigns who had {{recognised}} Maria Theresa as heiress broke their promises; Queen Elisabeth of Spain and Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria, married to Maria Theresa's deprived cousin Maria Amalia and supported by Empress Wilhelmine Amalia, wanted portions of her inheritance. Maria Theresa secured the recognition from King Charles Emmanuel III of <b>Sardinia,</b> who had not accepted the Pragmatic Sanction during her father's lifetime, in November 1740.|$|E
5|$|Monaco {{has been}} {{ruled by the}} House of Grimaldi since 1297. From 1793 until 1814, Monaco was under French control; the Congress of Vienna {{designated}} Monaco as being a protectorate of the Kingdom of <b>Sardinia</b> from 1815 until 1860, when the Treaty of Turin ceded the surrounding counties of Nice and Savoy to France. Menton and Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, part of Monaco until the mid-19th century before seceding in hopes of being annexed by <b>Sardinia,</b> were ceded to France in exchange for 4,000,000 French francs with the Franco-Monegasque Treaty in 1861, which also formally guaranteed Monaco its independence. Until 2002, Monaco would {{have become part of}} France had the house of Grimaldi ever died out; in a treaty signed that year, the two nations agreed that Monaco would remain independent even in such a case. The current monarch is Albert II.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{spent time}} as {{inspector}} of coastal fortifications on the Mediterranean coast near Marseille {{while he was}} waiting for confirmation of the Army of Italy post. He devised plans for attacking the Kingdom of <b>Sardinia</b> as part of France's campaign against the First Coalition. Augustin Robespierre and Saliceti were ready to listen to the freshly promoted artillery general.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1861, {{the flag}} of the Kingdom of <b>Sardinia</b> was {{declared}} {{the flag of}} the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. This Italian tricolour, with the armorial bearings of the former Royal House of Savoy was the first national flag and lasted in that form for 85 years until the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July, the King's brother, the Count of Artois, left France {{with his}} wife and children, along with many other courtiers. Artois and his family took up {{residence}} in Turin, the capital city of his father-in-law's Kingdom of <b>Sardinia,</b> with the family of the Princes of Condé.|$|E
5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of <b>Sardinia.</b> This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from <b>Sardinia</b> to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Giro d'Italia was the 90th {{running of}} the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place from 12 May to 3 June 2007. The race began in <b>Sardinia</b> and {{finished}} in Milan, and featured five mountain top finishes, of which one was an individual time trial. The race also visited France and Austria in three stages.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{ground and}} naval forces were {{aided by a}} large aerial fleet of 3470 planes. The {{majority}} of them were stationed on Corsica and <b>Sardinia.</b> The tactical bombers and fighters had to support the landings directly, while the strategic element had to bomb German targets deep into France. The strategic bombing started well before the landing and targeted airports, traffic hubs, railroads, coastal defenses, and communication lines.|$|E
5|$|The Crimean War {{lasted from}} October 1853 until 1 April 1856 and was fought between the Russian Empire and an {{alliance}} of the United Kingdom, France, the Kingdom of <b>Sardinia,</b> and the Ottoman Empire. The majority of the conflict {{took place on the}} Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea and Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has been {{introduced}} outside its native range, but has not always become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to <b>Sardinia,</b> eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Dubai.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at the Pinewood Studios in London, Porto Cervo in <b>Sardinia</b> (Hotel Cala di Volpe), Egypt (Karnak, Mosque of Ibn Tulun, Gayer-Anderson Museum, Abu Simbel temples), Malta, Scotland, Hayling Island UK, Okinawa, Switzerland and Mount Asgard on Baffin Island in the then {{northern}} Canadian territory of Northwest Territories (now located in Nunavut).|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the island of <b>Sardinia</b> {{is best known for}} the {{polyphonic}} chanting of the tenores. The sound of the tenores recalls the roots of Gregorian chant, and is similar to but distinctive from the Ligurian trallalero. Typical instruments include the launeddas, a Sardinian triplepipe used in a sophisticated and complex manner. Efisio Melis was a well-known master launeddas player of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} concerted between Eastern Emperor Leo, Western Emperor Anthemius, and General Marcellinus, who enjoyed {{independence}} in Illyricum. Basiliscus {{was ordered to}} sail directly to Carthage, while Marcellinus attacked and took <b>Sardinia,</b> and a third army, commanded by Heraclius of Edessa, landed on the Libyan coast east of Carthage, making rapid progress. It appears that the combined forces met in Sicily, whence the three fleets moved at different periods.|$|E
5|$|The race began for {{the second}} year in {{succession}} with a team time trial on one of Italy's islands, in this case Sicily (in 2007 it had been <b>Sardinia).</b> The route contained only four stages that were officially deemed mountain stages, but several of the seven intermediate stages contained selective climbs. The Giro had four time trials, three of which were individual and one a team event. Six stages were classified as flat.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} {{agreement between}} the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38BC. One of Pompeius' naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and <b>Sardinia</b> to Octavian. Octavian lacked the resources to confront Pompeius alone, however, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37BC.|$|E
5|$|Troglita's {{success in}} {{restoring}} peace to Africa {{can be seen}} from the fact that in late 551, when Totila, king of the Ostrogoths, captured <b>Sardinia</b> and Corsica, Troglita was able to spare enough forces and send a fleet to reclaim them, albeit without success. The exact date of Troglita's death is unknown, but it is most likely that he died in 552 or soon after.|$|E
5|$|After 1302 {{the island}} kingdom was {{sometimes}} called the Kingdom of Trinacria. Often the kingship was vested in another monarch such as the King of Aragon, the King of Spain or the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1816 the island Kingdom of Sicily merged with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In 1861 the Two Sicilies were amalgamated with <b>Sardinia</b> and several northern city-states and duchies to form the Kingdom of Italy.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, <b>Sardinia,</b> among others—had {{achieved}} several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, in Italy the Coalition's achievements {{were more}} limited. In northern Italy, {{despite the presence}} of the most experienced of the Austrian generals—Dagobert Wurmser—the Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, which led to the formal peace treaty, the Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.|$|E
5|$|Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was {{conducted}} in mid-July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet and another in early August (Operation Style), albeit with only Force H covering the convoy. Several weeks later, Fury participated in Operation Mincemeat, during which Force H escorted a minelayer to Livorno to lay its mines while Ark Royals aircraft attacked Northern <b>Sardinia</b> as a diversion. In late September, the destroyer escorted another convoy to Malta in Operation Halberd.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Alberto, {{named after}} King Charles Albert of <b>Sardinia,</b> was laid down on 1 February 1892 at the Arsenale di La Spezia in La Spezia. The ship was {{launched}} on 23 September 1896 and completed on 1 May 1898. She was deployed to South America {{later that year}} and returned to Italy on 28 February 1899. Later that year Carlo Alberto {{was sent to the}} Far East and returned on 1 June 1900. After her return the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{music is}} {{sometimes}} divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system of three regions, southern, central and northern, proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated. Additionally, Curt Sachs proposed {{the existence of}} two quite distinct kinds of folk music in Europe: continental and Mediterranean, and others have placed the transition zone from the former to the latter roughly in north-central Italy, approximately between Pesaro and La Spezia. The central, northern and southern parts of the peninsula each share certain musical characteristics, and are each distinct from the music of <b>Sardinia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Impero {{was laid}} down in May 1938 and {{launched}} in November 1939. The entrance of Italy into World War II forced the Regia Marina to refocus its construction priorities on escort warships, so Impero was left incomplete. After Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943, {{the rest of the}} Italian Navy steamed to <b>Sardinia</b> to rendezvous with their American contemporaries. Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk for target practice. Sunk by Allied bombers in February 1945, she was refloated in 1947 and scrapped in Venice from 1948 to 1950.|$|E
5|$|In 533, Belisarius {{sailed to}} Africa with {{a fleet of}} 92 dromons, escorting 500 {{transports}} carrying an army of about 15,000 men, {{as well as a}} number of barbarian troops. They landed at Caput Vada (modern Ras Kaboudia) in modern Tunisia. They defeated the Vandals, who were caught completely off guard, at Ad Decimum on 14 September 533 and Tricamarum in December; Belisarius took Carthage. King Gelimer fled to Mount Pappua in Numidia, but surrendered the next spring. He was taken to Constantinople, where he was paraded in a triumph. <b>Sardinia</b> and Corsica, the Balearic Islands, and the stronghold Septem Fratres near Gibraltar were recovered in the same campaign.|$|E
