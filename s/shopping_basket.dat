40|$|Choosing checkouts in a {{supermarket}} is a common consumer decision that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we investigate the relative impact of queue length and average basket size on consumers’ waiting time expectations and checkout choice. Four studies highlight the importance of basket content, leading to a preference for longer queues where consumers have little loaded <b>shopping</b> <b>baskets</b> than shorter queues with fully loaded baskets. However, queuing perceptions change when focusing consumers’ attention on the time cost of payment at the checkout...|$|R

40|$|We study consumers’ {{motivations for}} buying organic food by {{analyzing}} their <b>shopping</b> <b>baskets.</b> Buying organic can {{be motivated by}} concern about sustainable development and/or self-interest (considerations related to health or product quality). Pro-social motivation is inferred from the presence of fair trade products in the consumer's basket; consumer self-interest is deduced from the presence of healthy and higher-quality products bearing special quality labels or certifications. Our results indicate that environmental motivation predicts organic food purchases better than health or quality considerations: the complementarity between organic and fair trade products is strongest. In addition, the household's socioeconomic background influences secondary motivations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStore {{switching}} is {{of major}} concern to retailers. In reaction, they heavily rely on sales promotions and therefore, indirectly, make manufacturers pay {{part of the}} price of store switching. Different consumers switch stores for different reasons. A more sophisticated understanding of these differences permits the development of marketing strategies to address store switching. Based on representative household panel data, our approach proposes segmenting households built on a combination of cluster analysis and managerial interpretation. Central to our approach is the development of a store-by-format share profile for each household. This profile is linked to switching patterns across stores for different types of <b>shopping</b> <b>baskets...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{rollator}} {{consists of}} a frame {{with three or four}} large wheels, handlebars and a built-in seat, which allows the user to stop and rest when needed. Rollators are also often equipped with a <b>shopping</b> <b>basket.</b> Rollators are typically more sophisticated than conventional walkers with wheels. They are adjustable in height and are light-weight, yet sturdier than conventional walkers. The handlebars are equipped with hand brakes that can be lifted or pushed downward to instantly stop the rollator. The brakes can also be used in maneuvering the rollator; by braking one side while turning the rollator towards that side a much tighter turning radius can be achieved.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{research}} {{carried out}} by Nielsen International suggests that about 72 percent of FMCG purchases are planned, but that 28 percent of supermarket purchases are unplanned or impulse purchases. The top unplanned purchases in the food category are candy (lollies), chocolate, cookies (biscuits), frozen desserts and snacks and the top unplanned purchases in the non-food category are cosmetics, air-fresheners, toothbrushes, hand-soaps and hand/body lotions. This explains why supermarkets place these types of products {{at the front of}} the store or near the checkout where the consumer spends more time and is more likely to notice them and therefore more likely to pop them into the <b>shopping</b> <b>basket.</b> Retailers use insights from this type of research to design stores in ways that maximise opportunities for impulse-buying.|$|E
