It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} a discipline implies a responsibility. Whose is it?

This distinction is fundamental. The historical review of the condition of object and/or subject in these studies reveals a crucial feature that defines both us and the Basque studies: our renunciation of their status of subject.

The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were <b>studied</b> <b>as</b> part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E

The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the mid 1970s. The latest piece of SR57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR210 was legislatively extended to San Bernardino in 1998. An unconstructed extension from Santa Ana south to Huntington Beach remains in the legal definition of SR57, and has been <b>studied</b> <b>as</b> a toll road above the Santa Ana River.|$|E
