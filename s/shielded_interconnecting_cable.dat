The flaps are hydraulically operated. <b>Interconnecting</b> <b>cables</b> synchronize the flaps throughout their range of travel and a limit switch located on the left flap sector prevents over-travel. An audible waning horn warns of flap extension to more than 25 degrees if the landing gear is not down and locked.|$|R
30|$|The {{existing}} optimization methods or formulations in {{the literature}} {{do not seem to}} be completely satisfactory. This is because, finding the optimal electrical interconnection layout without cable sizing leads to over-dimensioning of the <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cable</b> system. Moreover, decreasing the problem size by any clustering method without considering integration of all WTs or utilizing an insufficient optimization algorithm for such a complex problem may result in a local optimal solution.|$|R

Field-installable upgrade kits, {{consisting of}} a separate memory board, an appropriate number of 30-pin SIMMs, a mounting bracket and <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cable,</b> were made available to upgrade these early units to 1MB or 8MB. The price for the 8MB upgrade kit was around $495 in the mid-1990s. These early kits required considerable labor to install, including extensive disassembly of the programmer, as the memory board was designed to mount under the main circuit board.|$|R
50|$|In audio {{equipment}} the I²S sometimes forms an external {{link between the}} CD transport and a separate DAC box, contrary to purely internal connection within one player box. This may form {{an alternative to the}} commonly used AES/EBU or Toslink or S/PDIF standards. There is no standard <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cable</b> for this application. Some manufacturers provide simply three BNC connectors, an 8P8C ("RJ45") socket or a DE-9 connector. Others like Audio Alchemy (now defunct) used DIN connectors. PSAudio, Wyred4Sound use an HDMI connector.|$|R

30|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{attenuation}} constant were performed for different types of superconducting coaxial cables down to 4 K by impedance matched measurements [24 – 31]. In those works, the attenuation constant is typically evaluated from measurements of the transmission spectrum of the waveguide, which is subsequently corrected for the attenuation in the <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables</b> from room temperature to the cold stage in a reference measurement.
