40|$|Dry {{cleaning}} facilities using tetrachloroethene, {{also known}} as perchloroethylene (PCE) produce a solid waste consisting of <b>spent</b> <b>filtering</b> powder, mainly calcined diatomaceous earth, benthonites or other absorbent materials. These powders are normally used during dry washing for the organic solvent filtration and discoloration prior to its recovery by distillation and condensation with refrigerating fluid.

One of the new technologies for removal of turbidity from the effluent is ElectroCoagulation (EC) processes. This study aimed to examine the efficiency of continuous electrocoagulation in turbidity removal from <b>spent</b> <b>filter</b> backwash water. 			Materials & Methods: This study was non-continuous experiment. A rectangular cube electrocoagulation tank in 24 cm× 17 cm× 18 cm dimensions from Plexiglas with the volume of 7. 35 liter was made. In this tank there were 4 metal plates (electrode) (15 × 22 × 0. 1 cm); two electrodes as cathode and anode which were made of aluminum and iron, respectively. All of the tests were done in continuous flow. According to the study criteria (Time, Turbidity and pH), 126 sample got with the turbidity 320, 350, 400 NTU from rapid sand filter backwashing water, so they were tested in current density; 1, 1. 4, 1. 8, 2, 2. 4, 2. 8 and 3. 2 ampere in 3 selected detention times (10, 20 and 30 min).

Further, technology developed under this proposal would also have application for the use of liquid based fuels for fuel cell power generation. The program consists of four phases. Phase I will focus on developing a concept design and analysis and resolution of technical barriers concerning removal of sulfur-containing species in low sulfur fuels.

Furthermore, it is observed that the filtration efficiency measuredby two Coulter counters reaches a minimum value for a diameter close to 30 µm.

In addition, a metallographic analysis of <b>spent</b> <b>filters</b> shows that the density of thecaptured massive inclusions decreases exponentially between the filter inlet and the filter outlet. The initial filter coefficient can be derived, which is equal to 25 m^- 1 for a 30 -ppi filter grade(with a specific surface area of 1610 m^- 1), SiC inclusions 50 µm in diameter, and a filtrationvelocity of 0. 9 cm. s^- 1...|$|R
40|$|Coagulation is an {{effective}} pre-treatment process in membrane filtration for recycling <b>spent</b> <b>filter</b> backwash water (SFBW). To optimize {{the operation of the}} coagulation/filtration process for SFBW recycling, {{it is important to understand}} the critical role of coagulation mechanism on membrane filtration. In this study, SFBW samples were coagulated with polyaluminum chloride (PACI), followed by a dead-end micro-filtration (MF), and the mean permeate flux and permeate quality were determined. The results showed that pre-coagulation improved the flux decline and the degree of the improvement was closely related to coagulation mechanisms. The permeate flux was enhanced most effectively by precipitation charge neutralization (PCN) coagulation, followed by charge neutralization and then sweep flocculation. Close examination of cake properties indicated that the reduced cake resistance (R(c)) was subjected to the coagulated SFBW flocs in response to different coagulation mechanism. Smaller flocs, induced by PCN, were more compact and stronger, forming less compressible cake, which facilitated membrane filtration, while slower membrane filtration was observed when more compressible cake formed from larger flocs of looser and weaker structure. Coagulation mechanism also governed the size distribution of SFBW floc, which is strongly related to the subsequent cake compressibility as well as membrane permeability in membrane filtration.

40|$|High {{efficiency}} mist eliminators (HEME) {{and high}} efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA) made of High fiberglass {{will be used}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS) to remove particulate matter from offgases generated during melter feed preparation and vitrification of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). These filters will be contaminated with high-level, radioactive species and also with various high-boiling organic compounds. For this reason, a process was developed at the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) that will dissolve the <b>spent</b> <b>filters</b> so that the residues may be recycled to the HLW tanks for eventual vitrification. This process involves boiling the filters sequentially in NaOH, HN 0 {sub 3 } and NaOH, while contained in a stainless steal wire mesh frame assembly. The objective of this communication is to present some of the original preliminary work done by Ritter on the simple one-step dissolution process. The results from six bench-scale experiments are reported for the dissolution of an organically-fouled sample of HEME obtained from the Integrated DWPF Melter (IDMS) offgas filtration system. The preliminary effects of filter packing density, air sparging versus rotating basket agitation, fouling, and adding Triton X- 405 as a dispersing agent are reported...|$|R
