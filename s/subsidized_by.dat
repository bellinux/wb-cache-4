Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be <b>subsidized</b> <b>by</b> the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat.

The route from Bodø to Røst was made subject to public service obligation from 1 April 1997, which was won by the incumbent, after beating Valdresfly and Helikopter Service in the auction. The following contract, valid from 1 April 2000, was awarded to Guard Air, but this company folded in 2001.

5|$|During {{the period}} 1814–1815, Hermes o Logios reached an {{absolute}} low, with seven issues in 1814 {{and only one}} in 1815, which consisted of 16 pages written by Korais and directed against his ideological adversary, the conservative scholar, Neophytos Doukas. On the other hand, Gazis returned. In the following years, however, the periodical was <b>subsidized</b> <b>by</b> the princes of Moldavia, Scarlat Callimachi and Michael Soutzos. Apart from the difficulties faced, 1816 was a turning point, as two scholars and adherents of Korais, Theoklitos Farmakidis and Konstantinos Kokkinakis, were placed in charge. Consequently, Hermes o Logios actually became an outlet for Korais and continued to appear without interruption until the Greek War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be {{sufficient}} to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development costs for the T2000 were in part <b>subsidized</b> <b>by</b> the government, as the high-tech product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E
5|$|B {{service was}} also cut due to {{financial}} {{problems in the}} late 1930s and again after World War II; by 1950, Pittsfield was served by eight Boston-Albany round trips per day. The four daily trips to North Adams ended in 1953. The opening of the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1957 and the Berkshire Thruway two years later provided {{for the first time}} an auto route to western Massachusetts superior to the narrow and winding Route 20; this effectively decimated long distance service on the B In January 1960 the NYC received permission to discontinue all B service that April, but public outcry prevented full cancellation. On April 24, 1960, stops west of Framingham except Worcester, Palmer, Springfield, and Pittsfield were closed; Boston-Albany service via Pittsfield was reduced to just 3.5 daily round trips. Still facing losses, the B was finally fully absorbed into the NYC in 1961, effectively <b>subsidized</b> <b>by</b> its popular New York commuter service. The crack New England States, introduced in 1938, was combined with the 20th Century Limited west of Buffalo on November 5, 1967.

5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are <b>subsidized</b> <b>by</b> many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E
