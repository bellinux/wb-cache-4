5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community of <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government <b>scientists,</b> <b>who</b> supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Fermi {{served under}} J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the {{detonation}} {{of the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> have elements named after them.|$|E

5|$|Cockcroft {{was shocked}} when he was {{informed}} on 10 September 1945 that the British physicist Alan Nunn May, {{who worked at the}} Chalk River Laboratories, was a Soviet spy. In August 1947, Cockcroft was one of the <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> signed a petition urging that Nunn May's ten-year prison sentence be reduced, an act he later regretted.|$|E
5|$|Contagion premiered at the 68th Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy on September 3, 2011, {{and went}} on general release on September 9. The film was well {{received}} by critics, who praised the narratives and the performances of various actors and actresses. It was also well received by <b>scientists,</b> <b>who</b> praised its accuracy. Commercially, the film was a box office success. Budgeted at $60 million, Contagion attained $135 million in box office revenue during its theatrical run.|$|E

5|$|In London Smith {{tended to}} neglect the zoological {{parts of the}} collection, he added some {{specimens}} and also gave some specimens away.

5|$|Teller {{returned}} to Los Alamos in 1950 {{to work on}} the project. He insisted on involving more theorists. but many of Teller's prominent colleagues, like Fermi and Oppenheimer, were sure that the project of the H-bomb was technically infeasible and politically undesirable. None of the available designs were yet workable. However Soviet <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> had worked on their own hydrogen bomb have claimed that they developed it independently.|$|E

5|$|When World War II began, Teller {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} to the war effort. On the advice of the well-known Caltech aerodynamicist and fellow Hungarian émigré Theodore von Kármán, Teller collaborated with his friend Hans Bethe in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to <b>scientists</b> <b>who</b> were studying missile re-entry.|$|E

The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E
