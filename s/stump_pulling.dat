40|$|ABSTRACT- Historically, {{forest roads}} on the BC coast have {{sometimes}} been constructed using stumps and log cribs {{to retain the}} road fill on steep slopes. However, experience has shown that road fill failures may occur after several years often due to root strength deterioration. Currently, B. C. ’s forest Practices Code permits the use of logs and stumps to retain the road fill if the technique is prescribed as a “measure to maintain slope stability ” and the road will be permanently deactivated within five years of construction. Such measures must be prepared by a “qualified registered professional” (QRP). A strict interpretation of the code may lead QRPs to prepare a geotechnical design for the road fill retention structure. At present more information is needed to develop design criteria for log and stump retaining structures, specifically load carrying capacity and failure characteristics of old-growth stumps present on coastal BC terrain. Therefore, the Forest Engineering Research Institute of Canada (FERIC) in cooperation with Weyerhaeuser Company’s Ltd. ’s B. C. Coastal Group and EBA Engineering Consultants Ltd., conducted tests in September 2000 {{in order to determine}} the strength of typical old-growth Douglas-fir stumps.

5000|$|On October 13, 1857, Mother Mary Cecilia Bailly, general {{superior}} of the Congregation, purchased 30.39 acre {{just east}} of the Shell Chapel, but nothing was done to prepare the ground until 1860. That year, a <b>stump</b> <b>puller</b> was hired, cemetery limits were set, and work on the cemetery began.|$|R
50|$|Under R.B. Smith's direction, {{his brother}} Clarence Herbert Smith {{created the first}} stump-jump plough, {{entitled}} the Vixen, in 1876. The South Australian government had offered a reward of £200 to anyone who could develop an effective mechanical <b>stump</b> <b>puller</b> due to frustration with lack of productivity efficiency on its farms with current equipment.|$|R
50|$|They {{are formed}} {{either by the}} long term {{presence}} and growth of tree roots or when a large tree is blown over or has its <b>stump</b> <b>pulled</b> out which tears out a quantity of soil along with the roots.

50|$|The wrestler {{grabs the}} legs of an {{opponent}} lying supine while standing over his opponent, steps {{in front of his}} opponent's arms, and either remains standing or falls backwards, stretching the legs back. A single leg variation, also known as a <b>Stump</b> <b>Puller,</b> involves only one of the opponent's legs being stretched and a figure-four leglock variation as well. This move {{can be used as a}} pin as well as a submission maneuver.|$|R

50|$|Construction began July 4, 1817, at Rome, New York. The first 15 mi, from Rome to Utica, {{opened in}} 1819. At that rate, the canal {{would not be}} {{finished}} for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through virgin forest and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They <b>pulled</b> out the <b>stumps</b> with an innovative <b>stump</b> <b>puller.</b> A pair of huge wheels were mounted loose on an axle. A large wheel, barely smaller than the others, was fixed {{to the center of}} the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The mechanical advantage (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses, and mules could build a mile in a year.|$|R
50|$|Selecting one {{wild horse}} that is {{marked with a}} white streak on its face, the cowboy lassoes the horse and cinches the rope to a large <b>stump,</b> {{gradually}} <b>pulling</b> the animal closer to him. Once the wild horse gets used to his hands near the head, ears and neck, the cowboy ties a rope halter on its head. The {{next step is to}} introduce a loose halter, fitted without a bridle and bit and finally, a blanket and saddle on the half-broken steed.|$|R

In the legend of Kashikobuchi, Sendai, a voice was heard saying, [...] "clever, clever", ("kashikoi, kashikoi"), after the tree <b>stump</b> was <b>pulled</b> into the water. The legend is thought to be the origin of the name Kashikobuchi or [...] "clever abyss".

40|$|When {{orchards}} {{reach the}} end of the productive cycle, the stumps removal becomes a mandatory operation to allow new soil preparation and to establish new cultivations. The exploitation of the removed stump biomass seems a valuable option, especially in the growing energy market of the biofuels; however, the scarce quality of the material obtained after the extraction compromises its marketability, making this product a costly waste to be disposed. In this regard, the identification of affordable strategies for the extraction and the cleaning of the material will be crucial in order to provide to plantation owners the chance to sell the biomass and offset the extraction costs. Mechanical extraction and cleaning technologies have been already tested on forest stumps, but these systems work on the singular piece and would be inefficient in the conditions of an intensive orchard, where stumps are small and numerous. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the possibility to exploit a natural stumps cleaning system through open-air storage. The tested stumps were obtained from two different vineyards, extracted with an innovative <b>stump</b> <b>puller</b> specifically designed for continuous stump removal in intensively-planted orchards. The effects of weathering were evaluated to determine the fuel quality immediately after the extraction and after a storage period of six months with respect to moisture content, ash content, and heating value. Results indicated interesting storage performance, showing also different dynamics depending on the stumps utilized...|$|R

25|$|The {{fifth and}} final Test started on 8 September, at the Oval in London. It entered its final day with England batting {{in their second}} innings, 40 runs ahead with nine wickets in hand. Australia needed a win to force a 2–2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give the Ashes to England and end 16 years and eight series of Australian dominance. After a day of {{fluctuating}} fortunes, England established a lead of 341 after Kevin Pietersen's maiden century, and Australia batted for one over before the teams went off for bad light, the <b>stumps</b> were <b>pulled</b> out of the ground, and the match was declared a draw to ensure {{the return of the}} Ashes to England.|$|R
6000|$|And verily {{the strange}} sense of rapture and enchantment {{was no less}} in the mother herself. There is no charm perhaps {{equal to that of}} a {{primrose}} bank on a sunny day in spring, sight, sound, scent all alike exquisite. It comes with a new and fresh delight even to those to whom this is an annual experience, and to those who never saw the like before it gives, like the first sight of the sea or of a snowy mountain, a sensation never to be forgotten. Fret, fatigue, anxiety, sorrow all passed away like dreams in that sweet atmosphere. Carey, like one of her children, absolutely forgot everything in the charm and wonder of the scene, in the pure, delicate unimaginable odour of the primroses, in debating with Allen whether (cockneys that they were) it could be a nightingale [...] "singing by day when every goose is cackling," [...] in listening to the marvellous note, only pausing to be answered from further depths, in the beauty of the whole, and in the individual charm of every flower, each heavily-laden arch of dark blue-bells with their curling tips, so infinitely more graceful than their pampered sister, the hyacinth of the window-glass, of each pure delicate anemone she gathered, with its winged stem, of the smiling primrose of that inimitable tint it only wears in its own woodland nest; and when Allen lighted on a bed of wood-sorrel, with its scarlet stems, lovely trefoil leaves, and purple striped blossoms like insect's wings, she absolutely held her breath in an enthusiasm of reverent admiration. No one can tell the happiness of those four, only slightly diminished by Armine's getting bogged {{on his way to the}} golden river of king-cups, and his mother in going after him, till Allen from an adjacent <b>stump</b> <b>pulled</b> them out, their feet deeply laden with mud.|$|R

He employed her to weed around the school and <b>pull</b> <b>stumps</b> from the runway, when she offered her services for free. Mawuli skilfully cut the trees, showing analytical ability to determine the most efficient means of extraction. Porter recognized the same skill when {{he asked her to}} help him with an airplane he was assembling. Mawuli's ability to quickly learn, master the skills and tools used to build an airplane, prompted Porter to give her a paid job as his apprentice and teach her to fly.|$|R
5000|$|Collins hired {{predominantly}} black work crews from [...] "Colored Town", {{now known as}} Overtown, in his orchards and for clearing the mangrove forests on the barrier islands that would become Miami Beach. His crews used imported Asian elephants for <b>pulling</b> <b>stumps</b> and heavy lifting as well as mules and machinery. The black workers who did the work of clearing the mangroves and building solid land in Miami Beach out of a mangrove sandbar were unable to purchase property on the new land because the Lummus brothers' Ocean Beach Realty Company sold lots only to whites, and Fisher's Alton Beach Realty Company sold much bigger and more expensive lots for more expensive luxury homes.|$|R
2500|$|If a fielder {{uses the}} ball to remove the bails from either set of stumps whilst the batsmen are running between the wickets (or {{otherwise}} away from the crease {{during the course of}} play), then the batsman (striker or non-striker) is out. The batsman nearest the set of stumps from which the bails were removed, but not actually in safe territory, is given out. If the batsman has any part of his body or his bat (if he is holding it) on the ground behind the line of the crease, then he cannot be run out (except if both batsmen are {{on the same side of}} a crease) i.e. on the line is considered as out; frequently it is a close call whether or not a batsman gained his ground in this way before the bails were removed. (The difference between stumped and run out is that the wicket-keeper may stump a batsman who goes too far forward to play the ball (assuming he isn't attempting a run), whilst any fielder, including the keeper, may run out a batsman who goes too far for any other purpose, including for taking a run.) [...] If the bails have already been removed, a fielder can remove a remaining <b>stump</b> by <b>pulling</b> it out or hit out the stump (ensure that the stump is fully out of ground) from the ground with the ball in their hands. [...] A fielder can also [...] "remake" [...] the stumps and remove a stump/bail to effect a run out.|$|R
5000|$|The 27th Service Group {{would have}} the mission of {{training}} new Service Groups prior to their deployment to the overseas combat Air Forces. The advance element of the 27th, the 37th Service Squadron arrived at the station in July 1942 to perform guard duty and to prepare the base for an official opening. The Air Force opened the station, initially named the Service Group Training Center officially on 7 July, and it was placed {{under the jurisdiction of}} Air Service Command. Over the next several weeks, additional personnel were assigned (the Hq. & Hq. Sq. and the 826th QM Company. Later, the 1063rd Signal Co., the 90th Service Sq., and the 1728th, 1729th, 2064th and 2065th QM Companies) Although open, the station was far from ready to perform its mission. Early life at the Service Group Training Center is officially described as [...] "rugged".

No furloughs were given, and the men lived in tents.|$|R
60|$|Ten {{years are}} a {{century in the}} history of a {{perfectly}} new settlement. The changes they produce are even surprising, though in ordinary cases they do not suffice to erase the signs of a recent origin. The forest is opened, and the light of day admitted, it is true; but its remains are still to be seen in multitudes of unsightly stumps, dead standing trees, and ill-looking stubs. These vestiges of the savage state usually remain a quarter of a century; in certain region they are to be found for even more than twice that period. All this, however, had captain Willoughby escaped, in consequence of limiting his clearing, in a great measure, to that which had been made by the beavers, and from which time and natural decay had, long before his arrival, removed every ungainly object. It is true, here and there a few acres had been cleared on the firmer ground, at the margin of the flats, where barns and farm buildings had been built, and orchards planted; but, in order to preserve the harmony of his view, the captain had caused all the <b>stumps</b> to be <b>pulled</b> and burnt, giving to these places the same air of agricultural finish as characterized the fields on the lower land.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1880 and 1955, the {{dominant}} {{ethnic groups in}} Wyandanch were the German-Americans and Austrian-Americans. The earliest homes built in Wyandanch south of the LIRR were built by German and Austrian-American families. About a hundred [...] "honest and frugal" [...] German and Austrian-American families lived in Sheet Nine of the [...] "City of Breslau" [...] neighborhood {{as early as the}} 1880s. Many members of these Sheet Nine families were skilled workers, gardeners, carpenters, plumbers, stable workers and servants on the nearby August Belmont estate and horse breeding establishment in North Babylon (1865) and on the Corbin, Guggenheim and Phelps estates in North Babylon. Sheet Nine Germans and Austrians also worked in the Wyandance Brick and Terra Cotta works and cut brush and <b>pulled</b> <b>stumps</b> for the construction of Long Island Avenue (Conklin Street) in 1895. Prosperous German- and Austrian-Americans also lived in the hilly, secluded and sylvan Carintha Heights section, west of Conklin Street, which was developed by Brosl Hasslacher after the construction of William K. Vanderbilt's Motor Parkway. Hasslacher helped Vanderbilt assemble plots of land in Wheatley Heights for the right-of-way for his state-of-the-art parkway. Hasslacher built the Chateau Lodge (later the very popular Chateau Restaurant) off Hasslacher Boulevard (later Chateau Drive).|$|R
5000|$|Attempting to rid {{themselves}} {{of the problem of}} the protestors, English Heritage gained an interim injunction banning a series of the most prominent protestors from the vicinity of the site, including Des Crow, Geoff Needham, Buster Nolan and Rollo Maughfling, the self-declared [...] "Archdruid of Stonehenge and Glastonbury", who at one point climbed on top of Seahenge to declare an eight-point proclamation. Needham and Maughfling however successfully contested the ban, as the court agreed that neither of them had attempted to obstruct the archaeologists work. The publicity and controversy surrounding the excavation led the British television company Channel 4 to commission a special documentary episode of their archaeological series Time Team in which the excavation at Seahenge would be documented and a reconstruction of what the site would have originally looked like built. After several weeks work, the excavators decided to physically remove the main timbers from the site, an event for which the media had been tipped off, and so a wide variety of protestors turned up, along with a group of police officers to ensure that they did not cause trouble for the excavators. However, as the central tree <b>stump</b> was being <b>pulled</b> out by a digger, a young female protestor ran under the rope cordoning off the site and headed towards the excavation until she was restrained by excavators and then by police.|$|R
2500|$|Brian Close was {{replaced}} by Colin Cowdrey for the MCC tour of the West Indies in 1967–68, his third spell as England captain and {{he was determined to}} make a success of it. Barrington and the MCC fared poorly in the run up matches and with West Indian supporters constantly telling him [...] "Charlie's waiting for you man. He'll kill you". Barrington was so upset that told his wife that he wouldn't tour again. In the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad Cowdrey won the toss and batted with Boycott and Edrich adding 80 for the first wicket and Barrington coming in against the spinners at 110/2. Soon after Gary Sobers responded to the crowd and brought on Griffith, but Barrington twice called him to halt as the chanting of the crowd interfered with his concentration. Although hit with bouncers on the shoulders and back he survived the five over spell and the tired bowler was taken off. He brought up his 50 with a six off Lance Gibbs and added 134 with Cowdrey and 188 with Tom Graveney before hitting Gibbs for another six to bring up his 20th century. When he saw the ball sailing into the stands the 37-year-old Barrington took off his cap and waved his fist in triumph. He was finally caught by Griffith off Gibbs for 143, the second time that he had made a century in four successive Tests. England made 568 and the West Indies followed on (Barrington dismissing Sobers), but survived the last day on 243/8 for a draw. Barrington made 63 in the Second Test at Sabina Park, Jamaica, again stopping Griffith's run up as the crowd went wild. John Snow took 7/49 and the West Indies followed on again, but when the local favourite Basil Butcher was out at 204/5 the crowd disagreed with the decision and rioted, even though Butcher had walked. Tear gas was used by the Jamaican police to restore order and play resumed, but the England team lost their hold on the game as Sobers made 113 not out and the West indies 391/9. Needing only 159 to win England collapsed to 68/8 (Barrington 13), but somehow managed a draw. The Third Test at Bridgetown, Barbados was another draw (Barrington 17) and the Fourth back at Trinidad looked like going the same way. The West Indies had made 526/7 and England replied with 404, where Cowdrey (148) and Barrington (48) added 133 for the third wicket. Sobers, remembering the England collapse in the Second Test declared at 92/2 leaving England 215 to win in 135 minutes, a run-rate they had yet to achieve in the series [...] Cowdrey was uncertain, but Barrington convinced him to go for the win, shouting [...] "Will we go for it? Of course we'll go for it. That's what we've come all this way for, isn't it?" [...] Barrington did not bat, but England made 215/3 and won by seven wickets. Sobers was lambasted by the Caribbean press for his cavalier declaration, but responded in the Fifth Test in Georgetown, Guyana with 152 and 95 not out, Barrington taking his wicket again in the first innings, and England were struggling at 206/9 when <b>stumps</b> were <b>pulled</b> on the last day, but they drew the match and won the series. Barrington had made only 4 and 0, but finished with 288 runs (41.14) and 5 wickets (51.40), having dismissed Sobers and Seymour Nurse twice each and the opener Steve Camacho.|$|R
25|$|After one Thomson over on {{the third}} day the gloom made the umpires <b>pull</b> <b>stumps</b> with England 1/0. Dennis Amiss had made his name as a heavy scoring batsman with tallies of 663 runs (82.87) in the West Indies in 1973–74 and 370 runs (92.50) against India and 220 runs (55.00) against Pakistan in 1974 with five big centuries to his credit. He needed only 93 runs to make 1381 runs in 1974 and equal the record made by Bobby Simpson in 1964. Here, on a flat wicket at Melbourne he showed his talent in Australia by making 70 runs in an opening stand of 115 in the first session against Lillee, Thomson and Walker. David Lloyd looked less certain and gave several chances, {{including}} a catch by Ian Chappell which the Australian captain indicated had hit the ground before he took it, much to everyone's surprise. Ashley Mallett (4/60) slowed the run rate and just before lunch tricked LLoyd (44) and had him caught and bowled when the left-hander tried to drive a turning ball. With the pitch taking spin Dennis Lillee slowed his pace and concentrated on swing and after swearing at the gentlemanly Colin Cowdrey was hit through mid-wicket where Greg Chappell leapt across his brother at first slip to take a catch. Jeff Thomson (4/71) took a spell of 3/13 in six overs, having John Edrich caught behind, Denness caught by Ian Chappell and Knott was caught behind. He hit Fred Titmus painfully {{on the back of his}} knee, which held up the match before until he could struggle back to his feet. Ian Chappell caught Amiss off Mallett ten runs short of his century and 3 runs short of Simpson's record. Mallet also bowled Titmus for a 31-minute duck and had Underwood caught by the captain as England collapsed from 152/2 to 182/8. As at Brisbane Tony Greig restored the situation thrashing 5 fours and a six in his 60 and adding 66 runs with Bob Willis (15) for the ninth wicket before Greg Chappell snatched a catch off a ball heading to the third man boundary. The limping Hendrick came out to help add a few runs, but Willis was bowled trying to drive Thomson, who had now taken 24 wickets in three Tests, an average of four wickets in each England innings. The total of 244 left Australia 365 minutes to make 246 runs to win their third Test in succession.|$|R

2500|$|Dennis Lillee (2/70) showed {{what could}} be done by {{swinging}} the ball like a boomerang in the first over and with his eighth ball turned Dennis Amiss around and clipped the shoulder of his bat to give Doug Walters a difficult catch at third slip. Jeff Thomson did not like bowling into the wind and was replaced after one over by Max Walker, who bowled three maiden overs, but had David Lloyd dropped by Walters as he and Colin Cowdrey slowly advanced the score. Thomson was brought in at Lillee's end with the wind behind him and gave Lloyd a rearing ball that moved on the leg stump, struck his hand and lobbed to Ashley Mallett in the gully to leave England 34/2. 40/2 at lunch. John Edrich came in with his still sore hand and for two hours the veteran partnership added 76 runs between lunch and tea. The 50 was brought up in 160 minutes by a Thomson bouncer that leaped over Rod Marsh's head for four byes and he struck Cowdrey on the chest and elbow with successive balls. Edrich snicked Lillee to Ian Chappell, who dropped and catch and split his hand between his thumb and forefinger, so had to leave the field for treatment. Just before tea two supporters climbed the picket fence and reached the wicket before Umpire Brooks removed them and the interlude spoilt Cowdrey's concentration. He misjudged a Thomson inswinger which he thought was passing him, but rapped his pads and he was given out leg before wicket for 35. In the next over, Edrich tried to glance a ball from Mallett (2/37) and was caught by Marsh for 49, though the batsmen later said he had missed and the ball had come off his pads he was given out by Umpire Bailhache and England were 110/4. Tea was taken when the wicket fell and Mike Denness and Tony Greig resumed after the break. As at Brisbane and Perth, Greig slashed away at everything and was dropped by both Ian and Greg Chappell. Thomson pulled up with a leg-strain and left the field, but Denness cut Mallett into the hands of Marsh and Greig was controversially run out and England were 157/6. Ian Chappell had thrown the ball in from the boundary as Greig was completing his third run and Marsh caught the ball and smashed the stumps as the 6'7" [...] South African reached for the crease with his long handled bat. Photographs later showed that he had just made his ground, but Umpire Bailhache gave him out and Greig refused to go until rudely told to leave by Greg Chappell. The innings now depended on Alan Knott, who made 52, and Fred Titmus who batted until <b>stumps,</b> which were <b>pulled</b> when Lillee bowled round the wicket to the Cockney spinner and Mallett took a catch off his bat-handle. Resuming at 176/7, Thomson returned despite the advice of the team physiotherapist as Knott and Derek Underwood made 39 runs in 38 minutes, the England wicketkeeper cutting with abandon. Thomson was bowling carefully to avoid further injury and was replaced the Walker (1/35) who an overconfident Underwood tried to drive only to give Marsh his third catch of the innings. Bob Willis slashed a ball from Thomson into the covers and Walters took a running catch over his left shoulder. Mike Hendrick hit two boundaries in his 8 not out and the innings ended when Thomson (4/72) yorked Knott with the score on 242 to give him 20 wickets in five innings.|$|R
