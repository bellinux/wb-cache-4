In this paper, I analyze the consequences of <b>scapegoating</b> within a firm in a model where reputation concerns drive the actions of superiors. Consider delegation choices, for example. Hiring efficient workers may be a good idea if successful production is the only way to build reputation. But if successful <b>scapegoating</b> also increases reputation, superiors will tend to hire less efficient workers and will eventually blame them for failures. I characterize <b>scapegoating</b> as an activity "nested" after failures. Even though the results of <b>scapegoating</b> do not affect welfare directly, they do so indirectly through the decisions governing the probability of success in production. We examine how activities "nested" after good results may increase efficiency without relying on costly incentives and why superiors tend to hire better workers during good times. Productivity...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Second Dutch War, Charles {{dismissed}} Lord Clarendon, whom he used as a <b>scapegoat</b> for the war. Clarendon fled to France when impeached for high treason (which carried the penalty of death). Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a whimsical acronym as the Cabal—Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and Lauderdale. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy <b>scapegoat</b> for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class {{immigrant}} and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov and Gorbachev {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners. This would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power. Nikolai Talyzin, Chairman of the State Planning Committee, became the <b>scapegoat</b> {{for the failure of}} this reform and on the orders of Ryzhkov he was replaced by Yuri Maslyukov.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scapegoating</b> is an {{interpersonal}} {{process which}} {{is as old as}} humanity. It offers a means of protecting a social group from disintegration, but at the cost of blaming one individual for having a problem which he or she cannot then fix. Family therapy attempts to unravel the <b>scapegoating</b> process and address the underlying diffi-culty, but often fails because the family responds fearfully and reasserts the <b>scapegoating.</b> Therapeutic Storytelling Intervention (TSI), among other things, offers a means of adding individual therapy to family therapy without reinforcing <b>scapegoating.</b> Family therapy began when therapists became interested in the interactions between individuals, rather than concen-trating on mental phenomena within the individual.

5000|$|Victimage is {{the process}} of <b>scapegoating.</b> Here, the speaker blames an {{external}} source for his ills. [...] According to Burke, there are two different types of <b>scapegoating,</b> universal and fractional. In universal <b>scapegoating,</b> the speaker blames everyone for the problem, so the audience associates and even feels sorry for the victim, because it includes themselves. In fractional <b>scapegoating,</b> the speaker blames a specific group or a specific person for their problems. This creates a division within the audience. [...] The victim, whoever it may be, is vilified, or made up to violate the ideals of social order, like normalcy or decency. As a result, by people who take action against the villains become heroized because they are confronting evil.|$|R

5|$|The winter had {{political}} ramifications {{and caused}} {{the public to}} lose faith in a Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies.

The cabinet had to take control away from him and he became the <b>scapegoat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient <b>scapegoat</b> for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
40|$|Playing the Villain {{argues that}} the {{portrayal}} and punishment of terrorists in the Western media perpetuates colonialist attitudes, due to the visual connections between these modern images and past or fictional representations of iconic, punished villains. A theory of <b>scapegoating</b> related to intervisuality supports this argument, by explaining that as a ritual dependent on and developed by cultural history and mythology, <b>scapegoating</b> requires engagement with recognisable visual motifs that repeat and perpetuate Western, colonialist attitudes. Underlying, repeated narrative patterns ensure that the <b>scapegoating</b> ritual functions {{in a way that}} is cathartic and builds national unity following social crisis. This need for catharsis requires that there be a <b>scapegoated</b> villain whose demise may be celebrated, and that the villain is objectified and fetishised through visual representation and spectacle...|$|R

5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors {{that kept the}} Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A <b>scapegoat</b> was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E
5|$|He {{was part}} of a {{landmark}} expedition of the Dutch East India Company in 1626–27 which mapped the southern coast of Australia. He became the Dutch ambassador to Japan in 1627, and he was appointed Governor of Formosa in the same year. Later he became a controversial figure because of his disastrous handling of official duties, coupled with rumours about private indiscretions. He was disgraced, fined and imprisoned, before being made a <b>scapegoat</b> to ease strained Dutch relations with the Japanese. He returned to the Dutch Republic in 1637, where he became the mayor of Hulster Ambacht and of Hulst.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a <b>scapegoat</b> {{for the failure of}} Market Garden. Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle. When he was a toddler, his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a <b>scapegoat</b> for the former king's financial policies. His eldest brother was John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, who sought to advance him in the king's service. Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s. Answering a complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540, Norfolk told the Privy Council that the only two people he had ever found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward Belingeham.|$|E
5|$|Henry became King of England {{following}} the death of William Rufus, who had been shot while hunting. On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the New Forest, accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry. An arrow was fired, possibly by the baron Walter Tirel, which hit and killed William Rufus. Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was a risky activity, and such accidents were common. Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either because he had fired the fatal shot, or because he had been incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a <b>scapegoat</b> for the King's death.|$|E
5|$|Ian Meckiff (born 6 January 1935) is {{a former}} cricketer who {{represented}} Australia in 18 Tests between 1957 and 1963. A left-arm fast bowler, he {{is best known for}} two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player: He was the batsman run out by Joe Solomon in 1960, causing the first Tied Test in cricket history; and in December 1963, his career was sensationally ended when he was called for throwing in the First Test against South Africa by Australian umpire Col Egar. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had been a media frenzy about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket. The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community to believe that he had been made a <b>scapegoat</b> by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} stereotyping, <b>scapegoating,</b> unethical behaviour and instability and shows how stereotyping and <b>scapegoating</b> can contribute to national and international instability. It presents a revised version of a three-part model of conflict previously developed by the author, with the components of an issue of dispute, a context which favours violence over peaceful resolution, and a trigger event, and shows how some of the theories of <b>scapegoating</b> and the resulting violence fit into this model. It also presents a new three-level model of the factors which lead to stereotyping at the individual, organisational or communal, and wider society levels. The paper also discusses potential solutions to current vicious cycles in which unethical behaviour, stereotyping and <b>scapegoating</b> promote or lead to instability. The role of multi-loop action learning and organisations such as TECIS (IFAC Technical Committee 9. 5 on Technology, Culture and International Stability, formerly SWIIS) are highlighted in providing support for whistleblowing, responsibility and accountability at both the collective and individual levels, a strengthening of both individual and group identities and increasing respect for currently stereotyped and discriminated against out-groups, which will reduce their vulnerability to <b>scapegoating.</b> </p...|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole <b>scapegoat</b> for the whole atrocity.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} of Rufus in 1100, Ranulf was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Rufus' {{successor}} Henry I of England. Ranulf was a convenient <b>scapegoat</b> for the financial extortions of Rufus' reign. He became the first prisoner {{to escape from the}} Tower and went into exile in Normandy with Rufus' and Henry's older brother Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy. Ranulf became a leading advisor to Robert, and assisted in his unsuccessful invasion of England, an attempt to oust Henry from the throne. The brothers reconciled, but although Ranulf was restored to office he spent the next few years in Normandy, returning only after Henry had defeated Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray. Ranulf subsequently retired from political life, with only occasional appearances in public. He remained active in ecclesiastical affairs, attending councils and working to defend the rights of his see.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{are called}} to {{investigate}} {{the shooting death of}} Charles Courtland Cox, a small-time drug peddler shot in the back shortly after a police raid of a crackhouse. When Pembleton suspects a police shooting, Lt. Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) explains Officer Hellriegel (Jeffrey Mandon) accidentally shot Cox after falling down and discharging his weapon. However, Hellriegel does not recall details and appears nervous by questioning from Pembleton. Gee is angry with Pembleton's inquiries into the police, and becomes even angrier when Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) and Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) say they will make Hellriegel a <b>scapegoat</b> if the media start suggesting racism or police brutality. Hellriegel is cleared when tests reveal the bullet does not match his gun, but Pembleton requests the firearms of the other officers be tested. Gee refuses to approve the tests, but Pembleton gets Barnfather to order them.|$|E
