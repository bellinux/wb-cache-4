5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF <b>software-defined</b> <b>radio</b> (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E
500|$|The Telecom Subsystem on MRO is {{the best}} digital {{communication}} system sent into deep space so far {{and for the first}} time using capacity approaching turbo-codes. The Electra communications package is a UHF <b>software-defined</b> <b>radio</b> (SDR) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. The system consists of a very large (...) antenna, which is used to transmit data through the Deep Space Network via X-band frequencies at 8GHz, and it demonstrates the use of the [...] at 32GHz for higher data rates. Maximum transmission speed from Mars is projected to be as high as 6Mbit/s, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band amplifiers (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt Ka-band amplifier, and two Small Deep Space Transponders (SDSTs).|$|E
2500|$|Communications: Curiosity is {{equipped}} with several means of communication, for redundancy. An X band Small Deep Space Transponder for communication directly to Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network and a UHF Electra-Lite <b>software-defined</b> <b>radio</b> for communicating with Mars orbiters. [...] The X-band system has one radio, with a 15W power amplifier, and two antennas: a low-gain omnidirectional antenna that can communicate with Earth at very low data rates (15bit/s at maximum range), regardless of rover orientation, and a high-gain antenna that can communicate at speeds up to 32kbit/s, but must be aimed. The UHF system has two radios (approximately 9W transmit power), sharing one omnidirectional antenna. This can communicate with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter (ODY) at speeds up to 2Mbit/s and 256kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only {{able to communicate with}} Curiosity for about 8 minutes per day. [...] The orbiters have larger antennas and more powerful radios, and can relay data to Earth faster than the rover could do directly. Therefore, most of the data returned by Curiosity (MSL), is via the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY. The data return via the communication infrastructure as implemented at MSL, and observed during the first 10 days was approximately 31 megabytes per day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays {{there is}} a lot of {{wireless}} com-munication protocols being used, and this results in a series of difficulties for developers of systems that interacts with devices which can use different com-munication protocols. <b>Software-defined</b> <b>radios</b> (SDR) aims to solve this problem by using a software-based approach to provide flexibility on the implementation of the protocols physical layer. In this paper, an analysis of SDR implementation approaches is pre-sented, and an architecture for SDR implementation is proposed. The architecture uses hybrid HW/SW components and programmable logic devices in order to enable the efficient implementation of <b>software-defined</b> <b>radios</b> from high level models.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} role of the eavesdrop-per’s {{statistics}} in the implementation of a practical secret-key gen-eration system. We carefully conduct the information-theoretic analysis of a secret-key generation system from wireless channel gains measured with <b>software-defined</b> <b>radios.</b> In particular, we show that it is inaccurate to assume that the eavesdropper gets no information because of decorrelation with distance. We also provide a bound for the achievable secret-key rate in the finite key-length regime that takes into account the presence of correlated eavesdropper’s observations. We evaluate this bound with our experimental gain measurements to show that operating with a finite number of samples incurs a loss in secret-key rate on the order of 20 %.
