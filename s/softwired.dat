40|$|Phylogenetic {{networks}} {{are used to}} display the relationship among different species whose evolution is not treelike, which is the case, for instance, {{in the presence of}} hybridization events or horizontal gene transfers. Tree inference methods such as maximum parsimony need to be modified in order to be applicable to networks. In this paper, we discuss two different definitions of maximum parsimony on networks, “hardwired” and “softwired,” and examine the complexity of computing them given a network topology and a character. By exploiting a link with the problem Multiterminal Cut, we show that computing the hardwired parsimony score for 2 -state characters is polynomial-time solvable, while for characters with more states this problem becomes NP-hard but is still approximable and fixed parameter tractable in the parsimony score. On the other hand we show that, for the <b>softwired</b> definition, obtaining even weak approximation guarantees is already difficult for binary characters and restricted network topologies, and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms in the parsimony score are unlikely. On the positive side we show that computing the <b>softwired</b> parsimony score is fixed-parameter tractable in the level of the network, a natural parameter describing how tangled reticulate activity is in the network.

40|$|Maximum parsimony {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently-discussed tree {{reconstruction}} methods in phylogenetic estimation. However, in recent years it has become more and more apparent that phylogenetic trees are often not sufficient to describe evolution accurately. For instance, processes like hybridization or lateral gene transfer that are commonplace in many groups of organisms and result in mosaic patterns of relationships cannot be represented by a single phylogenetic tree. This is why phylogenetic networks, which can display such events, are becoming of more and more interest in phylogenetic research. It is therefore necessary to extend concepts like maximum parsimony from phylogenetic trees to networks. Several suggestions for possible extensions can be found in recent literature, for instance the <b>softwired</b> and the hardwired parsimony concepts. In this paper, we analyze the so-called big parsimony problem under these two concepts, i. e. we investigate maximum parsimonious networks and analyze their properties. In particular, we show that finding a <b>softwired</b> maximum parsimony network is possible in polynomial time. We also show that the set of maximum parsimony networks for the hardwired definition always contains at least one phylogenetic tree. Lastly, we investigate some parallels of parsimony to different likelihood concepts on phylogenetic networks. Comment: 28 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePhylogenetic {{networks}} have gained prominence {{over the years}} due {{to their ability to}} represent complex non-treelike evolutionary events such as recombination or hybridization. Popular combinatorial objects used to construct them are triplet systems and cluster systems, the motivation being that any network N induces a triplet system R(N) and a <b>softwired</b> cluster system S(N). Since in real-world studies it cannot be guaranteed that all triplets/softwired clusters induced by a network are available, it is of particular interest to understand whether subsets of R(N) or S(N) allow one to uniquely reconstruct the underlying network N. Here we show that even within the highly restricted yet biologically interesting space of level- 1 phylogenetic networks it is not always possible to uniquely reconstruct a level- 1 network N, even when all triplets in R(N) or all clusters in S(N) are available. On the positive side, we introduce a reasonably large subclass of level- 1 networks the members of which are uniquely determined by their induced triplet/softwired cluster systems. Along the way, we also establish various enumerative results, both positive and negative, including results which show that certain special subclasses of level- 1 networks N can be uniquely reconstructed from proper subsets of R(N) and S(N). We anticipate these results to be of use in the design of algorithms for phylogenetic network inference...|$|E

40|$|Return Power Shift Control: Design Ethics in Computer Games Miguel Sicart Ph. D. Student Department of Digital Aesthetics and Communication IT University of Copenhagen – Denmark miguel@itu. dk Abstract This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the Ethics of computer games’ design. Applying a philosophical methodology, this research intends to analyze the ways computer games enforce ethical discourses via (conscious) design decisions. Ultimately, this paper will ground the rhetoric needed to formalize the morality of computer games. In order to answer {{the question of the}} morality of games, three philosophical traditions will be used: Don Ihde’s postphenomenology (Ihde: 1993), Michel Foucault’s analyses of power (Foucault: 1980, 2000), and Luciano Floridi’s Information Ethics (Floridi & Sanders: 1999, 2004 a, 2004 b). Other theoretical frameworks used will be the legal approach to the nature of Code by Lawrence Lessig (Lessig: 1999) and game design theories (Rollings & Morton: 2003, Zimmerman & Salen: 2003). The basic premise of this paper is that computer games enforce their ethical discourses also through their design. The morality of computer games lies not only in what they tell, but also in how it is told. In order to understand this shift of perspective, games will be defined as agent systems in which ethical values are <b>softwired</b> in the design. This power-agency also affects the experience of the game by the players. Computer games imply an active role of the user/player in their configuration as experience and as cultural object. This active role is determined by a specific design of the system, oriented to create gameplay. In order to play the game, users have to understand and accept that design. Thus, design becomes a power institution in the field of the game, prohibiting and allowing certain activities and not others. Games are designed objects. And design is power. Agents uphold power and Ethical actions. This paper will argue for the definition of games as agents with a rather large autonomy. Thus, computer games become accountable for the moral values their designs promote, as they are agents of those values. Almost all games, including RPGs, operate with a certain notion of winning condition. In single player games, the system puts obstacles to the player who attempt to achieve the winning condition. The game will be designed for those means, and the player has to accept the regulations of the game’s architecture to achieve success. On the other hand, multiplayer games are different. They are not designed as an obstacle to a player, but as set of boundaries the players cannot trespass in their attempt to achieve the winning condition before or better than the other players. In the case of multiplayer games, it is also necessary to take into account that the power structure of the game permeates to the social structures built surrounding the game. That is, players that do not follow or exploit the designed routes to achieve the winning condition are seen as unlawful players. In other words, the ethics of the design are implemented to the ethics of the group of players. Given this framework, this paper will argue for computer games being conveyors of ethical discourses that are implemented via design. A game will be defined as a moral agent, ethically accountable for the values its architecture enforces. Design in computer games implies power and control. By imposing a power structure over the users’ choices and strategies, restraining them of free choice and conditioning them to a certain success condition, design in computer games becomes morally accountable. It becomes a moral object as well as a moral agent. As a summary, this paper will argue for the moral accountability of computer game design as an ethical object and as an ethical agent. The design architecture of the game is an active power structure in which ethical discourses and moral values are embedded. This paper will use three games as examples: in XIII (Dargaud/UbiSoft: 2003), the design architecture does not allow the player to kill certain NPCs, namely policemen. The main character of the game is amnesic, but his moral standards are defined with a design limitation: a dead cop means game over. More complex is the case of Manhunt (RockStar North: 2003). Even though the game has raised discussions due to its content, this paper will focus on the way the game is designed, and how that design is used to enhance a certain experience by the player: namely, that of a hunted man that has to kill to survive in a hostile environment. Finally, Battlefield 1942 (Digital Illusions: 2002) will be the multiplayer example, especially for the freedom its architecture gives to the players, which has contributed to a rich ethical code of conduct in may BF 1942 servers. Other examples taken from games that actually take into account ethical values in their game design, such as Knights of the Old Republic (BioWare: 2003), will be taken into consideration as a symptom of the awareness designers have of their power over players. Games like Fable (BigBlueBox Studios/Lionhead Studios: 2004) and The Sims 2 (Maxis: 2004) suggest that computer games {{are becoming more and more}} aware on the ways they can convey ethical values, and how their players experience them. Are computer games moral objects? Can game design enhance ethical discourses? If so, how? These two are the main questions of this paper. The topic of Ethics brings forth many controversial issues concerning computer games. This paper intends to provide a theoretically solid, well-grounded perspective on the question of ethics in computer games. Games are often blamed for evil as if they had some magic, totemic power. Games pervert the youth and turn them into malicious sociopaths, some say. My goal with this research is no other than to prove that there is no such "dark magic" in games, even though they are definitely morally accountable objects. My goal is to allow a scientific approach to the morality of games to contribute to the academic and media understanding of the complexity of the ethical construction in computer game design.
