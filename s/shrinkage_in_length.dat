The {{structure}} {{and influence of}} temperature on mechanical deformation of Liquid Crystal Elastomers (LCEs) were studied using various techniques like Raman Spectroscopy (RS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy and Polarizing Microscopy Studies (PMS) etc. The spectroscopic studies confirmed the presence of functional group attached to the sample. The <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> <b>length</b> was observed while heating whereas material returns to its original length on cooling which revealed the correlation of mechanical behavior of Liquid Crystal Elastomers with temperature.

40|$|A new {{technology}} for the manufacture of dense SiC ceramics in a low cost approach by imitating the biological structure of wood is aim of the co-operation between the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). In a first material screening eight types of commercial wood-based composites with the size 150 x 150 x 20 mm were examined, which differ in their structure and composition of wood and binding agent (e. g. laminated beech panels, chip boards and medium dense fibre boards). First experiments showed that each wood-based composite has to be dried in three heating ramps up to 110 °C prior to pyrolysis to reduce the water content. A mass loss of 3, 7 - 6, 5 % and a shrinkage in thickness of 0, 3 - 2, 0 % occur during drying. The subsequent pyrolysis up to 900 °C shows a further mass loss of about 70 % and an additionall shrinkage in thickness of about 34 %. The <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> <b>length</b> and width however is about 21 %. Both, the mass loss and anisotropic shrinkage {{may be responsible for}} the formation of cracks during pyrolysis. Within the last step a pressureless infiltration of silicon melt (siliconization) was performed under vacuum up to 1650 °C to fill the pores and to create SiC. As the commercial wood-based composites were not adapted for their conversion to SiC ceramics only a few of them could be pyrolysed reproducible and crackfree. So, the modification of the wood-based composites starts by the development and manufacturing of adapted wooden preforms. This paper deals with the actual status of the project and describes the results in terms of properties and microstructures of these wood-based composites, the intermediate carbon/carbon templates and the final SiC ceramics...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{order to}} improve the inter-specific {{selectivity}} of a new bottom trawl design for demersal crustaceans, an experimental attempt was carried out to compare the <b>shrinkage</b> effect <b>in</b> <b>length</b> of net structure accessories, particularly shorter bridles and sweeps, based on previous studies on escape behavior of gadiform fishes. For this purposes, an experimental fishing for nylon shrimp (Heterocarpus reedi) was carried out on board of two trawler vessels. The results showed {{no significant differences in}} catch per unit of fishing effort (CPUE) for the target species between gears and significant reductions (p < 0. 05) for the most important by-catch species (Merluccius gayi) with the modified gear. In fact, the average CPUE for M. gayi decreased 5. 6 kg h- 1 (19. 2 %) and 35. 7 kg h- 1 (47. 5 %) for each vessel...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{historical}} specimens are widely applied {{in studies of}} taxonomy, systematics, and ecology, but biologists often assume {{that the effects of}} preservative chemicals on the morphology of amphibian specimens are minimal in their analyses. We compared the body length and body mass of 182 samples of 13 live and preserved (up to 10 years) anuran species and found that the body length and body mass of preserved specimens significantly decreased by 6. 1 % and 24. 8 %, respectively, compared to those measurements of their live counterparts. The changes <b>in</b> body <b>length</b> and mass also exhibited highly significant variations between species. Similarly, there were significant differences <b>in</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of body <b>length</b> and body mass between sexes, where males showed greater <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> body <b>length</b> and body mass compared to females. Preservation distorted the magnitude of the interspecific differences <b>in</b> body <b>length</b> observed <b>in</b> the fresh specimens. Overall, the reduction <b>in</b> body <b>length</b> or mass was greater in longer or heavier individuals. Due to the effects of preservation on amphibian morphology, we propose two parsimonious conversion equations to back-calculate the original body length and body mass of studied anurans for researchers working with historical data, since morphological data from preserved specimens may lead to incorrect biological interpretations when comparing to fresh specimens. Therefore, researchers should correct for errors due to preservation effects that may lead to the misinterpretation of results...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{physical}} and antibacterial properties of a flowable resin composite incorporating a sol-gel derived silver doped bioactive glass (Ag-BGCOMP). The depth of the cure was calculated by measuring the surface micro-hardness for {{the top and bottom}} surfaces. The volumetric polymerization shrinkage was measured by recording the linear <b>shrinkage</b> as change <b>in</b> <b>length,</b> while the biaxial flexural strength was studied measuring the load at failure.

Ag-BGCOMP could find an application in low stress-bearing areas as well as in small cavity preparations to decrease secondary caries.

50|$|The {{chemical}} processes of Portland cement hydration lead to {{another type of}} shrinkage, called theautogeneous shrinkage, which is observed in sealed specimens, i.e., at no moisture loss. It is caused partly by chemical volume changes, but mainly by self-desiccation due to loss of water consumed by the hydration reaction. It amounts to only about 5% of the drying <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> normal concretes, which self-desiccate to about 97% pore humidity.

40|$|A {{promising}} way {{to mitigate}} autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> cementitious materials {{with a low}} water-to-binder ratio is internal curing {{by the use of}} superabsorbent polymers. Superabsorbent polymers are able to absorb multiple times their weight in water and can be applied as an internal water reservoir to induce internal curing and mitigation of self-desiccation. Their purposefulness has been demonstrated in Portland cement pastes with and without silica fume. Nowadays, fly ash and blast-furnace slag containing binders are also frequently used in the construction industry. The results on autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> materials blended with fly ash or blast-furnace slag remain scarce, especially after one week of age. This paper focuses on the autogenous shrinkage by performing manual and automated shrinkage measurements up to one month of age. Without superabsorbent polymers, autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> was reduced <b>in</b> cement pastes with the supplementary cementitious materials versus Portland cement pastes. At later ages, the rate of autogenous shrinkage is higher due to the pozzolanic activity of the supplementary cementitious materials. Internal curing by means of superabsorbent polymers is successful, independent of this long-term higher rate of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> mixtures with supplementary cementitious materials. Superabsorbent polymers proved to be successful in mitigating self-desiccation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDominant {{optic atrophy}} (DOA) arises from {{mutations}} in the OPA 1 gene that promotes fusion {{of the inner}} mitochondrial membrane and {{plays a role in}} maintaining ATP levels. Patients display optic disc pallor, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and bilaterally reduced vision. We report a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of idebenone at 2000 mg/kg/day in 56 Opa 1 mutant mice (B 6;C 3 -Opa 1 Q 285 STOP), with RGC dendropathy and visual loss, and 63 wildtype mice. We assessed cellular responses in the retina, brain and liver and RGC morphology, by diolistic labeling, Sholl analysis and quantification of dendritic morphometric features. Vision was assessed by optokinetic responses. ATP levels were raised by 0. 57 nmol/mg (97. 73 %, p= 0. 035) in brain from idebenone-treated Opa 1 mutant mice, but in the liver there was an 80. 35 % (p= 0. 011) increase in oxidative damage. NQO 1 expression in Opa 1 mutant mice was reduced in the brain (to 30. 5 %, p= 0. 002) but not in retina, and neither expression level was induced by idebenone. ON-center RGCs failed to show major recovery, other than improvements <b>in</b> secondary dendritic <b>length</b> (by 53. 89 %, p= 0. 052) and dendritic territory (by 2. 22 × 104 μm 2 or 90. 24 %, p= 0. 074).

40|$|In this {{on-going}} work, I explore certain {{theoretical and}} empirical implications of data transformations under the PCA. In particular, I state and prove three theorems about PCA, which I paraphrase as follows: 1). PCA without discarding eigenvector rows is injective, but looses this injectivity when eigenvector rows are discarded 2). PCA without discarding eigen- vector rows preserves pair-wise distances, but tends to cause pair-wise distances to shrink when eigenvector rows are discarded. 3). For any pair of points, the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distance is bounded above by an L 1 norm reconstruction error associated with the points. Clearly, 3). suggests that there might exist some correlation between <b>shrinkages</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distances and mean square reconstruction error which {{is defined as the}} sum of those eigenvalues associated with the discarded eigenvectors. I therefore decided to perform numerical experiments to obtain the corre- lation between the sum of those eigenvalues and <b>shrinkages</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distances. In addition, I have also performed some experiments to check respectively the effect of the sum of those eigenvalues and the effect of the shrinkages on classification accuracies under the PCA map. So far, I have obtained the following results on some publicly available data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 1). There seems to be a strong cor- relation between the sum of those eigenvalues associated with discarded eigenvectors and <b>shrinkages</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distances. 2). Neither the sum of those eigenvalues nor pair-wise distances have any strong correlations with classification accuracies. ...|$|R

Seeds with an approximate initial moisture content of 0. 61 kgw kgdm- 1 (kilogram of water per kilogram of dry matter) were dried in a convection oven at temperatures of 36, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 °C until they reached a moisture content of 0. 11 ± 0. 006 kgw kgdm- 1. The experimental data were fitted to five mathematical models used to represent volumetric <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> agricultural products.
