Because frequent experiences are typically less intense than rare ones, this meaning shift results in reports of different experiences.

Participants asked how frequently they get angry (a) assumed that the question refers to less intense and more frequent episodes when presented with a short (1 -week) rather than a long (1 -year) reference period, (b) reported more extreme episodes in the latter case, and (c) provided differential frequency reports.

40|$|AbstractDrought {{indices are}} {{commonly}} used tools for drought characterisation and analysis. The Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) {{is one of the}} widely used indices, due to its high sensitivity and resilience. The basic form of the index is the ratio of the cumulative precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, for a <b>specified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> The RDI is also transferred to a normalised and a standardised expression. Since the RDI incorporates both the main input and the main output of a natural water system, it is considered as an appropriate index of water availability. Based on this notion, as shown in recent studies, the RDI is suitable for the assessment of drought impacts on agriculture. In this paper, {{a modified version of the}} index, RDIe, is presented, in which precipitation is replaced by the effective precipitation. With the proposed modification, the amount of water beneficially exploited by the agricultural systems can be represented more accurately, enhancing the performance of the index for agricultural drought analysis. Further, alternative ways for the calculation of effective precipitation are presented and discussed. An application of the modified RDI in an agricultural area demonstrates its better performance in assessing the impacts of drought on the rainfed agricultural production...|$|E

The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS) is a social survey which asks people about their experiences and perceptions of crime in Scotland. The survey is an important resource for both the government and public of Scotland. Respondents are selected at random from the Postal Address File and participation in the survey is entirely voluntary. The main aims of the SCJS are to: provide reliable statistics on people's experience of crime in Scotland, including services provided to victims of crime assess the varying risk of crime for different groups {{of people in the}} population examine trends in the level and nature of crime in Scotland over time collect information about people's experiences of, and attitudes on a range of crime and justice related issues An important role of the SCJS is to provide an alternative and complementary measure of crime to police recorded crime statistics. For further details of the scope and methodology of the SCJS, please see documentation. Information about the survey and links to publications may be found on the Scottish Government's Scottish Crime and Justice Survey webpages. Background and history of the SCJS Previous surveys of victimisation in Scotland began with the Scottish components of the 1982 and 1988 sweeps of the British Crime Survey (BCS) (held at the Archive under SNs 4368 and 4599) The Scottish element of the 1988 BCS was also known as the Scottish Areas Crime Survey and coverage was limited in those early surveys to the areas south of the Caledonian Canal. From 2012, the BCS has been renamed the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) (held under GN 33174). The first independent Scotland-only crime survey was commissioned by the Scottish Office in 1993 under the title of the Scottish Crime Survey (SCS) and was followed by repeated sweeps in 1996 (both years held together under SN 3813), and again in 2000 (SN 4542) and 2003 (SN 5756). In 2004 the survey underwent both a name change, to the Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey (SCVS) (SN 5757), and a major methodological change, with a move away from in-home face-to-face interviewing to telephone interviewing. However, the 2006 SCVS (SN 5784) returned to face-to-face interviewing after it was shown that the robustness of the data produced by the 2004 telephone survey could not be substantiated. From 2008 - 2009, the series name was changed to the present title, the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, and it moved to a repeated annual cross-sectional schedule based on financial year. From 2012 - 13 the SCJS moved from annual to biennial survey covering the financial year. Otherwise, the design of the SCJS 2012 - 2013 remained largely the same as the 2010 - 2011 survey. See documentation for further details. Special Licence data From 2012 - 2013 only the Main Questionnaire data are available under standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement. The Victim Form and Self-Completion data are available under Special Licence (SL). The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. For the second edition (November 2009), new versions of the victim and non-victim form data files were deposited. Some revisions have been made to variables regarding offence coding, household theft/housebreaking categorisation, victimisation rates and incident recall. In addition, some variables have been relabelled to improve clarity, and a weighting variable to adjust for series incidents has been included. Further information may be found in the updated documentation to accompany the new edition. Main Topics : The 2006 SCVS questionnaire consisted of eight main modules, as follows: the main questionnaire, which covered a number of general topics. All the questions are relatively straightforward and were generally asked of all respondents. The first questions referred to Scotland as a whole and the focus then shifted to questions related to people's own local area. The main topics included were: general problems in Scotland today; how long respondents had lived in their local area; how safe they felt in their area, and worries about crime the screener questionnaire, in which all respondents were asked whether they had experienced certain types of incidents within a <b>specified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>period,</b> namely the time between the date of the interview and 1 April 2005 victim forms for incidents identified at the screeners (up to a maximum of five) module A (answered by 50 % of respondents, covering perceptions of crime levels in local area; perceptions and impact of anti-social behaviour in local area; whether respondent had been insulted or pestered since 1 April 2005, had ever been the victim of a violent attack, or a victim of workplace violence; attitudes to sentencing; and personal safety) module B (answered by the remaining 50 % of respondents, and covering: contact with agencies in the Scottish criminal justice system (CJS); confidence in the Scottish CJS; contact with the police; awareness of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency; contact with the Procurator Fiscal; and whether respondent knows someone who has been to prison, or has been to prison themselves) demographics self-completion module on drug use (answered by those aged 16 - 59) self-completion module on domestic violence For further details of coverage, see documentation...|$|E

When comparing simulations {{with each other}} and with observations it is standard practice to compare temperature anomalies with respect to a <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> It is not always appreciated that the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> can affect conclusions, both about the skill of simulations of past climate, and about the magnitude of expected future changes in climate. For example, observed global temperatures over the past decade are towards the lower end of the range of CMIP 5 simulations irrespective of what <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> is used, but exactly where they lie in the model distribution varies with the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> Additionally, we demonstrate that projections of when particular temperature levels are reached, for example 2 K above ‘pre-industrial’, change by up to a decade depending on the choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> In this article we discuss some of the key issues that arise when using anomalies relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> to generate climate projections. We highlight that there is no perfect choice of <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> When evaluating models against observations, a long <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> should generally be used, but how long depends on the quality of the observations available. The IPCC AR 5 choice to use a 1986 - 2005 <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> for future global temperature projections was reasonable, but a case-by-case approach is needed for different purposes and when assessing projections of different climate variables.
