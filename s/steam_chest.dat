5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each bogie {{were cast}} in mono-block format, each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet <b>steam</b> <b>chest.</b> These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering the cylinders. However, these castings were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, {{with each of the}} six cylinders and valve sleeves requiring 24 sealing rings.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives did {{not show}} the pressure of steam in the boiler, but {{it was possible to}} estimate this by the position of the safety valve arm which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a sight-glass at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the <b>steam</b> <b>chest.</b> This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|E
500|$|Maunsell {{initiated}} trials with Urie N15 No.442 in 1924, {{and proved}} that better performance {{could be obtained}} by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements. As a result, Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to [...] and replaced the safety valves with Ross pop valves set to [...] boiler pressure. The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater {{was replaced by a}} Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere. Valve events (the timing of valve movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.|$|E
50|$|The valve <b>chests</b> or <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> {{which contain}} the slide valves or piston valves may {{be located in}} various positions.|$|R
5000|$|Air {{was drawn}} from outside the smokebox through a pair of {{non-return}} valves into the exhaust ports, from where it was compressed into the <b>steam</b> <b>chests.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{twin-cylinder}} {{wet steam}} engine {{was on the}} outside. The <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> and the Stephenson valve gear were on the inside. The cylinders, which were set horizontally, drove the first coupled axle.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{compound}} systems and configurations, {{but we can}} define two basic types, according to how HP and LP piston strokes are phased and hence whether the HP exhaust is able to pass directly from HP to LP (Woolf compounds) or whether pressure fluctuation necessitates an intermediate [...] "buffer" [...] space {{in the form of}} a <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> or pipe known as a receiver (receiver compounds).|$|E
2500|$|The steam {{generated}} in the boiler fills the space above {{the water in the}} partially filled boiler. Its maximum working pressure is limited by spring-loaded safety valves. It is then collected either in a perforated tube fitted above the water level or by a dome that often houses the regulator valve, or throttle, the purpose of which is to control the amount of steam leaving the boiler. The steam then either travels directly along and down a steam pipe to the engine unit or may first pass into the wet header of a superheater, the role of the latter being to improve thermal efficiency and eliminate water droplets suspended in the [...] "saturated steam", the state in which it leaves the boiler. On leaving the superheater, the steam exits the dry header of the superheater and passes down a steam pipe, entering the steam chests adjacent to the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. Inside each <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> is a sliding valve that distributes the steam via ports that connect the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> {{to the ends of the}} cylinder space. The role of the valves is twofold: admission of each fresh dose of steam, and exhaust of the used steam once it has done its work.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the steam}} {{locomotive}} era, two measures of locomotive performance were generally applied. At first, locomotives were rated by tractive effort, {{defined as the}} average force developed during one revolution of the driving wheels at the rail head. This can be roughly calculated by multiplying the total piston area by 85% of the boiler pressure (a rule of thumb reflecting the slightly lower pressure in the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> above the cylinder), and dividing by {{the ratio of the}} driver diameter over the piston stroke. However, the precise formula is: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{two-cylinder}} {{wet steam}} engine {{was on the}} outside. The cylinders set horizontally and drive the coupling rod on the first axle. The <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> were, like the Stephenson valve gear, on the inside.|$|R
50|$|Their {{cylinders}} were inclined {{and arranged}} outside the 7/8 in plate frames. The <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> were arranged between the frames and the unbalanced slide valves were actuated by Stephenson valve gear through rocker shafts.|$|R
50|$|The {{snifting}} valves may {{be mounted}} {{directly on the}} cylinders or <b>steam</b> <b>chests.</b> The drawback of this arrangement is that they admit cold air which cools the cylinders and leads to condensation when the steam is turned on again.|$|R
2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre connecting rod's big end bearing were located beneath the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced ventilation following the fitting of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards. The grease-lubricated locomotive axles also suffered overheating problems from the sustained higher speed running. The VR addressed both issues by switching to a [...] "red oil" [...] lubricant which had a higher resistance to heat.|$|E
2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a crankpin (Wristpin in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> is controlled {{through a set of}} rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, adjusting valve travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|E
2500|$|A little-known {{example of}} Jones' heroic {{instincts}} in action {{is described by}} his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book, Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones' train approached Michigan City, Mississippi. He had left the cab in charge of fellow Engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the running board to oil the relief valves. He advanced from the running board to the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some [...] ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and braced himself on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|E
50|$|Copper steam pipes, 4+1/2 in in {{internal}} diameter, were arranged from {{each side of}} the steam dome and passed vertically down the outside of the boiler to the <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> of the high-pressure cylinders. The exhaust from the high-pressure cylinders passed to a receiver pipe, 7+1/2 in {{in internal}} diameter, arranged along the centre line of the locomotive and with a ball-joint at the connection with the high-pressure cylinder casting. The front end of the pipe was fitted with an expansion joint near the connection which led to the <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> of the low-pressure cylinders. The exhaust from the low-pressure cylinders was carried by a pipe, also 7+1/2 in in internal diameter, with flexible connections leading into the smokebox.|$|R
50|$|This {{class was}} a forerunner {{of the first}} Bavarian express train locomotive. It was {{equipped}} with an inside Stephenson valve gear, inside <b>steam</b> <b>chests,</b> detachable cranks, (Aufsteckkurbel) and a full outside frame (aussenliegender Füllrahmen). The firebox was supported {{in order to provide}} a better distribution of weight.|$|R
50|$|For {{improved}} accessibility, the <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> were mounted {{outside the}} frames instead of between them. The slide valves, operated by Stephenson Link motion, were {{on top of}} the cylinders and employed rocker shafts. The balance weight for the Stephenson motion was seldom used on American locomotives and was replaced by a powerful coiled spring.|$|R
50|$|In the 3001 {{class the}} <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> was located {{underneath}} the cylinders, and contained two slide valves. The inverted {{placement of the}} valves allowed them to drop away {{from the face of}} the steam ports when steam was shut off, thus reducing wear. The <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> and valves lay above the front carrying axle, and there was sufficient clearance to allow the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> cover to be removed over the axle for maintenance.|$|E

50|$|The {{class were}} {{fitted with a}} <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> and slide valves located beneath the cylinders. The valves were driven by Stephenson valve gear. This {{inverted}} arrangement of slide valves and <b>steam</b> <b>chest,</b> originally introduced by William Stroudley of the LSBCR, allowed the valves to drop away from the cylinder's steam port faces when the regulator was closed, thus reducing wear. Because the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> was below the cylinders, and not between them, the latter could have an increased diameter. The centre line of the cylinders was inclined at an angle of 6° to the centre line of the valves, each centre line being aligned with the driving centre. This arrangement allowed the valve rods to be driven directly from the expansion link. First used on the Armstrong and 3031 Classes, this arrangement of cylinders, valves and valve gear was subsequently used on all GWR outside framed 4-4-0s, with the slide valves being eventually replaced by piston valves.|$|E
50|$|A {{pressure}} relief valve was fitted to the cylinder covers and snifting valves were fitted to the <b>steam</b> <b>chests.</b> Lubrication of the cylinders and piston valves was {{by means of a}} Ritter six-piston oil press, which was arranged in the cab at the right hand side of the engine and actuated from the trailing crank pin.|$|R
2500|$|A typical Crampton feature, {{previously}} used on Liverpool, was {{the large}} {{diameter of the}} outside eccentrics used to drive the valve gear. These were so large as to be larger than the driving cranks, thus avoiding {{the need for an}} overhung (and potentially weak) crank. The 17½" [...] × 24" [...] cylinders were horizontal, fed by inclined <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> above them.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} were mounted {{outside the}} frame and were lubricated by gravitation from two tallow cups, attached to the smokebox sides immediately above the <b>steam</b> <b>chests.</b> The feedwater pumps, attached {{to the back of}} the spectacle plate, were operated from the piston crossheads. The locomotive used wooden brake blocks which were driver-operated by a hand brake in the cab.|$|R
50|$|Replacing {{the axle}} with a bogie of {{conventional}} design would have obstructed {{access to the}} port faces. Dean instead used a suspension bogie, in which {{the weight of the}} locomotive was transferred upwards to the bogie by four bolts mounted on the inside frames. The centre pin of the bogie rotated in a spring-centred block mounted beneath the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> on cross beams. This setup gave sufficient clearance so that, when the bolts were undone, {{the front end of the}} locomotive raised, and the bogie was run out from underneath, the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> cover could be removed without hindrance.|$|E
50|$|The {{passage of}} gases through the large flues {{and around the}} {{superheating}} pipes was controlled by a damper, which was automatically operated by a steam cylinder connected directly to the <b>steam</b> <b>chest.</b> When the throttle was opened, the pressure in the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> would open the damper, which would be closed again by a counterweight when steam was shut off. Superheater dampers were used for many years until {{it was determined that}} damping was unnecessary, since the life of the superheating elements was not increased appreciably by their use. On the SAR, the use of superheater dampers was discontinued c. 1924.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Kirchweger condensers to pre-heat the feedwater. An external {{feature of}} that is the second chimney on the tender. Exhaust steam was led from the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> to the tender through a low-down, 100 mm, connecting pipe.|$|E
5000|$|A typical Crampton feature, {{previously}} used on Liverpool, was {{the large}} {{diameter of the}} outside eccentrics used to drive the valve gear. These were so large as to be larger than the driving cranks, thus avoiding {{the need for an}} overhung (and potentially weak) crank. The 17½" [...] × 24" [...] cylinders were horizontal, fed by inclined <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> above them.|$|R
50|$|All coupled wheels were flanged. The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel axle boxes were soft grease-lubricated. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> and cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|In 1926, {{the company}} {{produced}} a [...] "one-piece locomotive bed with cylinders, <b>steam</b> <b>chests,</b> and saddle cast integral" [...] and delivered {{it to the}} Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and, during this same period, cast steel underframes and trucks were developed for electric locomotives. [...] By 1928, [...] "practically all locomotives and passenger cars built in the United States" [...] were made using products manufactured at the Commonwealth plant.|$|R
5000|$|Most piston valves {{are of the}} [...] "inside admission" [...] type, where fresh steam is {{introduced}} from the boiler via {{the space between the}} two piston heads of the valve, and exhaust steam leaves via the space between a piston head {{and the end of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>chest.</b> The advantage of this arrangement is that leakage, via the gland which seals the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> from the operating rod of the valve gear, is much less of a problem when the gland is subjected to low exhaust pressure rather than full boiler pressure. However, some locomotives, like Bulleid's SR Merchant Navy class, used [...] "outside admission" [...] where the reverse was true, in Bulleid's case because of the unusual chain-driven valve gear arrangement.|$|E
50|$|A {{starting}} valve, {{secured to}} the side of the <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> over the high-pressure cylinder, was directly connected to the steam passages of the high-pressure cylinder but, upon starting, permitted boiler steam to pass directly to the low-pressure cylinders as well. A small by-pass valve for the high-pressure cylinder was contained in the casing of the starting valve. The low-pressure cylinders were also provided with by-pass valves.|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of Hampton Roads on 8 March 1862 {{in which}} CSS Virginia {{destroyed}} the Federal warships USS Cumberland and USS Congress, Patrick Henry attempted {{to take the}} latters surrender but was fired upon by shore batteries, and took a shell in her <b>steam</b> <b>chest</b> that killed four men. Towed out of action {{long enough to make}} repairs, she soon resumed her former position.|$|E
50|$|To {{accommodate}} the redesigned cylinders and the necessary alteration to the Walschaerts valve gear, the running boards {{had to be}} raised to clear the <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> and motion. This resulted in the gentle sweeps at either end where the running boards dropped down to the buffer beam and below the cab. These curves became a Hendrie hallmark and enhanced the appear&shy;ance of the locomotive. In other respects, however, they were practically identical to the Class 3.|$|R
50|$|When Peppercorn {{replaced}} Thompson {{as chief}} mechanical engineer {{he made the}} rebuilding {{the basis for a}} new class of 2-cylinder 2-6-0. Several modifications were made. The running plates were redesigned to improve access to the cylinder <b>steam</b> <b>chests</b> and there were changes to the leading pony truck, the cylinder linings and the boiler. The new engines were also longer and received bigger tenders holding 4,200 gallons of water instead of the 3,500 gallons of the K4s.|$|R
50|$|The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels on each engine unit were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel axle boxes were fitted with Ajax grease lubrication systems. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the <b>steam</b> <b>chests,</b> cylinders and the ball joint of the main steam pipes on each engine unit.|$|R
