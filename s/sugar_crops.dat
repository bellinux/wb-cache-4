In Oahu, some homes along the coast were unroofed, and damage from wave action was also reported. Damage from these four islands totaled US$150,000, and two indirect deaths occurred in Lanai. Extensive damage occurred on Kauai as Dot made landfall, producing wind gusts as high as 103mph (166km/h) and toppling trees and power lines. Widespread power outages affected the island, causing telecommunications and water systems to fail. Although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds, crops suffered the most losses. Cane <b>sugar</b> <b>crops</b> sustained US$2.7million in losses. Overall, damage from Dot across Hawaii totaled US$6million, and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane's passage.|$|E
25|$|Table sugar (sucrose) {{comes from}} plant sources. Two {{important}} <b>sugar</b> <b>crops</b> predominate: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), in which sugar {{can account for}} 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial <b>sugar</b> <b>crops</b> include the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), and the sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Sucrose is obtained by extraction of these crops with hot water, concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid sucrose can be crystallized.

Because the family's resources were limited, Clemente worked alongside his father in the fields, loading and unloading trucks. Clemente showed interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. He attended Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina. During his first year in high school, he was recruited by Roberto Marín to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after Marín saw Clemente playing baseball in barrio San Antón. He was with the team two years as shortstop. Clemente joined Puerto Rico's amateur league when he was 16 years old, playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos.|$|E
