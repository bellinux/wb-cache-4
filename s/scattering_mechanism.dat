However, in BioMOCA the water is treated as a continuum dielectric background media. In addition to that, the protein atoms of the ion channel are also modeled as static point charges embedded in a finite volume with a given dielectric coefficient. So is the lipid membrane, which is treated as a static dielectric region inaccessible to ions. In fact the only non-static particles in the system are ions. Their motion is assumed classical, interacting with other ions through electrostatic interactions and pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. They also interact with the water background media, which is modeled using a <b>scattering</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, George Darwin {{subsequently}} {{calculated the}} gravitational force between two bodies at extremely close range {{to determine if}} geometrical effects {{would lead to a}} deviation from Newton’s law. Here Darwin replaced Le Sage's cage-like units of ordinary matter with microscopic hard spheres of uniform size. He concluded that only in the instance of perfectly inelastic collisions (zero reflection) would Newton’s law stand up, thus reinforcing the thermodynamic problem of Le Sage's theory. Also, such a theory is only valid if the normal and the tangential components of impact are totally inelastic (contrary to Le Sage's <b>scattering</b> <b>mechanism),</b> and the elementary particles are exactly of the same size. He {{went on to say that}} the emission of light is the exact converse of the absorption of Le Sage's particles.

[...] The amplitude of light scattered from within any transparent dielectric {{is proportional to the}} inverse square of its wavelength and to the volume of material, that is to the cube of its {{characteristic length}}. The wavelength dependence is characteristic of dipole scattering and the volume dependence will apply to any <b>scattering</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Objects with x ≫ 1 act as geometric shapes, scattering light according to their projected area. At the intermediate x ≃ 1 of Mie scattering, interference effects develop through phase variations over the object's surface. Rayleigh scattering applies to the case when the scattering particle is very small (x ≪ 1, with a particle size < 1 /10 wavelength) and the whole surface re-radiates with the same phase. [...] Because the particles are randomly positioned, the scattered light arrives at a particular point with a random collection of phases; it is incoherent and the resulting intensity is just the sum of the squares of the amplitudes from each particle and therefore proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength and the sixth power of its size.

30|$|In this article, a learning-based target {{decomposition}} method {{based on}} Kernel K-singular vector decomposition (Kernel KSVD) {{algorithm is proposed}} for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. With new methods offering increased resolution, more details (structures and objects) could be exploited in the SAR images, thus invalidating the traditional decompositions based on specific <b>scattering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> offering low-resolution SAR image classification. Instead of adopting fixed bases corresponding to the known <b>scattering</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> we propose a learning-based decomposition method for generating adaptive bases and developing a nonlinear extension of the KSVD algorithm in a nonlinear feature space, called as Kernel KSVD. It is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding in the kernel feature space based on the nonlinear dictionary and a process of updating each atom in the dictionary. The Kernel KSVD-based decomposition not only generates a stable and adaptive representation of the images but also establishes a curvilinear coordinate that goes along the flow of nonlinear polarimetric features. This proposed approach was verified on two sets of SAR data and found to outperform traditional decompositions based on <b>scattering</b> <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|R
