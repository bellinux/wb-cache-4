40|$|Guinea pigs, {{actively}} sensitized to ovalbumin, were inoculated by nasal insufflation with parainfluenza 3 or {{virus growth}} medium 4 d before performing in vitro pharmacological studies on tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle. In each airway segment, cumulative dose-response effects of ovalbumin were {{obtained in the}} absence and presence of a maximally effective concentration of a beta adrenergic receptor agonist, <b>sulfonterol.</b> <b>Sulfonterol</b> shifted the dose-response curve {{to the right and}} reduced the maximum smooth muscle contractile response to ovalbumin. Virus infection did not alter the dose-response effects of ovalbumin. However, the magnitude of the inhibitory effects of <b>sulfonterol</b> was smaller in segments taken from animals inoculated with virus. Blockade by virus infection of the inhibitory effect of <b>sulfonterol</b> was reversed when the concentrations of beta agonist were increased. <b>Sulfonterol</b> did not alter the dose-response effects of histamine at any of the concentrations that markedly antagonized the effects of ovalbumin. Virus infection did not alter the sensitivities to <b>sulfonterol</b> or papaverine in producing relaxation in either airway segment. The magnitude of relaxation produced by papaverine was significantly larger in bronchial rings taken from animals infected with virus for 4 d, but there was no alteration by virus of the dose-response effects of histamine or carbachol. In experiments measuring antigen-induced release of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis and histamine from minced lung, virus infection did not alter the sensitivity or the maximum effects of ovalbumin. Also, the ability of <b>sulfonterol</b> to inhibit the release of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis and histamine was not affected by virus infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} responses {{produced by}} alpha and beta adrener-gic receptor agonists were evaluated {{in control and}} myentenc neuron-ablated rat jejunal longitudinal muscle. The myenteric plexus of the jejunum was destroyed by serosal appliCatiOn of benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The beta adrenerglc receptor ag-onists isoproterenol and <b>sulfonterol</b> produced a concentraon-dependent relaxation of both control and BAC-treated jejunum. Dose-response curves obtained in control and BAG-treated je-junum were nearly supenmposable regardless ofthe beta agonist used. IsoproterenoWnduced relaxation was antagonized by the beta receptor antagonists propranolol and practolol but not by butoxamine. The alpha-i selective agonists phenylephnne and methoxamine were more potent and efficacious in producing relaxation of control than BAC-treated jejunum. The relaxan...|$|E
