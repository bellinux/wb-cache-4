On December 21, 2016, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registration of the 16 vehicles Uber was using {{for the test}} and forced the program to cease operations in California. Uber then moved the program to Arizona, where the cars are picking up passengers, albeit with 2 Uber engineers in the front seats as a safety precaution. In March 2017, an Uber <b>self-driving</b> <b>car</b> was flipped on its side by a vehicle which failed to yield.|$|E

40|$|<b>Self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> {{hold out}} {{the promise of}} being safer than {{manually}} driven cars. Yet they cannot be a 100 % safe. Collisions are sometimes unavoidable. So <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> need to be programmed for how they should respond to scenarios where collisions are highly likely or unavoidable. The accident-scenarios <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> might face have recently been likened to the key examples and dilemmas associated with the trolley problem. In this article, we critically examine this tempting analogy. We identify three important {{ways in which the}} ethics of accident-algorithms for <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> and the philosophy of the trolley problem differ from each other. These concern: (i) the basic decision-making situation faced by those who decide how <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> should be programmed to deal with accidents; (ii) moral and legal responsibility; and (iii) decision-making in the face of risks and uncertainty. In discussing these three areas of disanalogy, we isolate and identify a number of basic issues and complexities that arise within the ethics of the programming of <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars...</b>|$|R
40|$|While <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> {{may seem}} like {{something}} that can exist only in a futuristic movie, the technology is developing rapidly, and many states already allow test runs of <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> on state roads. Many car companies have announced that they will make <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> available as early as 2020. However, several manufacturers of the self- driving car technology predict that personal ownership of vehicles {{will be replaced by}} a car-sharing system, where companies own the <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> and rent them to consumers who pay per use. With more widespread introduction of this technology comes many questions about how to assess liability for accidents involving <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars,</b> and how insurance should be structured to pay for those accidents. This Note discusses the potential parties who could be held liable: drivers, car-sharing companies, and manufacturers. This Comment suggests the elimination of liability for any accidents involving <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars,</b> and recommends the creation of a National Insurance Fund to pay for all damages resulting from those accidents...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the predicted {{increase in the}} occurrence and severity of motion sickness in <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars.</b> <b>Self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> {{have the potential to}} lead to significant benefits. From the driver's perspective, the direct benefits of this technology are considered increased comfort and productivity. However, we here show that the envisaged scenarios all lead to an increased risk of motion sickness. As such, the benefits this technology is assumed to bring may not be capitalised on, in particular by those already susceptible to motion sickness. This can negatively affect user acceptance and uptake and, in turn, limit the potential socioeconomic benefits that this emerging technology may provide. Following a discussion on the causes of motion sickness in the context of <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars,</b> we present guidelines to steer the design and development of automated vehicle technologies. The aim is to limit or avoid the impact of motion sickness and ultimately promote the uptake of <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars.</b> Attention is also given to less well known consequences of motion sickness, in particular negative aftereffects such as postural instability, and detrimental effects on task performance and how this may impact the use and design of <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars.</b> We conclude that basic perceptual mechanisms need to be considered in the design process whereby <b>self-driving</b> <b>cars</b> cannot simply be thought of as living rooms, offices, or entertainment venues on wheels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society...|$|R
