The obtained-microspheres were characterized, including: morphology, particle size distribution, entrapment efficiency and mucoadhesive strength on the stomach and intestinal of rats. In addition, the in vitro drug release from the microspheres was performed in pH 1. 2 and 7. 2. The results showed that the produced microspheres of PCSS and its combination with HPMC and Carbopol 974 P were irregular shape with a rough surface morphology and have particles sizes range of 2. 5 - 28 μm. Propanolol hydrochloride (PH) was incorporated into the microspheres with an efficiency of range between 84 - 100 %. On gastric mucosa, the microspheres of PCSS, HPMC and PCSS-HPMC were more mucoadhesive than the microspheres of Carbopol 974 P and PCSS-Carbopol 974 P. On the other hand, all kinds of the microspheres show good mucoadhesive properties on intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, the drug release from the microspheres produced pH-dependent extended-release in pH 1. 2 HCl and pH 7. 2 phosphate medium. During 8 h in vitro release study, the release of propanolol hydrochloride from the microspheres of PCSS-HPMC and PCSS-Carbopol 974 P in pH 7. 2 was slower than that in pH 1. 2. The findings obtained revealed that PCSS microspheres have good mucoadhesive property on both of gastric and intestinal mucosa. Moreover, the addition of HPMC and Carbopol 974 P to PCSS hydrophilic matrix significantly extended the drug release...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The octenyl <b>succinate</b> <b>starch</b> is a stabilization-modified starch {{produced}} by esterification of native starch with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). When modified {{in this way}} the starch tends to improve its functional characteristics, can be used to tailor starch to specific food applications. Therefore, optimization of reaction conditions of octenyl <b>succinate</b> <b>starch</b> is critical for modification. The preparation of OSA starches from potato starch in an aqueous alkaline solution was investigated. The reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, OSA concentration, concentration of starch slurry, reaction time and pH, were studied and optimized, as they influence esterification. Under the optimization conditions, the degree of substitution (DS) could reach 0. 01862. The products were confirmed by the presence of the carbonxylate signal around 1558 cm- 1 in the fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. By scanning electron microscope (SEM), OSA starch granules were proved to transfer to some smaller anomalistic ellipses and had slight rough on their surfaces. X-ray diffraction showed that esterification occurred primarily in the amorphous regions and the crystalline pattern of starches did not change. The thermal characteristics of the OSA starch were studied by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA revealed that the OSA starch were thermally more stable than the native starch. The OSA starch exhibited 50 % weight loss at 320 °C, while the native starch underwent 50 % weight loss at 312 °C. The DSC results showed that amorphous region increased after esterification...|$|R

When the culture temperature increased, the molecular weight of its metabolites increased, the synthesis of high alcohol increased too, and their carbon chain lengthened gradually. When incubation time was prolonged, the varying law of the synthesis of its metabolites was alcohols-acid-ester, the metabolites with longer carbon chain produced earlier than the metabolites with shorter carbon chain. When the carbon source were starch, sucrose and bran, n-butyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol were the common metabolites.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the effects of}} concurrent ball milling (BM) and octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modification on the starch microstructure and physicochemical properties (swelling, emulsifying, and rheological). Unlike normal OSA-modified starches, the BM/OSA-modified starch displayed new features such as reduced viscosity and rigidity but increased paste stability during shearing, heating and cooling, regardless of the substitution degree. More interestingly, while the physicochemical properties could be regulated by simply altering the BM treatment time, BM/OSA was more efficient and effective at modulating starch properties during the initial period (approx. 10 h), as seen by the rapid evolutions in starch structural disruption and OSA esterification. Thus, the BM/OSA modification {{can serve as a}} viable and cost-effective approach for producing octenyl <b>succinate</b> <b>starches</b> where low viscosity (at relatively high concentrations) and high paste stability are desired...|$|R
40|$|Octenyl <b>succinate</b> <b>starches</b> are {{commonly}} used as emulsifiers and texturizing agents in many food-systems. Rice, tapioca, corn, wheat and potato starches were modified with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) at 3 % level. Structural characterization, molecular weight, starch digestibility and physical properties of starch granule stabilized emulsions were studied for modified starches. Modified potato (0. 022) and wheat (0. 018) starches had the highest and lowest degrees of OSA substitution, respectively. For all starches, amylose and amylopectin molecular mass was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower for OSA starches. OSA modification may have hydrolyzed the small amylose and amylopectin chains, or caused rearrangement of the starch molecules. Although the starch modification improved emulsification properties, botanical source showed more influence on this parameter. Overall, botanical source had more influence on functional properties than degree of substitution.

This species grows best between 4 C and 20 C, and some strains of C. antarcticus have been observed to grow upwards of 25 C. This temperature range {{is one of the}} only things that can distinguish it from C. albidus var. albidus on the DNA level, however, it can be phenotypically differentiated through its ability to utilize different minerals and its overall appearance. When plated the colonies have a slightly mucosoid appearance, with a white to cream coloration. C. antarcticus is able to assimilate nitrogen and glucoronate, and some strains can turn a dirty yellow when assimilating the previously mentioned compounds. When being cultured in liquid media, constant agitation is required. On a microscopic level this yeast is ovoid in shape. C. antarcticus has not been seen to sexually reproduce, but when they do reproduce asexually they do so through budding. Mature cells that have not recently budded typically are 4.0 μm by 7.5 μm, and they do not appear to produce pseudomycelium. C. antarcticus is not able to ferment, but all of its strains use cellobiose, 2-ketogluconate in hemicalcium salt, gluconate at pH 5.8, glucuronate at pH 5.5, maltose, mannitol, melezitose, soluble <b>starch</b> and <b>succinate</b> at pH 5.5 as sole carbon sources. Only certain strains of C. anarcticus can use citrate at pH 6.0, D-glucitol, L-arabinose, raffinose and xylose as sole carbone sources. This species does not require vitamins for optimal growth. Cryptococcus anarcticus is able to produce amylose. This species is also able to assimilate L-lysine, nitrate and cadaverine as nitrogen sources.|$|R

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} of an indirect or direct involvement of carbon metabolites in the short-term regulation of nitrogenase activity, nodule O 2 permeability was manipulated either by defoliation or by varying rhizosphere O 2 partial pressure. In contrast to defoliation, a 50 % reduction of the nodule O 2 permeability, due to adapting nodules to 40 kPa O 2, {{had no effect on}} nodule sucrose concentration. Likewise, total concentrations of other carbon metabolites such as fructose, <b>starch,</b> L-malate, and <b>succinate</b> tended to be differentially affected by the two treatments. Upon defoliation, carbon metabolites in roots responded {{in a manner similar to}} those in nodules. Sucrose concentration in nodules decreased significantly after the removal of 40 % of the leaf area, which is known to have no effect on nitrogenase activity and O 2 permeability. During regrowth after a 100 % defoliation, nitrogenase activity could be increased at any time by elevating rhizospheric O 2 partial pressure. Thus, during the entire growing cycle nitrogenase activity seems primarily oxygen limited. Changes in whole nodule sucrose pools after defoliation have to be viewed as secondary effects not necessarily linked to nodule activity. Whole-nodule carbon metabolites appear not to be determinants of nodule activity, either through direct metabolic involvement or through indirect effects such as triggering O 2 permeability...|$|R
40|$|The food {{processing}} industry {{has focused on}} using conventional methods for food preservation. However, the recurring incidence of food borne illnesses and outbreaks due to pathogenic or spoilage organisms have called for creation of novel intervention strategies. In recent years, antimicrobial compounds from natural sources are gaining significant importance in improving food safety and security. However, antimicrobials suffer from extensive degradation when applied to complex food systems due to several specific or non-specific interactions. There is an urgent need {{for the protection of}} such antimicrobials to prolong their activity in foods. One strategy of achieving the goal is by the combination with a delivery vehicle. In this work, we explored the interaction between novel carbohydrate biomaterial and model antimicrobial compounds. In addition, we studied the protection of such antimicrobials using carbohydrate based colloidal systems. In the first part, we examine the interactions between nisin and carbohydrate based materials in non-emulsion (aqueous) and emulsion systems. Phytoglycogen octenyl succinate (PG-OS), a dendrimer-like amphiphilic material was used as the model carbohydrate nanoparticle and nisin was used as the model antimicrobial peptide. Equilibrium dialysis experiments showed that PG-OS with different degree of substitution (DS) interacts with nisin in a Langmuir monolayer adsorption pattern in both non-emulsion and emulsion systems. The monolayer adsorption capacity (Qm) increased in non-emulsion system and was significantly higher in the emulsion system. At the equivalent concentration of PG-OS (5. 0 mg/mL), and nisin (200 µg/mL), adsorbed nisin concentration in aqueous and emulsion systems were 22 and 157 µg/mL, respectively. The study demonstrated that DS of PG-OS can be used to control nisin adsorption in the non-emulsion system. In addition, the distribution of PG-OS at the droplet interface affects nisin adsorption in the emulsion system. ^ In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we studied the protection of nisin as model antimicrobial using <b>starch</b> octenyl <b>succinate</b> or starch-OS based oil-in-water emulsion system against Listeria monocytogenes. Cantaloupe juice was used as the model food system because of its significant protease concentration, which depletes nisin activity. Nisin was combined with starch-OS stabilized emulsion at 500 µg/mL initial concentration and compared with nisin solution in cantaloupe juice model. The study demonstrated that protease in cantaloupe juice was the key factor behind nisin depletion. Antimicrobial efficacy tests revealed that starch-OS stabilized emulsion can prolong nisin activity till 6 days of interaction with cantaloupe juice. In addition, equilibrium dialysis experiments demonstrated that nisin adsorption to the colloidal system was responsible for prolonged antibacterial activity. In the last part, the protection of nisin and thymol combined with starch-OS emulsion against a model Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes) and a model Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella Typhimurium) in cantaloupe juice is reported. Thymol, being a volatile essential oil component suffers from extensive loss from foods due to evaporation, therefore it needs to be protected using a delivery vehicle. In general, combinations of nisin and thymol formulations demonstrated minor collaborative effects with regards to bacterial inhibition. Delivery system combined antimicrobials demonstrated effect till 7 days of incubation with cantaloupe juice. Out of all formulations, nisin and thymol combination with emulsion demonstrated the best antibacterial efficacy for a prolonged period of time. After 7 days of incubation, it showed 2. 53 and 2. 80 log 10 CFU/mL difference against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium, respectively. Overall, this research was an attempt to understand the interaction and extend the effect of antimicrobial molecules combined with carbohydrate materials as colloidal systems. ...|$|R
