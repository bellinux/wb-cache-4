Why is one author abrupt, another rhythmical, another concise? Evidently {{in each case}} the habitual mode of utterance must depend upon the habitual balance of the nature. The predominant feelings have by use trained the intellect to represent them. But while long, though unconscious, discipline has made it do this efficiently, it remains from lack of practice, incapable of doing {{the same for the}} less active feelings; and when these are excited, the usual verbal forms undergo but slight modifications. Let the powers of speech be fully developed, however--let the ability of the intellect to utter the emotions be complete; and this fixity of style will disappear. The perfect writer will express himself as Junius, when in the Junius frame of mind; when he feels as Lamb felt, will use a like familiar speech; and will fall into the ruggedness of Carlyle when in a Carlylean mood. Now he will be rhythmical and now irregular; here his language will be plain and there ornate; sometimes his sentences will be balanced and at other times unsymmetrical; for a while there will be considerable sameness, and then again great variety. His mode of expression naturally responding to his state of feeling, there will flow from his pen a composition changing to the same degree that the aspects of his <b>subject</b> <b>change.</b> He will thus without effort conform to what we have seen to be the laws of effect. And while his work presents to the reader that variety needful to prevent continuous exertion of the same faculties, it will also answer to the description of all highly organized products, both of man and of nature: it will be not a series of like parts simply placed in juxtaposition, but one whole made up of unlike parts that are mutually dependent.|$|E

The person, to whom {{these high}} titles now belonged, was Sir Thomas [...] Osburne, a Baronet of good family, and decayed estate; part of [...] {{which had been}} lost in the royal cause. He was of a bold undaunted [...] character, and stood high for the prerogative. Hence he was thought [...] worthy of being sworn into the Privy Council during the [...] {{administration}} of the famous CABAL; and when that was dissolved by [...] the secession of Shaftesbury and the resignation of Clifford, he [...] was judged a proper person to succeed the latter as Lord High [...] Treasurer. He was created Earl of Danby, and was supposed to be [...] deeply engaged in the attempt to new-model our Constitution on a [...] more arbitrary plan; having been even heard to say, when sitting in [...] judgment, that a new proclamation from the Crown was superior to an [...] old act of Parliament. Nevertheless, he was persecuted as well by [...] the faction of the Duke of York, to whom he was odious for having [...] officiously introduced the famous Popish plot to the consideration [...] of parliament, as by the popular party, who hated him as a [...] favourite minister. Accordingly, in 1678, he was impeached by a [...] vote of the House of Commons, and in consequence, notwithstanding [...] the countenance of the King, was deprived of all his offices, and [...] finally committed to the tower, where he remained for four years. [...] Sir John Reresby has these reflections on Lord Danby's greatness [...] and sudden fall: [...] "It was but a few months before, that few things [...] were transacted at court, but with the privity or consent of this [...] great man; the King's brother, and favourite mistress, were glad to [...] be fair with him, and the general address of all men of business [...] was to him, who was not only treasurer, but prime minister also, [...] who not only kept the purse, but was the first, and greatest [...] confident in all affairs of state. But now he is neglected of [...] all, forced to hide his head as a criminal, and in danger of losing [...] all he has got, and his life therewith: His family, raised from [...] privacy to the degree of Marquis, (a patent was then actually [...] passing to invest him with that dignity) is now on the brink of [...] falling below the humble stand of a yeoman; nor would almost the [...] meanest <b>subject</b> <b>change</b> conditions with him now, whom so very lately [...] the greatest beheld with envy."

[...] The unpleasant nature of such silences is associated with feelings of anxiety as the participants feel pressure to speak but are unsure of what to say next.

An awkward silence may occur if a pause has exceeded, for instance, a length generally accepted for demarcating a <b>subject</b> <b>change</b> {{or the end of}} a turn.

The primitive prototonic particle *to was reinterpreted in post-anatolian period as an anaphoric element referred to a non-subject antecedent.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} perspective on how organizational learning informs and extends {{our understanding of}} change. Several parallels that we note between change and organizational learning include: (i) drivers of change (internal and external) and locus of learning (internal and external), (ii) frame-bending and frame-breaking change and exploitation and exploration as forms of learning, (iii) context, content and process of change, corresponding to situated, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of learning, and finally (iv) change implementation {{and its impact on}} learning outcomes (single-loop and double-loop learning). Using our insights from the two literatures, we propose a dynamic, integrative conceptual model of change based on organizational learning. The nature of organizational change and how firms deal with it has been an area of high research priority for management scholars (Baden-Fuller and Volberda, 1997; Van de Ven and Poole, 1995).

40|$|Objective. We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of an intensified anticipatory guidance program in the nursery on Emergency Department (ED) use for nonurgent conditions (NUCs) in the neonatal period. Methods. Parturient mothers of healthy newborns were randomized to an intervention group or control group. Baseline and 1 -month follow-up knowledge surveys regarding newborn care were conducted. The primary outcome was the proportion of neonates who used the ED for a NUC. Secondary outcome was change in caregivers’ knowledge on NUC. Results. Of a total of 594 mothers, 323 (54 %) agreed to participate and were randomized to intervention (n= 170) or control (n= 153) group. Most were Hispanic (68 %), single (61 %), primiparous (39 %), and without high school diploma (44 %). 35 (21 %) neonates in the intervention group and 41 (27 %) {{in the control group}} were brought at least once for a NUC to the ED (p= 0. 12).

Objectives: *Determine the presence and magnitude of the between-group and within- <b>subject</b> <b>change</b> in hazard perception skills in young drivers with ADHD who receive Drive Smart training. Determine whether training facilitated change in hazard perception is maintained over time. Methods: This was a feasibility study, randomised control trial conducted in Australia. The design included a delayed treatment for the control group. Twenty-five drivers with a diagnosis of ADHD were randomised to the Immediate Intervention or Delayed Intervention group. The Immediate Intervention group received a training session using a computer application entitled Drive Smart. The Delayed Intervention group watched a documentary video initially (control condition), followed by the Drive Smart computer training session. The participant&# 039;s hazard perception skill was measured using the Hazard Perception Test (HPT). Findings: After adjusting for baseline scores, {{there was a significant}} betweengroup difference in post-intervention HPT change scores in favour of the Immediate Intervention group. The magnitude of the effect was large. There was no significant within-group delayed intervention effect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to investigate whether, with vision, the magnitude of the effect of calf muscles fatigue on postural control during bipedal quiet standing depends on the eye-visual target distance. Twelve young university students were asked to stand upright as immobile as possible in three visual conditions (No vision, Vision 1 m and Vision 4 m) executed in two conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue of the calf muscles. Centre of foot pressure displacements were recorded using a force platform. Similar increased variances of the centre of foot pressure displacements were observed in the fatigue relative to the No fatigue condition for both the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions. Interestingly, in the vision 1 m condition, fatigue yielded: (1) a similar increased variance of the centre of foot pressure displacements to those observed in the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions along the medio-lateral axis and (2) a weaker destabilising effect relative to the No vision and Vision 4 m conditions along the antero-posterior axis. These results evidence that the ability to use visual information for postural control during bipedal quiet standing following calf muscles fatigue is dependent on the eye-visual target distance.

40|$|Introduction: Fighter pilots report G {{tolerance}} {{increases with}} regular exposure. Our previous work {{has shown that}} the cardiovascular system of +Gz-adapted fighter pilots responds differently to orthostatic challenges than that of non-pilots. A +Gz training effect in pilots after repetitive +Gz exposure has also been shown. Individual pilot factors such as flying experience may have a role in +Gz adaptation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between flying hours (a marker of cumulative +Gz exposure) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) response to head-up tilt (HUT; a marker of enhanced cardiovascular performance). Methods: There were 14 male fighter pilots who participated: 9 had over 1000 h jet flying experience and 5 had less than 500 h. Subjects underwent rapid (~ 4 s) + 75 ° HUT. Beat-to-beat MAP was measured noninvasively. For each <b>subject,</b> <b>change</b> in MAP from resting values was obtained for the first 30 heart beats of the HUT period. MAP responses to tilt were compared between the experienced and less experienced pilots, and the averages of the MAP deviation values were plotted against flying hours. Results: There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 87, P < 0. 01) between the MAP response to tilt and jet flying hours. Comparison of the MAP responses to tilt indicates that the experienced pilots increased MAP more (+ 8 ± 1. 7 vs 5 ± 1. 5 mmHg) and maintained MAP at a higher level during the HUT than the less experienced pilots. Conclusion: The results suggest that flying experience in the high +Gz environment is strongly correlated with enhanced cardiovascular performance under conditions of accelerative stress...|$|E
40|$|Pictures of Linda is a {{collaborative}} storytelling project that is ongoing and experimental. The {{body of work}} develops in different directions through a process initiated by both subject (primarily Linda) and photographer (usually me). It {{is central to the}} project's ethos that photographer and <b>subject</b> <b>change</b> places at times, so that Linda becomes autobiographer as well as biographical subject. The work aims to question the power relationship between subject and photographer in the creation of photographic portraiture. The project has evolved over a thirty-year period and is still changing today: its continuous experiment in picture making represents a long-term commitment to challenging documentary conventions. The work tracks numerous lifestyle changes over time, as Linda’s life is represented {{in a variety of ways}} through her extraordinary range of costumes and guises. The costumes used in the shooting process all belong to her, and are not simply for dressing up: she wears these outfits every day. Besides raising questions about the documentary process itself, the work also aims to challenge myths and conventions concerning representations of women, particularly with reference to the picturing of women in rural locations (in the UK). The new work in this project, since 2008, includes: photographs by Linda (self-portraits and some photographs of me); texts (emails and excerpts photographed from Linda’s autobiography); photographs by me of Linda; and a video work funded by the Arts Council of England, made earlier but first shown in 2008, in Cockroach Diary and Other Stories. This ACE-supported exhibition (funded under the working title 'Masked Ball') presented a mix of older and new work, and the whole body of work including the video was shown at the Union of Lithuanian Art Photographers’ 36 th International Art Photography Meeting, Nida, 2013, where I also delivered a paper, 'Fabrication: documentary storytelling in the modern world'...|$|E
