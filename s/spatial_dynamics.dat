2500|$|Developments in {{landscape}} ecology illustrate the important relationships between spatial patterns and ecological processes. These developments incorporate quantitative methods that link spatial patterns and ecological processes at broad {{spatial and temporal}} scales. [...] This linkage of time, space, and environmental change can assist managers in applying plans to solve environmental problems. [...] The increased attention in recent years on <b>spatial</b> <b>dynamics</b> has highlighted {{the need for new}} quantitative methods that can analyze patterns, determine the importance of spatially explicit processes, and develop reliable models. [...] Multivariate analysis techniques are frequently used to examine landscape level vegetation patterns. [...] Studies use statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), or detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), for classifying vegetation. [...] Gradient analysis is another way to determine the vegetation structure across a landscape or to help delineate critical wetland habitat for conservation or mitigation purposes (Choesin and Boerner 2002).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to describe, analyse and discuss the {{development}} of <b>spatial</b> population <b>dynamics</b> in the Czech Republic between 1989 and 2007. Demographic structure and migration, the two components of <b>spatial</b> population <b>dynamics,</b> are analysed using two spatial dimensions, the urban-suburban-rural gradient and the core-periphery region distinction, using quantitative analyses, including gravity regression modelling of migration. The analysis primarily focuses on domestic migration as the main vehicle of <b>spatial</b> population <b>dynamics.</b> It discusses the structure, determinants, and temporal evolution of migration and its consequences on the population structure in different spatial categories. The thesis indicates that suburbanisation has recently become the main factor influencing Czech <b>spatial</b> population <b>dynamics.</b> The key factor determining migration destination is the social status of migrants, whereas age has only secondary importance. However, since Czechs are not very mobile, population dispersal is less large-scale than in Western-Europe. This explains why recent domestic migration patterns have had only a small measurable influence on the social or demographic structures of the population across spatial categories...|$|R

2500|$|The {{population}} size for the Bangladesh Sundarbans was estimated as 100–150 adult females or 335–500 tigers overall. Female home ranges, recorded using Global Positioning System collars, {{were some of}} the smallest recorded for tigers, indicating that the Bangladesh Sundarbans could have one of the highest densities and largest populations of tigers anywhere in the world. They are isolated from the next tiger population by a distance of up to [...] Information is lacking on many aspects of Sundarbans tiger ecology, including relative abundance, population status, <b>spatial</b> <b>dynamics,</b> habitat selection, life history characteristics, taxonomy, genetics, and disease. There is also no monitoring program in place to track changes in the tiger population over time, and therefore no way of measuring the response of the population to conservation activities or threats. Most studies have focused on the tiger-human conflict in the area, but two studies in the Sundarbans East Wildlife sanctuary documented habitat-use patterns of tigers, and abundances of tiger prey, and another study investigated tiger parasite load. Some major threats to tigers have been identified. The tigers living in the Sundarbans are threatened by habitat destruction, prey depletion, highly aggressive and rampant intraspecific competition, tiger-human conflict, and direct tiger loss.|$|E

40|$|F 11. 81 >. We {{are just}} {{beginning}} to understand how spatial and temporal population dynamics are integrated. From an empirical point of view, it is of interest to obtain accurate estimates of the strength of synchrony as a function of isolation and spatial distance between populations. Central to the statistical analysis and estimation of synchrony from spatiotemporal data is the concept of spatial covariance (Box 1). The role of theory in this context is to predict what covariance patterns can arise from different ecological mechanisms and, eventually, how the resultant covariance patterns can feed back into (temporal) population dynamics 12, 13. The final, and perhaps most tricky, step in the interplay of theoretical and empirical approaches to <b>spatial</b> population <b>dynamics</b> is the empirical testing of the possible causal mechanisms.

40|$|Aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{are among the}} most complex due to the highly nonlinearity, randomness, as well as interactive multi-processes in multi-scales. Besides, highly limited understanding and very limited measurement data make the modelling of such kind of systems a very challenging task, which needs to combine domain knowledge, available data and other models. The concept of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in modelling <b>spatial</b> population <b>dynamics</b> of aquatic plant growth is explored in this research due to the capability of MAS in utilizing various information and data, reflecting both the interactions among different entities and entity's own properties. Expert biological knowledge, GIS maps and environmental conditions are used as input information and data in the development of MAS model. Several different aspects are included: plant agents, environmental backgrounds, and animal influences. Environmental background factors include flow pattern, light visibility, water temperature, water depth and wind, which are all abiotic factors. Plant agents represent different plant species; the ones in this research are Potamogeton pectinatus (Pp) and Chara aspera (Cs), while animals here refer to water birds. Based on biological knowledge and data supplied for Lake Veluwe, the MAS modelling rules were developed. Through these MAS rules, agents are linked to environmental and biological processes. The resulting <b>spatial</b> pattern <b>dynamics</b> indicates that a multi-agent approach can exhibit complex behaviour even when the individual strategies of each agent are simple. The test case for Lake Veluwe showed quite good agreement compared to the GIS maps available and the biological knowledge presented. Multi-Agent Systems show a promising approach to modelling <b>spatial</b> population <b>dynamics</b> for aquatic plants. ...|$|R
