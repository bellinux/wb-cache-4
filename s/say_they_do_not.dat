The administrators of the site <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> initiate online contact with the users, and refuse to act on tips from the public as a result. If a user starts chatting to the volunteer and turns the conversation to sex, the volunteer responds positively and encourages them to divulge personal details, particularly a telephone number, ostensibly needed to verify their identity so that a meeting can be arranged.|$|E

25|$|During the 21st century, {{the area}} became more gentrified. In 1998, the Blackwell Island Light was {{restored}} by an anonymous donor. In 2006, the restored Octagon Tower opened, {{serving as the}} central lobby of a two-wing, 500-unit apartment building. In 2010, the Roosevelt Island Tramway reopened after renovations. A year later, Southpoint Park opened south of Goldwater Memorial Hospital, near the island's southern end, Cornell Tech, {{a joint venture between}} Technion– Israel Institute of Technology and Cornell University, was announced the same year. In 2012, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park was dedicated and opened to the public as a state park. Construction of the new Cornell Tech campus began in January 2014 with the arrival of equipment on Roosevelt Island for the building of a fence around the construction site and for the demolition of the existing Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital's south campus; demolition began in March 2014, but city officials <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have plans to close the north campus of the hospital.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E

500|$|Zvi Lederman, {{the other}} {{co-director of the}} dig, {{believes}} that Beth Shemesh was a cultural meeting point {{on the border of}} Israelite, Canaanite, and Philistine areas and calls the stories of Samson [...] "border sagas", noting that Samson could cross boundaries to seek out a Philistine wife, but also to fight and kill Philistines: [...] "When you cross the border, you have to fight the enemy and you encounter dangerous animals. You meet bad things. These are stories of contact and conflict, of a border that is more cultural than political." [...] According to Haaretz, [...] "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal." ...|$|E

Although he never reported his wife missing, police <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> plan to charge him in her death unless more evidence surfaces, as his whereabouts {{at the time of}} his wife's death are currently unknown.

[...] In this article, author Joanna Cantor interviews her sister Edith, also an amateur editor, who says she receives stories with cover letters apologizing for the tale as [...] "a Mary Sue", even when the author admits she does not know what a [...] "Mary Sue" [...] is. According to Edith Cantor, while Paula Smith's original [...] "Trekkie's Tale" [...] was only ten paragraphs long, [...] "in terms of their impact on those whom they affect, those words [...] have got to rank right up there with the Selective Service Act". At Clippercon 1987 (a Star Trek fan convention held yearly in Baltimore, Maryland), Smith interviewed a panel of female authors who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> include female characters in their stories at all. She quoted one as saying [...] "Every time I've tried to put a woman in any story I've ever written, everyone immediately says, this is a Mary Sue." [...] Smith also pointed out that [...] "Participants in a panel discussion in January 1990 noted with growing dismay that any female character created within the community is damned with the term Mary Sue." ...|$|E

About every quarter of a mile, it seemed to me, a man came out and held up a club till the train went by, to signify that everything was safe ahead. Switches were changed a mile in advance by pulling a wire rope that passed along the ground by the rail, from station to station.

60|$|This may {{be thought}} {{inconsistent}} in itself, and wide {{from the business}} of this book; particularly, I reflect {{that many of those}} who may be pleased and diverted with the relation of the wild and wicked part of my story may not relish this, which is really the best part of my life, the most advantageous to myself, and the most instructive to others. Such, however, will, I hope, allow me the liberty to make my story complete.

60|$|Perhaps {{we ought}} not to deny their town of Troy and their temple of Delphos to the dull people; but if we ought, and if we did, they would still insist upon having them. An English novel, full of titles and rank, is {{apparently}} essential to the happiness of such people; their weak and childish imagination is at home in its familiar environment; they know what they are reading; {{the fact that it is}} hash many times warmed over reassures them; whereas a story of our own life, honestly studied and faithfully represented, troubles them with varied misgiving. They are not sure that it is literature; they do not feel that it is good society; its characters, so like their own, strike them as commonplace; they <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> wish to know such people.|$|E
60|$|I <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{want to be}} free. When {{they are}} oppressed, they cry out--as an animal cries when you beat him.

'Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us out of Egypt?' And again, 'Would God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, where we did sit by the flesh-pots, and eat meat to the full!'

60|$|I am much mistaken, too, if {{since the}} Revolution {{some very good}} ships have not been built at this town, and {{particularly}} the Melford or Milford galley, a ship of forty guns; as the Greyhound frigate, a man-of-war of thirty-six to forty guns, was at John's Ness. But what is this towards lessening the town of Ipswich, {{any more than it}} would be to <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> build men-of-war, or East India ships, or ships of five hundred ton burden at St. Catherines, or at Battle Bridge in the Thames? when we know that a mile or two lower, viz., at Radcliffe, Limehouse, or Deptford, they build ships of a thousand ton, and might build first-rate men-of-war too, if there was occasion; and the like might be done in this river of Ipswich, within about two or three miles of the town; so {{that it would not be}} at all an out-of-the-way speaking to say, such a ship was built at Ipswich, any more than it is to say, as they do, that the Royal Prince, the great ship lately built for the South Sea Company, was London built, because she was built at Limehouse.|$|E
60|$|And it {{was just}} that which had most disconcerted me in my {{dealings}} with him. When people <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> care what others think of them, {{for the most part they}} deceive themselves. Generally they mean only that they will do as they choose, in the confidence that no one will know their vagaries; and at the utmost only that they are willing to act contrary to the opinion of the majority because they are supported by the approval of their neighbours. It is not difficult to be unconventional in the eyes of the world when your unconventionality is but the convention of your set. It affords you then an inordinate amount of self-esteem. You have the self-satisfaction of courage without the inconvenience of danger. But the desire for approbation is perhaps the most deeply seated instinct of civilised man. No one runs so hurriedly to the cover of respectability as the unconventional woman who has exposed herself to the slings and arrows of outraged propriety. I do not believe the people who tell me they do not care a row of pins for the opinion of their fellows. It is the bravado of ignorance. They mean only that they do not fear reproaches for peccadillos which they are convinced none will discover.|$|E

There is sure to be a palaver when the men who have been on the hills come down. It will be too late then for them to go back before night, so that I think we are pretty sure to find them all in the ravine this evening. If, when we get there, we find the place empty, we must come to a decision as to what our best course will be. In that case I think we ought to climb the hills and make our way up the mountains as rapidly as possible. We could calculate on eight or ten hours' start, and by keeping as much as possible on the rocks, might hope to get so high among the mountains {{that they would not be}} able to follow our traces and overtake us before we reach a point where they would not dare follow us. In that case, of course we should have to give up all hope of finding the gold valley, and lose the mules with all our belongings, which would cripple us terribly." ...|$|E
