The song begins with the lyrics [...] "I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker", during the song [...] "a slew of f-bombs" [...] can be heard, and varied graphic descriptions such as: [...] "You got your legs {{up in the sky}} with the devil in your eyes / Let me hear you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it all" [...] and the chorus [...] "You and me, baby, making love like gorillas!". Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor. On September 11, 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that Dannielle Miller, co-founder of Enlighten Education, decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban [...] "Gorilla", due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, father, that is {{just what}} <b>you</b> were <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted,</b> and I am sure you spent hours every day walking about with the children, or telling them stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, God bless my soul," [...] shrieked out the Doctor, hardly {{knowing whether}} to burst with rage or laughter, [...] "you don't mean to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to marry her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{you have}} to do is to go in and <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the ice cream that Mrs. Babbitt ordered {{yesterday}} by 'phone, and it will be all ready for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Their degrees {{are as good}} as his. You are too 'manly,' you say, {{to arrest}} their course. Is {{injustice}} manliness? We have another name for it. We <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the pluck.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. I don't ride behind {{anything}} but Vermont; never did. Touch of Morgan, of course; but you can't have much Morgan in a horse if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> speed. Hambletonian mostly. Where'd <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to get out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't ye <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> one to match? Ho, ho! I reckon I cotched {{you that}} trip, didn't I?" [...] And the man {{continued}} to laugh, and Dave and Phil joined in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, as for that, I {{should have}} thought the new horse {{might have been able}} to carry you as far as that. I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to see Mr. Crawley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy on us, {{these things}} are like the night-drawers Jamie wears! You don't mean to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> Rose {{to come out in}} this costume? It's not proper, and I won't consent to it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said, 'You're arresting me, huh? <b>Say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to {{look where}} you're goin'; I cut some ice in this town. I made half the big {{politicians}} in New York!' That {{was what he}} said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don’t {{you talk}} nonsense," [...] said Mr. Blows, violently. [...] "You {{go to them}} interfering Camels and <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your money—all of it. Say you’re going to Australia. Say it was my last dying wish." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never bore them--and {{they are}} so easily bored! It bores them if you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be married. I {{think it would be}} sweet to be married, but you should never ask for a wedding. They give you {{everything}} else, but if you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a wedding, they stamp their feet and go away. Why are you crying, girl? You should not cry; they don't like it. Put on your prettiest gown and laugh and pretend you are happy, and then they will tell you naughty stories and give you these." [...] She felt her ears and looked at her fingers, on which there may once have been jewels, but there were none now.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{an immense}} number of words," [...] said Cecilia after a pause, [...] "to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{to fall in}} love! I 've no doubt you have as good a genius for that as any one, if you would only trust it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's when you're sleeping. But when you're waking, <b>you</b> {{make people}} <b>say</b> just what <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> And that's why day dreams are so bad. If <b>you</b> make people <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> they {{probably}} don't mean it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll {{tell you}} what you might do. <b>You</b> might <b>say</b> that Mr. Berkeley wired that he had left {{something}} here. He had Bertie's room, you know. <b>You</b> might <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to look for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Honora vaguely, [...] "ambitions, {{and what}} {{one is going to}} make of {{themselves}} in life. And then you make fun of me by <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> Mr. Dwyer's house." [...] She laughed again. [...] "I can't imagine you in that house!" ...|$|R
6000|$|OLIVER. You want {{a better}} way,--but not his way: {{he wants a}} better way--but not your way. Why can't you both drop your buts, and simply <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a better way, and believe yourselves and one another when you say it? Why can't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better go into Bideford an' pay up our debts," [...] said Stalky. [...] "I've {{got three}} quid {{out of my}} father--ad hoc. Don't owe more than thirty bob, either.

6000|$|Now {{you should}} be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to go a long distance.

6000|$|... "You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to {{know why}} you were cabled for. I'll tell you. There's no use talking for half a day before you get to the point. I guess you've heard that there's a prince here instead of a {{republic}} now? Well, that's where you come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conclusion}} was, perhaps, {{not entirely}} logical, but Jack overlooked it, {{and handed the}} sum to his visitor. [...] "The old-woman business is about played out, Brown," [...] he added, by way of commentary; [...] "why don't you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to buck agin' faro? You know you ain't married!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} what it cost;--but there it is." [...] This she said, drawing off her glove and showing him her finger. [...] "And when I am dead, there it will be. You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> money, Frank. May I {{not give it}} you? Are not we brother and sister?" ...|$|E
50|$|Word order {{can change}} to clarify words {{that can be}} nouns or verbs. For example, 'akimat' means 'old woman', or, 'to drink'. If <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'acamit ayoŋ akimat' <b>you</b> are <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the old woman rather than <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to drink, so {{in this case the}} infinitive is rather oddly {{replaced}} by the vocative, thus 'acamit ayoŋ tomat' to avoid confusion when you need a drink.|$|R
