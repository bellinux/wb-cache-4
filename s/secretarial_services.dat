The purpose of this report is to present the major findings of the student team including the problems found, and the solutions proposed. The prime focus of this report is the personnel management of the company, rather than financial planning. During the ten week stay, the team found six main problems: organization of management, lack of direction or focus, overstated markets, incorrect pricing schedule, dropping sales levels, and recruitment of new employees. Through interviews, meetings, and outside research, possible solutions were proposed and appear in this report.

The Westropes, who were friends of Nellie in the Esperanto movement, had an easy-going outlook and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was job sharing with Jon Kimche who also lived with the Westropes. Orwell worked at the shop in the afternoons, having the mornings free to write and the evenings to socialise. He was at Booklovers' Corner for fifteen months. His essay [...] "Bookshop Memories", published in November 1936, recalled aspects of his time at the bookshop, and in Keep the Aspidistra Flying, [...] "he described it, or revenged himself upon it, with acerbity and wit and spleen." [...] In their study of Orwell the writers Stansky & Abrahams remarked upon the improvement on the [...] "stumbling attempts at female portraiture in his first two novels: the stereotyped Elizabeth Lackersteen in Burmese Days and the hapless Dorothy in A Clergyman's Daughter" [...] and contended that, in contrast, [...] "Rosemary is a credible female portrait." [...] Through his work in the bookshop Orwell {{was in a position to}} become acquainted with women, [...] "first as a clerk, then as a friend ... and with whom, if circumstances were favourable, he might eventually embark upon a 'relationship' ... This for Orwell the author and Blair the man, was the chief reward of working at Booklovers' Corner." [...] In particular, Orwell met Sally Jerome, at this time working for an advertising agency (like Rosemary in Keep the Aspidistra Flying), and Kay Ekevall, who ran a small typing and <b>secretarial</b> <b>service</b> which did work for Adelphi magazine.|$|R
