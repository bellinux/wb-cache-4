40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of 2 different types of Cotrel-Dubousset instrument systems in stabilising thoracolumbar and lumbar spine fractures. METHODS: Between January 1989 and December 1993, 45 fractures in 42 patients with unstable fracture or fracture dislocation of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spines were randomly assigned to 2 surgical treatments with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation-using either a long <b>segment</b> (<b>Group</b> 1) or a short <b>segment</b> (<b>Group</b> 2) -and short posterolateral fusion. RESULTS: Consolidation of the fractured vertebral body and posterolateral fusion were achieved at a mean time of 4. 5 months; fusion rates were 75 % in Group 1 and 83 % in Group 2. The average collapses of anterior vertebral body height in Group 1, in the immediate postoperative period and at the final follow-up, were 15 % and 17 %, respectively; and in Group 2, the figures were 16 % and 24 %, respectively. The correction of vertebral height and kyphosis at the last follow-up were lost more in Group 2 (5. 7 degrees) than in Group 1 (4. 4 degrees). There were neurological recoveries in 6 of the 9 cases of incomplete paraplegics, including complete recovery in 5, and one-Frankel grade increase in one. There were 15 instrument failures in 12 patients, including screw breakage in 3 Group 1 cases and 6 Group 2 cases. The plug dislodged in 3 Group 1 cases, and the hook dislodged in 3 Group 2 cases. In other words, instrument failures were more common in Group 2. CONCLUSION: Cotrel-Dubousset stabilisation of the fractured spine achieves fracture consolidation, but does not maintain the restored height and sagittal curve completely until fusion. The long rod and short fusion construct was more effective for all fracture types than was the short rod and fusion construct, although it leads to wider immobilisation of normal segments...|$|E

Entre os métodos existentes, destacam-se a reeducação postural global (RPG), que promove o alongamento global das cadeias musculares, e o alongamento segmentar, que alonga um músculo ou grupo muscular específico. Este estudo visou comparar o alongamento segmentar e o global pela técnica de RPG quanto ao ganho de flexibilidade, ADM e força muscular. Trinta mulheres foram distribuídas aleatoriamente em três grupos (n= 10 em cada) : o grupo global fez alongamento de cadeias musculares; o grupo segmentar realizou alongamento segmentar; e o grupo controle não fez alongamento. Antes e depois do tratamento, em todos os grupos, foram avaliadas a ADM de extensão da perna, flexibilidade pelo teste 3 o dedo-solo e força isométrica de flexão da perna em 45 ° e 90 °.

This article looks at the island community of Frøya, in Sør Trøndelag in Norway, where around 20 % {{of the population is}} of foreign descent, and where stakeholders in the production line experience a lack of upward mobility due to their lack of Norwegian language skills, and the insecure nature of their employment status.

This study examined the effect of pravastatin therapy on serum oxidation susceptibility, particularly in relation to endothelial function of coronary arteries. METHODS: The participants were recruited from the Pravastatin-Related Effects Following Angioplasty on Coronary Endothelium trial, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study designed to analyze the effect of pravastatin treatment on endothelial function in previously dilated and normal coronary arteries. Serial, graded, intra-coronary acetylcholine infusions {{were used to assess}} endothelial function. In vitro, copper-induced, serum oxidation parameters were determined at randomization and at time of coronary endothelial function assessment. RESULTS: Oxidation parameters were determined in 45 patients (pravastatin 23, placebo 22). Pravastatin therapy significantly improved serum oxidation lag time (+ 8 %, P < 0. 05), maximal diene formation rate (- 22 %, P < 0. 01) and total amount of dienes formed after 5 h (- 16 %, P < 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract—Recently {{there is}} a line of {{research}} work proposing to employ Spectral Clustering (SC) to <b>segment</b> (<b>group)</b> 1 high-dimensional structural data such as those (approximately) lying on subspaces 2 or low-dimensional manifolds. By learning the affinity matrix {{in the form of}} sparse reconstruction, techniques proposed in this vein often considerably boost the performance in subspace settings where traditional SC can fail. Despite the success, there are fundamental problems that have been left unsolved: the spectrum property of the learned affinity matrix cannot be gauged in advance, and there is often one ugly symmetrization step that post-processes the affinity for SC input. Hence we advocate to enforce the symmetric positive semidefinite constraint explicitly during learning (Low-Rank Representation with Positive SemiDefinite constraint, or LRR-PSD), and show that factually it can be solved in an exquisite scheme efficiently instead of general-purpose SDP solvers that usually scale up poorly. We provide rigorous mathematical derivations to show that, in its canonical form, LRR-PSD is equivalent to the recently proposed Low-Rank Representation (LRR) scheme [1], and hence offer theoretic and practical insights to both LRR-PSD and LRR, inviting future research. As per the computational cost, our proposal is at most comparable to that of LRR, if not less. We validate our theoretic analysis and optimization scheme by experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.
