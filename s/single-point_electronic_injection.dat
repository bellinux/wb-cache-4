5000|$|Along {{with the}} name change, came other major {{improvements}} and tweaks for the final model year of the conventional cab pickups. <b>Single-point</b> <b>electronic</b> throttle-body fuel <b>injection</b> (TBI) was introduced on GM's full-size pickups, with new electric fuel pumps and high-pressure fuel lines. In addition, a [...] "smart" [...] powertrain control module (PCM) was also introduced, which controlled the fuel injection system, fuel-to-air burn ratio, engine ignition timing, and (if equipped with an automatic transmission) the Turbo Hydra-Matic's turbine torque converter clutch. The 5.7 L 350 cubic inch pushrod V-8 {{was introduced to the}} order books for R-Series and V-Series half-ton class pickups, with the new TBI fuel injection system. Horsepower and torque output was increased to 210 hp, and 300 lb-ft of torque.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, the 2.8 was {{produced}} with carburetor (132 bhp), mechanical fuel injection (Bosch K-Jetronic, 160 bhp), and <b>electronic</b> <b>injection</b> (Ford EEC-IV, 150 bhp). <b>Electronic</b> <b>injection</b> only {{featured on the}} 2.8 Granada models for one year before being replaced with the 2.9 unit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{introduces}} {{the structure and}} working principles of the diesel-LNG <b>electronic</b> <b>injection</b> system. For a further experimental study, the author transforms a X 6170 ZC- 19 diesel engine to a hybrid-fuel engine by installing this <b>electronic</b> <b>injection</b> system, and the load characteristics experiment of which testifies that: the diesel-LNG diesel engine can accurately measure the natural gas consumption and can thus control fuel consumption; it also possesses high replacement ratio. In addition, comparing to pure diesel engine, the hybrid-fuel engine has lower fuel consumption and thermal load, and a better performance in environment protection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The structure, stability, and intermolecular rearrangements between ortho-, meta-, and para-C 2 B 10 H 12 and B 12 H 12 2 were {{investigated}} using the hybrid density functional B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) for vibrational frequencies, {{as well as}} B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(2 d,p) for <b>single-point</b> <b>electronic</b> energies.

40|$|The {{research}} {{is presented to}} get the number of comparison for torque, power, and specific fuel consumption between conventional engine (carburetor) system and <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> (EFI) engine system. The method that used to get the data is by using the experiment method. The {{research is}} begun by preparing tools and materials those {{will be used for}} making test bed. After that is assembling the system on the engine alternately after getting the data including voltage, current, engine rotation (rpm), and fuel consumption (ml). Based on the experiment and parameter those have been experimented, the engine performance on the conventional system is lower at the high engine rotation than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system, and when the engine rotation is low, the engine performance of the conventional system is higher than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system, and the specific fuel consumption on the conventional engine system at high engine rotation is more wastefully than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system, but at low engine rotation, the conventional engine system is more economical than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system...|$|R
