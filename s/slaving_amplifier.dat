25|$|From the mid-1980s, Van Halen {{has used}} a {{real-time}} re-amping or Master/Slave <b>slaving</b> <b>amplifier</b> setup that was originally designed by Bob Bradshaw and {{was published in}} the September 1986 issue of Guitar World Magazine. The first amplifier was a Tube Amplifier, and the second amplifier was an H MOSFET solid state power amplifier. Between 1993 and 2004, Van Halen was sponsored by Peavey Electronics to use their 5150 Amplifiers, which he had a role in designing.|$|E
40|$|The Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) {{technique}} {{is a powerful}} method for determining meteorological parameters, but it requires high quality of the laser source: high energy, very narrow bandwidth, high wavelength stability, and spectral purity. Although many efforts {{have been made to}} improve the lasers in view of these aspects, a satisfactory solution has not been demonstrated up to now. We describe a regenerative amplifier, using a Ti:sapphire laser as master oscillator and an alexandrite laser as <b>slave</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which is expected to meet the requirements for water vapor concentration and temperature measurements...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an expository {{document}} describing numerous experimental aspects of ultra cold atoms, based {{entirely on the}} work completed in the current term of May-August 2006. A 87 Rb MAT (Miniature Atom Trap) has been built from start to finish, {{with the exception of}} its laser stabilization scheme. To that end a <b>slave</b> laser <b>amplifier</b> system, magnetic coils, and an UHV system have been assembled. I present a few basic loading rate measurements taken by myself and Dr. James Booth from BCIT, who was instrumental in the conception and rapid success of the experiment. Several magnetic coils and a pair of high voltage electrodes have been designed as part of a heteronuclear Feshbach resonance experiment in the same lab. For these I present a short description, specifications, and several photographs. Finally, a numerical simulation has been written to predict the performance of a magnetic waveguide as low-pass velocity filter. i...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new soft {{switched}} {{cell that}} overcomes {{most of the}} drawbacks of the normal "hard switched-pulse width modulation" converter is proposed to contrive a new family of soft switched PWM converters. All of the semiconductor devices in this converter are turned on and off under exact or near zero voltage switching (ZVS) and/or zero current switching (ZCS). No additional voltage and current stresses on the main switch and main diode occur. A push-pull converter equipped with the proposed snubber cell is analyzed in detail. The predicted operation principles and theoretical analysis of the presented converter are verified with a prototype of a 50 W PWM push-pull multi-output converter with insulated MOSFET and for regulation of <b>slave</b> outputs magnetic <b>amplifier</b> post regulators are considered as post regulators. Moreover; this multioutput converter has a simple structure, low cost, and ease of control circuitry...|$|R
