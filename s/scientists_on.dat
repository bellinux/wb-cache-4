5|$|The {{journey was}} rich in {{scientific}} results. However, {{the relationship between}} the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often problematic, due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament as well as Cook's refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, even single neurons {{appear to}} be complex and capable of {{performing}} computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project is {{trying to build a}} realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> both sides of the argument.|$|E
5|$|In 2379, {{two hundred}} years after the events of Alien 3, {{military}} <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The xenomorph queen's DNA has been mixed in with Ripley's, and the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As {{a result of the}} xenomorphs' DNA inside her, she has enhanced strength and reflexes, blood that is somewhat acidic and a psychic link with the xenomorphs. Additionally, the xenomorph's genetic memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham {{had made}} a {{breakthrough}} investigating the critical mass of uranium-235 in June 1939. Their calculations indicated that it was within {{an order of magnitude}} of , which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum initiated the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E

5|$|New {{concepts}} for {{missions to}} the Neptune {{system to be}} conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward by NASA <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

5|$|This decay chain {{differed}} from the previous observations at RIKEN mainly in the decay mode of 262Db, which was previously observed to undergo spontaneous fission, {{but in this case}} instead alpha decayed; the alpha decay of 262Db to 258Lr is well-known. The <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> this team calculated the probability of accidental coincidence to be 10−28, or totally negligible. The resulting 254Md atom then underwent beta plus decay to 254Fm, which itself finally underwent the seventh alpha decay in the chain to the long-lived 250Cf, which has a half-life of around thirteen years.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> British developments.

5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} relies on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, {{it is argued that}} radiometric dating technique of evaluating a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the carbon-14 isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft, {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission, briefed American <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the London liaison office of the American Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. As part of the scientific exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. Oliphant, one of the Maud Committee's members, flew to the United States in late August 1941, and discovered that vital information had not reached key American physicists. He met the Uranium Committee, and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence, who was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Lawrence in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was a success; key American physicists {{became aware of the}} potential power of an atomic bomb. Armed with British data, Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), briefed Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace in a meeting at the White House on 9 October 1941.|$|E

5|$|It {{was clear}} from the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (<b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E
5|$|When Voight began {{research}} at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, {{it was largely}} unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local <b>scientists</b> <b>on</b> volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division of Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including {{the extent of their}} burn areas, clothing worn, and lung damage. He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing and masks enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity.|$|E
