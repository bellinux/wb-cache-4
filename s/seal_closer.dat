Instead of reverberating in a fairly simple damped enclosure, sound {{from the back of}} the bass speaker is directed into a long (generally folded) damped pathway within the speaker enclosure, which allows far greater control and use of speaker energy, and the resulting sound.|$|R

50|$|Between August 1943 and March 1944, another B-17E (41-2595) was {{converted}} to a cargo aircraft and designated XC-108A. Hoping to convert obsolete bombers into cargo aircraft, the United States Army Air Forces initiated a remanufacturing station at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The plane was stripped of armament, armor, and other military equipment. Crew locations were shifted, and the nose was modified to provide space for cargo and/or personnel. The cockpit was accessed via the crawlway under it or through the hinged solid nose cone that had replaced the original glazed bombardier station. To increase cargo space, several bulkheads were removed and the bomb bay doors were <b>sealed</b> <b>closed.</b> This allowed much of the fuselage volume {{to be used to}} carry cargo or personnel.|$|R

The central chamber itself is entered from the courtyard via an antechamber that goes down into a dimly lit maze of chambers. The access from the antechamber to the exterior courtyard could be <b>sealed</b> <b>closed</b> by rolling a round stone across it, and the stone still remains in-situ. In the first century A.D., a [...] "secret mechanism" [...] operated by water pressure moved the stone. Probably {{a small amount of}} water pressure activated a system of weights to open the tomb. Two of the eight burial chambers have arcosolia, resting places made of a bench with an arch over it. Some of the arcosolia have triangular niches where oil lamps were placed to give light during the burial process.|$|R
2500|$|Vision is its {{critical}} sense. Its {{eyes are}} proportionally large and contain a large spherical lens, improving its focusing ability. Its pupil is mobile {{to help it}} adapt to the intense glare of the Arctic ice. Its retina is rod-dominated and backed by a cat-like and reflective tapetum lucidum, enhancing its low light sensitivity. Its rods best sense blue-green, while its cones help with bright light and may provide some colour discrimination. Its cornea is sometimes tear-covered, {{to protect it from}} salt. Lacking tear ducts, it [...] "cries" [...] to remove its tears. On ice, the mother identifies her offspring by smell. This sense may also warn of an approaching predator.

They may provide a touch sense, and underwater, also respond to low-frequency vibrations, such as movement.|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structural}} changes produced by lymphoedema, and by its treatment by coumarin and rutin were {{studied in the}} facial skin, parotid glands, ciliary bodies and cerebral cortices of rats, after the ligation of their cervical lymphatics. Both the true initial lymphatics (in the first two sites) and the prelymphatics (in the other two) behaved similarly, as did the tissue around them. There was much protein and oedema fluid during lymphoedema, which were markedly reduced by the drugs, separately and in combination. The very dilated lymphatics in the facial skin had many open endothelial intercellular junctions: the better supported ones in the parotid did not dilate so much and had no open junctions, although they normally possess some. It is suggested that the raised intralymphatic pressures, plus the smaller amount of dilatation permitted in this site, caused the junctions to be <b>sealed</b> <b>closed.</b> Fenestrae seemed to have {{little effect on the}} amount of lymphoedema, nor did it appear to affect their numbers...|$|R

40|$|Chromic acid {{has long}} been used to produce a thin, {{corrosion}} resistant (Type I) coating on aluminum. Following anodizing, the hardware was sealed using a sodium dichromate solution. <b>Sealing</b> <b>closes</b> up pores inherent in the anodized coating, thus improving corrosion resistance. The thinness of the brittle coating is desirable from a fatigue standpoint, and chromium was absorbed by the coating during the sealing process, further improving corrosion resistance. Unfortunately, both chromic acid and sodium dichromate contain carcinogenic hexavalent chromium. Sulfuric acid is being considered {{as a replacement for}} chromic acid. Sulfuric acid of 10 - 20 percent concentration has traditionally been used to produce relatively thick (Types II and III) or abrasion resistant (Type III) coatings. A more dilute, that is five weight percent, sulfuric acid anodizing process, which produces a thinner coating than Type II or III, with nickel acetate as the sealant has been developed. The process was evaluated in regard to corrosion resistance, throwing power, fatigue life, and processing variable sensitivity, and shows promise as a replacement for the chromic acid process...|$|R
