60|$|Entering {{the gate}} and passing the shrubs, the {{silhouette}} of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was <b>set.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aperture</b> was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.|$|E
50|$|The lens uses manual focus only. For most {{versions}} of the lens, the aperture must be set manually. For Nikon there are versions with and without a chip to communicate aperture information with the camera. Versions with the chip (model AE8M-N) can <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> automatically. The CS II version of the lens has a removable lens hood.|$|E
50|$|Albert {{built his}} own 16mm camera with {{existing}} parts {{that could be}} comfortably balanced on his shoulder, {{eliminating the need for}} a tripod, allowing him to shoot fluidly in the moment. He added a brace so he could hold the camera steady during long takes. He installed a mirror near the lens and a ring on the focus-pull and could then <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> and focus while the camera rolled, ensuring continuity during a take.|$|E
5000|$|Tv (Shutter speed priority): The camera lets <b>the</b> user <b>set</b> <b>the</b> {{shutter speed}} and {{automatically}} <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> for correct exposure.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A Kodak Pony II camera (1957-1962) with {{exposure}} value setting ring. This camera has a fixed shutter speed, so the [...] "EXP VALUE" [...] ring simply <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With ISO 100 film / <b>setting</b> in <b>the</b> camera, one <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to f/11 and {{the shutter}} speed to 1/100 or 1/125 second (on some cameras 1/125 second is <b>the</b> {{available}} <b>setting</b> nearest to 1/100 second).|$|R
5000|$|The {{routine for}} taking a {{photograph}} with a Stereo Realist is elaborate, compared to a modern camera. One must lift the lens cover, focus, manually <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> and shutter speed, cock the shutter and then take the picture. The wind release button must be depressed briefly while beginning to wind the film to the next frame. [...] The film winding is then completed so that the camera is ready to shoot another pair of images.|$|E
50|$|The {{camera was}} fully manual, with a {{built-in}} CdS light meter. The battery was only for the metering circuit. The user needed to push {{a button on the}} front of the camera to close the aperture, and then <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> ring on the lens to a value where the meter needle would fit inside a marker ring. After this, the user could let go of the button, and have full light in the viewfinder to compose the picture.On release of the shutter, the aperture would close to the correct setting.|$|E
50|$|The XG-M {{supported}} both {{aperture priority}} autoexposure and full manual mode. For aperture priority shooting, the shutter speed dial {{was set to}} the A (auto) position. The photographer would <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> on the lens, which would be visible in the viewfinder {{by means of a}} small periscope beneath the image. The camera would decide on the correct shutter speed according to the reading of its center-weighted average metering. This would be displayed in the viewfinder: a column on the right of the image showed all the shutter speeds, and an LED would light next to the chosen speed. The automatically selected exposure could be adjusted by means of the exposure compensation dial on the left; compensation of plus or minus 2 stops could be selected in half-stop increments.|$|E
5000|$|On a {{sunny day}} and with ISO 100 film / <b>setting</b> in <b>the</b> camera, one <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to [...] and the shutter speed to [...] or [...] second (on some cameras [...] second is <b>the</b> {{available}} <b>setting</b> nearest to [...] second).|$|R
50|$|The FA-J series {{consisted}} of three lower-priced zoom lenses, that were largely identical to the FA series of lenses, but like later DA series lenses lacked <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> ring. As a result, they are not fully compatible with some older manual film cameras, as there was no method of <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> other than through the camera body.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{for a given}} film, if a {{light meter}} {{indicates}} a required EV of 5 and <b>the</b> photographer <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to f/11, then ordinarily a 4-second exposure would be required; a reciprocity correction factor of 1.5 would require the exposure to be extended to 6 seconds for the same result. Reciprocity failure generally becomes significant at exposures of longer than about 1 sec for film, and above 30 sec for paper.|$|R
50|$|The {{shutter speed}} and {{aperture}} controls are {{located at the}} top of the camera. Shutter speed control is through a sliding bar which is marked B 25 50 100 and 200. The number 50 is red, the other numbers are black. The other side, next to the f stop numbers, has markings that say BRIGHT (in red), HAZY and CL'DY BRT (both black). These words have lines pointing to different f stops, depending on where the shutter speed is <b>set.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Aperture</b> lever has 9 positive clicks labeled 3.5, 4, (black dot), 5.6, (red dot), 8, 11, 16, 22. The red dot indicated f 6.3. These exposure suggestions are based on ASA 10 (not 100!) film which in 1954 was still the standard film for color slides just as it had been when the Realist was introduced. The recommended setting for bright sun was a shutter speed of 1/50th with an aperture of f 6.3.|$|E
5000|$|The M7 {{introduced}} auto-exposure in <b>aperture</b> priority mode: <b>the</b> user <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> on <b>the</b> lens manually, and {{the camera}} chooses a shutter speed. Manual exposure is also available. The shutter is electronically controlled, but speeds of 1/60th and 1/125th of a second are mechanically governed if the battery fails. Like the M6 TTL, the M7 features an [...] "off" [...] position on the shutter speed dial. The shutter release is redesigned with two distinct levels of pressure: the first detent locks the exposure reading, the second fires the shutter.|$|R
50|$|Both units add the {{possibility}} of shutter-priority auto exposure mode by <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> lens's <b>aperture</b> ring to 'A'. <b>The</b> <b>aperture</b> needle disappears from the meter display, and the meter needle indicates what <b>aperture</b> <b>the</b> AE system has selected. Also, using either of the motor drive systems also enables use of electronic interval timers and remote shutter releases, both wired and wireless.|$|R
5000|$|DEP: DEP (DEPth of field) mode, on some Canon cameras, <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> {{to yield}} <b>the</b> desired depth of field: one {{points at the}} nearest object that {{one wants to be}} in focus, half-presses the shutter, then points at the {{farthest}} object that one wants to be in focus, half-presses the shutter, at which point <b>the</b> camera <b>sets</b> both focus and aperture so that both objects are in focus. One then reframes the scene and fully depresses the shutter to take the photo. Unlike other modes, this also sets focus, and requires two separate metering/focus stages.|$|R
2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] <b>aperture,</b> which allows <b>the</b> lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, <b>set</b> <b>the</b> working <b>aperture</b> for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> and <b>the</b> other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset <b>aperture</b> control are <b>the</b> Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5. [...] The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85mm 2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>aperture</b> on <b>the</b> lens is <b>set</b> from <b>the</b> body by {{the same}} stop-down lever found on the {{original}} K-mount, but on KA-lenses this lever {{is proportional to the}} area of <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> opening, rather than the diameter as on previous lenses. This allows the body to easily set a specific <b>aperture,</b> since <b>the</b> relationship to F stops is linear. The lenses add an 'A' <b>setting</b> on <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> dial, which gives the body control of <b>the</b> <b>aperture.</b> Other, numeric settings are used for manual aperture modes—aperture priority and full manual mode.|$|R
50|$|The F series {{were the}} first {{autofocus}} lenses (excluding the rare smc Pentax-AF 35-70mm F2.8, made only for the ME-F camera). The autofocus is of screw-drive type, still supported by all Pentax DSLRs. They featured an aperture ring, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to be controlled manually. Thus F lenses are able to be used on older cameras which do not support automatic <b>setting</b> of <b>the</b> <b>aperture,</b> such as <b>the</b> Pentax K1000.|$|R
5000|$|Like the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF mount used on {{previous}} Pentax digital SLRs, the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF2 lacks the mechanism to mechanically sense a lens's aperture ring setting. For that reason, when using <b>the</b> manual <b>aperture</b> ring on K-mount lenses, {{it is necessary}} to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> 'Use <b>aperture</b> ring' <b>setting</b> in <b>the</b> 'Custom Menu' to 'Permitted' and use stop-down metering mode (Pentax calls it optical preview) to ensure proper exposure. KA and KAF lenses with aperture rings are fully compatible when <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> ring is <b>set</b> to automatic ('A'), giving control over <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to <b>the</b> camera body.|$|R
5000|$|The non-coupled {{selenium}} cell exposure meter reads out in exposure values (EVs) only. The camera is then <b>set</b> to <b>the</b> proper EV <b>setting</b> via an easily reached aperture release tab, though the EV scale itself is rather inconveniently {{located on the}} underside of the lens assembly. Once <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> release tab is <b>set</b> and released, <b>the</b> shutter ring is coupled to <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> ring - moving the shutter ring automatically moves <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> ring, so that the same exposure value is maintained. In other words, when in use, the camera is normally locked into one EV <b>setting</b> until <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> release tab is pressed. Needless to say this can be confusing to those unfamiliar with the camera.|$|R
50|$|The {{current line}} of Rodenstock {{enlarging}} lenses have removable click-stops for <b>setting</b> <b>aperture</b> in <b>the</b> dark, an illuminated f-stop display, {{and an aperture}} pre-set feature, which allows <b>setting</b> of <b>the</b> working <b>aperture,</b> and quick changing from full <b>aperture</b> to <b>the</b> working <b>aperture,</b> for easy focusing and framing.|$|R
50|$|A minimal {{amount of}} {{photographic}} flash automation was provided. With a compatible dedicated flash, the camera would be <b>set</b> automatically to <b>the</b> 1/60 second X-sync speed, and a ready {{light in the}} viewfinder would blink when the flash was charged. The photographer did have to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> correct <b>aperture</b> for flash photography according to subject distance; a guide was available {{on the back of}} Minolta's flashes.|$|R
5000|$|Like its FL predecessor, the FD {{mount system}} allowed {{automatic}} diaphragm function, but in addition, a new signal pin supported full-aperture metering. A second signal pin for the [...] "auto" [...] <b>setting</b> of <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> dial, plus a linkage to allow <b>the</b> camera to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> degree of diaphragm opening, enabled integral auto-exposure. The first camera to utilize {{this was the}} 1971 Canon F-1, when equipped with the Servo EE Finder. Later, the Canon EF of 1973 had automatic exposure built-in, as did the very popular Canon A-series cameras (save the AT-1) beginning in 1976.|$|R
50|$|The {{batteries}} also powered the ME F's {{exposure control}} system. This system lit LEDs alongside a vertical {{shutter speed scale}} {{on the left side}} of <b>the</b> viewfinder. In <b>aperture</b> priority mode, a steadily lit LED indicated the shutter speed automatically <b>set</b> by <b>the</b> electronic microprocessor in response to the light reaching <b>the</b> built-in, open <b>aperture,</b> through-the-lens (TTL), centre-weighted gallium arsenide phosphide photodiode (GPD) light meter and <b>the</b> <b>set</b> lens <b>aperture.</b> <b>The</b> LEDs for the speeds between 1/2000th and 1/60th second were green, while those for 1/30th to 4 seconds were yellow to warn of possible picture blur at the slower speeds. A steadily lit red OVER or UNDER LED came on if the scene was out of the meter's exposure range.|$|R
5000|$|Standardized {{aperture}} control. AI-S lens apertures move in {{a standardized}} fashion {{in relation to their}} stop-down levers. The levers of AI and pre-AI lenses were intended only to close <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to its manual <b>setting.</b> <b>The</b> advance of <b>aperture</b> control by <b>the</b> camera body itself, by partial actuation of the stop-down lever, meant more precision was required for consistent exposure. This feature is indicated by a Lens Type Signal notch in the lens mount. Although later Nikon cameras cannot control <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> of AI-S lenses as the F4, they control <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> of AF lenses using the same method of partial lever actuation and standardized response.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose a {{photographer}} has a flash device with a guide number of 44 (m)&thinsp;/&thinsp;144 (ft), [...] <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> camera’s <b>aperture</b> to , {{and wants to}} know the required flash-to-subject distance; he merely divides the guide number by 4. Thus, a subject 11 meters or 36 feet away will be correctly illuminated (GN&thinsp;44 (m)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;11 m, and GN&thinsp;144 (ft)&thinsp;÷&thinsp;&thinsp;=&thinsp;36 ft). For the same guide number and an <b>aperture</b> of , <b>the</b> light source must be 5.5 meters or 18 feet from the subject.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the Fourier relationship between angular position and angular momentum {{for a light}} mode. In particular we measure the distribution of orbital angular momentum states of light that has passed through an aperture and verify that the orbital angular momentum distribution is given by the complex Fourier-transform of <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> function. We use spatial light modulators, configured as diffractive optical components, to define the initial orbital angular momentum state of <b>the</b> beam, <b>set</b> <b>the</b> defining <b>aperture,</b> and measure <b>the</b> angular momentum spread of the resulting beam. These measurements clearly confirm the Fourier relationship between angular momentum and angular position, even at light intensities corresponding to the single photon level.

5000|$|The F-501 {{can be set}} {{for auto}} exposure, [...] "hi-speed" [...] auto exposure, [...] "dual" [...] auto-exposure (with AI-S type lenses) which {{switches}} between regular auto exposure and hi-speed autoexposure based on <b>the</b> lens attached, <b>aperture</b> priority, or full manual exposure modes, which allow <b>the</b> user to <b>set</b> both <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> and shutter speeds. The shutter speed and auto-exposure modes are <b>set</b> by <b>the</b> use of a dial {{on the top of}} the camera, while <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> ring on <b>the</b> lens is used for <b>aperture</b> control. <b>The</b> [...] "hi-speed" [...] auto-exposure tends to favor higher shutter speeds and wider <b>aperture</b> settings than <b>the</b> [...] "normal" [...] auto exposure mode, while the [...] "dual" [...] mode offers [...] "normal" [...] auto-exposure with lenses at focal lengths less than 135 mm and [...] "hi-speed" [...] auto-exposure if a lens is longer than 135 mm.|$|R
5000|$|With Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super B, when in {{automatic}} mode, when {{changing the}} shutter speed, the camera automatically selects <b>the</b> right <b>aperture</b> according to <b>the</b> value {{indicated by the}} built in selenium meter needle.In the beginnings of exposure automation (ca. 1960) the instruments were even used for setting exposure settings directly, mainly for automatic aperture setting. A simple method for this was called [...] "trap-needle"; pressing the shutter release mechanically gripped the meter needle, then moved an aperture control up to hit <b>the</b> needle, <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to a value controlled by the meter.This kind of attempt to automate exposure setting was common in an era were precision mechanical engineers didn't know any limits of complication so that even further steps were gone to use selenium photo cells to control all exposure settings, or to control them more exactly with help of electro-mechanical aids. Heinz Waaske's SLR construction Edixa Electronica was such a costly attempt. The construction problem was the low electric power delivered by the photo cell. It was a precision mechanical wonder that a handful of cameras were made which had automatic exposure control driven by a selenium meter, without need of further electronic or electromechanical support, for example the Optima.|$|R
30|$|Fiber-optic nanoprobes {{have opened}} up new {{applications}} in molecular biology and medical diagnostics. Due to their small sizes, nanosensor provides important tools for minimal invasive analysis at single cellular or sub-cellular level. Because transmission efficiency is highly related to <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> size, control <b>the</b> nanoaperture size is essential in the fabrication of high-quality nanoprobes. Subtle changes in the tilt angle during metal evaporation can greatly affect the size or even the existence of <b>the</b> <b>aperture.</b> A much more rational fabrication process would involve a nanofabrication technique such as FIB, in which aperture size could be independently controlled from evaporation. The detection sensitivity of fiber-optic nanoprobes depends mainly on the extremely small excitation or detection volume <b>set</b> by <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> sizes and penetration depths. This effectively reduces background fluorescence, thereby enhance detection sensitivity. Nanofabrication would also greatly improve <b>the</b> reproducibility of <b>aperture</b> shapes and hence the optical performance of near-field probes.|$|R
50|$|Like {{objective}} lenses, condensers vary {{in their}} numerical aperture (NA). It is NA that determines optical resolution, {{in combination with the}} NA of the objective. Different condensers {{vary in their}} maximum and minimum numerical <b>aperture,</b> and <b>the</b> numerical <b>aperture</b> of a single condenser varies depending on <b>the</b> diameter <b>setting</b> of <b>the</b> condenser <b>aperture.</b> In order for <b>the</b> maximum numerical <b>aperture</b> (and therefore resolution) of an objective lens to be realized, <b>the</b> numerical <b>aperture</b> of <b>the</b> condenser must be matched to <b>the</b> numerical <b>aperture</b> of <b>the</b> used objective. The technique most commonly used in microscopy to optimize the light pathway between the condenser (and other illumination components of the microscope) and the objective lens is known as Köhler illumination.|$|R
50|$|By 1974, the {{autoexposure}} SLR brands had aligned {{into two}} camps (shutter-priority: Canon, Konica, Miranda, Petri, Ricoh and Topcon; aperture-priority: Asahi Pentax, Chinon, Cosina, Fujica, Minolta, Nikkormat and Yashica) supposedly {{based on the}} superiority of their chosen mode. (In reality, based on {{the limitations of the}} electronics of the time and the ease of adapting each brand's older mechanical designs to automation.) These AE SLRs were only semi-automatic. With shutter-priority control, <b>the</b> camera would <b>set</b> <b>the</b> lens <b>aperture</b> after <b>the</b> photographer chose a shutter speed to freeze or blur motion. With aperture-priority control, <b>the</b> camera would <b>set</b> <b>the</b> shutter speed after the photographer chose a lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus).|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} {{found on}} many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control {{referred to as}} [...] "dedicated electronic flash". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is inserted into the camera's hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera's synchronization speed is <b>set,</b> along with <b>the</b> <b>aperture.</b> Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the electronic flash. This is denoted TTL flash metering.|$|R
50|$|In July 2010 Canon {{released}} firmware 1.0.8 that fixes {{a phenomenon}} in which <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>aperture</b> moves unexpectedly when shooting movies in manual exposure mode using some Canon lenses (such as macro lenses). 25 December 2010 Canon offered firmware version 1.0.9 which should fix tone jumps in some images, {{depending on the}} shooting scene and when shooting with the Auto Lighting Optimizer settings (low/standard/strong).|$|R
