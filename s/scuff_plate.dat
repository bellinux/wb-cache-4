Two ICC-GDs were launched and permanently attached to the ISS as External Stowage Platforms, ESP-2 (launched on STS-114/LF1) and ESP-3 (launched on STS-118/13A.1). Both ICC-GDs were deployed with Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) assistance via the orbiter's and/or ISSs robotic arm (Canadarm and Canadarm2, respectively). The ESP-2 and ESP-3 provides electrical power to the ORUs while attached to the ISS via the ICC-GDs Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and power cable/PCAS (Passive Common Attach System) interface. The ICC-GD flew on the Shuttle missions STS-114/LF1 (ESP-2) and STS-118/13A.1 (ESP-3).|$|R

50|$|The ICC-VLD is a {{derivative}} of the not-flown ICC-V. Due to the modular pallet {{design of the}} ICC-V which is composed of one central core section and two identical outer sections that bolt to {{the upper and lower}} edges of the core section, the ICC-VLD is converted from the octagonal-shaped ICC-V design by removing the top section and converted from a non-deployable configuration to a deployable configuration by adding a grapple fixture and <b>scuff</b> <b>plates.</b> Ths ICC-VLD flew on STS-127/2JA and STS-132/ULF4. During both missions, the ICC-VLD was deployed from the orbiter's cargo bay and transferred to the ISS via the orbiter's robotic arm Canadarm and subsequent handover to the Space Station's robotic arm Canadarm2. While grappled to the Space Station's robotic arm, the ICC-VLD's cargo elements, called Orbital Replacement Units ORUs were transferred with Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) assistance to the respective locations on the ISS. The ICC-VLD provided heater power and electrical connections for the ORUs while inside the cargo bay or grappled by the robotic arm. Upon completion of ORU removal and replacement activities (R&R), the ICC-VLDs were both berthed back into the orbiter and returned to earth. The ICC-VLD flew on the Shuttle missions STS-127/2JA and STS-132/ULF4.|$|R

5000|$|With a {{finished}} weight of 36 lb, the block weighs 51 lb {{less than the}} cast-iron block in the Chevy II [...] inline-4. Plating the piston skirts was necessary to put a hard iron skirt surface opposite the silicon of the block to prevent <b>scuffing.</b> The <b>plating</b> was a four layer electo-plating process. The first plate was a flash of zinc followed by a very thin flash of copper. The third and primary coating was hard iron, 0.0007 in thick. The final layer was a flash of tin. The zinc and copper were necessary to adhere the iron while the tin prevented corrosion before assembly of the piston into the engine. Piston plating was done on a 46 operation automatic line. From Tonawanda, the engines went to the Chevrolet assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.|$|R
