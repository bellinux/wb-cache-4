This model design was built by German youngsters for an annual contest named [...] "Der Kleine Uhu" [...] (the small owl) that began around 1950. The contest was very popular, and the glue became a popular item with German hobbyists, so the name stuck.|$|R

For small-scale production, rubber <b>pad</b> <b>stamping</b> is {{the best choice for}} thin sheet metal parts, compared with traditional stamping methods. The drawback of stamping with elastic media is the relatively large amount of technological wastage, resulting from the need to withstand the forces involved and hold the technological bridges. By finding out the surface dependence of friction between the sheet material, base plate and elastic area, it is possible to precisely calculate the minimum size of the technological bridge. Further research is therefore required in order to enhance the efficiency of rubber <b>pad</b> <b>stamping</b> technology...|$|R

5000|$|A {{good example}} of where laser {{engraving}} technology has been adopted into the industry norm is the production line. In this particular setup, the laser beam is directed towards a rotating or vibrating mirror. The mirror moves in a manner which may trace out numbers and letters onto the surface being marked. This is particularly useful for printing dates, expiry codes, and lot numbering of products traveling along a production line. Laser marking allows materials made of plastic and glass to be marked [...] "on the move". The location where the marking takes place is called a [...] "marking laser station", an entity often found in packaging and bottling plants. Older, slower technologies such as hot <b>stamping</b> and <b>pad</b> printing have largely been phased out and replaced with laser engraving.|$|R

Since then, it has grown to over 1700 dues paying members (dues are $10 for the first year, and $5 per year after that), and over 9700 members of the free online site www.parkstamps.org. Paying dues gives members access to the Master List, Master Database, and Master Map of all known National Park Passport Stamp locations, in addition to voting in club elections. The online site features trip reports and hints for visits to parks, information on legislation impacting parks, and a message board for park related topics. The membership meets yearly at the NPTC Annual Convention and also arranges smaller group meetings at events such as park dedications or important park anniversaries. Additionally, awards are given out to members meeting visitation criteria, such as visiting certain numbers of park units within a year, or over a lifetime. The NPTC publishes a quarterly newsletter called The <b>Stamp</b> <b>Pad.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Close {{had been}} known for his {{skillful}} brushwork {{as a graduate student}} at Yale University. There, he emulated Willem de Kooning and seemed [...] "destined to become a third-generation abstract expressionist, although with a dash of Pop iconoclasm". After a period in which he experimented with figurative constructions, Close began a series of paintings derived from black-and-white photographs of a female nude, which he copied onto canvas and painted in color. As he explained in a 2009 interview with the Cleveland Ohio Plain Dealer, he made a choice in 1967 to make art hard for himself and force a personal artistic breakthrough by abandoning the paintbrush. [...] "I threw away my tools", Close said. [...] "I chose to do things I had no facility with. The choice not to do something is in a funny way more positive than the choice to do something. If you impose a limit to not do something you've done before, it will push you to where you've never gone before."

40|$|Background: Dermatoglyphics are {{considered}} as a window of congenital abnormalities and {{is known to be}} one of the best available diagnostic tools in genetic disorders. Objective: The present study was conducted to observe and compare the differences in the dermatoglyphic patterns between cleft lip/palate (CL/P) and normal healthy children and evaluate their associated dental findings. Setting: This is a cross-sectional prevalence study in which dermatoglyphic patterns and dental anomalies of 90 (CL/P) and normal healthy children aged 0 - 15 years were recorded under standard conditions of seating and lighting. Materials and Methods: Dermatoglyphic traits were recorded using ink <b>stamp</b> <b>pad</b> method. Dental findings were recorded through clinical and radiographic examination. Results: The most frequently seen dermatoglyphic trait in the study and control group was loops followed by whorls and arches. A highly significant (P < 0. 001) difference between loops in the study and control group and statistically significant difference in the whorls (P = 0. 001) were found using Studentâ€²s t-test. The comparison of dental anomalies was accomplished using Chi-square test and hypodontia (50 %) was seen maximum in cleft patients. Conclusion: Any deviation in dermatoglyphics features indicates a genetic etiology...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} fingerprints patterns from the mixed family of Chinese-Javanese ethnic. The fingerprint patterns divided into three main patterns, i. e. arch, loop and whorl. The respondents were determined based on inclusion criteria (subject of research qualified as a sample) and the exclusion criteria (subjects which could not be used as a sample) through interviews and questionnaires. First, respondent 2 Ì† 7 s fingers cleaned with alcohol or washed using soapy water. The patterns of fingerprint were taken by pressing one by one using an inked <b>stamp</b> <b>pad.</b> Then, printed on white paper which has been given a code and serial number of fingers for each respondent. The last step was to identify the specific characteristic of fingerprint patterns from the respondents and analyzed it while determining about similarity and variability of inter-generations. The results indicated that the mixed family of Chinese-Javanese ethnic had whorl variant pattern (plain whorl and double loop whorl) on the thumbs as a specific marker of Javanese ethnic. Otherwise, radial loop on the index and tented arch pattern on both index and little finger are the unique marker of Chinese ethnic. Thus, both Javanese and Chinese ethnic have co-dominant fingerprint patterns for mixed family of Chinese-Javanese ethnic...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim: Dermatoglyphics is {{supposed}} to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors and so also dental caries. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to find out a possible relation between some quantitative and qualitative dermatoglyphic variables and early childhood caries (ECC). Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 200 children in age group of 3 to 6 years from two private kindergarten, Egypt, and divided into 2 equal groups i. e. caries active group (n= 100) and caries free group (n= 100). The caries active group included children with dmft index = 4 or more and caries free group consist of normal, healthy children without any dental caries. The finger prints of both hands were taken using a <b>stamp</b> <b>pad</b> method then qualitative and quantitative data of dermatoglyphics were analyzed. Results: There was increase in frequency of whorls and decrease in frequency of loops in caries active group when compared to caries free group which was statistically significant (p = 0. 000). The total finger ridge counts of whorls was higher in caries active children while total finger ridge counts of loops and the atd angles were higher in caries free children. The differences were statistically significant (p = 0. 000). Conclusion: Early childhood caries susceptibility of an individual increased with increased frequency of whorl pattern but it decreased with increased frequency of loop pattern and increased atd angl...|$|E

40|$|Background: Dental caries is a multifactorial disease, and its {{etiology}} {{has been}} advocated to various environmental and genetic factors. Dermatoglyphics {{is the study}} of dermal ridges on the palmar and plantar surfaces of hands and feet. It is genetic in nature and is unique to each individual. Enamel as well as finger buds are ectodermal in origin and develop during the same time of intrauterine life; therefore, factors affecting dental caries may cause peculiarities in dermal ridge patterns. Aim: To find a correlation between dermatoglyphic pattern and dental caries in pediatric cases. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 200 children (100 caries-active and 100 caries-free) between the age range of 6 â€“ 13 years. The decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) score was recorded for caries-active children having a score range of 3 â€“ 6 and under each score there were 25 cases. Midlo and Cummins method (1943) of recording palm prints was used using Indiana Ink (<b>stamp</b> <b>pad),</b> roller and printing papers. The prints were inspected with the help of magnifying lens and whorls and loops in each hand were recorded. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software 14. 00, and Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis of collected data. Results: The number of whorls was found to be more in caries-active children with increased number of whorls in children with a higher DMFT whereas the number of loops was more in caries-free children. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (P < 0. 05). The number of whorls and loops was found to be more on the right hand as compared to the left hand. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that there is a definite correlation between the number of whorls and loops and the presence of dental caries in children. Hence, dermatoglyphics {{can be used as a}} screening method to provide adequate preventive treatment to children showing a higher caries risk as detected by the hand ridge patterns...|$|E
