Triple H agreed to it only if the charges were dropped, which Hornswoggle agreed to.

500|$|The {{second type}} of prey capture {{behavior}} is [...] "creeping", used by the ray for stationary or slow-moving prey; this includes stunned prey that may have drifted out of reach from a jumping attack. In creeping, the ray makes small up and down motions of its disc coupled with small beats of its tail. The raising of the disc draws water beneath it and pulls the prey towards the ray, while the lowering of the disc and the tail beats move the ray towards the prey in small increments. When it reaches the prey, the ray opens its mouth to <b>suck</b> <b>it</b> in. Short electric bursts are produced as necessary, depending on {{the movement of the}} prey, and continue through ingestion.|$|E
500|$|Their fourth album <b>Suck</b> <b>It</b> and See {{sees the}} band {{exploring}} styles, mixing them with newfound maturity. Turner said: [...] "I think {{the new album}} is a balance between our first three. There's nothing about taxi ranks or anything like that, but there's {{a bit of the}} standpoint I had on those early songs and the sense of humour, but also there's a bit of the 'Humbug' stuff which is kind of off in the corners." [...] Critics noted an influence from British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as The Smiths, and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound. Turner wrote much of the album in his apartment on an acoustic guitar, further influencing the ballad-style prevalent on the album.|$|E

2500|$|The NAACP of Portland withdrew {{its support}} of the protest, accusing the {{original}} organizers of failing to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color. The group's president said she was told that those issues, along with anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter messaging and signage, were [...] "too political". As {{a result of the}} affiliate's criticism, a small group of women from Eastern Oregon who served as the original organizers of the Portland event were replaced with new leaders to [...] " [...] a larger platform to women of color". After the NAACP chapter was made aware of the leadership changes, its president explained: [...] "I felt it was important that we not miss this teachable moment about what role of race and religion and class were playing in pulling this march together." [...] Furthermore, she told Willamette Week: [...] "Putting a black woman's face {{at the beginning of the}} march doesn't fundamentally change the reason we withdrew our support. It's always been the case that if somebody suffers a racist incident, you're just supposed to <b>suck</b> <b>it</b> up and then, for the sake of unity, let's all join hands and pretend it didn't happen. I'm just at a place where I don't think that's healthy or wise anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the sixth}} season, Raj {{remained}} silent when Penny was present. Penny occasionally taunted him about this, saying such things as [...] "Yo, Raj, talk to me". Raj sometimes whispered what he wanted to say to Howard or Leonard, who then repeated his words or responded to his question out loud. However, Howard sometimes used the situation to amuse himself—for example, when he [...] "confessed" [...] on Raj's behalf that Raj had stalked Penny with binoculars, or when Sheldon called Penny over to their table to silence Raj; Howard then refused to act as a mouthpiece and told Raj, [...] "No no no, he won; <b>Suck</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] In [...] "The Dumpling Paradox", Leonard jokingly suggests cutting Raj in half so the group can play video games without Howard while Penny is in the room: Raj turns to Leonard (facing away from Penny) and responds, [...] "Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from." [...] Later, in [...] "The Bat Jar Conjecture", Raj accidentally utters a few words ("good story"), much to the surprise of his friends, but he immediately realizes Penny is there and covers his mouth with both hands. A recurring gag was for Raj to find himself left alone when his friends, in the company of Penny or another woman, make plans to go somewhere and Raj's mutism prevents him from speaking up to join in.|$|E
