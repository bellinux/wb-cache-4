25|$|The {{tools are}} usually mounted in a {{dedicated}} bore finishing machine, however {{they can also}} be mounted in a milling machine. In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the tool is plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger tool is mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired bore size is dependent on the workpiece material, the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each tool is progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; as the <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> is reduced, so is the tool's diamond grit size.|$|E
500|$|Emerson's early folding knives {{were of the}} linerlock variety, {{ground by}} the <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> method, and {{utilized}} rare materials from the aerospace industry, including titanium, carbon fiber, micarta, and meteorite. [...] He incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time, including mother-of-pearl, abalone shell, paua shell, staghorn, and rare hardwoods. Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species, noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker. The steel used in these blades was typically graded ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C, and the blades were either highly polished or hand-rubbed. Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades. Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the [...] "Pre-Tac" [...] (Pre-Tactical) models. They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades. The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms. Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.|$|E
40|$|Within this work, {{we focus}} on the {{optimization}} of storage location assignments arising in warehouses with storage locations applying a last-in, first-out throughput policy. The sequence of goods to be stored is, however, not entirely known such that for each item the currently best storage location has to be identified almost immediately. Caused by this imperfect data and by <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> concurrently performed it is necessary to apply relocation operations from time to time, which might range from a few operations to relocations lasting a working day depending on the workload of the warehousemen. For this purpose we propose an ad hoc stocking strategy as well as a storage relocation strategy based on variable neighborhood descent. Supported by experimental tests we compare variants of our approaches {{with each other and with}} formerly used stocking strategies showing that the number of conflicts could be significantly reduced by the proposed approach. Furthermore, an application of the relocation strategy can significantly improve warehouse states obtained due to imperfect stocking strategies, concurrently performed <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> and insufficient information on production sequences...|$|R

First of all, a unified surface model is proposed for a component with both angular and square-shoulder-featured surfaces. Then, a two-dimensional tolerance chart is constructed and parameterized for the machining of the component. Also, two general formulae are derived {{to calculate the}} surface changes due to machining cuts. The recording of the surface changes during all machining cuts means that the reverse dimensional chains and the "solid" <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> can be identified automatically.

30|$|Primitive {{studies on}} process {{tolerancing}} were introduced through graphical representation of machining tolerance charting (Irani et al. 1989). The graphical approach and rooted tree diagram were adopted for tolerance charting (Whybrew et al. 1990). A tree theoretical representation for a tolerance chart was presented from the part blue print dimensions, <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> and working dimensions (Ji 1993). The manufacturing process sequence {{was determined by}} using a profile representation method which incorporates a two-dimensional matrix containing a number coding system to represent the part profile (Ngoi and Ong 1993). A mathematical rooted tree model incorporating the linkage between the capability of manufacturing process and tolerance chart balancing was developed (Wei and Lee 1995). Geometrical control requirements were expressed as equivalent linear dimensions and then applied to a tolerance chart (Ngoi and Tan 1995). A backward derivation approach was traced for determining the machining tolerances starting from the last operation and computing machining allowances backwardly till the first machining operation (Ji 1996). A graphical method for presenting the process link and for obtaining the necessary working dimensions and tolerances was introduced (Ngoi and Tan 1997).|$|R
40|$|A {{tolerance}} chart is {{an effective}} tool {{used to determine the}} working dimensions and tolerances in process planning. Its kernel are the tolerance chains among the machining cuts through which the component will be manufactured. Identifying tolerance chains is a painstaking job. In this paper, a coordinate system is set up for the component in question so that all surfaces of the component are expressed with their coordinates and the tolerance chart is parameterised. Then an object-oriented model is developed so that each blueprint dimension is represented as a blueprint object while each working dimension is expressed as a machining-cut object. Each object has a special attribute, the surface chain, which is made up of all surfaces involved in the tolerance chart. The surface-chain model is very helpful in identifying the tolerance chains. By establishing the linear equations of the working dimensions, the <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> and the blueprint dimensions, the tolerance chains among the machining cuts are derived automatically. The working dimensions and tolerances then can be determined easily once the tolerance chains are identified. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{prices for}} energy, {{resources}} such as material-either externally purchased or internally manufactured-or labor inevitably result in the need {{to increase the efficiency}} of manufacturing processes. Furthermore, society requests documentation about companies' approaches for offering "green" and sustainable products. Therefore, the need for insight knowledge regarding the most influential processes, energy consumption (electrical energy, process heat and cooling, gas etc.) as well as material flow grows. Due to digitalization, the use of systems for production planning and control as well as the implementation of advanced sensors increase. Thus, the amount of shop floor data (e. g. power per operation, energy consumption, work orders, storages, <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> etc.) grows heavily and complicates the use for gaining efficiency in the resources' use or the overall gain in productivity. Currently, lots of such data are not even used at all anymore although containing i mportant information about the processes' performance. Thus, this paper addresses the integration of shop floor data throughout all electronic systems (enterprise resource planning, manufacturing execution system, data logging by sensors) in a software landscape and describes how to connect related datasets automatically in underlying databases. This connection allows the choice of key performance indicators for individually adjustable scopes such as processes, facility, overall company and the differentiation between products for a certain time period. The results offer live information about energy and resource consumptions for monitoring purposes, the identification of potentials for improvement as well as an easy sustainabiliy reporting. For sustainability reasons, the calculated results can be used within life-cycle assessment software for the evaluation of the manufacturing's impact onto the environment...|$|R
30|$|Among the {{unsustainable}} {{land use}} practices farmers that fuel soil degradation include low and unbalanced fertilizer application leading to mining of soil nutrient <b>stocks,</b> complete <b>removal</b> of crop residues, and dung burning as household energy rather than recycling to augment soil fertility and intensive tilling to create smooth seed bed for small cereals that predisposes {{the soil to}} erosion (Elias 2002; Hailu et al. 2015). In addition, research reports suggest that continued application of nitrogen and phosphorus alone would accentuate the uptake and deficiency of other nutrients that are not supplied in the fertilizer. Application of N and P fertilizer alone would particularly increase the uptake of micronutrients (e.g., Zn, Bo, Mn) and eventually depletes them unless included in the fertilizer scheme (FAO 2006 b; Elias 2016).|$|R

From 1994 to 1996 and in 1998, young-of-the-year (YOY) pike Esox lucius were stocked in different numbers in the course of a biomanipulation project in Lake Feldberger Haussee. Since 1997, population development, growth and food composition of pike have been studied. The fish stocked in 1995 were dominant within the population. Pike showed rapid growth, indicating a high food consumption. The predation pressure was mainly directed towards roach Rutilus rutilus and small perch Perca fluviatilis, the main planktivores. Natural recruitment was, however, low and the pike catches have drastically declined since 1996.

40|$|Understanding the rigorously {{demanding}} habitat {{requirements of}} salmonids {{is directly related}} to the needs of both conservation and management of freshwaters. In this thesis, I used large-scale temporal and spatial data to evaluate which key predictors determine the distribution of self-sustaining lake-living salmonids. Surveys were conducted among more than a thousand lakes in northern Sweden. Multivariate analysis tools were used to model effects of native species, exotics, chemical and physical factors that may govern establishment and extinctions. Historical sources such as archaic lake names, fishers’ knowledge and documentary evidence combined with more recent limnological surveys provided estimates and validations of pre-industrial baseline distributions and extinction rates. Among native brown trout (Salmo trutta), the extinction rate increased from an insignificant level at pre-industrial times, up to exceeding 3 % lost populations per decade between 1920 - 2000. Using these data sources, I could also link extinctions to specific detrimental human impact. Long-term impact from introduction of the exotic brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) was linked to a 10 -fold increase of native brown trout extinctions. Variables from Geographic information system (GIS) data were the best predictors of landscape-scale distributions of the keystone piscivore northern pike (Esox lucius), which in turn largely governed salmonid incidence among lakes. Landscape-scale patterns and retrospective whole-lake interventions involving <b>stocking,</b> <b>removal</b> and (re) colonization of pike and salmonids, clearly demonstrated that pike prevented self-sustaining populations of salmonids in these lakes. Set in the context of hierarchical filters, this approach provides a novel, highly predictable explanation to why these northern boreal lakes hold the specific fish communities they do. That is, keystone-specific connectivity is the fundamental determinant that either generates salmonid (low connectivity) or non-salmonid (high connectivity) assemblages and thus dictates fish species community compositions among these lakes. In contrast, water-quality (lakes ranging from highly acid-neutral, clear-murky and ultraoligotrophy-eutrophy) and lake morphometry (ranging from shallow small ponds to larger 53 m deep lakes) did not relate well to either salmonid or non-salmonid waters. In conclusion, I recommend that natural connectivity, e. g. SVimax = maximum stream slope measured in fixed vertical intervals, in drainage networks should be considered as standard characterization of lakes...|$|R

We examined gillnet disentanglement in exploited populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to characterize the length distribution of fish that disentangle from gillnets and determine whether nonretention mortality reinforces harvest selection and exerts common pressures according to sex and age. We also evaluated discrete spawning populations to determine whether nonretention affects populations with different morphologies in distinct ways. In aggregate, nonretention mortality in fish that disentangle from gillnets counters harvest selection but with different effects by sex and age.

Our analyses suggest nonretention mortality exerts significant selective pressures and should be explicitly included in analyses of fishery-induced selection...|$|R
