50|$|<b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> (SMR) may be {{an analog}} or digital trunked two-way radio system, {{operated}} by a service in the VHF, 220, UHF, 700, 800 or 900 MHz bands. Some systems with advanced features {{are referred to as}} an Enhanced <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> (ESMR). <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> is a term defined in US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. The term is of US regulatory origin but may be used in other regions to describe similar commercial systems which offer a radio communications service to businesses.|$|E
50|$|Two-way {{radio is}} {{primarily}} a dispatch tool intended to communicate in simplex or half-duplex modes using push-to-talk, and primarily intended to communicate with other radios rather than telephones. These systems run on push-to-talk-based infrastructure such as Nextel's iDEN, <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> (SMR), MPT-1327, Enhanced <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> (ESMR) or conventional two-way systems. Certain modern two-way radio systems may have full-duplex telephone capability.|$|E

40|$|Market {{research}} revealed {{several key}} demands for an Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) Global Positioning System (GPS) radio. The demands were for minimization of urban building blockage, easy programmability to minimize mobile data transmission costs, high accuracy for street map level coordination, interface capability with non-digital <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radios</b> (SMR), and a selling price {{close to that}} of alternatives such as Signposts and Loran-C. A team of experts was assembled to surmount these challenges and deliver a GPS radio for $ 500 to $ 1000, which operates at high accuracy in an urban environment and is plug-compatible with nearly all vehicle radios. Among the engineering and production breakthroughs described here are a unique Simultrac (Trademark) approach to satellite tracking, enabling up to eight GPS satellites {{to be used for}} position determination with a 2 -channel receiver, and a receiver-in-a-microphone design. A powerful Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) allowed GPS to be brought within easy reach of millions of AVL users such as bus, taxi, and delivery vehicle fleets...|$|R

Some <b>mobile</b> <b>radios</b> have alphanumeric displays that translate channel numbers (F1, F2) to a phrase more meaningful to the user, such as [...] "Providence Base", [...] "Boston Base", etc. Radios are now designed with a myriad of features to preclude the need for custom design.|$|R
50|$|Clearnet Communications Inc. was {{launched}} by The Lenbrook Group {{in the early}} 1980s as a national provider of <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> (SMR), two-way radio systems commonly used by taxicab and package delivery services. In 1994, Clearnet acquired the assets of Motorola's SMR network giving Clearnet the critical mass of radio spectrum to accomplish a conversion to a digital system. At the same time, Clearnet, with new strategic partners in Motorola and Nextel, completed {{an initial public offering}} to pay for this conversion.|$|E
50|$|The 2003 TCPA Order (18 FCC Rcd at 14115, para. 165) says: “Both {{the statute}} and our rules {{prohibit}} these calls, with limited exceptions, ‘to any telephone number {{assigned to a}} paging service, cellular telephone service, <b>specialized</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> service, or other common carrier service, or any service for which the called party is charged.’ This encompasses both voice calls and text calls to wireless numbers including, for example, short message service (SMS) calls, provided the call is made to a telephone number assigned to such service.” (citations omitted).|$|E
50|$|Nextel {{affected}} the cellular phone market in several ways. It {{was the first}} company to successfully provide unlimited calling plans to a large customer base. Nextel was the first company to implement a nationwide push-to-talk system similar to a walkie-talkie, marketed as DirectConnect. Unlike other cellular networks, the Nextel network operated in the <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> band, and Nextel {{was one of the}} first providers in the United States to offer a national digital cellular coverage footprint. The company was the first in the United States to integrate global positioning system features into their phones and to complete their 2G network upgrade.|$|E
40|$|A {{satellite}} {{land mobile system}} using <b>mobile</b> <b>radios</b> in the UHF band, and Ku-band Communications Routing Terminals (earth stations) for {{a nationwide}} connection from any mobile location to any fixed or mobile location, and from any fixed location to any mobile location is proposed. The proposed nationwide satellite land mobile service provides: telephone network quality (1 out of 100 blockage) service, complete privacy for all the users, operation similar to the telephone network, alternatives for data services up to 32 Kbps data rates, and a cost effective and practical <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> compatible with system sizes ranging from 10, 000 to 1, 000, 000 users. Seven satellite alternatives (ranging from 30 ft diameter dual beam antenna to 210 ft diameter 77 beam antenna) along with <b>mobile</b> <b>radios</b> having a sensitivity figure of merit (G/T) of - 15 dB/deg K are considered.

5000|$|Nextel Communications traces {{its roots}} to the 1987 {{foundation}} of FleetCall by Morgan O'Brien, Brian McAuley, Chris Rogers, and Peter Reinheimer. FleetCall {{changed its name}} to Nextel Communications, Inc. in 1993. Nextel provided digital, wireless communications services, originally focusing on fleet and dispatch customers, but later marketed to all potential wireless customers. Nextel's network operated in the 800 MHz <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> band and used iDEN technology developed by Motorola. Nextel's iDen network offered a then unique push-to-talk [...] "walkie-talkie" [...] feature in addition to direct dialed voice calls. Nextel {{was one of the first}} providers in the United States to offer a national digital cellular coverage footprint.|$|E
50|$|Some {{companies}} don't operate {{their own}} radio system and instead subscribe to an <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> system. The conventional radios are most suited {{to companies that}} operate within the local area and have a high volume of radio traffic. The SMR is more commonly used by black car services that cover a wider area, and smaller companies who use less airtime and don't want to run their own radio systems. With the advent of public data networks in the 1990s, operators are beginning to use PDAs and advanced mobile phones for dispatching and tracking functions {{in lieu of the}} traditional radio. Some small car services don't use a dispatcher at all. Instead the customers' calls are forwarded to the cell phones of whichever drivers are on duty at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The founders {{choose the}} name [...] "FleetCall" [...] because the company's network used the 800 MHz <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> {{frequencies}} {{designated by the}} Federal Communications Commission for use in fleet dispatch. The core of the business model was to buy these fleet dispatch frequencies from existing operators at a substantial discount {{when compared to the}} cost for equivalent bandwidth available via auction from the Federal Communications Commission. These [...] "non-cellular" [...] frequencies were made usable for a consumer and business wireless voice telephone service with the iDEN technology developed by Motorola, which some observers at the time said would not be practical. Initially, FleetCall did not want to include the push to talk feature in their phones, but the FCC required it as the initial frequencies were licensed for dispatch use. Later, Nextel would use the push-to-talk feature as a key marketing advantage.|$|E

40|$|When a firm acquires rival {{firms in}} one market, and moves their {{capacity}} to another market, should antitrust authorities be concerned? We address this question by studying a multi-stage game. A dominant firm {{has the opportunity to}} acquire fringe firms that operate in the same market. Then, the dominant firm has the opportunity to move capacity from that market to a second market. The model is motivated by a series of acquisitions in the <b>Specialized</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> industry aimed at establishing a new cellular carrier. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the dominant firm to acquire too little capacity relative to the social optimum. The results shed light on the Consent Decree negotiated in US v.
