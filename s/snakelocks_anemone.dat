50|$|Kaliseptine {{was first}} {{isolated}} from the <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> Anemonia viridis, previously known as Anemonia sulcata. The <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> releases its venom via both nematocysts and ectodermal glands. Kaliseptine is a type I anemone toxin. Although typically the type I toxins are located in both organelles, the location for kaliseptine {{has not yet been}} reported.|$|E
50|$|Cribrinopsis fernaldi, {{also known}} as the crimson <b>anemone,</b> <b>snakelock</b> <b>anemone,</b> chevron-tentacle anemone and Fernald {{brooding}} anemone (not to be confused with Epiactis fernaldi, another sympatric species known as Fernald brooding anemone), is a sea anemone native to the Pacific Ocean off northwestern North America.|$|R
50|$|The tentacles of anemones in deep or murky {{water can}} be a grey colour, but are {{otherwise}} usually a deep green colour with purple tips due {{to the presence of}} symbiotic algae within the tentacles that use sunlight as an energy source. As a result, the anemones prefer brightly lit shallow waters. On average the <b>snakelock</b> <b>anemone</b> is 8 cm wide.|$|R
50|$|BDS-1 is a toxin {{secreted}} by the nematocyst of Anemonia sulcata (Mediterranean <b>snakelocks</b> sea <b>anemone).</b>|$|R
50|$|Limited {{in vitro}} studies were {{performed}} on the toxic effects of isolated kaliseptine. The combined venom of the <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> {{is known to be}} toxic when applied directly onto mammalian hearts. The venom then causes an increase of the action potential duration. When the nematocysts of the <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> come into contact with human skin, the venom can cause redness, swelling and pain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> (Anemonia viridis) is a {{sea anemone}} {{found in the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no known}} {{treatment}} for intoxication with kaliseptine. The suggested {{treatment for the}} venom of <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> consists of symptomatic treatment and prevention of further nematocyst discharge.|$|E
40|$|The spider crab Inachus phalangium {{is common}} in the sublitoral fringe of the Mediterranean Sea and {{north-eastern}} Atlantic Ocean, {{where it can be}} found in association with the <b>snakelocks</b> sea <b>anemone</b> Anemonia viridis. Studies concerning its activity patterns {{and the role of the}} host sea anemone are lacking. Our study aimed at investigating activity rhythms and resources utilization of I. phalangium reared in captivity. The main behavioral traits exhibited by I. phalangium are performed mostly at night. Two experiments were designed, one examined the time budget of various behavioral acts and the degree of association with the sea anemone, the other analyzed the behavioral response to algae and anemones. We showed that algae have a crucial role in the biology of I. phalangium and that crabs are ready to leave the protection of their host to obtain them. Algae represent both the major component of the diet and one of the most utilized sources of masking material of I. phalangium, which provide, together with specialized cryptic behaviors, protection against predators. Although our data suggest that the association with A. viridis is not obligatory, but the role of the <b>snakelocks</b> sea <b>anemone</b> in the life of I. phalangium is still central, both as an anti-predatory defense and as a nutritional source. The association of I. phalangium with algae and the anemone is a facultative biotrophic commensalistic symbiosis. © 2006 Springer-Verlag. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|Kaliseptine (AsKS) is a neurotoxin {{which can}} be found in the [...] <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> Anemonia viridis. It belongs to a class of sea anemone {{neurotoxins}} that inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels.|$|E
50|$|Inachus phalangium lives commensally {{with the}} sea anemone Anemonia sulcata (<b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone).</b> The crab gains {{protection}} from potential predators by sheltering beneath the anemone's stinging tentacles. The crab eats particles of food dropped by the sea anemone, and mucus {{from the surface of}} the anemone.|$|E
50|$|The Actiniidae is {{the largest}} family of sea anemones, to which most common, temperate, shore species belong. Most members of this family do not {{participate}} in symbioses with fishes. Three exceptions are the bubble-tip anemone (with anemonefish and certain cardinalfish), <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> (with Bucchich's goby) and Urticina piscivora (with painted greenling).|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} small animals {{regularly}} {{live in a}} symbiotic or commensal relationship with the <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone,</b> gaining protection from predators by residing among the venomous tentacles. These include the Incognitus (or anemone) goby, formerly known as Gobius buchichi (Gobius incognitus), the shrimp Periclimenes aegylios and the Leach's spider crab (Inachus phalangium).|$|E
5000|$|Blood-depressing substance-1 (BDS-1), {{also known}} as kappa-actitoxin-Avd4a, is a {{polypeptide}} found in the venom of the [...] <b>Snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> Anemonia sulcata. BDS-1 is a neurotoxin that modulates voltage-dependent potassium channels, in particular Kv3-family channels, as well as certain sodium channels. This polypeptide belongs to the sea anemone type 3 toxin peptide family.|$|E

Up to 25 mm citation needed [...] They live in symbiosis with sea anemones such <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> (Anemonia sulcata), Aiptasia mutabilis, Cribrinopsis crass and Condylactis aurantiaca, feeding on the detritus.|$|E
5000|$|In Great Bernera, {{sea life}} is {{especially}} rich {{where there is}} tidal run between the Caolas Bhalasaigh (English: [...] "Valasay Straits/Kyles") and the inner sea-loch of Tòb Bhalasaigh. There are numerous molluscs, sponges, brittlestars and starfish, the latter growing noticeably larger in size than normal. Cup coral, <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> and dead man's fingers coral, may also be found here. Common fish include shanny and butterfish and Atlantic and common seals are regular off-shore visitors.|$|E
50|$|The rocky {{coastline}} at Saltern Cove supports diverse {{communities of}} intertidal plants and animals. Along the lower shore the coarse grained rocks are partly covered by brown seaweeds such as Flat wrack (Fucus spiralis) and Knotted wrack Ascophyllum nodosum, while pools and crevices {{in the rocks}} provide shelter {{for a wide variety}} of algal species, such as the red seaweed Corallina officinalis. Animals include the <b>Snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> Anemonia viridis, the Spotted goby Gobius ruthensparri, Periwinkles Littorina spp. and the Squat lobster Galathea strigosa.|$|E
50|$|Kaliseptine {{has been}} shown to reduce ion current through the KV1.2 K+ channel during depolarization. Since it has {{affinity}} for the DTXI receptor domain, kaliseptine may act on the channel in a similar manner as the agonist DTXI. Whether kaliseptine exerts its action by hindering conformational changes of the KV1.2 channel, is not certain. Evidence was provided that DTXI binds in close proximity to the external mouth of the channel, leading to occlusion of the pore. It is not certain whether this partial occlusion fully explains the inhibiting effect. The exact mechanism by which Kaliseptine alters KV1.2 function is still debated. Kaliseptine is thought to act in conjunction with other neurotoxins present in the <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> venom, altogether prolonging the action potential.|$|E
5000|$|... “Kali” {{is derived}} from the Latin word kalium, which means potassium. The suffix “septine” {{is derived from}} the Greek word “sepsis” σῆψις, which means “decay” or “putrefaction”. This suffix was added to {{distinguish}} it from the related toxin kalicludine.Kaliseptine was first isolated from the <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone,</b> which at the time was called Anemonia sulcata. Kaliseptine is abbreviated as AsKS, which stands for Anemonia sulcata KaliSeptine.The rational nomenclature of kaliseptine is kappa-actitoxin-Avd6a. The first letter Kappa indicates its molecular target, namely a voltage-gated potassium channel. Actitoxin is a neurotoxin derived from the Actiniidae. Avd denotes that it is extracted from Anemonia viridis. Finally, 6a specifies that this was the sixth Acititoxin of which the full-length amino acid sequence was published and {{that this is the first}} isoform.|$|E
40|$|Gene family {{encoding}} small Heat-Shock Proteins (sHSPs containing α-crystallin domain) {{are found}} both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms; however, {{there is limited}} knowledge of their evolution. In this study, two small HSP genes termed AvHSP 28. 6 and AvHSP 27, both organized in one intron and two exons, were characterised in the Mediterranean <b>snakelocks</b> <b>anemone</b> Anemonia viridis. The release of the genome sequence of Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis enabled a comprehensive study of the molecular evolution of α-crystallin gene family among cnidarians. Most of the H. magnipapillata sHSP genes share the same gene organization described for AvHSP 28. 6 and AvHSP 27, differing from the sHSP genes of N. vectensis which mainly show an intronless architecture. The different genomic organization of sHSPs, the phylogenetic analyses based on protein sequences, and the relationships among Cnidarians, suggest that the A. viridis sHSPs represent the common ancestor from which H. magnipapillata genes directly evolved through segmental genome duplication. Additionally retroposition events may be considered responsible for the divergence of sHSP genes of N. vectensis from A. viridis. Analyses of transcriptional expression profile showed that AvHSP 28. 6 was constitutively expressed among different tissues from both ectodermal and endodermal layers of the adult sea anemones, under normal physiological conditions and also under different stress condition. Specifically, we profiled the transcriptional activation of AvHSP 28. 6 after challenges with different abiotic/biotic stresses showing induction by extreme temperatures, heavy metals exposure and immune stimulation. Conversely, no AvHSP 27 transcript was detected in such dissected tissues, in adult whole body cDNA library or under stress conditions. Hence, the involvement of AvHSP 28. 6 gene in the sea anemone defensome is strongly suggested...|$|E
