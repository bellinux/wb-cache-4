5|$|The {{function}} of the Federal <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts. The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six-year terms.|$|E
5|$|In United States federal courts, {{a circuit}} split occurs when {{two or more}} {{different}} circuit courts of appeals provide conflicting rulings on the same legal issue. The existence of a circuit split {{is one of the}} factors that the Supreme Court of the United States considers when deciding whether to grant review of a case. Some scholars suggest that the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> more likely to grant review of a case to resolve a circuit split than for any other reason.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court (OSC) is {{the highest}} state court in the U.S. state of Oregon. The only court that may reverse or modify a {{decision}} of the Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> the Supreme Court of the United States. The OSC holds court at the Oregon Supreme Court Building in Salem, Oregon, near the capitol building on State Street. The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state's law library, while the courtroom is also used by the Oregon Court of Appeals.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the Brisbane <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{served as}} the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> for all of Queensland. As the colony’s {{population}} grew, two other <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> constructed. The first sittings of the Northern <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>were</b> held at Bowen in 1874 and the Bowen <b>Court</b> House <b>was</b> built in 1880 in classical revival style. The Central <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> officially opened at Rockhampton in 1896. After {{the opening of the}} Central <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> at Rockhampton, the Northern <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> moved from Bowen to Townsville. Justice Virgil Power, who {{served as the}} first Judge of the Central <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> <b>was</b> the first Queensland-born <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> Judge. As the population of Queensland has grown, additional <b>courts</b> have <b>been</b> built at locations such as Bundaberg, Mackay, Cairns, Longreach, Maryborough, Roma and Townsville.|$|R

5|$|The {{court system}} {{is headed by}} the Senior Courts of England and Wales, {{consisting}} of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice for civil cases, and the Crown Court for criminal cases. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in England and Wales. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the judicial functions of the House of Lords. A decision of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} French civil law and Chadian {{customary}} law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Council, have become fully operational since 2000. The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of a}} chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.|$|E
5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} written opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> more likely to disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, {{the constitutionality of the}} Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E
50|$|Judges {{are members}} of the Judicial Service of the Republic.

5|$|Primarily {{an appeals}} court, the Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> also {{the court of}} last resort in Oregon. Although most oral {{arguments}} before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools. All cases are heard en banc by the court. It receives appeals from the Oregon Tax Court, the Oregon Court of Appeals, and some select cases such as death penalty appeals. Decisions of the court are published in the Oregon Reporter published by the Oregon Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was formed {{out of the old}} Oregon Country region, followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form of}} a Fundamental Right itself, for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights, and the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a Fundamental Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> supervises the {{functioning}} of the still largely ineffective and overburdened judicial system. As part of the 1995 constitutional reforms, the independence of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> strengthened by increasing the number of magistrates from 9 to 12. In 2000, the number of <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> Justices <b>was</b> increased to 16. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> justices <b>are</b> nominated by the political parties and elected to 5-year terms by the National Assembly.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, {{under the}} new constitution, the {{judicial}} power of Seychelles is vested in the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> a Court of Appeal, and such subordinate courts or tribunals that may be established by legislature. The Attorney-General and the judges of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>are</b> appointed by the President {{from a list of}} candidates prepared by the Constitutional Appointments Authority. The head of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> who <b>is</b> also the head of the Judiciary, is entitled the Chief Justice.

25|$|Today, {{decisions}} of the Puerto Rico <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>are</b> as final as those of any state <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> and <b>are</b> reviewable by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of the United States only pursuant to a writ of certiorari, when an important question of federal law is involved.|$|R
5|$|The {{court can}} appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve {{temporarily}} as judges {{at any level}} in Oregon. They can also appoint senior judges to serve on any state court at or below {{the highest level of}} court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation. The state <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> <b>is</b> responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon, disciplining attorneys, and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also {{in the hands of the}} Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur. The Supreme Court can then suspend judges, censure them, remove them from office, or take no action.|$|E
5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
