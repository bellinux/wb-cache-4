Originally, the wall was framed with two side towers, and {{had a series of}} <b>sculptures.</b> The few of them that survived clearly show a French influence, particularly traceable to the cathedral in Reims. It is unknown how many rows of <b>sculptures</b> there originally were - only the bottom row survived the fires and decay of the late Middle Ages; the five remaining <b>sculptures</b> are in poor condition. These <b>sculptures</b> are now in the museum in Erkebispegården i Trondheim (Archbishop's Palace in Trondheim). Work on the <b>sculptures</b> started in 1929.

5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures {{that keep the}} <b>sculpture</b> standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished <b>sculpture</b> has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the <b>sculpture</b> as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the <b>sculpture</b> move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E
