5|$|Villa Park has 42,682 seats {{split between}} four stands. These four stands are the Holte End to the south, the Trinity Road Stand to the west, the Doug Ellis Stand {{opposite}} the Trinity Road Stand, and the North <b>Stand</b> <b>behind</b> the northern goal. All of the stands have two tiers except the Trinity Road Stand, which has three.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
5|$|You {{have more}} to do than simply abstain from riotous proceedings. You must not <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property. You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E

5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the catcher, to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E
5|$|The god Vishnu and his consorts Lakshmi and Bhudevi {{should be}} {{represented}} as taking {{the place of}} Parvati's parents in the ceremony. The four-armed Vishnu should be shown in the background in between Shiva and Parvati; {{in one of his}} front hands is a golden pot from which he pours water over the hands of the couple, symbolizing giving away the bride to the groom. He holds his usual attributes, the sudarshana chakra (discus) and a shankha (conch), in his back arms. Vishnu's wives, dressed in royal finery, <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> Parvati and hold her waist, symbolizing the handing over.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

5|$|At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away {{supporters}} are {{situated in the}} North <b>Stand</b> <b>behind</b> the goal. Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North Stand is closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand. The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston Stand is the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard. The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a doping control room and a treatment room for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans. The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively. The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for partially sighted fans. The seats are a mixture of both resident teams' main colours — cherry red and blue. The stadium is fully compliant with safety guidelines for a sports ground.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly {{increased}} government purchases of silver. The government pledged to <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold. Pursuant to this promise, government gold reserves dwindled {{over the following}} three years. Although the economic Panic of 1893 {{had a number of}} causes, President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman's act to be a major factor, and called a special session of Congress to repeal it. Congress did so, but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions. Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold, with little effect but to increase the public debt, as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency. Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation. The bankers' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency—the gold standard was deflationary, and as creditors, they preferred to be paid in such a currency, whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency.|$|E

25|$|The ground {{has seen}} many {{improvements}} {{over the years}} with the <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the far goal being rebuilt in 1994, {{now known as the}} Taffy Jones/Sid Myall stand. The original was a wooden structure and was destroyed by a fire in 1969. The stand was rebuilt but lost its roof in the 1987 hurricane.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{accountability}} to MEPs or national parliamentarians has also cast {{doubt as to}} whether national leaders will in practice <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> the President on major issues.

McNulty takes Bodie to Cylburn Arboretum. Bodie tells him {{that he is not}} an informant but admits his frustration with his life as a drug dealer and Marlo's leadership. He states that Marlo expects his people to <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> him, yet he himself does not <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> people who work for him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that he feels like a pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he will not give any information on any former Barksdale associate. McNulty, out of genuine respect, tells Bodie that he is a soldier.|$|E

25|$|In 1666, Aurangzeb invited Shivaji to Agra, {{along with}} his nine-year-old son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb's plan was to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to {{consolidate}} the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier. However, in the court, on 12 May 1666, Aurangzeb made Shivaji <b>stand</b> <b>behind</b> mansabdārs (military commanders) of his court. Shivaji took offence and stormed out of court, and was promptly placed under house arrest under the watch of Faulad Khan, Kotwal of Agra.|$|E
