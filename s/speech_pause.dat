Simulation results and measurements show that <b>speech</b> <b>pause</b> detection improves the overall system performance considerably. 1 Introduction For acoustic speaker localization, we use a number of spatially distributed microphone sensors to capture incoming sound waves. If the amplitude gradient across the microphone array is negligible, the time delays between dierent microphone signals can be expressed in terms of the unknown source location parameters. Speaker localization is related to the classical sonar target detection problem already described in [1, 2]. However, these early references are not directly applicable to [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} works {{proved the}} existence of a synchronization between speech and holds in adults and in 9 year old children with a rich linguistic vocabulary and advanced language skills. When and how does this synchrony develop during child language acquisition? Could it be observed also in children younger than 9 ? The present work aims to answer the above questions reporting on the analysis of narrations produced by three different age groups of Italian children (9, 5 and 3 year olds). Measurements are provided on the amount of synchronization between <b>speech</b> <b>pauses</b> and holds in the three different groups, {{as a function of the}} duration of the narrations. The results show that, as far as the reported data concerns, in children, as in adults, holds and <b>speech</b> <b>pauses</b> are to a certain extent synchronized and play similar functions, suggesting that they may be considered as a multi-determined phenomenon exploited by the speaker under the guidance of a unified planning process to satisfy a communicative intention. In addition, considering the role that <b>speech</b> <b>pauses</b> play in communication, we speculate on the possibility that holds may serve to similar purposes supporting the hypothesis that gestures as speech are an expressive resource that can take on different functions depending on the communicative demand. While <b>speech</b> <b>pauses</b> are likely to play the role of signalling mental activation processes aimed at replacing the “old spoken content” of the communicative plan with a new one, holds may signal mental activation processes aimed at replacing the “old visible bodily action” with new ones reflecting the representational and/or propositional contribution of gestures to the new communicative plan...|$|R

The system presented in the paper users a mircophone array to overcome these problems. The speech signal is enhanced realizing a specific charateristic of the array and setting a zero {{in the direction of the}} speaker to estimate the noise.

40|$|Speech has a {{property}} that the speech unit preceding a <b>speech</b> <b>pause</b> tends to lengthen. This work presents {{the use of}} a dynamic Bayesian network to model the prepausal lengthening effect for robust speech recognition. Specifically, we introduce two distributions to model inter-state transitions in prepausal and non-prepausal words, respectively. The selection of the transition distributions depends on a random variable whose value is influenced by whether a pause will appear between the current and the following word. Two experiments are presented here. The first one considers pauses hypothesised during speech decoding. The second one employs an extra component for speech/non-speech determination. By modelling the prepausal lengthening effect we achieve a 5. 5 % relative reduction in word error rate on the 500 -word task of the SVitchboard corpus.

30|$|High-quality speech without {{grammatical}} <b>speech</b> <b>pauses</b> within sentences can {{be highly}} intelligible and acceptable. But, {{as soon as the}} speech quality is less than normal, or the speech is listened in noisy conditions, the introduction of grammatical <b>speech</b> <b>pauses</b> can help to maintain intelligibility [64]. In general, “it can be observed that the contributions of prosody to speech perception become more important when the segmental quality of speech or the listening conditions become less favorable” [64]. Pauses can be considered as “markers of information structure” [71, 72]. Intonational phrases (clearly signaled by silence, {{as well as by the}} characteristic pitch movement) are required between utterances and at punctuation boundaries. Phonological phrases (signaled by silence rather by the characteristic pitch movement only) “may be harder to place with certainty and to evaluate” [72]. Voices with a high speaking rate combined with long utterance breaks seem to be preferable to listeners [73].|$|R
