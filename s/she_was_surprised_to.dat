Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.|$|E

25|$|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh {{made their}} public entry into London on 12 March. The marriage, however, {{was not a}} happy one, and the bride was thought haughty by London Society. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} {{that she had to}} yield precedence to the Princess of Wales and all of Queen Victoria's daughters and insisted on taking precedence before the Princess of Wales (the future Queen Alexandra) because she and her father the Tsar considered the Princess of Wales' family (the Danish Royal Family) as inferior to their own. Queen Victoria refused this demand, yet granted her precedence immediately after the Princess of Wales. Her father gave her the then-staggering sum of £100,000 as a dowry, plus an annual allowance of £28,000.|$|E

She found it to be a bold statement and inquired about the man, {{who turned out to be}} Zackie Achmat, a South African activist, film director, and co-founder of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). Although the singer had been associated with the 46664 campaign, being introduced to Achmat gave her an opportunity to do more for the campaign and the project.|$|E
500|$|Charisma Carpenter {{was invited}} to appear on Charmed because of her {{friendship}} with Holly Marie Combs after they had worked together on the ABC Family television film See Jane Date (2003). Kyra was created as a separate character from the Seer (Debbi Morgan), who was featured as an antagonist {{in the second half}} of season four. Carpenter joked that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> be considered for such a minor part on the show as a guest star. Kyra was one of three characters with precognition that Carpenter has played in her career, including Cordelia Chase from supernatural dramas Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, and Heather from the Syfy horror film Voodoo Moon (2006).

500|$|Richard Edgeworth {{observed}} on his wife's death that being {{familiar with the}} experimental method in science, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find that educational theory was based on very little empirical evidence, {{and set out to}} apply experimental science to child education and devised, executed and recorded experiments with children. She conceived and executed a register (2 volumes 1778–1779) of the reaction of children to new knowledge and experience, given her interest in applying experimental science to the field of child education. She observed the questions that children asked, what they did, and how they solved problems. An extensive example of her recorded dialogue is given by Richard and Maria Edgeworth in [...] "Practical Education". This formed the basis of Richard Edgeworth's Essays on professional education (1809). In the Bodleian Library there is a short story in manuscript dated 1787 and other fragments attributed to Honora Sneyd. Her parents' principles of childhood education were to be a profound influence on Maria Edgeworth's own career as a writer for children.|$|E

The elder Archduchess Sophie, who often referred to Elisabeth as a [...] "silly young mother", not only named the child (after herself) without consulting the mother, but took complete charge of the baby, refusing to allow Elisabeth to breastfeed or otherwise care for her own child. When a second daughter, Archduchess Gisela of Austria (1856–1932), was born a year later, the Archduchess took the baby away from Elisabeth as well.|$|E

Cooper explained that Lynsey supported Jacqui through her rape trial and believed Jacqui was telling the truth. This means Jacqui can relate to Lynsey's situation with Silas as nobody believes Lynsey's claims, leading to them building [...] "a great friendship". Hassan also commented on the friendship, saying <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear the pair would become friends as naturally they would not be expected to be friends. She elaborated on this, saying the characters are at opposite [...] "ends of the spectrum" [...] but have both been through traumatic times and have had people not believe them. They have shown each other kindness so there is [...] "a real tenderness in their friendship".|$|E

2500|$|The new couple {{would have}} a happy marriage. After the wedding, the new Lady Morpeth {{went to live with}} her husband's family at Castle Howard in Yorkshire. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} a patriarchal family culture that emphasised showing little affection to children, in contrast to her own background being raised by her loving mother. Georgiana's sister Harriet likened the relationship between the 5th Earl of Carlisle and his children to [...] "a Prince and his followers", adding that [...] "Lord Carlisle certainly keeps his children in great awe of him". Lord and Lady Morpeth would have six sons and six daughters together; she raised them all devotedly in contrast to the pre-existing environment of the household. The birth of their second son Edward in December 1809 delayed the marriage of her sister Harriet to Lord Granville Leveson-Gower. Georgiana was present at the birth of Harriet's first child Susan in 1810.|$|E

She closed with [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", and 20,000 voices spontaneously joined in.|$|E
2500|$|Ann Bates {{was first}} {{discovered}} by a civilian-spy, John Craig, or [...] "Craiggie". The two met sometime during British occupation in Philadelphia. Craig {{was an active}} member in Clinton's espionage network, and assigned Bates with small secret tasks {{while they were still}} in Philadelphia. [...] Craig quickly noticed her intelligence, and referred her to meet with his general, Major Duncan Drummond, in New York City. She would then go on to flee Philadelphia on June 18, 1778, when British commander General Clinton evacuated his forces from the capital. This was in response to news of an alliance between France and the United States. As the political climate was changing, Bates was one of many loyalists who left Philadelphia with the British Army. She swiftly left the capital after convincing the General at the time, [...] Benedict Arnold, that she was leaving to sell her goods in New York City. [...] After her husband joined Clinton's army on June 18, 1778, Bates followed the British to their headquarters in New York City. After she arrived at headquarters to meet with Craig, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> meet with one of Clinton's main spy handlers, Duncan Drummond, instead. The two persuaded Bates to join the British spy network. He was recorded describing their meeting; [...] "A woman whom Craig has trusted often came to town last night. She is well acquainted with many of the R.A. (Royal Army)... It is proposed to send her out under the idea of selling little matters".|$|E
