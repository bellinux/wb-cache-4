40|$|There is a {{substantial}} body of literature addressing the issue of optimal <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> taxation. The most common theme in this literature concerns the optimal <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> in a growing economy. For example, papers by Diamond (1965), Samuelson (1975), and Hu (1979) demonstrate that a <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> can alter the private sector 2 ̆ 7 s saving behavior. As such, <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> {{can be used as}} a policy tool to change the economy 2 ̆ 7 s capital/labor ratio and the economy 2 ̆ 7 s growth path. The optimal <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> is that which brings about the most preferred growth path. For an economy in which no growth occurs, it is often argued that <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> cannot improve upon the performance of the private economy, Actuarially fair programs will simply replace private saving; actuarially unfair programs will produce distortions within the economy. However,. in Enders and Lapan (1981), we derived the optimal <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> for a stationary economy in which all agents have rational expectations...|$|R

25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>taxes</b> are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as high as it is for those in the top fifth.|$|E
25|$|During working years, the low wage {{worker is}} {{eligible}} for the Earned Income Tax Credit (FICA refunds) and federal child credits and may pay little or no FICA tax or Income tax. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0–20%) and second quintile (21–40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average income tax of -9.3% and -2.6% and <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>taxes</b> of 8.3% and 7.9% respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average Total Federal Tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively.

25|$|Critics of Social Security {{have said}} that the {{politicians}} who created Social Security exempted themselves from having to pay the Social Security tax. When the federal government created Social Security, all federal employees, including the president and members of Congress, were exempt from having to pay the Social Security tax, and they received no Social Security benefits. This law was changed by the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which brought within the Social Security system all members of Congress, the president and the vice president, federal judges, and certain executive-level political appointees, as well as all federal employees hired in any capacity on or after January 1, 1984. Many state and local government workers, however, are exempt from <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>taxes</b> because they contribute instead to alternative retirement systems set up by their employers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} key {{implication}} of rational expectations {{and the basic}} Life Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis (LCH/PIH) : that predictable changes in income have no e®ect on {{the growth rate of}} consumption expenditures. 1 This implication is important for understanding the e®ectiveness and optimal timing of ¯scal policy, the causes and propagation of business cycles, and the e®ects of income °uctuations on the growth rate of the economy. Using household-level consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), this paper tests whether expenditures on nondurable goods increase contemporaneously with predictable changes in <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> withholding. 2 Individuals with wage and salary income earned in the United States are subject to <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> withholding of around seven percent of their gross pay up to an annual maximum income level. The structure of the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>tax</b> system provide two sources of variation. First, a series of pre-announced tax rate increases occurred in the 1980 's.

In a two-period model with uncertainty about life-expectancy, it is shown that for a given annuity price tax incentives for life annuities increases consumption expenditures in old-age, while the opposite occurs by a cut in the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> benefits and by an increase of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>tax.</b> The main result is that a tax incentive for life annuities and a cut in the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> benefits alleviate adverse selection in the private annuity market, while an increase in the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>tax</b> exacerbates adverse selection. annuity market; uncertain lifetime; adverse selection; <b>tax</b> incentives; <b>social</b> <b>security...</b>|$|R

25|$|Along with earning salaries, {{senators}} receive {{retirement and}} health benefits that are identical to other federal employees, and are fully vested {{after five years}} of service. Senators are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).

Under FERS, senators contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2% of their salary in <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>taxes.</b> The amount of a senator's pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of their salary. The starting amount of a senator's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under CSRS was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a Social Security {{number for}} a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal {{requirement}} that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want or have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About {{the only way to}} avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes are to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the Amish, Christian Science or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>taxes</b> due to historical exemptions.|$|E
