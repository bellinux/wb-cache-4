5|$|Betty Dean Sanders {{was born}} on May 28, 1934, to Ollie Mae Sanders and Shelman Sandlin. Sandlin was 21 years old and Ollie Mae Sanders was a teenager; the couple was unmarried. Throughout her life, Betty Sanders {{maintained}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> in Detroit, Michigan, but early records—such as her high-school and college transcripts—show Pinehurst, Georgia, as her place of birth. Authorities in Georgia and Michigan {{have not been able}} to locate her birth certificate.|$|E
5|$|Anne was the {{daughter}} of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Boleyn was a well respected diplomat with a gift for languages; he was also a favourite of King Henry VII, who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad. Anne and her siblings grew up at Hever Castle in Kent. However, the siblings were born in Norfolk at the Boleyn home at Blickling. A lack of parish records from the period has made it impossible to establish Anne's date of birth. Contemporary evidence is contradictory, with several dates having been put forward by various historians. An Italian, writing in 1600, suggested that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> in 1499, while Sir Thomas More's son-in-law, William Roper, indicated a much later date of 1512. Her birth was most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507. As with Anne herself, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but it seems clear that her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary's children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister. Most historians now agree that Mary was born in 1499. Mary's grandson claimed the Ormonde title in 1596 on the basis she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth I accepted. Their brother George was born around 1504.|$|E

25|$|La Pola's {{date and}} place of birth are also subject to {{conjecture}} {{in the absence of}} legal documents. The popular version is that she was born in the municipality of Guaduas, Cundinamarca, between 1790 and 1796. However Rafael Pombo affirmed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> in Mariquita, while José Caicedo Rojas confirmed it as Bogotá.|$|E
25|$|The ancient historians {{mentioned}} that some Greek deities were of Libyan origin.

Those ancient historians stated that she was originally honored by the Berbers around Lake Tritonis where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> from the god Poseidon and Lake Tritonis, according to the Libyan legend. Herodotus wrote that the Aegis and the clothes of Athena are typical for Libyan woman.|$|E

25|$|Graham was {{interested}} in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists from around the world; with the largest representations of nations ever held until that time. Over 157 nations were gathered in 2000 at the RAI Convention Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At one revival in Seoul, South Korea, Graham attracted {{more than one million}} people to a single service. He appeared in China in 1988—for Ruth, this was a homecoming, since <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> in China to missionary parents. He appeared in North Korea in 1992.|$|E

She was found dead in a river shortly after the marriage; she had been stabbed. When her parents went to identify her, her mother—already ill—had a heart attack and died. Grayling said he dealt with his grief by becoming a workaholic.|$|E

Ermengarde reads the letter to Sarah and they all imagine what her father is doing over in Africa (The Widow Zuma). Sara enlists Ermengarde and Lottie's help to create such chaos at school that Becky is recalled from the workhouse, and restored to her position. Miss Minchin, realizing <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> outmaneuvered, believes all Sara's advantages come to her because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> lucky ("Lucky").|$|R

25|$|Nationally, One Nation gained 8.99 {{percent of}} the Senate vote and 8.4% of the Representatives vote, but only one MP was elected – Len Harris as a Senator for Queensland. Heather Hill had been elected to this position, but the High Court of Australia ruled that, {{although}} she was an Australian citizen, she was ineligible for election to sit as a Senator because she had not renounced her British citizenship, which the Court assumed she possessed because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> in Britain.

25|$|Doherty {{was born}} Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine (Екатерина Фёдоровна Колышкина) in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire. Her parents, Fyodor and Emma Thomson Kolyschkine, {{belonged to the}} minor nobility and were devout members of the Russian Orthodox Church who had their child baptized in St. Petersburg on September 15, 1896. She was not baptized {{on the same day}} that she was born because her mother was worried she might get a disease as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> on a train. Schooled abroad due to her father's job, she had an {{exposure}} to the Catholic Church in the form of her schooling in Alexandria (Egypt) where her father, an aristocrat, had been posted by the government.

In 1912, aged 15, she married her first cousin, Baron Boris de Hueck (1889–1947).|$|E
500|$|As {{with many}} Simpsons characters, Marge's age and {{birthday}} changes {{to serve the}} story. In season one (1990) episodes [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] and [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", Marge {{was said to be}} 34. In [...] "Homer's Paternity Coot" [...] (season 17, 2006), Marge states that Emerald would have been her birthstone if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> three months later, placing her birthday sometime in February. [...] In [...] "Regarding Margie" [...] (season 17, 2006), Homer mentioned that Marge was his age, meaning she could have been anywhere between 36 and 40. In the season eighteen episode [...] "Marge Gamer" [...] she states that she and actor Randy Quaid share the same birthdate (October 1).|$|E

50|$|Her {{youngest}} daughter, Evelyn Mothemane, was 78 {{when her}} mother celebrated her purported 132nd birthday, meaning <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> {{when her mother}} was 53 or 54.

500|$|Mansfield was so {{uncertain}} {{about how it}} would be applied that he specified in his 1793 will that his [...] "mulatto" [...] great-niece Dido Elizabeth Belle was to be considered a free woman. (<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> into slavery as the illegitimate daughter of his nephew in the West Indies but lived with him and his wife for 30 years.) In addition, advertisements from the 1770s show that slaves continued to be bought and sold in England. Mansfield referred to slaves in his judgment in a later case. Although slavery was not completely abolished in the British Empire until 1834, Mansfield's decision is considered to have been a significant step in recognising the illegality of slavery.|$|E
500|$|During Perón's time, {{children}} born to unmarried parents {{did not have the}} same legal rights as those born to married parents. Biographer Julie M. Taylor, professor of anthropology at Rice University, has said that Evita was well aware of the pain of being born [...] "illegitimate." [...] Taylor speculates that Evita's awareness of this may have influenced her decision to have the law changed so that [...] "illegitimate" [...] children would henceforth be referred to as [...] "natural" [...] children. Upon her death, the Argentine public was told that Evita was only 30. The discrepancy was meant to dovetail with Evita's earlier tampering with her birth certificate. After becoming the first lady in 1946, Evita had her birth records altered to read that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> to married parents, and placed her birth date three years later, making herself younger.|$|E
500|$|Wagner and Cosima {{were married}} at Lucerne, on 25 August 1870, in a Protestant church. Cosima's journal {{for that day}} records: [...] "May I be worthy of bearing R's name!" [...] Liszt was not {{informed}} {{in advance of the}} wedding, and learned of it first through the newspapers. The year ended on a high note for the Wagners: on 25December, the day on which Cosima always celebrated her birthday although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>born</b> on the 24th, she awoke to the sounds of music. She commemorated the event in her journal: [...] "...music was sounding, and what music! After it had died away, R ... put into my hands the score of his [...] "Symphonic Birthday Greeting. ... R had set up his orchestra on the stairs, and thus consecrated our Tribschen forever!" [...] This was the first performance of the music that became known as the Siegfried Idyll.|$|E
