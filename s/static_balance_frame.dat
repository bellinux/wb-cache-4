40|$|<b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> is the {{reduction}} or {{elimination of the}} actuating effort in quasi-static motion of a mechanical system by adding non-dissipative force interactions to the system. In recent years, there is increasing recognition that <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> of elastic forces in compliant mechanisms leads to increased efficiency as well as good force feedback characteristics. The development of insightful and pragmatic design meth-ods for statically balanced compliant mechanisms is the motivation for this work. In our approach, we focus on a class of compliant mechanisms that can be approxi-mated as spring-loaded rigid-link mechanisms. Instead of developing <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> techniques directly for the compliant mechanisms, we seek analytical balancing tech-niques for the simplified spring–loaded rigid–link approximations. Towards that, we first provide new <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> techniques for a spring-loaded four-bar linkage. We also find relations between <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> parameters of the cognates of a four-bar linkage. Later, we develop a new perfect <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> method for a general n-degree-of-freedom revolute and spherical jointed rigid-body linkages. This genera...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between physical activity levels, types and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> in elderly people. The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was used to assess physical activity levels and types. <b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> indicating the path length and the body sway area of the center of pressure was measured by five <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> tests using the static force platform. The tests included standing on one leg with eyes opened, standing on two legs with feet apart and together, and being in the two-leg stance positions with eyes opened and closed. Thirty-seven subjects completed all measurements. In the total sample, most (55. 32 %) PASE points were accounted for by household-related activity, and the PASE scores were between 20. 04 and 222. 07. But there was no significant difference between <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and physical activity levels, and between <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and various physical activity types. However, <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> with eyes opened was significantly better than with eyes closed. Physical activity levels were low amongst elderly people and the primary physical activity types were sedentary-orientated and walking. Hence, the physical activity of elderly people might be too light to affect <b>static</b> <b>balance.</b> However, the results inferred the importance of vision in the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> of elderly people. Use of vision as a factor to measure <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> in elderly people could increase the discriminability. Further investigations on the factors that influence the capability of elderly to balance are required to improve and to serve as references in the prescription of exercise for elderly people...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether spinal cord stimulation (SCS) {{has a negative}} effect on <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and gait, which is implicated by the increased incidence of falls leading to frequently occurring lead migrations. Materials and Methods: A controlled trial is performed with 11 subjects (four female, seven male) {{with a mean age of}} 46 years old. A baseline measurement consisting of <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and gait tests was performed. Within two weeks after implantation of a spinal cord stimulator, subjects performed the same tests with both stimulation switched on and off. <b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> was assessed with eyes open and eyes closed on hard surface and foam surface. The velocity of the center of pressure and weight symmetry were the main outcome parameters. Kinematics and spatiotemporal outcome parameters were used to analyze gait. ANOVAs were used to compare between baseline, stimulation on, and stimulation off. Results: Spinal cord stimulation resulted in significant pain relief as scored on a Visual Analog Scale (p < 0. 001). Gait width decreased and this change (indicative of improvement in balance) was significant (p = 0. 007). No other significant group differences were found between stimulation baseline and post-surgery measurements. SCS did not influence <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> or gait when group effects were analyzed. Four subjects showed significant differences in <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> between stimulation on and off. Conclusions: The lack of group differences in normal gait and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> cannot explain the increased incidence of falls. However, four subjects showed an effect of SCS on <b>static</b> <b>balance.</b> Further research to clarify why only a part of the subjects experienced balance problems is recommended and assessments of more demanding balance and gait tasks are desirable...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of balance}} and balance {{training}} in athletic performance: [...] Balance has long been recognized as {{an important factor in}} a number of sports (such as gymnastics, and figure skating) and more recently has been regarded as important in other sports as well. Lack of balance {{has been shown to be}} detrimental to optimal performance through decreases in strength and force production, increased fatigue as well as predisposition to injury. Much of the research regarding balance training focuses on injury rehabilitation and prevention with little focus on examining the effects of short and long term balance training on athletic performance. The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide a comprehensive review of literature regarding balance, short and long term effects of balance training and its possible beneficial effects on athletic performance. [...] The objective of this study was to determine the effects <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and dynamic balance training on muscle activation strategies, <b>static</b> <b>balance,</b> jump and sprint performance. Twenty-four recreationally active females were tested pre- and post-training (<b>static</b> <b>balance</b> training, n= 11, dynamic balance training, n = 7 and control group, n = 6). Experimental subjects completed either <b>static</b> or dynamic <b>balance</b> exercises 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to assess preparatory and reactive muscle activity of the rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), and the soleus during one- and two-foot landings. Maximum vertical jump, <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and sprint times were also examined. A 3 -way ANOVA revealed a significant (p<. 05) increase in reactive rectus femoris activity, as well as a group by time interaction for the reactive rectus femoris activity. The <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> group showed a 33 % increase in reactive rectus femoris activity (p<. 01). There was also significantly less reactive hamstring to quadriceps coactivation following training (p<. 05). The group by time interaction for the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and maximum vertical jump height performance (p<. 05) were also significant. The <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> training group showed a 33 % improvement in <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and 9 % improvement in jump height performances.

Objective: The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the effect of 8 weeks of Whole Body Vibration (WBV) training on <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and explosive strength of the lower limbs, using two different training intensities vibration protocols. Methods: Eighty-three physical education students (age 19. 39 &# 8239;&# 177;&# 8239; 2. 35 &# 8239;years) volunteered to participate in an 8 -week WBV training. They were randomly divided into two groups with 30 &# 8239;sec and 60 &# 8239;sec duration of vibration exposure per exercise, total volume of exercise was the same for both groups. The explosive strength of the lower limbs was assessed by a squat jump and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> by Balance Error Scoring System at the baseline (pre-test) and after 8 weeks of WBV training at 15 &# 8239;sec, 5, 10, and 15 &# 8239;min after the end of WBV exposure. A two-way ANOVA 2 × 5 (protocol × time) with repeated measures on both factors was used. Univariate analyses with simple contrasts across time were selected as post hoc tests. Results: Results showed a time × protocol interaction effect for <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> (p&# 8239;&# 8239;. 05). Furthermore, a time effect was found for the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and squat jump test. The 60 &# 8239;sec protocol had a greater percentage improvement compared to the 30 &# 8239;sec protocol in <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> (p =&# 8239;. 003), whereas the 30 &# 8239;sec protocol was superior to the 60 &# 8239;sec protocol in explosive strength.

The survey was conducted before and after the implementation of our methods of teaching swimming. Results: revealed low level of capacity to preserve <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and ability to preserve the active balance while walking on the increase at the beginning of research. Conclusion: the defined positive impact of the methodic of teaching swimming in deaf children of experimental group according to results of <b>static</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Static {{and dynamic}} balance are {{essential}} in daily and sports life. Many {{factors have been}} identified as influencing <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> control. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} apply the (XCoM) method and other relevant variables (CoP, CoM, Fh, KE, P, Q, and, AI) to investigate sport related activities such as hopping and jumping. Many studies have represented the CoP data without mentioning its accuracy so several experiments were done to establish the agreement between the CoP and the projected CoM in a static condition. 5 healthy male were participated in this study (Mean ± SD:- age 24. 6 years ± 4. 5, height 177 cm ± 6. 3, body mass 72. 8 kg ± 6. 6). Results found that the implementation of the XCoM method was found to be practical for evaluating both <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>balance.</b> The general findings were that the CoP, the CoM, the XCoM, Fh, and Q were more informative than the other variables (e. g. KE, P, and AI) during <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>balance.</b> The XCoM method was found to be applicable to dynamic balance as well as <b>static</b> <b>balance.</b> Keywords—Centre of Mass, <b>static</b> <b>balance,</b> Dynamic balance, extrapolated Centre of Mass...|$|R
40|$|Background: Proprioceptive {{deficiency}} {{followed by}} lateral ankle sprain leads to poor balance is not uncommon. It {{has been linked}} with increased injury risk among young athletes. Introducing neuromuscular training programs for this have been believed {{as one of the}} means of injury prevention. Hence, this study was aimed {{to determine the effects of}} six weeks progressive neuromuscular training (PNM Training) on <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> gains among the young athletes with a previous history of ankle sprains. Methods: This study was an experimental study design, with pre and post test method to determine the effects of PNM Training on <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> gains. All data were collected at university’s sports rehabilitation lab before and after six weeks of intervention period. There were 20 male and female volunteer young athletes (20. 9 ± 0. 85 years of age) with a previous history of ankle sprain involving various sports were recruited from the University community. All the subjects were participated in a six week PNM Training that included stability, strength and power training. Outcome measures were collected by calculating the errors on balance error scoring system made by the athletes on <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> before and after the six weeks of intervention period. <b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> was tested in firm and foam surfaces and recorded accordingly. Results: The researchers found a significant decrease (2. 40 ± 0. 82) in total errors among the samples at the post test compared with their pre test (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that a PNM Training can improve the <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> on both the firm and foam surfaces among the young athletes with a previous history of ankle sprains...|$|R

40|$|A {{rotating}} system {{such as that}} shown in Figure 1 may possess both static and dynamic balance; this demonstration illustrates the difference. If the system possesses <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> it will remain balanced in any orientation. If it also possesses dynamic balance it will rotate smoothly, as does the system in Figure 1. On the other hand, when the bar is rotated, as shown in Figure 2, it possesses <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> but not dynamic balance. When it is rotated it begins to vibrate violently. This is why the tires on your car must be balanced dynamically...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} {{study was to}} {{consider}} the effect of six-week special walking program upon <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and flexibility of the sedentary old aged 60 - 70 in Zanjan. In doing so, 24 old adults participated voluntarily in the program. They,at first,were examined to ensure their physical health was fit for the program. Their mean age and weight was 65. 1 and 76. 1,respectively. They were divided into experimental (n= 12) and control(n= 12) groups. The results show that walking program had a positively {{significant impact on the}} <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and flexibility of the old...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} relationship between foot posture and <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>balance</b> in athlete and non-athlete girls. Material and methods: there were 40 girl student that 20 of them were athlete aged 21 / 5 +- 4 / 62 and 20 non-athlete aged 22 / 8 +- 2 / 61. to evaluate foot posture, dynamic <b>balance</b> and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> used radmond,s six scale visual method, star exersion balance test, and BESS test respectively. To analyzing data, indipendent t-test and pearson correlation test was used. (p≤ 0 / 05) Results: there was not significant correlation between foot posture with dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> in any of athlete and non-athlete girls group (p≥ 0 / 05) but there were significant difference in foot posture, dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> between two group (p≤ 0 / 05). Conclusion:this research show that athletes have a propriate foot posture index and balance function. also we can probably say that fitness and neuro-muscular performance affect on balance more than biomechanic factors such as foot posture. To evaluate this hypothesis we need more researchs...|$|R
