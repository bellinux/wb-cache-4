The 20 MW BiOlevano project is due to come on stream {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2011 at a cost of €80 million. A key feature is the development of the wood-chip supply chain. A high proportion (more than 85%) of the plant’s raw materials will come from a <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> The BiOlevano unit features very high conversion efficiency (more than 30%) and extremely low emissions, lower than any other biomass power plant in Italy.The plant, designed to deliver 140 GWhe per year of renewable energy, sufficient to meet the needs of about 50,000 families, will consume approximately 200,000 tonnes/year of wood chips. These will come mainly from poplar trees grown according to the short rotation forestry (SRF) formula, defined as high-density plantations of fast-growing species to be used for energy conversion. Taking into account the carbon capture cycle of its raw materials, the Olevano plant will reduce atmospheric emissions of CO2 by more than 100,000 tonnes/year by replacing electricity generated from fossil fuels.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - In {{recent years}} {{consumers}} in Belgium {{have shown a}} great interest for foods from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> The difference with the conventional chain {{is that in the}} <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> the primary products are locally processed and sold directly by the producer to the consumer. The <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> has different microbiological quality and safety aspects in comparison with the conventional chain. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate these aspects. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consists of analyzing the available scientific literature and results of microbiological analyses on foods from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Findings - The main findings were that Listeria monocytogenes was frequently detected (15 percent) in sampled raw dairy products whereas Salmonella was not isolated in 1, 023 samples. Human pathogenic vero (cyto) toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Campylobacter spp. are potential hazards, in particular for products that are not thermally treated. Data with regard to E. coli counts showed a greater variability in products from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> compared to the conventional chain. Research limitations/implications - The paper discusses strengths and weaknesses with impact on microbial quality and safety in operation of food safety management in the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> vs the conventional chain. Originality/value - This is the first paper that assesses the risks from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> vs the conventional chain and that makes recommendations for operators in the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|E

40|$|Currently, <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> {{represent}} {{a viable alternative}} to the conventional globalized <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> thus gradually becoming a more and more proeminent actor in the global logistics sector. The previously mentioned <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> are in general extremely varied both in terms of nature and practices, benefiting producers as well as consumers from the socio-economic, environmental and health improvement points of view. In most cases, <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> effectively reconnect end consumers, especially the young generations, with local small agri-food producers, thus contributing to the process of educating and/or sometimes reeducating individuals about the importance of adopting a healthy diet. Romania holds, in this respect, a high potential for the development of <b>short</b> food <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> due to a series of factors such as: the large number of small semi-subsistence agricultural holdings (under 5 hectares); the persistent historical rural-urban link, as evidenced by the methods of obtaining food and groceries; the growing number of local certified producers, and last but not least the great veriety of specialized shops.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{new forms of}} food {{distribution}} organisation, known as short supply chains, have gained ground. The local nature of such distribution has positive effects {{on the environment and}} on the local economy. Consumers appear to trust the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain,</b> and it has achieved considerable success. However, the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> has credence characteristics which, by their very nature, cannot be identified through a system of certification. The question we address in this paper is whether it is possible to identify the constituent elements of the credence trait in relation to food quality in the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Our hypothesis is that the latter are linked to a range of socially constructed food quality criteria. To develop a more inclusive vision of how such criteria are coordinated in food quality assessment by consumers, use has been made of convention theory. In accordance with convention theory, quality is identified, in a social context and informally, as one of the spheres in which economic activity is regulated by procedures which go beyond regulation by price. The aim of our study was to measure the effects of coordinated conventions of quality in the context of one type of short supply chain: farmers' markets specialised in the sale of organic products. An ordered logit model was implemented. Our results allow credence characteristics to be classified within conventions of quality and could help support strategies aimed at spreading sustainable forms of food distribution and consumption. Future research might go to the direction of validating our results based on a single form of supply organization. Moreover, additional efforts should be made understanding the effect of situational factors on socio-demographic variables such as gender. Finally, an attempt should be made to merge different theories to better understand the issue of consumer choice...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study {{based on the results of}} a number of Italian national and regional research projects is to analyse income from beef, sales distribution channels and breeder strategies. Our research shows that breeding farms offer a considerable number of products, especially livestock and value added products (fresh meat cuts, salamis) sold directly to consumers in addition to providing tourist and recreational services. However because organic beef producers have little negotiation power, traditional livestock sales channels are not economically rewarding. The organic beef supply chain stops at the farm stage and therefore organically reared animals are sold at the same price as traditionally reared animals. This situation has motivated some farmers to add meat processing to their normal rearing activities.

40|$|AbstractThe {{lengthening}} of {{the supply}} chain developed over the last decades – due to the multiplication of intermediaries - has produced effects from an environmental, economic, social and territorial point of view cannot pass unnoticed. As a matter of fact, the excessive amount of participants taking part in all the phases {{of the supply}} chain has created the basis for an increase of environmental impacts due to many factors: the implementation of farming methods, which are {{getting more and more}} intensive, put pressure on the environment, on the sustainability of the agricultural industrial production process and increase the number of kilometres the goods have to travel in order to be distributed. Moreover, the extension of the supply chain has produced a decrease of its share of value-added to the benefit of the farmers and, as a consequence, has excluded many small producers from the market and caused a negative impact on rural areas (unemployment, depopulation due to migration). From the customers’ point of view, the increase of intermediaries has created an informative asymmetry due to the impossibility to track their shipment as well as to a lowering of their quality standards, caused by an increasingly standardized production process. During the last years, the interest of policy-makers in <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> has grown. It appears to be a tool able to incentivize a sustainable agricultural productions and to provide environmental, economic and social benefits. In fact, the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> other than reducing costs, which are cut down by decreasing the number of intermediaries that take the product from the producer to the consumer, creates a positive environmental externalities and, above all, promotes the local areas. This work highlights the central role taken on by the implementation of new forms of marketing in the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and its importance in influencing the concept of sustainable development in the agricultural supply chain. Moreover, this work aims to find evidence-based guidelines for policy-makers seeking to support the development of these new forms of marketing, whose potential lies in the customers’ attention to ethical and environmental issues and their need for natural and healthy food...|$|E

Further, the alpine region presents an increase of the forests in lands once used by agricultural activities. Consequently the improved availability of hardwood from spontaneous regenerating process could provide industrial roundwood. An interdisciplinary project was undertaken to study the potential of these forests with regard to the sustainability of the short forestry-wood chain for the furnishing production together local designers and industries. Furnishing requirements of ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) wood were evaluated, focusing to physical and aesthetical behaviour after ageing.
