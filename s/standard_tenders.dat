50|$|The G 12 {{was mainly}} {{equipped}} with Prussian class 3 T 20 or 2'2' T 31.5 tenders. The Saxon XIII H, {{on the other}} hand, generally ran with the somewhat larger Saxon class 3 T 21 tenders, resulting in a greater overall length. Because water tank volume was reduced on conversion to coal dust firing, only large Prussian 2'2' T 31.5 tenders or <b>standard</b> <b>tenders</b> were used after the war.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{delivery}} of new tenders in the required quantities was not possible for various reasons and the original pr 3 T 20 and sä 3 T 21 tenders {{could not be used}} for safety reasons, there was a major shortage of tenders for this class for a long time. So the Class 58.30 was coupled with almost all available types of four-axled tender to begin with. For example, there are official photographs of engines with the large 2'2'T34 <b>standard</b> <b>tenders</b> as well as the 2'2'T30 tub tenders.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1915, the Southern had {{the unique}} idea to fit [...] "tractor engines" [...] {{underneath}} the tender. These locomotives were {{used on the}} mountainous Asheville Division in North Carolina. They were similar to the Erie Railroad's [...] "Triplex" [...] 2-8-8-8-2 pusher locomotives, in that the rear set of driving wheels exhausted through a pipe on {{the rear of the}} tender. But there was not just one specific type of wheel arrangement. The Southern added 2-8-0 engines onto the Mikados 4535-4539 and 4576, but they added a 2-6-0 unit to the 4561. They did not produce good enough results, and the tractor units were removed in 1924 and were replaced by <b>standard</b> <b>tenders.</b> An obvious problem with this arrangement is that, similar to the Garratt locomotive and the Triplex, as the tender coal and water ran out, the traction decreased. The locomotives continued service until the early 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The engines were {{equipped}} with a 2'2' T 32 <b>standard</b> <b>tender.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Type MP1 was {{the first}} of a <b>standard</b> <b>tender</b> type which, by fitting an engine drawbar to suit the class of engine to which it is coupled, was {{eventually}} to be used on all the Hendrie-designed locomotives. The tender had a coal capacity of 10 lt t, a water capacity of 4250 imp gal and a maximum axle load of 13 lt 15 lcwt kg.|$|R
50|$|The DRG's Class 03.10 engines were an {{evolutionary}} development from the Class 03 locomotives, {{comparable to those}} of Class 01.10 which had evolved from Class 01. The first 03.10 was built in 1939 and 140 units were to be manufactured. As a result of the Second World War and the switching of production to 'war essential' goods, only 60 vehicles were completed. Originally supplied with the 2'2 T38St <b>standard</b> <b>tenders,</b> the 03.10 could later be encountered coupled to 2'2'T34 tenders. The locomotives were mainly produced by the firms of Borsig, Krupp and Krauss-Maffei, and were fully enclosed by streamlining plates. The vehicles were given the operating numbers 03 1001 - 1022, 03 1043-1060 and 03 1073 - 1092.After the war, 47 locomotives remained in Germany; 26 were taken over by the Deutsche Bundesbahn and 21 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany. Ten other locomotives ended up with the Polish State Railways (PKP) as the Pm3. Two engines (03 1091 and 1092) had to be retired as early as 1944 due to war damage. The fate of 03 1002 is unknown. Because the top speed on main lines had to be reduced due to route damage, the streamlined shells became uneconomical, not least because they made maintenance more difficult, and they were removed from all the engines except the DR's 03 1087. Almost all the DR and DB locomotives were rebuilt. Only 03 1047, 1097 and 1086 (DR) had been retired before the reconstruction programme.|$|E
40|$|A {{central bank}} {{possesses}} various instruments to provide liquidity. These are either outright monetary transactions (OMT) of securities or other refinancing facilities, primarily repos, which are executed with <b>standard</b> <b>tenders.</b> The eligible securities (i. e. bonds or equities) need to conform with certain credit risk criteria (i. e., satisfactory credit rating or low default probability).

40|$|We {{consider}} tenders/auctions for {{the procurement}} {{of items that}} do not exist {{at the time of}} the tender. The cost of production is subject to ex-post shocks, i. e. cost overruns, which cannot be contracted away or insured at the time of tender. The contractors may default due to the cost overruns once the project is underway. We consider a simple contract that speci 8 ̆ 5 es the payment in case of default and the award that is paid upon successful project completion. This contract is allocated at the tender and the award part is determined by competitive bidding. We characterize bidding behavior of contractors in <b>standard</b> <b>tenders</b> and derive the implications for the buyers expected cost minimization. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{shipping}} in the mid-19th century led to {{a need for more}} lighthouses along the Swedish coasts, and Jonsson was responsible for many new or refurbished lighthouses during the 1840s: Vinga, Hållö, Kullen, Morups Tånge, Långe Erik, Fårö, Landsort and more. He was so successful as a lighthouse-builder that he was eventually offered such jobs without the <b>standard</b> <b>tender</b> procedure for government-financed buildings. However, there are also records of complaints from both workers and government inspectors, giving a picture of an unyielding man.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{locomotive}} firebox {{of the day}} {{was long}} and narrow, fitting in between the locomotive's frames. The successful design of a trailing truck with the firebox mounted behind the driving wheels had not yet been developed. Wootten instead mounted his huge firebox above the locomotive's driving wheels. The problem now arose that with a cab floor at the then <b>standard</b> <b>tender</b> deck height, it would be impossible for the locomotive's engineer (driver) to see forwards around the firebox shoulders. Instead, a cab for the engineer was placed above and astride the boiler. The fireman, however, remained at the rear with minimal protection from the elements.|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} the Tendering Process in South African Government Institutions has become an area of concern in recent years with issues related to transparency, {{governance}} and rigid retrospective procedures being cited as impediments to efficiency. In tum, Knowledge Management (KM) {{and its ability to}} be applied to all types of organisations to increase efficiency has been popularised extensively. An analysis of KM literature suggested that the principles of KM may be used to increase efficiency and create competitive advantage. This study attempted to identify whether the benefits gained by other organisations through the application of Knowledge Management principles, could be applied to the Tendering Process in South African Government Institutions. The study sought to identify how Knowledge Value Chain by Wang and Ahmed (2005) may be leveraged to create an enhanced Tendering Process. The study then reviewed the Tendering Processes conducted in Australia, United States of America, Malaysia and South Africa and sought to identify the common steps in a tendering process in order to construct a <b>standard</b> <b>tendering</b> process. The Knowledge Value Chain was then applied to this process to create a <b>standard</b> <b>tendering</b> process enhanced by Knowledge Management Principles. The model was compared to the processes currently conducted in two Government institutions and two parastals. The findings indicated that the model is well suited for Government Organisations and would assist in the creation of greater transparency, however the practical implementation of the model is yet unlikely as the model suggest electronic access to information, and the process in South African Government Institutions is predominately paper-based...|$|R
50|$|La France was visibly not a GWR engine, {{although}} {{fitted with}} a Swindon chimney and paired with a <b>standard</b> <b>tender,</b> as immediately recognisable from firebox and the cab. Initially the locomotive was painted black, looking more LNWR than GWR, but she was repainted in 1905 into the standard GWR green livery. In contrast to previous GWR practice, La France had two high pressure cylinders fitted between the frames, and two low pressure cylinders outside. The high pressure cylinders drove the front driving wheels while the low pressure cylinders drove the rear driving wheels. Also notable was the external steam pipe mounted {{just in front of}} the dome, and looking rather similar in appearance to a top feed.|$|R
50|$|After {{nationalisation}} two Highland Railway 0-4-4 tank locomotives {{were retained}} for {{service on the}} branch: nos 55051 and 55053, formerly nos 25 and 45. 55051 was withdrawn {{in the summer of}} 1956, but 55053 was overhauled and continued in service. However early in 1957 its leading axle broke while it was hauling a mixed train on the branch. No-one was injured but this was the end of 55053, and an 0-6-0 pannier tank locomotive, no. 1646, was drafted in from the Western Region to take over. A second engine of the 1600 Class, no. 1649, was sent to Helmsdale in July 1958. A British Railways <b>standard</b> <b>tender</b> engine no. 78052 saw occasional work on the line between February 1957 and September 1958.|$|R
50|$|The Class 12 {{locomotives}} {{introduced a}} new Type MP1 tender with a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. This marked {{the introduction of a}} <b>standard</b> <b>tender</b> type which, with few modifications, was eventually to be used on all the Hendrie-designed locomotives. The tender bogies were interchangeable with other tender types operating in the Transvaal and Orange Free State at the time, while its centre longitudinal frame members were carried through unbroken from buffer to buffer. The arrangement of the buffing gear between engine and tender {{was the result of a}} long series of experiments, made with the view to avoid excessive fore and aft action between engine and tender while running at high speed.|$|R
50|$|John E. Wootten {{developed}} the Wootten firebox to effectively burn anthracite waste, {{which was a}} plentiful, cheap source of fuel. Wootten determined that a large, wide firebox would work best. As the successful trailing truck used to support large fireboxes {{had not yet been}} developed, Wootten instead mounted his huge firebox above the locomotive's driving wheels. The problem now arose that with a cab floor at the then <b>standard</b> <b>tender</b> deck height, it would be impossible for the locomotive's engineer to see forwards around the firebox shoulders. Instead, a cab for the engineer was placed above and astride the boiler. The fireman, however, remained at the rear with minimal protection from the elements.

40|$|A {{construction}} project should be administrated systematically {{from its inception}} for successful completion. When a Contractor or a Consultant is selected for a Civil Engineering Project, <b>standard</b> <b>tender</b> procedures are to be followed. When obtaining services for a project an agreement is signed by the Client and the Contractor. This agreement spells out the conditions of contract covering the contract administration requirements. There are standard contracts available so that the parties can use them effectively, easily and efficiently for better results. In Sri Lanka, when public finance is utilised, the Financial Regulations have to be followed in formulating a project. Financial Regulations specify the authority, limits and procedures to be followed when a project is financed by government money. In certain instances standard procedures and Financial Regulations contradict each other thus leading to ambiguity which adversely affect the successful completion of the project. Therefore reviewing of both standard procedures and Financial Regulations {{for the purpose of}} eliminating these differences is of high priority. This research has studied the available <b>Standard</b> <b>Tender</b> Procurement Procedures and Contract Conditions, and has established relevant procedures in tendering and contract administration with due consideration to the practical applications and problems. The research also has identified the Financial Regulations available for the relevant procedures and has established and compared the consistency of Financial Regulations against the established procedures. The research revealed that in activities such as Project Strategy, Evaluation of Tenders, Extensions, Claims, etc., F. RR are not clear or not addressed adequately. In activities such as Approving the Tender Documents, Approving Variations greater than 10 % of the contract value etc., F. RR contradict the established standard procedures. Futhermore getting prior approvels from relevant authorities as per F. RR for activities such as Variations and Valuation, Claims etc., are not practicable at all Finally recommendations were made where necessary on Financial Regulations to streamline both the Tender Procurement Procedure and Contract Administration Procedure...|$|R
50|$|In 1860, the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company took {{delivery}} of eight <b>standard</b> gauge <b>tender</b> locomotives with a 0-4-2 wheel arrangement for {{service on the}} Cape Town-Wellington Railway, which was still under construction.

50|$|They {{were built}} in 1885 as 2-4-0T tank {{locomotives}}, but five were rebuilt in 1890 as 2-4-0 tender locomotives for working express trains between Exeter and Plymouth. They comprised the first ten locomotives of Lot 64, the remainder of which comprised ten similar locomotive Nos. 3511 to 3520 built to the standard gauge.

40|$|AbstractSupport {{schemes for}} {{renewable}} electricity generation (RES-E) have been extensively applied the last decades. European countries have implemented both feed-in tariffs (FITs), renewable portfolio <b>standards</b> (RPS) and <b>tendering</b> schemes for different RES-E technologies. This paper examines {{the impact of}} these policies in the five largest electricity consuming countries in Europe using detailed data spanning 1990 - 2012. Following recent policy impact studies we employ the investment decision model specified by [1] where the share of return on an investment in renewable generation capacity that can be attributed to feed-in tariffs is isolated. Renewable portfolio <b>standards</b> and <b>tendering</b> schemes are also included in the econometric specification. Due to high FIT levels and reduced costs we find that investments in PV and onshore wind power have generally had a high expected return the last years. We conclude that FIT has significantly affected the development of PV and onshore wind in the five countries analyzed in the period 1990 - 2012. The significance of FIT on onshore wind generation contradicts previous findings. Also, it is confirmed that RPS has significantly positive effect on the development of bioenergy for power generation and that the presence of tendering schemes has contributed to the increase of onshore wind power...|$|R
50|$|In 1936 the {{locomotive}} 670.030 was rebuilt with a Franco-Crosti boiler. Articulated ducts carried the combustion gases {{from the main}} boiler to the preheater (placed on a <b>standard</b> bogie <b>tender),</b> and these passed to a chimney {{at the end of}} the tender. Exhaust steam from the cylinders similarly went through articulated ducts to the blastpipe at the rear of the tender, while articulated pipes connected the preheater and main boiler to take water and steam from one to the other. The whole locomotive-tender complex was given a streamlined casing. The locomotive was reclassified FS 672.001 and was subjected to trial runs, which showed a 22 per cent fuel saving compared to other Class 671 locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|The gold {{certificate}} was used from 1863 to 1933 (although {{there is the}} rare 1934 issue) in the United States {{as a form of}} paper currency. Each certificate gave its holder title to a corresponding amount of gold coin at the statutory rate of $20.67 per troy ounce established by the Coinage Act of 1834. Therefore, this type of paper currency was intended to represent actual gold coinage. In 1933 the practice of redeeming these notes for gold coins was ended by the U.S. government and until 1964 it was actually illegal to possess these notes. (In 1964 these restrictions were lifted, primarily to allow collectors to own examples legally; however the issue technically converted to <b>standard</b> legal <b>tender</b> with no connection to gold.) ...|$|R
50|$|The boiler of the Class 690 was {{replaced}} by the one fitted on the Class 746 locomotives; the trailing axle {{was replaced}} by a Bissel truck, to sustain the weight of the new, larger firebox, and a Nielebock-Knorr pre-heater was added. The 33 locomotives were rebuilt, part by the FS workshops, and part by the Ernesto Breda company.Initially they would have received the same tender designed for the Class 695, but in the end an enlarged version of the <b>standard</b> FS bogie <b>tender</b> was fitted.|$|R
