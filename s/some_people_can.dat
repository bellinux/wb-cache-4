25|$|There are {{two methods}} of encoding/remembering music. The first process {{is known as}} {{relative}} pitch, which refers to a person's ability to identify the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> also use absolute pitch in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an external standard. Relative pitch has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce physiological responses, for example, if the melody violates the learned relative pitch. Relative pitch {{has been shown to}} develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of relative pitch than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this could be because the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience.|$|E

Then in 1978 Michel Pollentier was disqualified from the Tour de France after {{cheating}} a drugs test {{on the afternoon}} that he took the race lead. He left the team {{at the end of}} the season and started his own, with a new backer, Splendor. Both Maertens and Pollentier wanted Kelly. Pollentier and Splendor offered Kelly more and made him a team leader. But Splendor was new and logistic problems became obvious. The bikes were in poor state– enough that Splendor decided not to ride Paris–Roubaix– and the manager, Robert Lauwers, was replaced. Kelly rose above it and rode for himself. The writer Robin Magowan said: <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> do business on the committee system; others find that life is only fun when you are running the show. In Kelly's case it was to mean working for the collection of underpaid has-beens that de Gribaldy habitually assembled. But a smaller, less pretentious team can have its advantages for a rider of Kelly's sort. When you don't have to compete for a team's loyalty you can concentrate on winning races, and that's exactly what Kelly proceeded to do.|$|E

500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite.
