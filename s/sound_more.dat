5|$|When voicing child characters, {{the voice}} actors speak within their normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection. The {{recorded}} audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered {{to make the}} voice <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> {{like that of a}} fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was {{recorded}} in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> psychedelic. Stylistically the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman sound like English voiced stops and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g. Fortis stops, however, <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> like voiceless stops in English, but are slightly longer than lenis stops. They are written with two voiceless letters, pp, tt and kk when they occur between two vowels.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} Kenny's speech is {{achieved}} by Stone mumbling into his own hand as he provides Kenny's lines, while the recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> {{like that of a}} fourth grader. As the technique of Kenny's muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane and sexually explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.|$|E
5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the album {{is similar to that}} of their debut, with four original songs and three rearranged covers, although the tracks are longer, the arrangements more complex and the <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> polished than on Shades of Deep Purple. The music style is a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock and hard rock, with several inserts of classical music arranged by the band's keyboard player Jon Lord.|$|E
5000|$|Kevin {{came from}} Bandung , West Java [...] The {{origin of the}} name Kevin (<b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like a name given to a boy) because first, Kevin's parents wanted a boy. To add a sense of women, it is added Lilliana name that <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> feminine. And the {{opposite}} of her sister, brother Kevin-sex male named Audi Danendra, where the usual Audi name reserved for a female name.|$|R

5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a bright green ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Newman recollaborated with Stanton on WALL-E {{since the}} two got along well on Nemo, which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, {{in the hope that}} {{starting}} this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged {{for the first time in}} October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to make it <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too.|$|E

25|$|Several of Cobb's {{stories were}} adapted as silent movies. He also wrote the screen titles for other movies, {{including}} the Jackie Coogan movie, Peck's Bad Boy (1921). With {{the advent of}} <b>sound,</b> <b>more</b> of his stories were adapted for the screen, including The Woman Accused (1933), featuring young Cary Grant.|$|E
25|$|In another damper technique—half pedaling—the player {{depresses}} {{the pedal}} {{just enough to}} remove the spring pressure from the bars, {{but not enough to}} make the pad lose contact with the bars. This lets the bars ring slightly longer than with the pad fully up and can make a medium-fast passage <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> legato without pedaling every note.|$|E

25|$|Cajun {{music is}} rooted in the music of the preexisting Creoles and the French-speaking Catholics of eastern Canada and became {{transformed}} into a unique sound of the Cajun culture. In earlier years of the late 18th century the fiddle was the predominant instrument and the music tended to <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> like early country music. Cajun music is typically a waltz or two step. Unlike the folk music of Quebec, it is not associated with the Celtic tradition.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Sephardim still often carry common Spanish surnames, as well {{as other}} {{specifically}} Sephardic surnames from 15th century Spain with Arabic or Hebrew language origins (such as Azoulay, Abulafia, Abravanel) which have since disappeared from Spain when those that stayed behind as conversos adopted surnames that were solely Spanish in origin. Other Eastern Sephardim have since also translated their Hispanic surnames into the languages of the regions they settled in, or have modified them to <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> local.|$|E
25|$|Lieber {{was one of}} four {{children}} of Clara and Abraham Rosenberg. Her brothers were Denver publisher Joseph Rosenberg, psychiatrist Aaron Rosanoff, and chemist Martin André Rosanoff. Aaron and Martin changed their names to <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> Russian, less Jewish. Lieber moved to the US with her family in 1891. She received her BA from Barnard College in 1908, her MA from Columbia University in 1911, and her PhD from Clark University in 1914. She married Hugh Gray Lieber in 1926.|$|E

25|$|The L-variant {{may be used}} in songs, movies, soap operas, sitcoms {{and other}} {{television}} shows, although, at times, the H-variant is used in historic films or soap operas to make the language used <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> ‘elegant’ or ‘archaic’. There is a claim that the H-variant used to be preferred when dubbing foreign films and series into Brazilian Portuguese, but nowadays the L-variant is preferred, although this seems to lack evidence. Movie subtitles normally use a mixture of L- and H-variants, but remain closer to the H-variant.|$|E
25|$|Dimon {{was born}} in New York City, to {{children}} of Greek immigrants Theodore and Themis (née Kalos) Dimon. One of three sons, he is of Greek descent and Greek Orthodox and attended The Browning School in his youth. His paternal grandfather was a Greek immigrant who changed the family name from Papademetriou to Dimon to make it <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> French, {{and worked as a}} banker in Smyrna and Athens. He has an older brother, Peter, and a fraternal twin brother, Ted. Dimon's father and grandfather were both stockbrokers at Shearson.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a fourth}} type of pickup under a P-90 cover, {{referred}} to as a large mini-humbucker. These, however, are not intended to mimic the sound of a P-90. Like all side-by-side humbuckers, they have lower hum levels. This configuration operates {{in the same way as}} a humbucker: both coils individually respond to string vibrations, but since the two coils have a reversed magnetic polarity, the signal from both coils is added, while the hum is effectively canceled. Consequently, these types of pickups <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> like a humbucker than a P-90.|$|E
