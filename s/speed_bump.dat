40|$|Ankarafantsika National Park, one of {{the largest}} and last {{remaining}} sections of dry deciduous forest in Madagascar, is filled with critically endangered and endemic species. A major highway bisects the park. Road kill continues to be a problem facing park management. In 2007 two <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> were constructed along the highway system inside the park. While it is assumed that <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> decrease incidence of road kill by slowing vehicles, no studies have conclusively determined that <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> protect wildlife. This project analyzes data collected from 2005 to 2007 to determine if <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> reduced the amount of road kill inside the park. The <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> were found to substantially reduce the amount of road kill across all faunal classes. The fact that reductions in road kill occurred along the entire road suggests that the <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> might act as psychological deterrent as well as a physical obstacle...|$|R
25|$|Although <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> are {{effective}} in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial—as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle (often found in private car parks) can be disruptive for drivers, and {{may be difficult to}} navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars have this problem with such <b>speed</b> <b>bumps.</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>bumps</b> can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. <b>Speed</b> <b>bumps</b> cost $50–200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.|$|R
40|$|It may be {{that project}} {{managers}} are looking in the wrong places to find improvements.

25|$|Speed {{bumps in}} some areas have been removed after protests by local residents. Such protests cite {{the lack of any}} {{consultation}} as one factor.

25|$|As such, {{vehicles}} {{that do not}} qualify, have their times mentioned, but do not get included on the Lapboard.

Whenever a non-qualifying vehicle is raced, the time is compared to the official Power Laps but then removed from the board, for example - the Ferrari FXX owned by Michael Schumacher (1:10.7) was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern men tend {{to believe in the}} principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually live up to that belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new <b>speed</b> <b>bump</b> that is a little bit higher than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of pain on travelling over <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> for {{the diagnosis of}} acute appendicitis. DESIGN: Prospective questionnaire based diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Secondary care surgical assessment unit at a district general hospital in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 101 patients aged 17 - 76 years referred to the on-call surgical team for assessment of possible appendicitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for pain over <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> in diagnosing appendicitis, with histological diagnosis of appendicitis as the reference standard. RESULTS: The analysis included 64 participants who had travelled over <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> on their journey to hospital. Of these, 34 had a confirmed histological diagnosis of appendicitis, 33 of whom reported increased pain over <b>speed</b> <b>bumps.</b> The sensitivity was 97 % (95 % confidence interval 85 % to 100 %), and the specificity was 30 % (15 % to 49 %). The positive predictive value was 61 % (47 % to 74 %), and the negative predictive value was 90 % (56 % to 100 %). The likelihood ratios were 1. 4 (1. 1 to 1. 8) for a positive test result and 0. 1 (0. 0 to 0. 7) for a negative result. <b>Speed</b> <b>bumps</b> had a better sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio than did other clinical features assessed, including migration of pain and rebound tenderness. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of pain while travelling over <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> was {{associated with an increased}} likelihood of acute appendicitis. As a diagnostic variable, it compared favourably with other features commonly used in clinical assessment. Asking about <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> may contribute to clinical assessment and could be useful in telephone assessment of patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Finding the use {{of roads}} as smooth as {{possible}} and a maximum security prompted the Cameroonian authorities to build {{an infinite number of}} <b>speed</b> <b>bumps.</b> The lack of standards in this area in the country led to an anarchic system of the latter, which is not without consequences. It appears from this study two major problems: the problems of materials and those related to traffic signing Regarding materials, the 92 % of asphalt concrete <b>speed</b> <b>bumps,</b> 50 % are either collapsed or padded; about 7 % of <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> armed concrete, 70 % do not meet the standard dimensions and about 1 % <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> paved, are essentially trays and have defects either to poor implementation, or the poor quality of material used. As for traffic signing, 62 % of the problems are caused either by their absence or the wrong traffic signing, 23 % are due to the design (non-respect of dimensions with diversity forms) and 15 % are due to implantation (bad choice of location). Discussed in this paper is to draw the attention of authorities by conducting a study on the critical <b>speed</b> <b>bumps</b> built throughout the triangle Yaounde-Douala-Yaounde-Bafoussam. Proposals have been made both in terms of design, the location of traffic signing. 45...|$|R
