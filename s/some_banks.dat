Most banks also enable a customer to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (<b>some</b> <b>banks</b> charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). <b>Some</b> <b>banks</b> also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software.

25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this, {{one of which is}} the lax {{attitude}} <b>some</b> <b>banks</b> have adopted because of the years of “good times.” The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in {{a significant impact on the}} bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, these created {{problems}} for <b>some</b> <b>banks</b> {{as the high}} inflation of that period resulted in them borrowing money at higher rates than they could lend it. In response to this asset liability mismatch, libertarians and free-market advocates called for interest rate caps to be increased or repealed entirely as an unreasonable restriction on market forces. Bills to do so were introduced in Congress and some state legislatures. Some succeeded in the former goal, but those that sought to eliminate interest rate caps entirely failed.|$|E

25|$|Associated Press {{reported}} that {{in response to the}} costs that the legislation places on banks, <b>some</b> <b>banks</b> have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking. Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, calling attention to the new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the mortgage market due to increased risk. One study has shown that smaller banks have been hurt by the regulations of the Dodd–Frank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.|$|E

[...] Numismatic writer David Lange pointed out that the collecting of recent coins in rolls peaked in 1964, and believed the coin collecting hobby's blame for the shortage unfair.|$|E
500|$|As Gateshead {{expanded}} southward to {{meet the}} village, Low Fell became a residential suburb of Gateshead but one which has, through its atypical development, has retained a rural village character. In 1897, the first shops were built on Durham Road. These expanded substantially so that by 1939 the villagers were able to forgo travel to nearby Gateshead for commercial purposes. Today the Durham Road area is [...] "a vibrant commercial hub with thriving shops, bars and restaurants" [...] as well as <b>some</b> <b>banks</b> and small offices. These now act as the principle commercial centre for the area [...] though the townscape in this area varies greatly and the unsympathetic development at the crest of Albert Drive in the 1960s is uncommon and has been said to detract from the suburb.
