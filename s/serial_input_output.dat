5000|$|Zilog {{introduced}} {{a number of}} peripheral parts for the Z80, which all supported the Z80's interrupt handling system and I/O address space. These included the Counter/Timer Channel (CTC), the SIO (<b>Serial</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Output),</b> the DMA (Direct Memory Access), the PIO (Parallel Input-Output) and the DART (Dual Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter). As the product line developed, low-power, high-speed and CMOS versions of these chips were produced.Like the 8080, 8085 and 8086 processors, but unlike processors such as the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502, the Z80 and 8080 had a separate control line and address space for I/O instructions. While some Z80-based computers such as the Osborne 1 used [...] "Motorola-style" [...] memory mapped input/output devices, usually the I/O space was used to address {{one of the many}} Zilog peripheral chips compatible with the Z80. Zilog I/O chips supported the Z80's new mode 2 interrupts which simplified interrupt handling for large numbers of peripherals.|$|E

The receive clock may have been recovered from the data by the serial clock recovery technique. However, SerDes which do not transmit a clock use reference clock to lock the PLL to the correct Tx frequency, avoiding low harmonic frequencies present in the data stream. The SIPO block then divides the incoming clock down to the parallel rate. Implementations typically have two registers connected as a double buffer. One register is used to clock in the serial stream, {{and the other is}} used to hold the data for the slower, parallel side.|$|R

The objective of this project is to design and implement a baseband of MB-OFDM transmitter on FPGA hardware which provides very high speed for application.
