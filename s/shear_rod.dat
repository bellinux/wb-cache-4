40|$|One {{laboratory}} technique {{to determine the}} unit side resistance of piles is the <b>rod</b> <b>shear</b> test. In a <b>rod</b> <b>shear</b> test a model pile is placed inside a cylindrical soil specimen. A confining pressure is then placed around the specimen/pile assembly and the model pile axially loaded. In some cases <b>rod</b> <b>shear</b> tests in sands have produced anomalously high interface friction angles (δ) which may be, at least in part, {{due to differences in}} how the normal stress on the model pile has been interpreted. Therefore, the usefulness of the <b>rod</b> <b>shear</b> test as a means to determine interface behavior for pile design is questionable. In this study, a new <b>rod</b> <b>shear</b> device was constructed to determine the behavior of steel-sand interfaces, and a numerical model was used to further evaluate the results. The interfaces tested were smooth and rough model piles in dense and loose sand. Results for the smooth pile tests are consistent with published values. However, tests with the dense and loose sands using rough piles produced interface friction values that were, in some instances, higher than the dilatant friction angle (φ(d)) for the sand at comparable stress levels. Elastic and elasto-plastic (modified Cam-clay) models failed to predict the high interface friction angles. Therefore it is suggested that the <b>rod</b> <b>shear</b> test imposes heretofore unrecognized kinematic restraints to volume change that, coupled with the discrete nature of the sand, lead {{to the development of a}} complex arching system The result is that effective normal stress on the pile is increased beyond the applied confining pressure. Evidence for such behavior included the observation of secondary features in the dense sand following pile displacement, the existence of force chains and work with discrete element systems showing that stress distribution in dense arrays is nonuniform...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} to be a supplement to ORNL/TM- 12398, Steady-State Thermal-Hydraulic Design Analysis of the Advanced Neutron Source Reactor. It updates the core thermal-hydrualic design to the latest three-element configuration and also provides the most recent information on the thermal-hydraulic statistical uncertainty analysis. In addition, it includes calculations of beam tube cooling and control rod lift forces, which were not addressed in the initial report. This report describes work that is a snapshot in time as it stood {{at the end of the}} project. The three-element core calculations include a description of changes made to the overall coolant system; however, most of the analysis is focused on fuel loading thermal-hydraulic calculations. This analysis uses updated uncertainty values and indicates that a two-dimensional fuel grading in the three-element core would still be necessary to meet the desired operating and safety criteria. Analysis of cooling in the reflector tank examines various cooling options for the reflector tank components. This work investigated multiple forced convection designs as well as natural convection cooling requirements. Lift forces on the inner control rods caused by the upward coolant flow were also examined. Initial control rod designs were such that a <b>sheared</b> control <b>rod</b> would tend to lift because of flow forces. Design changes were recommended that would eliminate this issue. They included geometry changes to the inner control rod cooling channels, changes to the orificing in the central hole region, and reduction of inner control rod coolant velocity...|$|R

To our knowledge they are the first such single-crystal ultrasonic measurements on a high-pressure phase recovered from the multi-anvil press. The cubic single-crystal elastic constants of hydrous Fo 89 ringwoodite at ambient conditions are (in GPa) : c 11 = 298 ± 13, c 44 = 112 ± 6, and c 12 = 115 ± 6. Hydration of Fo∼ 90 ringwoodite to 1 wt. % H 2 O reduces the adiabatic bulk (K 0 S = 176 ± 7 GPa) and shear (G = 103 ± 5 GPa) moduli by about 6 and 13 %, roughly equivalent to raising the temperature at room pressure by 600 and 1000 ◦C, respectively. Assuming a linear trend with hydration, we calculate that P-and S-wave velocities are reduced by about 40 m/s for every 1000 ppm weight (0. 1 wt. %) H 2 O added to Fo∼ 90 ringwoodite.

The Hanford slugs were then placed in the Heald machine, which cuts the slugs to desired lengths and finishes and radiuses the ends. The Savannah River slugs were reduced to exact dimensions of size, surface, and straightness on a centerless grinder after which a contour was placed on the surface by a thread rolling machine. The slugs were numbered and put on a basket on a conveyor that passes through a degreasing tank, pickling tank, two rinse tanks and a hot air dryer before depositing the slug basket in the Inspection Department.

40|$|Debris flow poses {{significant}} {{threat to}} property and human life mainly {{as a result}} of its high sediment concentrations and mobility. For the purpose of predicting debris flow mobility and mitigating potential damage, considerable attention has been drawn to the development of debris flow physical models. Despite of the achievements, a thorough mechanism accounting for the built-up and maintaining of pore pressure within the shearing layer of debris flow has not been made available mainly due to the lack of experiment data. In viewing of that situation this study developed a coaxial-cylinder apparatus and conducted two series of tests concerning pore pressure built-up in samples of varying solid fraction concentration (by volume) and fine grain content (by weight) at differing rotational velocity. The first series of tests show that when solid fraction concentration increase from 20 % to 50 %, pore pressure built-up tends to be higher. The second series of tests exhibit that similar pattern can apply except for samples with 80 % and 100 % silt content. This peculiarity together with grain size analyses before and after experiment give rise to a postulation that mixing <b>rods</b> <b>shearing</b> may be responsible for the constant pore pressure built-up, while «most breakable grain sizes may exist and have led to the extraordinarily low peak values and prolonged decline in samples with rich silt content through dilatancy. Nonlinear relationship between pore pressure built-up and rotational velocity was found in all tests. Initial stagnation and transitional stage were observed for most samples; plausible explanations have been proposed. Owing to some limitations, future work is expected on the microscopic mechanism of sediment dilatancy, the properties of «most breakable grain sizes and practical application...|$|R

The main objective of this program is to experimentally and analytically study the FRP strengthening methods of full-scale RC T-section beams in shear. During this Ph.
