Using monthly data from the period 1974 - 1996, {{the results show that}} both price series follow a random walk and that these oil markets share a long-run common trend. The empirical results suggest that the two markets are 'unified'. That is, they are competitive, and there is price convergence in the markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{cycles of}} soil water content cause {{shrinking}} and swelling in clay soils that can in turn contribute to strain-softening and progressive failure. This paper presents and analyses {{six years of}} field measurements of soil water content and pore water pressures in the upper layers of a lightly vegetated London Clay <b>slope</b> near Newbury, <b>UK.</b> The field observations are set {{in the context of}} a 40 year run of rainfall data for the site. Moderately extreme rainfall and drought events were experienced over the period 2003 - 2008, allowing almost the full variation in likely pore water pressures to be characterised. Pore water pressures were found to return to near hydrostatic during most winters. Variations in summer rainfall, particularly during June-August, are shown to have a large influence on the magnitude of the cycles of pore water pressure and effective stress. The 40 year rainfall dataset is used to calculate approximate return periods for the observed soil conditions and provides a benchmark for calculating the impacts of expected climate change on similar sites...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} no systematic approach {{for the evaluation}} of shallow, weathering-related breakdown of excavated rockslopes. The ad hoc approach often adopted to assess this type of rockslope deterioration gives rise to unplanned resource requirements or, alternatively, results in resource wastage because of over-design or excessive and unnecessary monitoring and inspection. A field investigation of over 200 <b>slopes</b> in the <b>UK</b> found deterioration to be widespread in excavated road cuts and disused quarry slopes. Deterioration is manifest in a range of erosional processes, which are classified according to constituent material size, relative velocity of movement and frequency of occurrence. These erosional processes correlate well with the type of rock mass in which they occur and result in a range of distinctive small-scale erosional and depositional slope forms. A new, three stage approach to slope hazard assessment, Rockslope Deterioration Assessment (RDA), is proposed, which addresses shallow, small-scale weathering-related erosion of rockslopes. In RDA stage one, rockslope susceptibility to deterioration is assessed via the application of ratings to intrinsic and extrinsic influences and controls on deterioration. In stage two, the nature of the likely deterioration hazard is qualitatively reviewed with reference to rock mass type and slope morphology. In stage three, guidance on appropriate mitigation is provided, based on the findings of stages one and two. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} row of {{discrete}} vertical piles is an established method, successfully used to remediate failure of existing slopes and to stabilise potentially unstable slopes created by widening transport corridors. This paper challenges the assumptions made in current design procedures for these piles, which treat the pile only as an additional force or moment and simplify soil–pile interaction. Two-dimensional plane-strain finite-element analyses were performed to simulate the excavation of a slope in a stiff clay and the interaction of vertical piles within the slope. A non-local strain-softening model was employed for the stiff clay to reduce the mesh dependency of the solution. An extensive parametric study was performed to systematically {{examine the impact of}} pile position, dimensions (length and diameter) and time of pile construction on the stability of a cutting in London Clay, which was chosen as a representative strain-softening material. A variety of different failure mechanisms were identified, depending on pile location, dimensions and time of construction. The variability of the pile and slope interaction that was modelled suggests that an oversimplification during design could miss the critical failure mechanism or provide a conservative stabilisation solution. Given the prevalence of stiff clay <b>slopes</b> in the <b>UK,</b> increased capacity requirements of transport infrastructure and the age of slopes in this material, an informed and more realistic design of stabilisation piles will become increasingly necessary...|$|R
40|$|In {{the broad}} {{spectrum}} of natural hazards, landslides in particular are capable of changing the landscape and causing significant human and economic losses. Detailed site investigations form an important component in the landslide risk mitigation and disaster risk reduction process. These investigations usually rely on surface ob- servations, discrete sampling of the subsurface, and laboratory testing to examine properties that are deemed representative of entire slopes. Often this requires extensive interpolations and results in large uncertainties. To compliment and extend these approaches, we present a study from an active landslide in a Lias Group clay <b>slope,</b> North Yorkshire, <b>UK,</b> examining combined P- and S-wave seismic refraction tomography (SRT) {{as a means of}} providing subsurface volumetric imaging of geotechnical proxies. The distributions of seismic wave velocities determined fromSRT at the study site indicated zones with higher porosity and fissure density that are interpreted to represent the extent and depth of mass movements and weathered bedrock zones. Distinguishing the lithological units was facilitated by deriving the Poisson's ratio fromthe SRT data as saturated clay and partially saturated sandy silts showed distinctively different Poisson's ra- tios. Shear and Young's moduli derived from the SRT data revealed the weak nature of the materials in active parts of the landslide (i. e. 25 kPa and 100 kPa respectively). The SRT results are consistent with intrusive (i. e. cone penetration tests), laboratory, and additional geoelectrical data from this site. This study shows that SRT forms a cost-effective method that can significantly reduce uncertainties in the conceptual ground model of geotechnical and hydrological conditions that govern landslide dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a number of}} key challenges in current subjective well-being (SWB) research: A new wave of studies should take into account that different things may make different people happy, thus going beyond a unitary 'happiness formula'. Furthermore, empirical results need to be connected to broader theoretical narratives. Using a re-examination of the social context of well-being as its case study, this article therefore resorts to sociological theory and fills a gap by investigating how social capital is correlated in different ways with the SWB of men, women, parents, and non-parents. Ordered logit and OLS regression analyses systematically examine <b>slope</b> heterogeneity using <b>UK</b> data from the European Social Survey. It turns out that civic engagement is not at all associated with higher life satisfaction for mothers, while the relationship is positive for men and strongest for childless women. Moreover, informal socialising is positively and more strongly associated with life satisfaction among women, although only when OLS is used. In sum, the social context of well-being varies considerably by gender and parental status. Mothers do not seem to benefit from formal social capital, indicating a "motherhood penalty" (see Correll et al., Am J Sociol 112 (5) : 1297 - 1338 in 2007) regarding the psychological rewards usually associated with volunteering. Given the high levels of formal social capital among mothers, the findings also highlight the importance of the homo sociologicus concept. Consequently, SWB research can be successfully used to provide new insights into long-standing interdisciplinary theory debates such as the one on homo economicus versus homo sociologicus...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Failure of slopes adjacent to the UK transport infrastructure causes delays and these are expensive assets to repair and maintain. Understanding the processes that lead to failure will assist asset managers both {{now and in the}} future in the context of a changing climate. The EPSRC-funded multidisciplinary FUTURENET project investigated the effect of climate change on the resilience of the UK transport network and this thesis is a part of that project considering the weather patterns leading to slope failures along transport infrastructure <b>slopes</b> within the <b>UK.</b> To that end a series of slope failure case studies were investigated to understand the processes leading to failure. These were compiled using nationally held datasets as well as news reports. This research used data from the FUTURENET partners that hold national data sets and asset management information. This shows the wide reaching remit of a multidisciplinary collaborative project such as FUTURENET, but also highlights the limitations of datasets collected and used for very specific purposes and not necessarily suited to wider research. From these case studies a suite of slope failure weather thresholds were developed. These thresholds consider the antecedent period, water content within the slope through the soil moisture deficit and triggering rainfall through comparison to the long term average rainfall. Consideration was given to possible future weather using weather event sequences (WESQs), possible weather patterns for 2050 derived from the UKCP 09 climate projection data. By considering these possible weather patterns with the slope failure thresholds a picture of a possible future was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{microclimate}} {{of plants}} growing {{close to the}} ground is strongly influenced by the orientation of a soil/vegetation surface with respect to the sun's rays (slope and aspect). In chalk grassland in the <b>UK,</b> <b>slopes</b> of contrasting aspect frequently have distinctive patterns of vegetation. A series of climatic and microclimatic measurements were made at field sites indifferent regions on the English chalk (North Dorset and the Yorkshire Wolds) during the period June 2000 to September 2002. Using digital terrain models (DTMs), process-based models of microclimatic variables at different points in the landscape were developed. The mechanisms through which topography may influence vegetation and species distribution were investigated with field experiments and measurements. Both existing vegetation data from Perring (1956) and new data collected from the field sites were analysed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and generalised additive models (GAMs), to elucidate the relationships between vegetation and soil, topography and climate. A consistent gradient in chalk grassland vegetation was found across spatial scales, associated with the frequency of species with a "stress tolerant” strategy. This gradient in vegetation is apparently driven by species' responses to several separate, but often correlated, variables including soil moisture, maximum summer temperatures and soil fertility. Over the past 50 years, stress tolerant species have declined in frequency at the North Dorset field site, Ellenberg fertility indices have increased and light indices have decreased. The observed changes are consistent with fertilization from atmospheric N deposition and/or relaxation of rabbit grazing after the myxomatosis outbreak in the 1950 s. Plots on sloping ground, and in particular, south-west facing slopes, were least affected by these changes, suggesting that high temperatures, phosphorus and water limitation have acted as a buffer against vegetation change, and that complex topography creates refuges for stress tolerant species in the landscape.

40|$|Feed samples {{received}} by commercial analytical laboratories are often undefined or mixed varieties of forages, originate from various agronomic or geographical {{areas of the}} world, are mixtures (e. g., total mixed rations) and are often described incompletely or not at all. Six unified single equation approaches to predict the metabolizable energy (ME) value of feeds determined in sheep fed at maintenance ME intake were evaluated utilizing 78 individual feeds representing 17 different forages, grains, protein meals and by-product feedstuffs. The predictive approaches evaluated were two each from National Research Council [National Research Council (NRC), Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle, seventh revised ed. National Academy Press, Washington, DC, USA, 2001], University of California at Davis (UC Davis) and ADAS (Stratford, <b>UK).</b> <b>Slopes</b> and intercepts for the two ADAS approaches that utilized in vitro digestibility of organic matter and either measured gross energy (GE), or a prediction of GE from component assays, and one UC Davis approach, based upon in vitro gas production and some component assays, differed from both unity and zero, respectively, while {{this was not the}} case for the two NRC and one UC Davis approach. However, within these latter three approaches, the goodness of fit (r(2)) increased from the NRC approach utilizing lignin (0. 61) to the NRC approach utilizing 48 h in vitro digestion of neutral detergent fibre (NDF: 0. 72) and to the UC Davis approach utilizing a 30 h in vitro digestion of NDF (0. 84). The reason for the difference between the precision of the NRC procedures was the failure of assayed lignin values to accurately predict 48 h in vitro digestion of NDF. However, differences among the six predictive approaches in the number of supporting assays, and their costs, as well as that the NRC approach is actually three related equations requiring categorical description of feeds (making them unsuitable for mixed feeds) while the ADAS and UC Davis approaches are single equations, suggests that the procedure of choice will vary dependent Upon local conditions, specific objectives and the feedstuffs to be evaluated. In contrast to the evaluation of the procedures among feedstuffs, no procedure was able to consistently discriminate the ME values of individual feeds within feedstuffs determined in vivo, suggesting that the quest for an accurate and precise ME predictive approach among and within feeds, may remain to be identified.

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Climate change is predicted to have a global effect on temperatures and precipitation rates throughout the world. The UK Climate projections expect that in the United Kingdom this will lead to warmer, drier summers and wetter winters, where events of extreme rainfall are more common. These changes are expected to impact on slope hydrology, and concurrently slope stability. In the United Kingdom this impact {{is expected to be}} negative, whereas in other countries, such as Italy and France it could lead to slopes being more stable. Infrastructure <b>slopes</b> in the <b>UK</b> range in age and construction quality, they are susceptible to serviceability problems, characterised by heterogeneous material properties and can fail unexpectedly due to progressive reduction in soil shear strength. In this thesis the effects of climate change on a highway cutting in the south of England are modelled, using numerical methods. A finite element model is created and developed in the software package GeoStudio VADOSE/W. The model has been validated against observed pore water pressure trends and magnitudes and is shown to be able to accurately replicate the behaviour. By incorporating the effects of desiccation cracking on the soil s material properties, by the means of bimodal soil water characteristic curve and hydraulic conductivity function, the replication of these trends is improved even further. A series of future climate series were created using the UKCP 09 Weather Generator 2. 0. These series were implemented with the VADOSE/W model as climate boundary conditions and models were run, and the results compared to control, current climate results. The results were investigated by the means of statistical analyses which revealed that climate change will have some significant effects on the slope s hydrology, increasing magnitudes of evapotranspiration greatly which can have further significant effects on the magnitude of suctions developing in the slope throughout the summer. It is thought that the results suggest that climate change will not have significant negative effects on slope stability. However {{it is important to remember}} that the results only apply with certainty to the specific slope and climate change scenario investigated here. The methods used and developed within this thesis can be extended to other locations, in the UK and internationally, analysing the effects of different climate change scenarios...|$|R
