Come down, Ospakar: come down from that <b>soft</b> <b>seat</b> of thine and here and now let us {{put it to the}} proof who is the better man.

60|$|One of the {{soldiers}} brought a large truss of straw, and another a bundle of firewood. The blanket {{at the end of}} the tent sheltered from the wind, was drawn aside, and a great fire speedily blazed up at the entrance. The straw was shaken out to form a <b>soft</b> <b>seat,</b> just inside the tent. All three produced their pipes and lit them, while the doctor's servant prepared over the fire a sort of soup with the rations. This turned out to be by no means bad, and when after it the boys produced one of their bottles of brandy and three cigars, the Russian doctor patted them on the back, and evidently told them that they were first-rate fellows.|$|E
60|$|Long {{after two}} miles had been covered, and I {{had begun to}} {{associate}} Jim's biscuits with a certain <b>soft</b> <b>seat</b> near a ruddy fire, I was apparently still the same distance from my landmark crag. Suddenly a slight noise brought me to a halt. I listened intently. Only an indistinct rattling of small rocks disturbed the impressive stillness. It {{might have been the}} weathering that goes on constantly, and it might have been an animal. I inclined to the former idea till I saw Satan's ears go up. Jones had told me to watch the ears of my horse, and short as had been my acquaintance with Satan, I had learned that he always discovered things more quickly than I. So I waited patiently.|$|E
60|$|A {{bundle of}} lavender, or a truss of new-mown hay, {{could not have}} been more sweet to carry and there was {{something}} electric about the touch of her, which went through and through me. Very soon it was over, and we were out of the cave into the full glory of the tropical sun. At first, that her eyes might become accustomed to its light and her awakened body to its heat, I set her down where shadow fell from the overhanging rock, in a canvas deck chair that had been brought by Marama with the other things, throwing the rug about her to protect her from such wind as there was. She nestled gratefully into the <b>soft</b> <b>seat</b> and shut her eyes, for the motion had tired her. I noted, however, that she drew in the sweet air with long breaths.|$|E

6000|$|In {{giving an}} account of the arrival of Lady Lillycraft at the Hall, I ought to have {{mentioned}} the entertainment which I derived from witnessing the unpacking of her carriage, and the disposing of her retinue. There is something extremely amusing to me in the number of factitious wants, the loads of imaginary conveniences, but real encumbrances, with which the luxurious are apt to burthen themselves. I like to watch the whimsical stir and display about one of these petty progresses. The number of robustious footmen and retainers of all kinds bustling about, with looks of infinite gravity and importance, to do almost nothing. The number of heavy trunks, and parcels, and bandboxes belonging to my lady; and the solicitude, exhibited about some humble, odd-looking box, by my lady's maid; the cushions piled in the carriage to make a <b>soft</b> <b>seat</b> still softer, and to prevent the dreaded possibility of a jolt; the smelling-bottles, the cordials, the baskets of biscuit and fruit; the new publications; all provided to guard against hunger, fatigue, or ennui; the led horses, to vary the mode of travelling; and all this preparation and parade to move, perhaps, some very good-for-nothing personage about a little space of earth! ...|$|E
