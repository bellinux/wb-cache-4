5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a <b>simple</b> <b>fact.</b> This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E

5|$|During the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election Karmal {{was one of}} four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were Anahita Ratebzad, Nur Ahmed Nur and Fezanul Haq Fezan. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by historians that Andrianjaka did indeed succeed {{to the throne}} around 1610 or 1612 after his older brother's claim {{was rejected by the}} public. All speculation about fanorona and royal summons aside, Ralambo may have chosen Andrianjaka based on the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that {{he was the son of}} Ralambo's first wife. Ralambo's father, Andriamanelo, had established rules of succession by which Ralambo's first son by his first wife must rule after his father in order to fulfill a mandate established by his Vazimba antecedents Rafohy and Rangita. The passing over of Andriantompokoindrindra in favor of his younger brother was partially mitigated by the establishment of a royal tradition maintaining that all reigning descendants of Andrianjaka would henceforth be required to marry a princess directly descended from Andriantompokoindrindra, thereby preserving the royal status of descendants in both brothers' bloodlines.|$|E

5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

25|$|Andrei had two brothers. The {{younger brother}} Nicolae Folberth, {{worked for the}} Ford Factory in Romania and for just the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> of being German nationality, was {{deported}} by the Romanian authorities, after the Second World War to Russia, as a so-called compensation for the war damages. After spending 5 years (1945-1950) in several labor camps {{in the region of}} Donbas, he returned to Romania trying to forget the big injustice. Getting his old job back, he was also part of the football team of the Factory. Weakened after the labor years, he died on the football field after he was severely faulted.|$|E
25|$|Note that Opel prices {{appear to}} be {{inherently}} higher than Ford ones. A common mistake {{in a lot of}} examples trying to prove that VAT rebates form as a trade barrier is, to set retail prices equal for both Ford and Opel. This way, prices are initially equal, but become different after all the additional VAT taxes and rebates described below. Such an approach {{does not take into account}} the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that Opel prices in the table above always include VAT while Ford prices never include it. That's exactly why additional adjustments are made in VAT taxation.|$|E
25|$|England's group {{games in}} the World Cup 2011 were watched by up to four million viewers on German television, but less than a million on BBC, which means even with no German involvement, England games are at this point more popular in Germany than in the country the England team {{actually}} represents. Observers do not lead this gap in popularity back {{to a lack of}} gender equality in England, but to the <b>simple</b> <b>fact,</b> that the German women's team is far more successful, and therefore women's football is in the focus of media coverage in Germany.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with its}} {{assistance}} {{in developing the}} new Saigon campus and teaching classes, MSUG was instrumental in a substantial expansion of the NIA library, which by 1962 held more than 22,000 books and other documents. The library {{was considered one of}} MSUG's greatest successes, and the NIA affiliation was the longest-lasting of the MSUG projects. However, the library's usefulness suffered from the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that most of its documents were in English, rather than Vietnamese or French; {{and by the end of}} the MSUG contract the library was threatened by restricted accessibility, poor maintenance, and a lack of qualified Vietnamese personnel to staff it.|$|E
25|$|While {{the show}} does derive {{some of its}} humour from {{exploring}} the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of conservative Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more liberal interpretations of Islam (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> of being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood cultural community. Nawaz herself has stated that the show's primary agenda is to be funny, {{not to be a}} political platform. She has also stated that she views comedy {{as one of the most}} valuable and powerful ways to break down barriers and to encourage dialogue and understanding between cultures.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{women as}} a whole {{tend to be less}} {{assertive}} and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so. Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys {{are more likely to be}} pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.|$|E

25|$|Key to {{the rituals}} {{associated}} with the Grito is the gift, given by Chilean writer Gabriela Mistral to Albizu's family, of a tamarind tree obtained from Simón Bolívar's estate in Venezuela. The tree was planted at the Plaza de la Revolución with soil taken from the eighteen other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Albizu meant to give the Plaza a living symbol of solidarity with the struggle for freedom and independence initiated by Bolivar (who, while visiting Vieques, promised to assist the Puerto Rico independence movement, but whose promise never materialized due to the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> that most Puerto Ricans {{did not want the}} island's independence from Spain), as well {{as a symbol of the}} bittersweet (as the trees' fruit) hardships needed to reach Puerto Rico's independence. As such, the Tamarindo de Don Pedro was meant to resemble the Gernikako Arbola in the Basque Country between Spain and France.|$|E
25|$|Fogg {{had thought}} it was one day more than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this <b>simple</b> <b>fact.</b> During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, {{the concept of a}} de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware {{that it would be a}} day less than it used to be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a de facto date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite the tips of his surroundings).|$|E
25|$|Dionysius {{copied the}} last decennovenal {{cycle of the}} Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with {{numbered}} Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi (Years of our Lord Jesus Christ) because, as he explained to Petronius, he {{did not wish to}} continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did not realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years, otherwise he would have stated such a <b>simple</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E
