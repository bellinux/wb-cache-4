His {{economical}} and understated style had {{a strong}} influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations.

He published seven novels, six <b>short</b> <b>story</b> collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four <b>short</b> <b>story</b> collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when <b>Short</b> <b>Story</b> was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of <b>Short</b> <b>Story</b> as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of <b>Short</b> <b>Story,</b> realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of <b>Short</b> <b>Story</b> by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E
