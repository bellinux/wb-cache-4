5000|$|By 1987, a new {{generation}} of country stars, such as Randy Travis, Ricky Van Shelton and Dwight Yoakam had emerged on the country music landscape. Consequently, some of the old guard were having a more difficult time remaining relevant on the charts, and this may help explain the modest showing of Jones's 47th studio album, which did not break the top ten on the Billboard albums chart and produced no hit singles. In a review upon its release, Country Music declared that Too Wild Too Long contained too many songs that relied on the myth of George Jones rather than the kind of songs that built the myth. Although none of the album's singles cracked the top 20, Jones's singing is characteristically stellar. <b>Significant</b> <b>tracks</b> include a cover of the Hank Williams song [...] "I'm A Long Gone Daddy" [...] and [...] "One Hell Of A Song". [...] "The U.S.A. Today", a rare foray for the singer into the political realm, points out America's virtues and faults. Jones also made his second music video for [...] "The Old Man No One Loves", a tearjerker that pulls on the same heartstrings as [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today".|$|E

Indeed, the heavy use of synths and electric percussion was a step beyond the dance-influenced flavor of the previous album, and Murphy's soulful vocals gave the songs a definite R&B flavor. Besides the upbeat electronics-laden tracks, the album also introduced a more mature and pop-friendly quality, evident in tracks such as [...] "Promises Can Break," [...] "I Wanna Make You Feel Good," [...] and [...] "I Can't Take Losing You." [...] The System also appeared in the 1984 breakdancing film Beat Street and its soundtrack, performing the song [...] "Baptize the Beat."

Other <b>significant</b> <b>tracks</b> on the album include [...] "It Takes 2", [...] "Love Won't Wait for Lovin'", and [...] "This is for You".

Although Fogerty was producing, arranging and writing all the songs at this point, as well as handling lead guitar and singing duties, bassist Stu Cook insisted to Bill Kopp of musoscribe.com, [...] "We didnt always play the parts we were given. John showed us lots of stuff he wanted specifically in songs; songwriters often do that. They come up with a song, they have an arrangement they want to hear. Some things are important, and other things are less important. We had a sufficient amount of latitude in writing and arranging our parts." [...] Although he has always maintained that the bands artistic vision was solely his own, Fogerty himself conceded to Rolling Stones Michael Goldberg in 1993, [...] "Probably ninety-nine percent of the tracks we did as a quartet are played live with all four guys playing at the same room. Ive heard the rumor over the years that after they left the studio, John went in and re-recorded all the parts. No. I think the charm of what you hear on those records is four guys really playing." [...] However, Fogerty has always maintained that the ideas for Creedence were his; in 1998 he asserted to Harold Steinblatt of Guitar World, [...] "Many times — in fact, most of the time — they never heard the melodies until after the record came out...I showed the band how each part went — I showed them the music that fit the song I had written." ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Effects of steep island terrain on typhoon motion and structure changes are studied by both observational analyses and numerical simulations. The analyses involve calculation of center position deviations from a second- order polynomial curve fitted {{to the best}} tracks, and an empirical orthogonal function analysis to determine the terrain-induced surface structures. The simulations use a limited-area model, with a elliptical-shaped barrier and a 'spun-up vortex' to represent the typhoon, to demonstrate the sensitivity on track and structure relative to vortex intensity, approach direction and translation speed. Both observational and simulation {{studies show that the}} orography induces <b>significant</b> <b>track</b> deflections and structure distortions, especially for a weaker and slowly moving typhoon approaching central or southern Taiwan. As the typhoon approaches, {{the outer edge of the}} circulation accentuates the blocking effect of the barrier. Asymmetric gyres are induced by a vortex-terrain interaction as the vortex moves closer to the barrier, which accounts for the <b>significant</b> <b>track</b> deflections from a simple barrier effect. The simulations suggest that a center-following algorithm based on the wind field would be more representative than on the pressure field. A track discontinuity occurs when the secondary vortex created from flow deflections around the barrier becomes the primary center downstream. Republic of China (Taiwan) author (civilian) ...|$|R
