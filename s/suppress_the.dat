5|$|By early May, the Albanian authorities, {{being unable}} to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> revolt, became willing to start discussions with the {{intervention}} of the International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations. Subsequently, on May 6, the members of the Commission informed Zografos that they were willing to discuss the demands of the Northern Epirote side.|$|E
5|$|By {{shutting}} down Black Snow and prosecuting Takechi, Eirin {{had intended to}} <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> new pink film genre, but the trial had the exact opposite outcome. The publicity surrounding the trial brought the pink film genre {{to the attention of}} the general public, and helped inspire the wave of pink films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolution, border raids from British-allied Iroquois tribes harried the {{settlers}} on the frontier. George Washington ordered Sullivan's Expedition, Rangers, to enter Central New York and <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois threat. More than 40 Iroquois villages were destroyed and their winter stores, causing starvation. In {{the aftermath of}} the war, numerous European-American settlers migrated into the state and this western region from New England, especially Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|Ettore Fieramosca had a {{relatively}} uneventful career; her first decade in service {{was confined to}} the normal peacetime routine of training with the Italian fleet. She thereafter {{spent most of her}} career abroad, including a deployment to China to help <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and tours in African and North American waters in the mid-1900s. She was stricken from the naval register in July 1909 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> activity of the histamine.|$|E

5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E
5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.|$|E

The Sultan of Oman, then residing in Zanzibar, arranged for Hamad to be seized and thrown in jail in Fort al Jalali. Hamad died on 23 April 1850, either from starvation or from poison.|$|E
5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to <b>suppress</b> <b>the</b> growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E

5|$|The role of RNA {{interference}} in mammalian innate immunity is poorly understood, and relatively little data is available.

In 955, a Daylamite military officer named Muhammad ibn Makan seized Isfahan from Rukn al-Dawla. Adud al-Dawla then marched towards the city and recaptured it from Muhammad ibn Makan. Another Daylamite military officer named Ruzbahan also shortly rebelled against Mu'izz al-Dawla, while his brother Bullaka rebelled against Adud al-Dawla at Shiraz.
