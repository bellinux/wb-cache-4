40|$|International audienceThe <b>sandwich</b> <b>molding</b> process {{consists}} of injecting sequentially a skin and core polymers. The thermomechanical model describing {{the flow of}} the two polymers into the mold cavity is based on the lubrication approximations. A transport equation characterizes the displacement of the interface between the two fluids. An experimental study has been performed in order to test the influence of processing parameters (viscosities, flow rates, etc.) on the interface location. Numerical simulations are in agreement with measurements...|$|E

[...] Working in composite materials, {{the company has}} expanded its space {{over the years and}} added a climate-controlled vacuum bag <b>molding</b> capability, plus <b>sandwich</b> construction <b>molding</b> jigs.|$|R
40|$|In {{the scope}} of INNOMONT within the R and D project 'Material Development / - Analysis' the {{behaviour}} of polymers which are used as mold compounds were tested relating to high frequency characteristics. New developed primer between leadframe-resin were investigated and tested on a test vehicle (Cu-Leadframe), under climate load. In a subproject we looked for new filler materials with negative coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). A filler material with this property was successfully tested and the basis for further tests close to practice was established. Because of the non-existence of praxis relevant characterisation methods for polymers, a method and test assembly was developed for determination of mechanical and thermomechanical properties. Investigations with addition of micro-hollow spheres into the mold compound leaded to stress degradation but without reproducibility. A <b>sandwich</b> <b>mold</b> process with duroplastics (similar with thermoplastics) did not succeed. (orig.)

40|$|The work {{included}} establishing {{controls on}} the polymer, the prepreg, composite fabrication, and quality assurance, as well as fabrication of structural elements to demonstrate the developed materials and processes. The fabricated structures were hat sections, I-beam sections, honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> structures, and <b>molded</b> graphite-reinforced fittings. The graphite/PMR- 15 polyimide system was shown to be well suited {{for use in the}} 550 - 600 F temperature range; the processing techniques developed were proved and found potentially useful for other commercially available systems...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} to obtain commercially available graphite/PMR- 15 polyimide prepreg, develop an autoclave manufacturing process, and demonstrate the process by manufacturing structural elements. Controls were established on polymer, prepreg, composite fabrication, and quality assurance, Successful material quality control and processes were demonstrated by fabricating major structural elements including flat laminates, hat sections, I beam sections, honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> structures, and <b>molded</b> graphite reinforced fittings. Successful fabrication of structural elements and simulated section {{of the space shuttle}} aft body flap shows that the graphite/PMR- 15 polyimide system and the developed processes are ready for further evaluation in flight test hardware...|$|R
