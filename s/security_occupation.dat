40|$|Excerpt] The {{higher rates}} of {{workplace}} violence in the government were {{partly due to the}} high rates of workplace violence attributed to law enforcement and security employees (figure 2). The rate of workplace violence for law enforcement and security employees was a high of 672. 3 per 1, 000 in 1994, declining to 109. 3 in 2011. These law enforcement and <b>security</b> <b>occupations</b> accounted for over half of the violence committed against government workers and were concentrated most heavily in state, county, and local government. The estimates of nonfatal violent victimization in the workplace against government employees are based on data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on nonfatal crimes against persons age 12 or older, reported and not reported to the police, from a nationally representative sample of U. S. households. In this report, nonfatal workplace violence includes rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault (serious violent offenses), and simple assault against employed persons age 16 or older that occurred while at work or on duty. Information on workplace homicide in this report was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) (see Methodology). Workplace homicide includes the homicide of employed victims age 16 or older who were killed while at work or on duty and excludes death by accident. Trend estimates of nonfatal workplace violence are based on 2 -year rolling averages centered on the most recent year. For example, estimates reported for 2011 represent the average estimates for 2010 and 2011. For some tables in this report, {{the focus is on the}} single 10 -year aggregate period from 2002 through 2011.

Males are seen to have the highest number of people working in agriculture at 40 in comparison to females which had none recorded doing this job. The job role of agriculture is the most common occupation for males. The number of people with unknown occupations was higher for females at 51 compared to males at just 4 people, with it not being the social normality for women to have occupations in this decade which stems to the century of the Victorians, where many women had to stay at home to look after the children while the men went to work, for example on the farms. Their jobs could also be unofficial with them not wanting to have them recorded or even not fitting into a certain occupational role. The most common occupation for women that is officially titled was domestic service or offices, which could be considered to be a stereotypical job compared to others, with the tradition of women being subjected to housework and maternal duties naturally when getting married or being of a younger age to help out their mothers. When comparing the occupations of 1881 to the occupations from 2011, they are extremely different in roles with the 2011 statistics including more modern occupations such as technological and scientific jobs and also insurance and social <b>security.</b> The <b>occupations</b> also included construction, education and also agriculture in small amounts with just a small number of males (4 people) and females (1 person) partaking in this sector.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between land tenure security and disaster resilience. The core concept {{of this research is}} the integration between the two major themes of tenure security and disaster resilience. Two case studies that fit the research context were selected, namely Barangays of Ilawod and Tagaytay in Camalig Municipality, Province of Albay, the Philippines. The two barangays are prone to multiple disasters, i. e. typhoon, flash floods, river flood, lahar/mudflow, lava/pyroclastic flow, ash flow, earthquake and landslide. At the same time, only 37 % of the total lots in the study area are titled or registered. This thesis presents the results of qualitative methods using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with local communities and related stakeholders. It was found that land titles are not the main instrument in securing land tenure in the study area. In the absence of title documents, the level of confidence gained through <b>security</b> of <b>occupation</b> is the main aspect that builds their perception of tenure security. There are two sources of tenure security that are respected by the local communities and the government: de jure and de facto tenure security. Communities with legal title documents and residents of government-assisted housing enjoy the benefit of de jure tenure <b>security</b> since their <b>occupation</b> can be proved by legal title documents or formal certificate housing award issued by the government. On the other hand, this research confirms that even among communities living as informal settlers and tenants, de facto tenure security through community and government recognition, is almost as important as de jure or legal recognition in determining tenure security in the study area. Among the four dimensions of resilience (institutional, economic, social and physical) discussed in this research, social resilience is the strongest dimension in the study area that builds community’s perceptions on disaster resilience. Social resilience is built by strong social cohesion and a sense of community, trust among the community, and community involvement and respect to existing cultures and values. In addition, the strong capacity of local government in disaster management and perception of local communities of ‘natural disasters as part of life’ are other key factors that constitute community resilience. The research confirms that perceived tenure security can provide opportunities for Disaster Risk Reduction and promote disaster resilience. In a pre-disaster setting, it provides access to housing and livelihood, which are pre-conditions for economic growth. In a post-disaster setting, tenure security impacts early recovery and reconstruction process. Confidence to return to land and housing provides a shorter recovery time and rehabilitation process. This research has demonstrated that social aspects of the society bring the bridge between tenure security and resilience. Aspects such as a strong sense of community and social trust play important roles in securing tenure and provide a platform for building resilience. In these situations where economic vulnerability persists, this research demonstrates the importance of having strong community cohesion and social bonds in securing tenure and building resilience...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} service users’ perspectives on the difference between high secure long-stay forensic psychiatric services in the Netherlands and high secure forensic psychiatric care in England. These perspectives are relevant in considering the benefits of a similar long-stay service in England. Method: A current in-patient detained in a high secure hospital in England and other mental health service users and carers with experience in forensic-psychiatric settings were asked to watch a documentary on a Dutch high secure long-stay service. Then they were invited to make comparisons between this service and high-secure care in England. These perspectives were gained in the context of their membership of the Service User Reference Group of an externally funded study on long-stay in forensic-psychiatric settings in England. Findings: Our small group of participants highlighted the importance of relational <b>security,</b> meaningful <b>occupation,</b> autonomy, positive therapeutic relationships with staff and a homely environment for those with lengthy admissions and perceived these to be better met in the Dutch service. These factors might contribute to improved quality of life that services should strive to achieve, especially for those with prolonged admissions. Practical Implications: Perspectives of service users with lived experience of long-stay in forensic settings are important in informing service developments. Lessons can be learnt from initiatives to improve the quality of life of long-stay services in other countries and consideration be given on how to best manage this unique group. Originality/Value: To our knowledge this is the first study asking service users about their view on forensic services in other countries.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} future impact of soil {{degradation}} on national food <b>security</b> and land <b>occupation</b> in Ethiopia. It applies a spatial optimization model that maximizes national agricultural revenues under alternative scenarios of soil conservation, land accessibility and technology. The constraints {{in the model}} determine whether people remain on their original site, migrate within their ethnically defined areas or are allowed a transregional migration. Key to this model is {{the combination of a}} water erosion model with a spatial yield function that gives an estimate of the agricultural yield in its geographical dependence of natural resources and population distribution. A comparison of simulated land productivity values with historical patterns shows that results are interpretable and yield more accurate outcomes than postulating straightforward reductions in yield or land area for each geographic entity. The results of the optimization model show that in absence of soil erosion control, the future agricultural production stagnates and results in distressing food shortages, while rural incomes drop dramatically below the poverty line. Soil conservation and migration support a slow growth, but do not suffice to meet the expected food demand. In a transregional migration scenario, the highly degraded areas are exchanged for less affected sites, whereas cultivation on already substantially degraded soils largely continues when resettlement is confined to the original ethnic-administrative entity. A shift to modern technology offers better prospects and moderates the migration, but soil conservation remains indispensable, especially in the long term. Finally, an accelerated growth of non-agricultural sectors further alleviates poverty in the countryside, contributing to higher income levels of the total population and, simultaneously, relieving the pressure on the land through rural-urban migration.

Having been delayed several days by bad weather, they landed at Le Hamel on Gold Beach and leaguered up at Sommervieu near Bayeux. Going into action almost immediately they began taking casualties at Granville Crossroads, Livry in the fighting around Villers-Bocage. From 11–30 June the 8th {{were involved in the}} advance through the Bocage with the 22nd Armoured Brigade. They were involved in action against the 2nd Panzer Division, with the 8th leading their division out of the bridgehead. On 30 June, they handed over their positions to tanks from the US 2nd Armored Division and withdrew for a rest and a refit of the tanks. They also fought heavily around Briquessard and took a full part in Operation Goodwood {{and a number of other}} smaller engagements. The 8th pushed German forces further and further back, taking part in the actions to close the Falaise pocket suffering more casualties of men and tanks. Reinforced by a squadron from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, they pushed back through France, the break-out into the low countries, crossing the border into Belgium on 11 September 1944 and into the Netherlands on 23 September, taking up positions at Sint Oedenrode and finally to the Rhine, fighting hard on the way at St Pol, the Nederrijn and the Maas. After wintering in the Maas and spending a time employed as infantry in support of the Rifle Brigade during the latter half of 1944, the regiment painted its vehicles white (including the recently acquired Sherman Firefly versions with their effective 17 pdr guns and the Chaffee recce tanks) and prepared to support the counterattack against the German offensive in the Ardennes. In the event this did not occur and the Irish Hussars continued their advance across the Netherlands dealing with resistance when they came across it.

Our purpose is also to understand what strategies they use to keep them selves employable and {{get an idea of}} what long-term consequences according to their experiences various temporary employments have had. To examine this, we conducted a study based of qualitative interviews. Six respondents aged between 29 - 35 years old, were interviewed about their experiences of a long period of various forms of temporary employments. The interviews were semi-structured and between 50 - 80 minutes long. We have built our analysis based on theories regarding: Flexibility, Employability, Job Insecurity, social capital, Emotional Labour. We then analysed our empirical data using thematic analysis. Our results show that the respondents experience an uncertainty about their future and a longing for security on many different levels. We also see that fierce competition in the labour market has contributed a feeling of having to do work beyond their employment agreement. Furthermore they seem to be using a combination of networking and Emotional Labour to make themselves indispensable to stay employable. Over time, this has contributed to several consequences such as; lack of confidence in both the system and the employers. Some respondents even expressed resignation and bitterness. Another consequence is how the respondents reflect on how to handle the challenge of choosing between <b>security</b> and their <b>occupation.</b> A theme that stands out is how to balance family life and employability in precarious employments. 3 Based on the results, it becomes clear just {{how difficult it is to}} conduct a good Systematic Work Environment Management, in respect to the prevention of psychosocial conditions linked to the work of these groups. In the new working environment regulation (AFS 2015 : 4), steps are taken to prevent an increase in work-related psychosocial health issues. We ask ourselves how effective this steps will be for our respondents, since they have mentioned attempt to hide weakness and disguise their emotions due to the interchange ability to make them selves employable. Creating security and sense of belonging for this group will become increasingly important as the number of temporary employments increase in the labour market, as does psychosocial health issues. This study contributes to the HR-field because the describing of how people with a long-term experience of insecure employments experience their situation will be important knowledge in the future. This is not something that seems to be easily resolved on an individual, organizational or societal level alone, but requires coordinated action on all levels...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} of non-lethal weapons (NLW) are under military research and development, {{mainly in the}} USA. Due to incomplete information, judgement under criteria {{of the laws of}} warfare or of human rights is hampered. This study analyses four potential NLW technologies which are based on physics to provide reliable information for such assessment. The Active Denial System (ADS) produces a beam of electromagnetic millimetre waves; such radiation is absorbed in the upper 0. 4 mm of skin. The beam stays approximately 2 m wide out to many hundreds of metres. With a power of 100 kilowatts, the beam can heat the skin of target subjects to pain-producing temperature levels within seconds. With a prototype weapon, mounted in a military multi-purpose vehicle, the effects have been tested on hundreds of volunteers. In order to produce pain while preventing burn injury, the power and duration of emission for one trigger event is controlled by a software program. Model calculations show that with the highest power setting, second- and third-degree burns with complete dermal necrosis will occur after less than 2 seconds. Even with a lower setting of power or duration there is the possibility for the operator to re-trigger immediately. Collateral damage is not much of a problem. Use in armed conflict would bring much less injury than flamethrowers which count as legitimate weapons. However, such use is not very probable because the system is large, needs to be exposed for action and is vulnerable to many kinds of light weapons. More likely is its use for internal <b>security,</b> by <b>occupation</b> forces against uprisings etc. Taking into account that the operator may be up to one km away, in such circumstances overdoses with severe burn injuries could only be prevented if technical devices would reliably limit the skin temperature, i. e., would limit beam power or duration depending on target distance and would prevent re-triggering on the same person before a certain cooling time has passed. The Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL), to be carried by a transport aircraft, is to emit an infrared laser beam of 300 kilowatts power, provided from a chemical reaction. Via a 0. 5 m wide transmitting and directing mirror, the beam can be focused – under ideal conditions – to a spot of 0. 1 - 0. 2 m size over 10 km and more. With the 100 -fold power of a stove plate applied over a similar area, wood or textiles would start burning and metal would melt through after fractions of a second, under usual atmospheric conditions on the order of one second. Strong turbulence will limit the range, fog, dust or heavy rain can reduce it markedly. With fuel for about 40 seconds of radiating on board and dwell times below a second, the beam will often be directed and fired automatically. The ATL can destroy equipment and kill people, it is not a non-lethal weapon. Its usage in armed conflict against combatants could be compared with flamethrowers which are accepted under international humanitarian law. Compared to other means of applying force at many kilometres distance (artillery, bombs), the ATL would allow much more discriminating destruction. The ATL has limitations: the fuel is sufficient only for around 100 “shots”. A clear line of sight is also needed, preventing action through fog or heavy rain and exposing the carrier aircraft. Due to its size, long range and drastic effects, the ATL is not suitable for police. In peaceenforcing operations it could allow more precise targeting than possible with artillery or guided bombs, but collateral damage is nevertheless possible to several metres from an exploding tyre, fuel tank or munition. The concept of the Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) is to use short, powerful, infrared laser pulses to produce a mechanical impulse. The laser works with a chemical reaction. If the pulse intensity is high enough, the uppermost target layer is explosively vaporised and the vapour heated to a plasma which absorbs the rest of the pulse and produces a lasersupported detonation wave. This shock wave exerts a mechanical impulse on the target. With a range of 0. 5 - 2 km, the PEP is to be used against humans and equipment in armed conflict and law enforcement. The ratio between impulse and laser-pulse energy is such that for a relatively high pulse energy of 1 kilojoule requiring a big, heavy laser (1 - 2 metres, hundreds of kilograms), the mechanical impulse with 0. 1 newton-second is one to two orders of magnitude below the one from a rubber baton or an existing blunt-impact munition. Multiple pulses in fast sequence would add, but then the target would be ablated to corresponding greater depth, measuring by millimetres. If bare skin were hit, bad wounds would ensue. In addition, permanent hearing damage may occur from the shock wave even from one laser pulse. If the eye is hit, serious injury by cornea ablation or mechanical impulse is probable. In clear, non-turbulent air the spot focus will remain at a few cm size out to a few kilometres, but dense fog or rain will strongly limit propagation. The PEP is a lethal weapon. It could be used selectively, without significant potential of collateral damage. Comparison with penetrating projectiles or flamethrowers shows that its use in armed conflict would not a priori contradict the rules of warfare. However, it should be investigated if severe wounds produced on bare skin, in particular to the face, and the loss of vision from eye injury may count as unnecessary suffering or superfluous injury. The PEP has limitations. It needs a clear line of sight to the target so that it will be exposed and cannot work in thick fog or rain, it will be big, heavy, complex and expensive. Due to its size, range and potential injurious effects, the PEP would neither be appropriate as a weapon for law enforcement nor for peace-enforcing operations. For mechanical blows and pain, blunt-impact projectiles provide much easier, much cheaper options with less risk of injury. The Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) was developed in a weapon programme but is now denoted as a hailing and warning device. It is a flat loudspeaker which due to its diameter of 0. 8 m has a relatively high directivity (beam opening angle 5 - 15 &# 1048689;). It transmits mainly high frequencies (above 1 kilohertz); voice messages have a range above 500 m, warning tones (1000 -fold intensity, level 30 dB higher) to above 1000 m. Since 2003, hundreds of copies have been sold to and used by mainly military forces, in particular of the USA in occupied Iraq, but police, port authorities and border patrol have also ordered the LRAD. In the high-power warning mode the sound in front of the system is at levels dangerous to unprotected hearing. In order to prevent permanent hearing damage, the exposure has to be limited to a few seconds out to 50 m distance. The LRAD has been used to expel snipers and repel pirates. For such use as a weapon, an evaluation under the laws of warfare should be done explicitly. The same holds for human-rights or constitutional law for weapon-like use by internal security forces. To prevent hearing damage, technical devices should be introduced that limit the sound power and/or duration depending on the distance to the target subject(s). The four technologies differ widely. The first three are clearly weapons, one (ADS) potentially lethal, the other two (ATL and PEP) lethal. The LRAD can be used for hailing and warning or in weapon mode. Final judgement whether introduction and use of these technologies is legally or morally justified, will strongly depend on the scenarios. Because all technologies can be problematic, continuous attention of human-rights organisations, the International Committee of the Red Cross etc. is needed. Neue Techniken nicht-tödlicher Waffen (ntW) sind in militärischer Forschung und Entwicklung, vor allem in den USA. Durch unvollständige Information wird die Beurteilung unter Kriterien des Humanitären Völkerrechts oder der Menschenrechte behindert. Diese Studie analysiert vier mögliche ntW-Techniken, die auf physikalischer Grundlage beruhen, um verlässliche Information für eine solche Beurteilung zur Verfügung zu stellen. Das Active Denial System (ADS) erzeugt einen Strahl elektromagnetischer Millimeterwellen; solche Strahlung wird in den obersten 0, 4 mm der Haut absorbiert. Der Strahl bleibt bis zu vielen hundert Meter etwa 2 m breit. Mit einer Leistung von 100 Kilowatt kann der Strahl die Haut von Zielpersonen innerhalb von Sekunden auf Schmerz erzeugende Temperaturen aufheizen. Mit einer Prototypwaffe, eingebaut in ein militärisches Mehrzweckfahrzeug, sind die Wirkungen an Hunderten von Freiwilligen erprobt worden. Damit Schmerz erzeugt wird, aber Verbrennungen vermieden werden, werden die Leistung und die Strahldauer für eine Waffenauslösung durch Software gesteuert. Modellrechnungen zeigen, dass bei der höchsten Leistungsstufe Verbrennungen zweiten und dritten Grades mit vollständiger Hautnekrose nach weniger als 2 Sekunden auftreten werden. Selbst mit einer niedrigeren Leistungsstufe oder Dauer hat der/die Bediener/in die Möglichkeit, sofort erneut auszulösen. Kollateralschaden ist kein großes Problem. Anwendung im bewaffneten Konflikt würde erheblich geringere Verletzung hervorrufen als Flammenwerfer, die als legitime Waffen zählen. Solche Nutzung ist jedoch nicht sehr wahrscheinlich, weil das System groß ist, sich zur Wirkung exponieren muss und gegen viele Arten leichter Waffen verletzlich ist. Wahrscheinlicher ist die Anwendung für innere Sicherheit, durch Besatzungsstreitkräfte gegen Aufstände usw. Wenn man in Rechnung stellt, dass der/die Bediener/in bis zu einem km entfernt sein kann, könnten Überdosierungen mit schweren Verbrennungen unter solchen Umständen nur verhindert werden, wenn ein technisches Gerät zuverlässig die Hauttempera-tur begrenzen würde, d. h. die Strahlleistung oder –dauer in Abhängigkeit von der Zielentfernung begrenzen sowie verhindern würde, dass|$|R
