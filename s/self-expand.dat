50|$|Self-expansion motives {{can explain}} why people may {{appreciate}} intergroup contact, however, {{it can also}} provide explanations for why we avoid this intergroup contact. People may be cautious of self-expansion due {{to a sense of}} self-loss. As we <b>self-expand</b> in one area we may put ourselves at risk of losing aspects of the self in another area. Consequently, people may be fearful of creating a close relationship with an outgroup member as this may trigger animosity from original ingroup members. Often individuals must balance between potential benefits of including the outgroup in the self with the potential loss of ingroup friends and the associated resources. If the self-loss outweighs the self-expansion, it is possible for a decrease in perceived self-efficacy.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{motivation}} to <b>self-expand</b> still does influence attraction to others for a potential close relationship. Aron and Aron suggest that our attraction is broken down into two components based on Rotter's value-expectancy approach. Desirability is the perceived total amount of self-expansion possible from a potential close relationship. The second factor, probability, refers to {{the likelihood that the}} close relationship with the individual can actually be formed. It can also be conceptualized as the likelihood that self-expansion will occur. Consequently, individuals will seek a partner that has high social status and a greater number of resources. However, to maximize self-expansion, consideration is also given to how likely this person will be loyal and desires to be in the close relationship. Self expansion is when you motivate yourself and trust yourself.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{underlying}} themes of self-expansion is that individuals have a very basic motive to <b>self-expand.</b> Self-expansion is the desire to enhance an individual's potential efficacy. [...] Motivational models often refer to self-efficacy as one's belief that they are competent and can achieve specific goals. [...] However, within the self-expansion model, potential efficacy is used instead as it only refers to obtaining resources that will make goal attainment possible. Achievement of this goal is a secondary concern. According to the self-expansion model we increase potential efficacy by creating close relationships, which in turn, increases material and social resources, perspectives and identities. Some examples of resources include the following: social support, possessions, information, and friendship networks. Perspectives are the way we appreciate the world and ascribe causal explanations for people's behaviours. Identities refer to a person's memories and characteristics. Self-expansion is not consciously motivated. A person does not explicitly attempt {{to be part of}} a close relationship for the sole intention of increasing physical and psychological resources.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A benign {{condition}} {{is a relative}} contraindication {{to the use of}} <b>self-expanding</b> metallic stents, because these devices usually are not retrievable. The <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent is removable and induces less tissue hyperplasia. This study prospectively evaluated the use of a <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent to treat benign esophageal conditions. METHODS: Over 4 years, 21 patients underwent <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent placement for various benign esophageal disorders, including refractory peptic (n = 2), caustic (n = 3), post-radiotherapy (n = 3), and anastomotic (n = 4) stenoses; hyperplastic (n = 5) stenosis within a previously implanted metallic stent; and anastomotic leak (n = 4) after esophagectomy. The <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent was removed from all patients. Patients were followed for at least 8 months after stent removal. RESULTS: Implantation was successful in all cases. Temporary <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent placement was curative in 17 / 21 patients, especially those with caustic and hyperplastic strictures and anastomotic fistula, all of which were treated successfully without re-intervention. Median follow-up was 21 months (range 8 - 39 months) after stent removal. Moreover, by inducing tissue ischemia, <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent allowed delayed removal of metallic stents. Only one severe complication (tracheal compression) was encountered, and this resolved after stent removal. CONCLUSIONS: A range of benign stenosing disorders of the esophagus can be treated safely with a <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent. Because the long-term results were highly favorable, <b>self-expanding</b> plastic stent placement could be used as the initial treatment for various conditions. <b>Self-expanding</b> plastic stent insertion within an esophageal <b>self-expanding</b> metallic stent allowed removal of the latter, theoretically unretrievable, stent.

40|$|People are {{generally}} motivated {{to increase the}} diversity of their self-concepts, within their relationships and outside of them. Self-expansion enhances both individual and relationship well-being; however, almost no research has investigated what circum-stances attenuate people’s desire for self-expansion. The present research addressed this question by testing the central hypothesis that experiencing lower self-concept clarity would predict less interest in self-expansion. Across three studies, the present research demonstrated that individuals primed with low self-concept clarity expressed less interest in self-expansion outside of romantic rela-tionships (Studies 1 – 2) and {{were less likely to}} actually <b>self-expand</b> by incorporating attributes from a potential romantic partner into the self (Study 3).

40|$|Studies {{conducted}} in various contexts and with varied populations have found expressive writing enhances {{physical and psychological}} wellbeing. This pilot intervention study countered the predominantly quantitative evidence by adopting a qualitative methodology, exploring the experience of using positive emotions in expressive writing. Participants (n = 10), who all had previous experience in expressive writing, were asked to select one of ten positive emotion cards (PECs) each day for three days. Participants {{were then asked to}} write expressively through the ‘lens’ of their chosen emotion. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and experiences were evaluated using Thematic Analysis. The results identified two main themes that compared the experience of expressive writing both with and without the PECs.

The second main theme, Progressing (with the PECs) contained three different sub-themes: sense of direction, changed perspective and interactive with experience.

40|$|The guiding {{premise of}} this thesis {{is that the}} concept of {{historical}} time constitutes a distinct philosophical problem for Karl Marx’s work. Marx does not examine the relationship between time and history in his work, rendering the historicist framework of linear, progressive time the overriding framework through which he understands this relationship. However, the larger problem is that, despite this lack, the philosophical originality and critical function of Marx’s work is in no small measure defined by the contribution it makes towards our understanding of this relationship. Therefore, this thesis argues {{that it is necessary to}} construct a concept of historical time out of Marx’s work. Methodologically, this begins with an outline of the broad contours of the materialist concept of history in The German Ideology, and a temporal reading of the historical act – the creation of the means of human life – on which this concept is based. This reading is then ontologically grounded, first by Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time, in order to establish how the act as such temporalises, and then by Jean-Paul Sartre’s Critique of Dialectical Reason, in order to grasp how this temporalisation can be thought in relation to the movement of historical totalisation, which is to say the ongoing totalisation of the time of all human lives. In short, Heidegger and Sartre enable us to secure labour and need – the two concepts upon which the materialist concept of history depends – as the two basic forces upon which historical temporalisation depends. Yet if, as Marx’s Capital reveals, the specifically capitalist category of ‘abstract labour’ is the condition of thinking the transhistorical category of ‘labour in general’, and if abstract labour exists to satisfy capital’s need to <b>self-expand,</b> not the human’s need to live, then capital – not the human – is the condition of thinking history. Capital and its times give history its intelligibility, such that capitalism is the only standpoint (to date) from which ‘history as such’, ‘history itself’, can be conceived. However, the concept of historical time cannot simply register that capital makes the category of history possible. It must also account for the historically changing character of the relationship between time and history, and hence the possibility of social and historical time after capitalism...|$|E
40|$|Self-expansion, the {{motivation}} for people to learn, explore, and grow, is facilitated by novel and challenging activities; often with close others (Aron 2 ̆ 6 Aron, 1996). The current studies were designed to replicate and extend Mattingly, McIntyre, and Lewandowski 2 ̆ 7 s (2012) experiment on self-expansion opportunity. Highly approach-oriented individuals reported greater liking for potential partners who offered many opportunities to <b>self-expand,</b> whereas less approach-oriented individuals rated potential partners similarly across the differing levels of self-expansion opportunity. In Study 1, I sought to alleviate the negative wording used to describe low self-expansion opportunity in used by Mattingly and colleagues (2012), which described future experiences with a potential partner as 2 ̆ 2 dull and boring. 2 ̆ 2 The current study compared this description of low self-expansion opportunity with an affect-neutral alternative, 2 ̆ 2 familiar and comfortable. 2 ̆ 2 Two hundred and twenty-six students from a Midwestern university completed measures of approach and avoidance motivation before reading and reacting to a hypothetical scenario about meeting an attractive, opposite-sex stranger.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Long-term {{success of}} endoluminally placed grafts for {{exclusion}} of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) relies on secure fixation at the proximal and distal cuffs and, as such, {{assumes that the}} fixation sites will not dilate over time. Data regarding this issue, however, are not yet available. This study was performed to evaluate {{the region of the}} proximal anastomosis in patients many years after having undergone conventional AAA repair to determine the potential for late dilatation after placement of an endoluminal device. Methods: Three hundred forty-six patients underwent repair of an infrarenal AAA at our institution between January 1985 and December 1990. Of 97 eligible living patients, 33 both had their original CT scans available and underwent repeat scanning at a mean of 88. 6 ± 23. 8 months (mean ± SD; range, 40 to 134 months) after repair. Results: The overall 5 -year survival rate was 73 %. The mean preoperative infrarenal aortic cuff diameter by CT scan was 24. 5 ± 3. 7 mm (range, 19 to 33 mm). At an average of 89 months after repair, the mean infrarenal aortic diameter increased 4. 3 mm to 28. 8 ± 7. 7 mm (range, 20 to 52 mm; p = 0. 0004 by t test). The proximal cuff at this time measured 30 mm or more in 11 patients (33 %), and as early as 6 years after operation three of the seven patients (43 %) scanned within this time period had cuffs that were dilated to 30 mm or more. Late dilatation to 30 mm or more was rare (16 %) in patients who had preoperative cuffs that measured 27 mm or less. The mean late iliac artery size was 16. 9 ± 8. 9 mm (range, 10 to 52 mm), and 30 % (10 of 33) measured 20 mm or more. Conclusions: One third of all patients who survive AAA repair experience significant dilatation of their proximal aortic cuff over time. Proximal dilatation is rare but not absent in patients who have smaller initial aortic cuff diameters. This dilatation rarely causes problems after conventional suture fixation, but the long-term implications of cuff dilatation after endoluminal repair are unclear. Our findings suggest that endovascular aortic prostheses that have the ability to continue to <b>self-expand</b> many years after implantation may be required and that endovascular prostheses {{may not be the best}} option for patients who have a long life expectancy or for those who have preoperative proximal cuffs greater than 27 mm...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} structural design of medical stent grafts. A {{new type of}} an innovative stent graft has been developed. Unlike the conventional stent grafts which consist of a wire mesh and a covering membrane, the proposed stent graft {{can be made from}} a single folded sheet of material. Firstly, a detailed symmetric design of a foldable cylindrical tube for the new stent graft has been presented. Folding is achieved by dividing the structure into a series of identical elements with hill and valley folds as in origami (Japanese art of paper folding). The folding patterns allow the stent graft to be folded and expanded both radially and longitudinally. The relationships among the design of the elements, the number of elements in the circumferential and longitudinal directions and the folded dimensions of the stent graft have been derived. It has been found that compact folding in the radial direction can be achieved by increasing the number of circumferential elements. A geometric mismatch during deployment has also been identified. The elements have to deform when the structure is expanded. Optimum designs which minimise the deformation have been found. Secondly, a new stent graft with helical folds has also been designed to improve radial strength and ease the deployment process. Helical folds are introduced by adjusting the joining position of the two edges of a sheet that had been symmetrically jointed in the symmetric design. The relationships among the number of elements in one complete circumference of a helix, the helical angle and the radius of the helical type stent graft have been established. The locations for the helical folds are optimised for easy folding by considering both geometric aspects of folding and the buckling patterns of a thin-walled tube under torsion, which are found analytically. Thirdly, using numerical analysis of the finite element method (FEM) the strain level and overall deformation of the stent graft during deployment has been calculated. Finally, the stent graft has been manufactured to verify the concept. A number of prototypes of the stent graft, which are the same size as standard oesophageal and aortal stent grafts, have been produced successfully using the same materials as current stent grafts of stainless steel and shape memory alloy (SMA) sheets. The patterns of folds on the materials are produced by photochemical etching. It has also been demonstrated that the SMA stent grafts <b>self-expand</b> smoothly and gradually by a near body temperature. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between the familial and relational bases of the Philippine banking system and the series of liberalisation initiatives pursued since 1972. It shows that the relaxation of restrictions on the operations of foreign banks since 1995, while changing important aspects of the functioning of Philippine banking, has strengthened the system's familial basis and the dependence of top banks on relational practices. Through the use of a triangulation of econometric, questionnaire and qualitative methods, it is shown that foreign competition has forced domestic universal banks to narrow spreads and undertake non-price measures aimed at their extensive margins. Competitive pressures exerted by foreign banks have also led to an increase in the concentration of familial control of the system, and an increased reliance by top Chinese-Filipino banks on relational business. These competitive responses suggest the interactions of the familial and relational bases of Philippine banking with foreign capital are complex, requiring a broad-based framework for their analysis. For that purpose this dissertation develops a historically rooted framework for analysis of the social relations defined by Philippine banking. This is accomplished through a critical discussion of subjectivist and Marxian theoretical approaches to the nature and evolution of banking-credit relations and their relationship to capitalist accumulation. Approaches founded on individualism are found to be too narrow, particularly for analysis of combined social formations p laying a role inc redit relations. Neoclassical information-theoretic approaches are shown to provide little beyond a logical reconciliation between banking and methodological individualism, 6 ffering few insights on either banking relations or knowledge flows. Neo-Austrian approaches offer insights into knowledge flows in banking relations, but are shown to be analytically limited by their exclusively subjectivist understanding of such flows. The framework adopted here is founded on Marxian political economy and is based on analysis of flows of loanable money, the difficulties posed in securing particular avenues for money's general ability to <b>self-expand,</b> and of the social relations developing and mediating these processes. The framework can explicate the importance of broader social relations and practices in banking, suggesting that analysis ofthe Philippine banking system and its familial form requires understanding their historical, social and cultural origins {{in the development of the}} Philippine political economy. Based on such analysis, this dissertation rejects the common interpretation of the recent strengthening of the familial and relational bases of Philippine banking as a result of incomplete or corrupted implementation ofreform initiatives. This phenomenon is understood as the most recent embodiment of the broad pattern of accommodation between foreign capital and top domestic elite families that has characterised the development of the Philippine economy and banking system. This accommodation, inexplicable on individualist terms, is likely to bear on the long-term outcomes of foreign entry and shape the future development ofthe Philippine banking system.

The present {{study was designed to}} assess the potential of performance increase by the introduction of next-generation, <b>self-expanding</b> venous cannulas, which {{can take advantage of the}} luminal width of the venous vasculature despite a relatively small access orifice. METHODS: Veno-arterial bypass was established in three bovine experiments (69 +/- 10 kg). The Lifebridge (Lifebridge GmbH, Munich, Germany) system was connected to the right atrium in a trans-jugular fashion with various venous cannulas; and the oxygenated blood was returned through the carotid artery with a 17 F percutaneous cannula. Two different venous cannulas were studied, and the correlation between the centrifugal pump speed (1500 - 3900 RPM), flow and the required negative pressure on the venous side was established: (A) Biomedicus 19 F (Medtronic, Tolochenaz, Switzerland); (B) Smart canula 18 F/ 36 F (Smartcanula LLC, Lausanne, Switzerland). RESULTS: At 1500 RPM, the blood flow was 0. 44 +/- 0. 26 l min(- 1) for the 19 F rectilinear cannula versus 0. 73 +/- 0. 34 l min(- 1) for the 18 / 36 F <b>self-expanding</b> cannula. At 2500 RPM the blood flow was 1. 63 +/- 0. 62 l min(- 1) for the 19 F rectilinear cannula versus 2. 13 +/- 0. 34 l min(- 1) for the 18 / 36 F <b>self-expanding</b> cannula. At 3500 RPM, the blood flow was 2. 78 +/- 0. 47 l min(- 1) for the 19 F rectilinear cannula versus 3. 64 +/- 0. 39 l min(- 1) for the 18 / 36 F <b>self-expanding</b> cannula (p< 0. 01 for 18 / 36 F vs 19 F).

At 2500 RPM the venous line pressure accounted for - 22 +/- 32 mmHg for the 19 F rectilinear cannula versus 2 +/- 5 mmHg for the 18 / 36 F <b>self-expanding</b> cannula. At 3500 RPM, the venous line pressure was - 112 +/- 42 mmHg for the rectilinear cannula versus 28 +/- 7 mmHg for the 18 / 36 F <b>self-expanding</b> cannula (p< 0. 01 for 18 F/ 36 F vs 19 F). Conclusions: The negative pressure required to achieve adequate venous drainage with the <b>self-expanding</b> venous cannula accounts for approximately 31 % of the pressure necessary with the 19 F rectilinear cannula. In addition, a pump flow of more than 4 l min(- 1) can be achieved with the <b>self-expanding</b> design and a well-accepted negative inlet pressure for minimal blood trauma of less than 50 mmHg...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} whether <b>self-expanding</b> stents are more effective than balloon-expandable stents for reducing stent malapposition at 3 days after implantation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction is associated with vasoconstriction and large thrombus burden. Resolution of vasoconstriction and thrombus load during the first hours to days after primary percutaneous coronary intervention may lead to stent undersizing and malapposition, which may subsequently lead to stent thrombosis or restenosis. In addition, aggressive stent deployment may cause distal embolization. METHODS: Eighty patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to receive a <b>self-expanding</b> stent (STENTYS, STENTYS SA, Paris, France) (n = 43) or a balloon-expandable stent (VISION, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California; or Driver, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) (n = 37) at 9 European centers. The primary endpoint was the proportion of stent strut malapposition at 3 days after implantation measured by optical coherence tomography. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction, emergent bypass surgery, or clinically driven target lesion revascularization). RESULTS: At 3 days after implantation, on a per-strut basis, a lower rate of malapposed stent struts was observed by optical coherence tomography in the <b>self-expanding</b> stent group than in the balloon-expandable group (0. 58 % vs. 5. 46 %, p < 0. 001). On a per-patient basis, none of the patients in the <b>self-expanding</b> stent group versus 28 % in the balloon-expandable group presented ≥ 5 % malapposed struts (p < 0. 001). At 6 months, major adverse cardiac events were 2. 3 % versus 0 % in the <b>self-expanding</b> and balloon-expandable groups, respectively (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Strut malapposition at 3 days is significantly lower in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients allocated to <b>self-expanding</b> stents when than in those allocated to balloon-expandable stents. The impact of this difference on clinical outcome {{and the risk of}} late stent thrombosis need to be evaluated further.

40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the frequency and mechanisms of sequential incomplete stent apposition (ISA) changes such as persistent, resolved or newly acquired ISA during the first three days after primary PCI (pPCI) in a matched segment-level analysis, with the comparison between <b>self-expanding</b> and balloon-expandable stents assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS AND RESULTS: The current analysis is a substudy of the APPOSITION II study that included 69 patients (self-expanding: 35, balloon-expandable: 34) using serial optical coherence tomography (OCT) post procedure and three days after pPCI. In order to evaluate a temporal change in ISA, stented regions were segmented using fiduciary landmarks. In a total of 228 corresponding segments, persistent and newly acquired ISA were less frequently observed in <b>self-expanding</b> stents than in balloon-expandable stents (11. 5 % vs. 33. 9 %, p< 0. 01, 2. 7 % vs. 14. 8 %, p< 0. 01, respectively). New appearances of ISA were caused by tissue resorption, vasorelaxation and "early" recoil in balloon-expandable stents, and only tissue resorption in <b>self-expanding</b> stents. CONCLUSIONS: Three days after pPCI, tissue resorption and vasorelaxation were biological factors associated with new appearance of ISA while "early" recoil of balloon-expandable stents was a mechanical factor. Both persistent ISA and newly acquired ISA occurred less frequently in <b>self-expanding</b> stents, resulting in a low number of ISA segments compared to balloon-expandable stents.
