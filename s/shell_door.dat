40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{discusses}} whether elastic {{and plastic}} impacts and scratches caused by applied forces (e. g., car bump, key scratch etc.) to a parked vehicle {{can be distinguished}} by an autonomous system. The authors assume that a force impact to a vehicle stimulates characteristic frequencies in the vehicle body shell components {{that can be used}} to distinguish the given damages. Eight piezoelectric film sensors made of polyvinylidene fluoride mounted at the inside of the vehicle body <b>shell</b> components <b>doors,</b> bumpers, bonnet, and tailgate are used as the sensing element. An experimental modal analysis of several vehicle components is performed to identify characteristic frequencies. The results are used to compute the best sensor position in order to detect all considered eigenfrequencies of the component. A con-structed model set up for force generation was used to record reference data. Derived features of the reference signals are computed and assessed to their relevance of distinguishing the damages on the vehicle...|$|R

50|$|The 309 {{had been}} {{conceived}} as Projet C28 {{as a replacement}} for the Talbot Horizon, and as a result its development had been performed by the former Chrysler/Simca wing of PSA. Styling was the responsibility of the former Chrysler-Rootes design studios in Coventry, whilst much of the engineering was done at the Simca site at Poissy in France. The only stipulation from PSA management was that the new car had to use as much existing architecture as possible; hence the use of a stretched Peugeot 205 floorpan and <b>door</b> <b>shells,</b> whilst the Simca engines and transmissions from the Horizon were also carried over.|$|R

5000|$|The 309's {{slightly}} awkward styling (especially {{when compared}} with the 205 and 405 of the same era) was due to the decision to re-use the <b>door</b> <b>shells</b> from the 205. The 309 was also supposed to be differentiated from Peugeot as a Talbot, and was designed [...] "in-house". Other Peugeot cars were designed by the famed Italian design house Pininfarina, up until the introduction of the 206 in 1998. The notched-hatchback design bears an unintentional similarity to the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance, which were also developed, entirely separately and cut-down from a larger (Chrysler K-Car) platform rather than stretched from a smaller one, to replace the Horizon in North America.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Climate and {{environmental}} issues are of paramount importance. Researchers agree that we must all contribute to a reduction of gases that contribute to climate change. Energy consumption must decrease within all sectors {{and the promotion of}} renewable sources of energy must be introduced. Each sector should aspire to decrease its energy consumption. Energy consumption is strongly linked to waste gases that contribute to climate change. Passive houses {{are a part of the}} construction industry's methods to attain energy conservation. Passive houses are derived from low energy houses and super insulated houses. A passive house is intended to obtain heat from the inhabitants and through their activities. The house is built so that heat losses through the climate <b>shell</b> (<b>doors,</b> windows, walls, floors and ceilings) and the ventilation system are decreased. In order to get a good indoor environment it is important that the ventilation and heat recycling system working together, hold the energy consumption down. This is how faculty people usually present a passive house to someone who has not considered the concept before. I would like to turn the focus from heating to cooling. Houses with large glass facades facing south and a closed climate shell risk too high an indoor temperature. How do we plan houses so that they don’t need a cooling system? Is protection from the sun enough? During the planning of a passive house, efforts are made in order to let the house be dependent on a small heat battery during the coldest parts of the year. My approach to passive houses became an effort to see how solar radiation influences closed and highly insulated units. The heating of houses in my calculations was not influenced to any extent by the rotation of the building. When heating buildings the sun’s radiation only plays a small part. When the sun’s radiation is most concentrated no active heating is required. It is important to note that solar radiation cannot be depended upon at all times especially in winter. Of course, with sun protection, energy needed for heating will increase but energy for cooling will decrease. Sun radiation influences active cooling as shown in my software program. Increased sun radiation requires increased active cooling for alternatives in my study without sun protection. The alternatives with sun protection are not influenced as much by solar radiation as those without. Alternatives with strong sun protections are not as sensetive how the house is placed among the point of the compass. Solar radiation does not become equally considerable and impact to be decreased therefore...|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} car {{was shown}} {{to the world in}} May 1985. It was powered by a David Wood designed bespoke 3-litre V6 powerplant which used some of the engine architecture of the Cosworth DFV. It featured twin overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. The engine was a break from the norm, as it wasn't turbocharged as the majority of its competitors were. The engine was mounted back to front in the car, with the forward end of the engine facing the hatchback and the gearbox attached conventionally behind it and, therefore, {{in the middle of the}} vehicle. The four-wheel-drive was permanently engaged, and drove separate propshafts to the front and rear differentials. The rear differential was mounted on the side of the engine sump with one driveshaft running through the sump to the nearside rear wheel. Much of the outer bodywork was made of GRP, with the only exception being the roof panels (which were aluminium), the steel doors and the remaining panels from the original Metro <b>shell.</b> The <b>doors</b> were, however, concealed by plastic airboxes. Indeed, models now on show generally have stickers demonstrating where it is safe to push from when moving the vehicle, so as not to damage the bodywork.|$|R
40|$|A {{shielded}} cask is used {{to transport}} radioactive materials between facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory. The cask was fabricated with an outer and inner shell of A 36 carbon steel with lead poured in the annular space between the shells to provide radiation shielding. Carbon steel {{is known to be}} susceptible to low-temperature brittle fracture under impact loading. This paper will present the analysis results representing postulated transportation accidents during on-site transfers of the cask at subzero temperatures. The accident scenarios were based on a series of cask drops onto a rigid surface from a height of 1. 83 m (6 ft.) Finite element models of the cask and its contents were solved and post processed using the ABAQUS software. Each model was examined for failure to contain radioactive materials and/or significant loss of radiation shielding. Results of these analyses show that the body of the cask exhibits considerable ruggedness and will remain largely intact after the impact. There will be deformation of the main cask body with localized brittle failure of the cask outer <b>shell</b> and <b>door</b> structure. The cask payload outer waste can remains in the cask but will experience some permanent plastic deformation in each drop. It will not be deformed {{to the point where it}} will rupture, thus maintaining confinement of the can contents...|$|R
5000|$|Cemetech {{began as}} a {{personal}} website hosted on Homestead and later GeoCities, publishing personal software and hardware projects. In 2004 the site expanded on shared hosting with a PhpBB-based forum, and in March 2005 moved to Cemetech.net. [...] The site spent the following three years consolidating its presence in the TI graphing calculator enthusiast community, attracting programmers who began publishing their own independent software projects on the site. Early projects were primarily calculator-related, later branching out into computer, web, and embedded programming. In mid-2006, Cemetech lost several hundred posts when hosting provider Jatol disappeared overnight, stranding hundreds of customers without websites or backups. From 2008, Cemetech expanded further into hardware development, releasing popular projects such as the Clove 2 typing glove, an electro-acoustic musical instrument, and several hardware mods of graphing calculators. Major software projects have included networking libraries for calculators and other low-resource devices, {{as well as the}} hardware and computer software to support internet-connected calculators, an extensive <b>shell</b> called <b>Doors</b> CS for these devices, and work on distributed computing and image processing projects by the founder and several staff members.
