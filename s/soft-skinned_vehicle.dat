40|$|Abstract—The {{kinematic}} response (including plastic deformation, failure initiation and fracture) of a <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicle</b> (represented by a F 800 series single-unit truck) to the detonation of a landmine shallow-buried in (either dry or saturated sand) {{underneath the}} vehicle’s front right wheel is analyzed computationally. The computational analysis included {{the interactions of}} the gaseous detonation products and the sand ejecta with the vehicle and the transient non-linear dynamics response of the vehicle. A frequency analysis of the pressure versus time signals and visual observation clearly show {{the differences in the}} blast loads resulting from the landmine detonation in dry and saturated sand as well as the associated kinematic response of the vehicle. It is noted that the dominant vehicle structural response to the blast is similar to the first torsional structural mode shape obtained through an eigenvalue analysis of the system. Tailoring the vehicle modal response may result in more desirable modes of failure...|$|E

The round is designed to be effective at breaking through windows and exploding inside, blowing up doors, producing multiple casualties, destroying bunkers or emplacements, and damaging or disabling <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In the Vietnam war, U.S. Navy and Coast Guard personnel on boats would lob 40mm grenades into the water (using the M79 {{grenade launcher}}), to preemptively attack Viet Cong swimmers ("sappers") attempting to plant explosives on anchored or moored U.S. water craft.|$|R
50|$|Several Soviet {{technical}} {{teams from}} the General Armoured Directorate (GBTU) were sent to Syria {{in the wake of}} the war to gather information about the use of the new vehicle (at the same time US specialists were gathering the same information). These lessons, combined with observations of western military tactics, development and the use of light AFVs in a number of other military conflicts, resulted in the beginning of a modernization program for the BMP-1 in 1974. A few updates were introduced in the Ob'yect 765Sp3 model to increase its firepower against small unarmored targets (infantry, <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles,</b> etc.) but the conclusions about the vehicle's vulnerability to infantry anti-tank weapons were not taken into consideration until the Soviet War in Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|A {{military}} {{armored car}} {{is a type of}} armored fighting vehicle having wheels (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of tracks, and usually light armor. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result, they are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for reconnaissance, command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R

50|$|Following this success, the Rapid Equipping Force {{was founded}} under the Army G-3/5/7 in late 2002. Its primary {{task was to}} support Soldiers in Operation Enduring Freedom using {{deployed}} teams of subject matter experts and a headquarters office at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. When Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) began in March 2003, REF expanded its operations to include forward teams in Kuwait and Iraq. REF personnel provided manpower to support daily operations, but most importantly, REF continued to provide technology to fill capability gaps and to counter the highest priority threats. Improvised Explosive Devises (IEDs) quickly became the primary threat to American Soldiers in Iraq. To address this threat, REF partnered with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Task Force, a precursor to JIEDDO, by providing support personnel and technology solutions. Together, the two organizations equipped units with the Ballistic Armor Kit for Vehicles that transformed the Army’s standard <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles</b> used early on in OIF into a much safer vehicle for Soldiers.|$|R

While these advances {{have been made in}} the areas of combat vehicles, the logistic vehicles tasked to provide the logistic support for the combat vehicles and the AirLand Battle doctrine have not changed since the 1940 s. The modern Army is still supported by wheeled, <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles</b> similar to the vehicles are lacking the mobility of modern fighting vehicles, and do not provide protection to the crew and cargo from artillery and small arms fire.

50|$|The primary {{armament}} of the T-15 {{tank was}} the 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun, already in {{use with the}} Belgian air force as a light anti-aircraft gun. Originally intended as an anti-aircraft gun, it had some anti-armor capabilities: it could penetrate 13 mm of armor plate at a range of 500 m. Barrel length was 992 mm. It fired from 25 or 30 cartridge box magazines {{at a rate of}} 450 rounds per minute. This gave the T-15 the theoretical capability to take out most enemy armored cars, half-tracks and <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Apart from the machine gun armed Panzer I however, the T-15 armament was no match for the heavier German tanks, nor was it meant to be. The secondary armament consisted of a single pintle-mounted light M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), meant as a form of anti-aircraft defence. To fire the BAR the gunner had to be exposed to enemy fire, and with the range of a light machine gun hardly sufficient to deal with enemy aircraft, the concept was disputed and hence not adopted in general.|$|R

Its modern Target Acquisition Devices {{together}} with a specially designed Recoiling Mortar System, attenuates the firing loads and enables mounting the systems on wheeled and tracked AFV's, or even <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as trucks. The CARDOM Aiming mechanisms are linked to state-of-the-art command, control and communication systems, to achieve quick response automatic laying mode. The IDF delivered Cardom system takes target acquisition data, that provides range, bearing, position and other data from an observation point and transmits it directly to the Cardom system. Using electrical servo motors the mortar barrel is then set at the exact traverse and elevation angles ready for firing.The 120 mm Cardom has a burst rate of 16 rpm, followed by a 4 rpm sustained rate of fire. The Cardom Recoil Mortar System has been qualified for fielding with the 3rd US Army Stryker brigade, and will be coupled to the US Army's M95 Mortar Fire Control System. So far over 320 mortar systems have been manufactured for the U.S. Army.|$|R

50|$|In 2014, CMI Defence and Doosan DST {{publicly}} {{revealed the}} K21-105, a light tank {{version of the}} K21 chassis fitted with a CMI Defence CT-CV 105HP turret. Referred to as a medium tank by its developers, the vehicle weighs around 25 tons with a 3-man crew, and is cheaper to produce and maintain and has better mobility than actual tanks. The vehicle's main role is direct fire support for infantry against armored and <b>soft-skinned</b> <b>vehicles,</b> buildings, and fortifications. Main armament is a 105 mm rifled low-recoil gun that fires standard NATO and newly developed smart ammunition with a max direct fire range of 4 km; although the gun would not be effective against modern main battle tanks, it can defeat older tanks that North Korea still has in widespread service. The gun can also fire the Ukrainian-designed laser-guided Falarick 105 GLATGM, which has a range of 5 km and a tandem warhead capable of penetrating 550 mm of armor behind ERA. The turret has a bustle-mounted automatic ammunition loading system capable of firing 8 rounds per minute and stores rounds in the bustle compartment, separated from the crew. Secondary armament is a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun plus an optional roof-mounted 12.7 mm machine gun in a remote weapon station.
