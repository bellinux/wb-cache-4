50|$|A common {{process of}} hot water {{extraction}} begins with preconditioning. Alkaline agents such as ammonia solution for synthetic carpets, or acidic solution (such as vinegar solution) for woollen carpets, are sprayed into the carpet, then agitated with a grooming brush or an automatic <b>scrubbing</b> <b>machine.</b> Next, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (known as a wand) passes over the surface to rinse out all pre-conditioner, residue, and particulates. If an alkaline detergent is used on a woollen carpet, use of a mild acetic acid solution will restore neutral fiber pH. The acidic rinse thus neutralizes the alkaline residues, and can contribute to softening cleaned fabrics.|$|E

Its advantage is its low production cost and high productivity, which can be achieved with counting tool. Good design and manufacture of a punch allows industry to be competitive in the global market for metal manufcturas. It describes the sequence of a progressive die design for manufacturing an electrical terminal, as developed in a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>machine</b> tool support conventional EDM process...|$|E
50|$|When floor <b>scrubbing</b> <b>machines</b> {{became more}} {{available}} to {{many types of}} facilities, {{there was a need}} to cover a different type of flooring. Floor buffers were invented to scrub and polish the floor with linoleum surface. The machines use rotary brushes with soft material to clean and make the floor shine. For marble and wood floors, floor polishers may be used to apply protective coating to floor.|$|R
50|$|An absorbent, 98% {{biodegradable}} {{cleaning compound}} may be spread evenly over carpet and brushed or scrubbed in. For small areas, a household hand brush can work such a compound into carpet pile; dirt and grime is {{attracted to the}} compound, which is then vacuumed off, leaving carpet immediately clean and dry. For commercial applications, a specially designed cylindrical counter-rotating brushing system is used, without a vacuum cleaner. <b>Machine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is more typical, in that hand scrubbing generally cleans only the top third of carpet.|$|R
5000|$|A 98% {{biodegradable}} or others, slightly moist absorbent {{cleaning compound}} may be spread evenly over carpet and brushed or scrubbed in. For small areas, a household hand brush can work such a compound into carpet pile; working like [...] "tiny sponges", the attracted cleaning solution dissolve dirt, dirt and grime is attracted/absorbed to the compound, {{after a short}} drying time (the cleaning solution which is attracted to the compound must evaporate), it will be removed with a vacuum cleaner, the drier the better, leaving carpet immediately clean and dry. But it's very difficult to remove all residues, the residues can cause allergies and biological compounds may cause discolourations on carpets. For commercial applications, a specially designed cylindrical counter-rotating brushing system is used, without a vacuum cleaner. <b>Machine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is more typical, in that hand scrubbing generally cleans only the top third of carpet.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} by the authors in order to evaluate the Twister™ method’s environmental pros and cons {{in relation to other}} traditional floor care methods using polish and wax. This has been ascertained through a Life Cycle Assessment which was conducted within the study. The study has been in co-operation with HTC Sweden AB, the developer of the Twister™ method. The results show that the elements of the Twister™ method with the greatest environmental impact are the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>machine</b> that is used and the low energy consumption that the Twister™ method requires. The results also show that the Twister™ method has a significantly lower environmental impact than floor care methods using polish or wax. The parts of the Twister™ pad that have the greatest environmental impact are the industrial diamonds and the material that makes up the pad...|$|E
40|$|In Today’s society {{there are}} {{a wide variety of}} floor and floor materials. An {{extensive}} range of products and methods are also used to ensure that these floors remain functional. All floor types and products create environmental impact of various kinds and magnitudes. This study was initiated by the authors in order to evaluate the Twister™- method’s environmental pros and cons in relation to other traditional floor care methods. This has been ascertained through a Life Cycle Assessment which was conducted within the study. The study has been in co-operation with HTC Sweden AB, the developer of the Twister™- method. A Life Cycle Assessment helps to identify and quantify the environmental impact of a product or a service, from a holistic perspective, which incorporates extraction of materials, their manufacture, use and waste management. The software application SimaPRo 7. 0 has been used in this study, from which the Eco-indicator 99 method has been selected. In the study, the Twister™ method is compared with other floor care methods using polish and wax. The analysis also includes a breakdown of the Twister™ method, as well as a breakdown of the Twister™ pad manufactured by HTC Sweden AB. The results show that the elements of the Twister™ method with the greatest environmental impact are the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>machine</b> that is used and the energy consumption that the Twister™ method requires. The results also show that the Twister™ method has a significantly lower environmental impact than floor care methods using polish or wax.

40|$|Operation with closely spaced bunched beams {{causes the}} {{build-up}} of an Electron Cloud (EC) {{in both the}} LHC and the two last synchrotrons of its injector chain (PS and SPS). Pressure rise and beam instabilities are observed at the PS during the last stage of preparation of the LHC beams. The SPS was affected by coherent and incoherent emittance growth along the LHC bunch train over many years, before scrubbing has finally suppressed the EC in a large fraction of the machine. When the LHC started regular operation with 50 ns beams in 2011, EC phenomena appeared in the arcs during the early phases, and in the interaction regions with two beams all along the run. Operation with 25 ns beams (late 2012 and 2015), which is nominal for LHC, has been hampered by EC induced high heat load in the cold arcs, bunch dependent emittance growth and degraded beam lifetime. Dedicated and parasitic <b>machine</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is presently the weapon used at the LHC to combat EC in this mode of operation. This talk summarises the EC experience in the CERN machines (PS, SPS, LHC) and highlights the dangers for future operation with more intense beams {{as well as the}} strategies to mitigate or suppress the effect...|$|R
