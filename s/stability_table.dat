40|$|Abstract—When {{applied in}} a {{commercial}} deployment, DHTbased P 2 P protocols face a dilemma: although most real-world participants are so unstable that the maintenance overhead is prohibitively high, they must be effectively utilized {{due to the lack}} of stable participants. Thus, determining how to leverage unstable nodes to enhance system scalability and then maximize stability in high-churn scenarios becomes a substantial problem. This paper focuses on this topic, and our main findings are two folds: 1) we propose a homogeneous grouping scheme for scalability enhancement. Besides extending system storage capacity by admitting all nodes, it clusters homogeneous nodes together, deploys the inter- and intra-group connections distinctively, and tunes the number of groups, which aims to facilitate search efficiency; 2) we further look into how to maximize stability under this scheme, which is formulated as the problem Maximum Stability of Grouping. It not only proves to be NP-hard, but also infeasible; therefore, we propose an approximated grouping approach and reduce it to an optimization problem that proves to be feasible. Simulation results exhibit that our grouping strategy effectively captures the stability-scalability tradeoff. Based on our proposed measurement metrics, it doubles the storage capacity of so-called GiantOnly strategy by incurring slightly more churn and search latency, and is about four times as stable as Chord with equal capacity and mild improvement in search efficiency.

40|$|Peatland {{practitioners}} and scientists have increasingly recognised the damage resulting from various management methods, {{and the need}} to restore peatlands to achieve several potential benefits. Many of the hoped-for benefits of peatland restoration, such as Carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and water quality improvements, are thought to depend on a reinstatement of high water tables that had been reduced by drainage. Despite the current emphasis on restoring drained peatlands, many of the predicted responses to restoration are still not adequately proven and the mechanisms behind them still uncertain. This study reports on water table and discharge responses to drain blocking restoration of a degraded Welsh upland blanket bog. Restoration work and monitoring were designed to permit a novel catchment scale control-intervention experimental design. An information theoretic approach to examining the data provided evidence of increases in water retention and water tables within the bog after restoration. But the study also demonstrated the importance of small and large scale topography in determining the degree of these responses. The increases in water storage after restoration produced lower discharge rates observable at the level of both drains and hill streams; as well as greater water <b>table</b> <b>stability,</b> reduction in peak flows and increases in water residency after rainfall.

40|$|Hydrological {{models have}} the {{capability}} to provide useful river flow predictions and flood warnings. The aim of this project, ‘Hydrological Modelling using Convective Scale Rainfall Modelling’, is to investigate which models and associated computational methods would allow best use of the latest Met Office developments in numerical weather prediction (NWP). Two recent enhancements in particular offer interesting opportunities and {{open the door to the}} use of probabilistic flood forecasting. These two developments are: • operation of the nowcasting system STEPS (Short Term Ensemble Prediction System) at 2 km resolution; • a new system for longer term numerical weather prediction called MOGREPS (Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System). The three-phase project is concerned primarily with: • how to use high resolution (convective scale) rainfall forecasts effectively for flood forecasting; • how to make operational the use of ensembles of numerical weather prediction (MOGREPS) in flood forecasting and warning within the Environment Agency’s National Flood Forecasting System (NFFS). This report presents the results of Phase 2 (pilot case study). During Phase 1 (inventory and data collection), the storm event at Boscastle on 16 August 2004 was selected as the case study to test various hydrological modelling concepts for the transformation of high resolution rainfall predictions into accurate flood forecasts. Three hydrological models (one lumped and two distributed) were applied to the north Cornish catchments affected by the Boscastle event: • Probability Distributed Moisture (PDM) model; • physical–conceptual Grid-to-Grid (G 2 G) model; • physics-based Representative Elementary Watershed (REW) model. The three models were configured and calibrated for the three gauged catchments (Ottery, Tamar and Camel) selected as the focus of the case study. Raingauge-adjusted radar rainfall data produced using HyradK were used as model input. This phase also coupled the latest Met Office high resolution NWP products with the distributed hydrological model developed by the Centre for Hydrology & Ecology at Wallingford and considered the future potential of ensemble convective scale rainfall predictions. The term ‘distributed forecasting’ in this sense means the use of a spatially distributed (grid-based) hydrological model to forecast ‘everywhere’. This contrasts with current hydrological model networks that comprise a connected set of (normally) lumped rainfall-runoff (‘catchment’) models feeding into hydrological and hydrodynamic river models which provide forecasts only at specific locations. Ensemble forecasting was configured in a test NFFS system for two Environment Agency Regions (Thames and North East) set up at Deltares in the Netherlands as part of the Delft Flood Early Warning System (Delft-FEWS) and receiving MOGREPS forecasts from the Met Office. Particular attention was given to the effect on system performance as it is necessary, when running the models in ensemble mode, to repeat the forecast workflow 24 times. Conclusions Phase 2 demonstrated that a distributed hydrological model (set up using a digital terrain model) can be operated on the National Flood Forecasting System platform with short enough run times for use in real-time forecasting. The PDM model gave excellent performance across catchments but was insensitive to the storm pattern. The G 2 G model gave good performance across catchments; ungauged performance was also good. The REW model gave good performance for winter periods but overall performance was only reasonable; ungauged performance was on a par with gauged performance. Distributed models were considered to have a number of advantages including: • sensitivity to spatio–temporal structure of storms; • helpful in understanding storm and catchment shaping of flash floods; • can identify locations vulnerable to flooding; • help forecast floods shaped by ‘unusual’ storm and catchment conditions absent from the historical record; • provide a complete spatial picture of flood hazard across a region; • respond sensibly to ensemble rainfall forecasts that vary in position. The performance of the G 2 G model was considered particularly promising with a number of its attributes being relevant to convective scale probabilistic flood forecasting. Recommendations • Hydrological modelling concepts to be carried through to Phase 3. - The distributed G 2 G model shows promise for Area-wide flood forecasting at gauged and ungauged locations. - An extended G 2 G formulation incorporating soil/geology datasets should be considered. • Case study selection for Phase 3. A more focused ‘regional assessment’ should be undertaken based on an area within Midlands Region affected by the summer 2007 floods and utilising raingauge data in combination with radar data for improved rainfall estimation as model input. More detailed analyses (including use of high resolution NWP pseudo ensembles) should be performed for the selected case study area in the Midlands Region. • Continuation of the MOGREPS trial into Phase 3. This will allow: - more events to be captured; - additional forecast <b>stability</b> <b>tables</b> to be added to the test configuration; - a wider range of Environment Agency staff to assess the results. A more radical recommendation is to trial the G 2 G model countrywide across England and Wales in Phase 3. At the end of Phase 3 (analysis and verification), overall conclusions will be drawn on the general benefits of using high resolution NWP as input into a hydrological model for flood forecasting. In addition, a possible approach using the hydrological models – and calibration and computation methods – will be formulated. ...|$|R

The paper was aimed {{to determine the}} main maceral, biomarker and isotopic (δ 13 C) characteristics of investigated lithotypes. Based on these results the sources and depositional environment of organic matter in 4 lithotypes were established. These samples were also used as substrates for investigation {{of the influence of}} diagenetic alteration on δ 13 C signatures of biomarkers, as well as for assessment of the most convenient utilization for each lithotype. The investigated lithotypes differ in accordance with the composition of huminite macerals. Xylite-rich coal notably distinguishes from other lithotypes beacuse of the highest content of conifer resins vs. epicuticular waxes. The mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal is characterised by the greatest contribution of algae and fungi and the most intense methanotrophic activity at the time of deposition. In all coal lithotypes diagenetic aromatisation influenced isotopic composition of individual biomarkers. Xylite-rich coal has the poorest grindability properties. However, this coal lithotype is the most suitable for fluidized bed gasification, whereas the mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal has the lowest applicability for this process. The calorific value decreases in order: xylite-rich coal > matrix coal > mixture of matrix and xylite-rich coal > mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal. The increase of organic carbon content and calorific value is controlled by the increase of contribution of wood vegetation vs. herbaceous peat-forming plants, as well as by <b>stability</b> of water <b>table</b> during peatification.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{expected}} in physics {{that there should be}} causality from the strong nuclear force to nuclear structures, but the mechanisms have been unknown. The present work addresses this problem, by developing a theory based on a non-local hidden-variable (NLHV) design, that explains the nuclides from the synchronous interaction (strong force) upwards. The basis of the Cordus nuclear theory is that the nucleus consists of a nuclear polymer bonded by the synchronous interaction (strong force). Three-nucleon physics are accommodated, in the form of bridge neutrons across the nuclear polymer. The requirements for nuclide stability are identified as the need to have a nuclear polymer that consists entirely of cis-phasic synchronous bonds, and also a spatially viable layout. Only certain identified layouts are viable. The Cordus nuclear theory successfully explains, for all nuclides from Hydrogen to Neon, why any nuclide is stable, unstable, non-viable or non-existent. It explains why some elements have multiple nuclides, and others only one. The theory also explains the deviations from the p=n line, why 1 H 0 and 2 He 1 are stable with low neutron counts, why 4 Be 4 and 9 F 9 are unstable, and why heavier elements require more neutrons than protons for stability. It explains relative stability (lateral trends with one nuclide series), including the anomalous progressions (i. e. those situations where one nuclide is unexpectedly much more or less stable than its neighbouring nuclides). The theory also explains why the limits of stability are where they are. It explains the patterns of <b>stability</b> in the <b>table</b> of nuclides, such as the runs of stable isotopes and stable isotones. Thus the nuclide landscape may be explained by morphological considerations based on a NLHV design...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the {{investigation}} {{and the development of}} a product made of plantain chips that will be commercialized as “Chiflines with chocolate”. This is a new product in the local markets of Quito and Ecuador, that looks for the diversification of the snacks made of plantain chips. It is a totally a new product that has a special mixture of flavours and a peculiar taste. It is a product that will catch the attention of the consumers because it is unique. It is different because of it is a combination of a product that everyone thinks is salty (plantain chips) with something sweet, as the chocolate. This product is considered to be in the category of convenience food, followed by the subcategory of Snacks. In order to develop “Chiflines con chocolate” some preliminary sensory evaluation test took place. At the same time, a market research with the final product was performed in order to calculate an estimated demand of product, real costs, design of a marketing plan, create and evaluate the packaging and other things that deal with the development of a new product. In this work there is a creation and an analysis of a plan HACCP as the fundamental part of the production of “Chiflines con chocolate. ” Also there is a technical study of the raw material, packaging and the final product. Furthermore, there is a <b>stability</b> test, a <b>table</b> of contents of the nutritional facts of the product and all the regulations of the “Instituto Ecuatoriano de Normalización” (INEN) and of the Codex Alimentarius and other parameters that can be found in the enclosure of this work. La presente tesis tiene como contenido el desarrollo y producción de chifles con chocolate que tendrán el nombre comercial de “Chiflines con chocolate. ” Un producto nuevo para el mercado nacional que busca diversificar los productos existentes de chifles. Es un producto novedoso con una combinación de sabor peculiar; la mezcla de un producto salado, los chifles, con un producto dulce, el chocolate. Los chifles con chocolate entran en la categoría de alimentos convenientes o útiles y en la subcategoría de Snacks. Para llegar a obtener chifles cubiertos con chocolate se realizaron pruebas sensoriales preliminares conjuntamente con encuestas de mercado para poder tener el producto final y de esta manera calcular la demanda aparente, costo del producto, plan de marketing, promoción, diseño de la etiqueta, entre otros aspectos que involucran la creación de un nuevo producto. En este trabajo se analizaron los puntos críticos de control (HACCP) como parte fundamental para la producción de los “Chiflines con Chocolate. ” Además se realizó un estudio técnico de las materias primas, producto final, material de empaque, pruebas de estabilidad, etiquetado nutricional y todas las normas a cumplir según el Instituto Ecuatoriano de Normalización (INEN) y el Codex Alimentarius entre otras reglamentaciones presentadas en los anexos de este trabajo...|$|R
