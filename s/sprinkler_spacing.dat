40|$|The {{objective}} of the tests {{was to determine the}} water distribution characteristics using different water pressures and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing</b> of two selected Extended Coverage sprinklers. The sprinklers may be used {{for the protection of the}} Muskö tunnel and the test set‑up simulated a freight truck trailer positioned inside the tunnel. Adequate sprinkler coverage would require that sprinklers are positioned close to the peak of the ceiling. A relatively short vertical distance from the sprinklers and the ceiling is also essential for proper thermal activation. These requirements are best met by the use of upright sprinklers. Two extended coverage upright sprinklers with a K‑factor of 363 (metric) and 202 was selected for the tests. For the extended coverage upright K 363 sprinkler (Tyco model EC‑ 25), a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing</b> of 4. 0  m is recommended, in order to account for the fact that full coverage of the freight truck trailer was not achieved at the tested 4. 2  m spacing. A density of 10  mm/min requires an operating pressure of around 0. 7  bar at this particular spacing. The tested extended coverage upright K 202 sprinkler (Tyco model EC‑ 14) provided a wider water discharge pattern, with a proper water distribution on the top of a freight truck trailer positioned offset in the tunnel at <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing</b> up to 5. 0  m.

40|$|Single leg {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine performance and cost effectiveness of different spacing combinations {{that can be used}} in 4 mm impact sprinkler irrigation systems design operating at 250 - 350 kPa. Four sprinklers were tested for coefficient of uniformity (CU), distribution uniformity (DU) and wetted diameter at three different pressure points. Results obtained for CU and DU showed that imported sprinklers had significantly higher water application uniformities than locally made sprinklers at 250 - 350 kPa pressure range. Sprinkler spacings of 12 m x 18 m and 15 m x 15 m passed the layout tests and can be used in Zimbabwe under moderate wind conditions at 300 kPa, using preferably imported sprinklers for best water application uniformity.

40|$|A good {{supply of}} {{groundwater}} and the commercial develop-ment of center pivot irrigation systems significantly increased sprinkler-irrigated acreage in southern Idaho {{during the late}} 1960 s and early 1970 s. Today, center pivot systems, with their automation, large areal coverage, reliability, high application uniformity, and ability to operate on relatively rough topography, are replacing surface, handline, and wheelline systems. The irrigated area under a center pivot system expands substantially with increasing system length. To accommodate the increased area, the application rate increases linearly along the center pivot lateral through one of two methods: increased flow rates through equally <b>spaced</b> <b>sprinklers</b> or gradually decreased <b>spacing</b> of equal-flow <b>sprinklers</b> along the center pivot lateral.

40|$|Irrigation {{uniformity}} {{and wind}} drift and evaporation losses (WDEL) are major {{concerns for the}} design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems under arid or semi-arid conditions. Field trials were carried out to assess irrigation uniformity and WDEL under various wind velocities, sprinkler spacings and operating pressure heads. Based on experimental data, a frequency analysis was performed to infer the occurrence probability of a given uniformity coefficient (UC). In addition, statistical regressions were used to model WDEL {{as a function of}} different climatic variables. Increasing the operating pressure head improved uniformity at low wind speeds. It was shown that UC has been severely impaired at wind speeds above 4 m/s. In the prevailing wind conditions, the frequency analysis showed that a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing</b> of 12 m × 12 m provided the best uniformity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of handmoved sprinkler irrigation systems under semi arid climate conditions by means of field tests conducted in Cumra-Konya (Turkey). The study was done in the sugar beet and dry bean fields irrigated by sprinkler irrigation.

The main factors affecting water application and evaporation and drift losses with these systems were analysed. A set of performance guidelines and recommendations for the design and management of sprinkler irrigation is presented to attain the highest uniformity and efficiency in water application in arid and semi arid areas.

40|$|The {{potential}} for improving irrigation scheduling decisions and adoption of more efficient irrigation systems is explored using a bioeconomic simulation model of lettuce production on the Gnangara Mound near Perth, Western Australia. Sandy soils with poor water and nutrient holding capacity {{are associated with}} declining marginal productivity of water at high water use, which would create an incentive to reduce water use and to adopt closer <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing</b> if farmers had correct information about the declining marginal productivity of water. Incorrect perceptions regarding water–yield relationships lead to over use of water by up to 50 per cent and reduce profits by $ 475 per crop hectare (12 per cent) in the short run, and remove the incentive to adopt more efficient systems in the long run. Higher water prices create an incentive to reduce irrigation scheduling time {{in the short term}} and to adopt more uniform sprinkler systems, and tend to reduce the discrepancies associated with poor information about the marginal productivity of water. The low level of adoption of efficient irrigation systems in the region might be explained partly by historically poor water governance and insufficient extension regarding water productivity and technology. bioeconomic models, horticulture, irrigation, technology adoption, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{different}} wind conditions, operating pressures, various sprinklers layouts and spacing on water distribution uniformity in sprinkler irrigation system a research project was conducted under 3 different wind velocities (0 - 5, 5 - 7 and > 7 m sec - 1), using 3 operating pressure (35, 40 and 45 m), three spacing on the lateral pipeline (15, 18 and 21 m) and 3 different layouts (square, rectangular and triangular). Simulation experiments were conducted to estimate water distribution uniformity. The results indicated that the distribution coefficient uniformity decreased with the increase of the wind velocity. With the increase of wind velocity up to 7 m sec - 1, the decrease of coefficient uniformity was not significant (the coefficient was reduced by 20 % in the range of wind velocity applied). The highest water distribution coefficient uniformity was occurred on 15 x 5 m spacing while the lowest value was achieved for spacing of 21 x 21 m and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing</b> to spray diameter of 0. 5 x 0. 5 with the increase of sprinklers spacing to the spray diameter, coefficient uniformity is reduced, especially at higher wind velocities.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this work was to develop and {{evaluate}} a data acquisition system (DAS) to automate sprinkler uniformity distribution testing. The system was designed to perform indoor tests for low and medium pressure sprinklers using a two radii collector pattern. The data acquisition system consisted of a PC/AT 386 computer connected to an A/D converter which received signals from 16 collector-transducer devices. The measuring principle of those collectors was to use the output of load cells to estimate the volume accumulated inside each collector Four tests of the Naan 501 -U sprinkler were conducted to evaluate the system performance. Weight readings were taken at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min during each test. The average volume weight readings taken {{at the end of}} the tests (120 min) were compared to volume values estimated rising a digital scale. Those readings were used to create an overlapping grid pattern for a 6 m (19. 7 ft) x 6 in (19. 7 ft) <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing.</b> Statistical parameters and uniformity coefficients were calculated for both methods (DAS and scale). Sprinkler discharge and operating pressure were monitored by transducers connected to the system. No statistical differences were found between recording methods (P < 0. 05). The same conclusion could be made for the uniformity coefficients. The maximum standard deviation of measurement dispersion for the delta acquisition system readings was 0. 35 mt (0. 01 oz). The results showed that the DAS is a reliable system for sprinkler uniformity testing using a radius pattern.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the design}} of {{sprinkler}} irrigation systems is discussed generally and consideration is given to <b>sprinkler</b> <b>spacing</b> and precipitation. The subject of uniformity of water application is reviewed and relevant research work is surveyed. Overlapped distribution patterns obtained from indoor experiments on individual sprinklers are presented, analysed and examined {{in a variety of}} ways, which are then compared and criticised. Methods of measuring and describing the nonuniformity of application by irrigation systems which use rotating sprinklers are investigated. Certain methods have advantages for particular purposes but it is demonstrated that no single method is adequate for all purposes. Therefore, the question of a reliable way of determining the degree of non-uniformity to be tolerated is examined. It is concluded that a combination of measures, e. g., the Christiansen uniformity coefficient and the USDA pattern efficiency, together with a histogram, would give a reasonable description of an overlapped distribution pattern for most design purposes, but the addition of a visual presentation, which is necessary in some cases, would give a better description. Also, various measures of non-uniformity are found to correlate strongly. It is verified that offsetting sprinklers half the move distance for alternate watering is beneficial in most cases but it is found that the degree of improvement varies considerably. Further, the change in non-uniformity which results from the pressure variation along a lateral is shown to be a factor which should be considered in design. It is demonstrated how the relative disposition of substantial areas of low and high precipitation is important in relation to orchards, row crops and such conditions as local soil variations. Also, examination of visual presentations of precipitation surfaces of overlapped distribution patterns, including some derived from hypothetical geometrical profiles, reveals characteristics which open up the possibility of permitting the designer to confine attention to easily located critical regions of precipitation. A new research programme is proposed which is directed towards extending the scope and refining the work of this study, particularly in relation to critical regions of precipitation...|$|E

The experiment {{was carried out}} in field at the Universidade do Oeste Paulista, in Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil, from August to October, 2006. One treatment was performed on bare soil and the other using lettuce cultivar Vera as cover crop, {{at the end of the}} cycle. The average water depth, application rate, uniformity of distribution coefficient, Christiansen uniformity coefficient, Hawaiian uniformity coefficient, as well as the statistical uniformity coefficient were evaluated. The following plant spacing were simulated: 12 x 12, 12 x 18, and 18 x 18 m. The highest water depth retained with lettuce crop cover, at the end of the cycle was 2. 4 mm, applied when <b>sprinklers</b> were <b>spaced</b> at 12 x 12 m. The same occurred in the application rate with an average reduction of 43 %. When the overlapping was performed, the crop cover did not influence the parameters of efficiency and uniformity, assuring the distribution of the irrigation depth. Neither treatment reached the expected rate concerning the water depth average or the application rate in the spaces. The treatment using cover crop presented the lowest value, with a water depth average below the intended amount. Therefore, the lettuce as cover crop promotes the reduction of applied water depth. Consequently, the irrigation time has to be increased to assure the expected water depth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{kinetic energy}} of {{discrete}} drops impacting a bare soil surface is generally observed {{to lead to}} a drastic reduction in water infiltration rate due to soil surface seal formation. Under center pivot sprinkler irrigation, kinetic energy transferred to the soil prior to crop canopy development can have a substantial effect on seasonal runoff and soil erosion. In the design of center pivot irrigation systems, selection of sprinklers with minimum applied kinetic energy could potentially minimize seasonal runoff and erosion hazard. Size and velocity of drops from five common center pivot sprinklers were measured using a laser in the laboratory. The data were used to calculate kinetic energy transferred to the soil by each sprinkler on a center pivot irrigation system lateral with 2. 5 m <b>spacing</b> between <b>sprinklers.</b> Specific power, which represents the rate that kinetic energy is transferred to the soil as a function of distance from a sprinkler and analogous to a sprinkler radial water application rate distribution, was used to estimate actual kinetic energy transferred to the soil by overlapping specific power profiles of <b>sprinklers</b> equally <b>spaced</b> along a center pivot lateral. Kinetic energy of irrigation sprinklers has traditionally been characterized using area weighted kinetic energy per unit drop volume. This characterization was found not to be correlated to actual kinetic energy transferred to the soil by the sprinklers. The results demonstrated that sprinklers with the smallest drop sizes do not necessarily transfer the least kinetic energy per unit depth of water applied. Conversely, sprinklers with the largest drop sizes do not necessarily transfer the greatest kinetic energy to the soil...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{aim of the}} {{sprinkler}} irrigation method, as in other irrigation methods, is to apply irrigation water as uniformly {{as possible to the}} root zone. The uniform distribution of the applied water in {{sprinkler irrigation}} depends on factors such as sprinkler type, number and size of nozzles, arrangement of sprinklers, working pressure and the speed and direction of the wind. <b>Sprinkler</b> and lateral <b>spacing</b> should be determined by also taking the speed and direction of the wind into consideration.

40|$|Current Canadian Building Codes mandate {{prescribed}} {{design requirements}} {{for the protection of}} vertical floor openings by means of draft stops and closely <b>spaced</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> In the event that a design cannot meet the requirements, they also allow for the use of an alternative solution as long as the alternative solution can be proven to provide at least an equivalent level of performance as that prescribed in the Code. A commonly suggested alternative to the use of draft stops includes the construction of a recession at the perimeter of the floor opening; however, the performance of this design relative to that of an equivalent draft stop design has not been thoroughly evaluated. 	In this research, the available methods for the evaluation of ceiling recession designs are reviewed in order to identify appropriate tools with which to conduct such an analysis. While both analytical analysis and experimental testing could be used, experimental testing of the design is not considered here as this option would not commonly be pursued by design teams due to restrictions on both project budget and design timelines. From the available analytical tools, the fire modeling software Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is selected for evaluation of the ceiling recession design due primarily to the ability of FDS to address complex geometries with appropriate spatial resolution to investigate details of flow and thermal profiles at the ceiling level in a larger compartment. 	Previous FDS studies are reviewed and an independent validation study is conducted in order to develop an analysis methodology which is appropriate for the evaluation of ceiling recession designs. A case study evaluation is conducted consisting of two dimensionally distinct ceiling recession configurations in the same compartment and two separate source fire heat release rates (HRR). Results are analyzed to evaluate the selected analysis methodology with respect to the characteristics of the simulated flow, and thermal detector response. Results show that the presence of an obstruction to the ceiling jet flow significantly improves thermal detector response where the source fire HRR is low. At higher source fire HRRs, the difference in activation time is found to be minimal amongst configurations of ceiling recession considered in the study. 	Predictions of thermal detector response time for a selected ceiling recession design are compared to predictions made for code-prescribed draft stop configuration as would be necessary for an alternative solution evaluation. Results indicate that ceiling recession designs provide a reduced level of performance at both low and high source fire HRRs when the thermal detector is placed at the recession ceiling level. In contrast, when the thermal detectors are located at distances greater than 80 mm below the upper ceiling, a design which is permitted by the Code, the performance of the ceiling recession appears better than that of the prescribed draft stop design. Results from the model for detectors placed at distances from the ceiling exceeding 40 mm, however, require further confirmation through experimental testing or additional modeling...|$|R
