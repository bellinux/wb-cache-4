40|$|The {{incidence}} of diabetic neuropathy increases with {{the duration of}} diabetes {{and the degree of}} hyperglycaemia. Pain is one of the mostcommon and incapacitating symptoms of diabetic neuropathy and itspharmacological control is complex. The effectiveness of <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> has been described in different types ofneuropathic pain, but their effectiveness, when used as analgesics in painful diabetic neuropathy, still remains controversial. Objective: To review the possible role of new-generation <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> in the treatment of pain in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. This work has thus consisted of a meta-analysis for determining which <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent</b> had the best analgesic potential in managing pain in patients suffering from painful diabetic neuropathy. Methods:This search covered the Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS databases, between January 2000 and August 2007. The followinginformation was obtained from each article: criteria for diagnosing diabetic neuropathy, patients’ age average, antidepressant drugreceived and dose, sample size, duration of the disease and treatmentfollow-up, outcome measurement, evaluation of pain and rescuemedication. Results: A combined RR: 1. 67 (95 % CI 1. 38 – 2. 02) wasobtained; this result indicated that the antidepressive agentduloxetine, was effective for controlling pain in diabeticneuropathy. The corresponding NNT for Duloxetine was established,according to our interests; NNT = 6 (95 % CI 5 - 8) for achievinggreater than 50 % analgesia in patients suffering from painfuldiabetic neuropathy. Discussion: <b>Antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> are frequently employed in the specific case of diabetic neuropathy; their analgesic benefit has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{prevalence}} {{of depression and}} hypertension, {{the relationship between the}} two diseases has received little attention. This paper reviews the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and prognostic aspects of this association, as well as its implications for treatment. A Medline search was conducted using the following key words: depression, blood pressure, blood pressure variability, physical morbidity, hypertension, mood, stress, hypertension, <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents,</b> and genetics, from 1980 to 2004. We found descriptions of increased prevalence of hypertension in depressed patients, increased prevalence of depression in hypertensive patients, association between depressive symptomatology and hypotension, and alteration of the circadian variation of blood pressure in depressed patients. There is considerable evidence suggesting that hyperreactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and genetic influences are the underlying mechanisms in the relationship between depression and hypertension. Depression can negatively affect the course of hypertensive illness. Additionally, the use of <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> can interfere with blood pressure control of patients with hypertension by inducing changes in blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{pharmacological}} {{and psychological}} interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment in {{primary and secondary}} care settings. Milnacipran, a dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), {{is one of the}} antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of milnacipran in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclics, SSRIs and other newer <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were electronically searched in August 2008. References of relevant trials and other reviews were also checked. Trial databases of the drug-approving agencies and ongoing clinical trial registers for all published and unpublished trials were hand-searched in 2007. All relevant authors were contacted for supplemental data. No language restriction was applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing milnacipran with any other active <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> (including non-conventional agents such as herbal products like hypericum) as monotherapy in the acute phase of major depression were selected. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently checked eligibility, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The number of participants who responded to treatment or those who achieved remission were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, combining data from the included trials. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (n= 2277) were included in the meta-analysis. Despite the size of this sample, the pooled 95 % confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents.</b> However, compared with TCAs, patients taking milnacipran were associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse events (OR 0. 55; 95 %CI 0. 35 to 0. 85). There was also some weak evidence to suggest that patients taking milnacipran experienced fewer adverse events of sleepiness/ drowsiness, dry mouth or constipation compared with TCAs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether milnacipran is superior, inferior or the same as other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of major depression. However, there is some evidence in favour of milnacipran over TCAs in terms of dropouts due to adverse events (acceptability) and the rates of experiencing adverse events (tolerability). Information about other clinically meaningful outcomes such as cost-effectiveness and social functioning, including the ability to return to work, is lacking. Further study is needed to answer whether milnacipran would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{pharmacological}} {{and psychological}} interventions are both effective for major depression, in {{primary and secondary}} care settings antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. SEARCH METHODS: MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical company marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to duloxetine versus any other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent.</b> DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (overall 5735 participants) were included in this systematic review. Of these, three trials were unpublished. We found 11 studies (overall 3304 participants) comparing duloxetine with one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (six studies versus paroxetine, three studies versus escitalopram and two versus fluoxetine), four studies (overall 1978 participants) comparing duloxetine with a newer antidepressants (three with venlafaxine and one with desvenlafaxine, respectively) and one study (overall 453 participants) comparing duloxetine with an antipsychotic drug which is also used as an <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent,</b> quetiapine. No studies were found comparing duloxetine with tricyclic antidepressants. The pooled confidence intervals were rather wide {{and there were no}} statistically significant differences in efficacy when comparing duloxetine with other antidepressants. However, when compared with escitalopram or venlafaxine, there was a higher rate of drop out due to any cause in the patients randomised to duloxetine (odds ratio (OR) 1. 62; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 01 to 2. 62 and OR 1. 56; 95 % CI 1. 14 to 2. 15, respectively). There was also some weak evidence suggesting that patients taking duloxetine experienced more adverse events than paroxetine (OR 1. 24; 95 % CI 0. 99 to 1. 55). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mirtazapine has {{a unique}} {{mechanism}} of antidepressive action {{and is one of}} the commonly used antidepressants in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present review was to assess the evidence on the efficacy and acceptability of mirtazapine compared with other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> in the acute-phase treatment of major depression in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review group's specialised register (CCDANCTR), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years to April 2011), EMBASE, (1980 to July 2011) MEDLINE (1950 to July 2011) and PsycINFO (1974 to July 2011). Reference lists of the reports of relevant studies were checked and experts in the field contacted. The review was not limited to English-language articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants with major depression to mirtazapine versus any other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent.</b> DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was response to treatment. The secondary outcomes included dropouts and individual adverse events. Meta-analyses were conducted using the random-effects model. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 29 RCTs (n = 4974), mostly following up the participants for six weeks in outpatient clinics and inadequately reporting the risk of bias, were included. In comparison with tricyclic antidepressants (10 trials, n = 1553) there was no robust evidence to detect a difference between mirtazapine and tricyclics in terms of response at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 0. 85, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 64 to 1. 13) or at the end of acute-phase treatment (at 6 to 12 weeks) (OR 0. 89, 95 % CI 0. 72 to 1. 10). In comparison with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (12 trials, n = 2626) mirtazapine was significantly more effective at two weeks (OR 1. 57, 95 % CI 1. 30 to 1. 88) and at the end of acute-phase treatment (OR 1. 19, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 39). Mirtazapine was significantly more effective than a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (venlafaxine only, two trials, n = 415) at two weeks (OR 2. 29, 95 % CI 1. 45 to 3. 59) and at the end of acute-phase treatment (OR 1. 53, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 2. 25). In terms of dropouts, there was no robust evidence to detect a difference between mirtazapine and other antidepressants. Mirtazapine was more likely to cause weight gain or increased appetite and somnolence than SSRIs but less likely to cause nausea or vomiting and sexual dysfunction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Some statistically significant and possibly clinically meaningful differences between mirtazapine and other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> were found for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Mirtazapine is likely to have a faster onset of action than SSRIs during the acute-phase treatment. Dropouts occur similarly in participants treated with mirtazapine and those treated with other antidepressants, although the adverse event profile of mirtazapine is unique...|$|R

General practice-based data were collected on all patients of >= 18 years who were diagnosed by their GP with a new episode of depression in Belgian sentinel general practices (SGP) during 2008. Data on 1739 persons were recorded by 172 sentinel general practices. Incidence rates for GP-diagnosed depression were estimated at 719 / 100 000 men and 1440 / 100 000 women. Thirty-one per cent of patients had mild, 50 % had moderate and 19 % had severe GP-diagnosed depression. Although only 43 % of the patients at risk for suicide were considered to have severe depression, having thoughts of death or suicide was the main factor associated with increased severity of depression. Seventy-five per cent of patients received a prescription for an antidepressive agent; 29 % received a prescription for another psychoactive agent; in 36 %, non-pharmaceutical support was initiated by the GP and 25 % received a referral. In contrast with the Flemish GP guideline criteria: (i) 69 % of patients with a new episode of mild or a first episode of moderate depression were prescribed an <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent</b> and (ii) only 39 % of the patients with severe depression were both prescribed an <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent</b> and referred to a mental health service.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence {{clinical}} practice guideline {{on the treatment}} of depressive disorder recommended that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first-line option when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent.</b> DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with {{another member of the}} team. A double-entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects). MAIN RESULTS: A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95 % confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis.

40|$|Nefazodone (NEF) is an <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent</b> {{that was}} {{widely used in}} the {{treatment}} of depression until its withdrawal from the market, due to reports of liver injury and failure. NEF hepatotoxicity has been associated with mitochondrial impairment due to interference with the OXPHOS enzymatic activities, increased ROS generation and decreased antioxidant defenses. However, the mechanisms by which NEF induces mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes are not completely understood. Here, we investigated the mitochondrial mechanisms affected upon NEF exposure and whether these might be linked to drug hepatotoxicity, in order to infer liabilities of future drug candidates. Two moderately hepatotoxic NEF concentrations (20 and 50  μM) were selected from dose-response growth curves performed in HepG 2 cells. Cell viability, caspase activity, nuclear morphology, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, mitochondrial superoxide levels, and the expression of genes associated with different cellular pathways were evaluated at different time points. NEF treatment led to an increase in the expression of genes associated with DNA-damage response, antioxidant defense and apoptosis and a decreased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair, cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, which seem to constitute mechanisms underlying the observed mitochondrial and cell function impairment...|$|R
40|$|Tamoxifen (Tmf), is a {{standard}} of care for women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Endoxifen is a Tmf metabolite generated by cytochrome P 450 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6). <b>Antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> (AD) are often prescribed to women with breast cancer not only for depression, but also for anxiety and hot flashes. Some AD are substrates or inhibitors of the Tmf metabolic pathway. Therefore there may be interactions when Tmf and AD are prescribed simultaneously. Oncologic protection afforded by Tmf may become less effective or null when AD are indicated, especially in poor metabolizing patients. We performed an update of the literature about the criteria for choosing AD in women receiving Tmf. Tricyclic AD, paroxetine and fluoxetine should be avoided in patients receiving Tmf, because they are strong inhibitors of CYP 2 D 6.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{pharmacological}} {{and psychological}} interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain {{the mainstay of}} treatment in primary and secondary care settings. During the last 20 years, antidepressant prescribing has risen dramatically in western countries, {{mainly because of the}} increasing consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and newer antidepressants, which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic citalopram. OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of escitalopram in comparison with tricyclics, other SSRIs, heterocyclics and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases were searched up to July 2008. Trial databases of drug-approving agencies were hand-searched for published, unpublished and ongoing controlled trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials comparing escitalopram against any other antidepressant (including non-conventional agents such as hypericum) for patients with major depressive disorder (regardless of the diagnostic criteria used). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were entered by two review authors (double data entry). Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (with 95 % CI) using the random effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials compared escitalopram with another SSRI and eight compared escitalopram with a newer <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agent</b> (venlafaxine, bupropion and duloxetine). Escitalopram was shown to be significantly more effective than citalopram in achieving acute response (OR 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 50 to 0. 87). Escitalopram was also more effective than citalopram in terms of remission (OR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 30 to 0. 93). Significantly fewer patients allocated to escitalopram withdrew from trials compared with patients allocated to duloxetine, for discontinuation due to any cause (OR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 99). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Some statistically significant differences favouring escitalopram over other <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found, in terms of efficacy (citalopram and fluoxetine) and acceptability (duloxetine). There is insufficient evidence to detect a difference between escitalopram and other antidepressants in early response to treatment (after two weeks of treatment). Cost-effectiveness information is also needed in the field of antidepressant trials. Furthermore, as with most standard systematic reviews, the findings rely on evidence from direct comparisons.

The aim of this report is to analyse an HIV infected patient on HAART including nevirapine and taking <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents,</b> with acute toxic hepatitis. Case presentation A 39 year old patient diagnosed as HIV positive one month ago administered to the clinical ward of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology in Ege University Medical School with high fever, malaise, nausea, diarrheae and elevated liver enzymes (ALT 1558 U/L, AST 4288 U/L).

40|$|Background: HIV/AIDS {{infection}} is frequently associated with psychiatric disor- ders like psychosis, depression and anxiety. Psychiatric comorbidities {{may interfere with}} adherence to antiretroviral treatment. Therefore, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these conditions are essential. However, the administration of a psychotropic drug to HAART therapy can result in drug interactions. Objectives: This review aims to analyze the various psychotropic drugs {{that can be used in}} these patients, as well as the interactions and adverse reactions that may occur. Methods : A MEDLINE search on anglo-saxonic literature was conducted, from 1993 until 2011, using the key-words: HIV, AIDS, psychosis, depression, anxiety, secondary mania, <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents,</b> antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, HAART. Results: We found 100 articles, of which 66 were included and 34 excluded. The articles that showed no specific data on the use of psychotropic drugs in HIV patients were excluded. Discussion: Pharmachologic interactions may occur by occupation of the same metabolic pathways. Further research is needed with indications for best practices. Psychotherapeutic interventions should be considered.

40|$|Introduction: Psychotropic {{drugs are}} often implicated in {{cutaneous}} adverse drug reactions. While {{most of these}} reactions have a benign character, it is still important, however, to consider {{its role in the}} increasing stigma and treatment adherence. A small number of the cutaneous adverse drug reactions can develop into serious and potentially fatal conditions. Objectives : This article aims to review the most common cutaneous adverse drug reactions in patients taking psychotropic drugs. Methods: In this study, a search was carried out in the MEDLINE database for English language articles published, from 1999 to 2014, using as keywords: psychiatric, psychotropic, cutaneous, adverse reaction, <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents,</b> antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsant, dementia. Information available from the Portuguese regulatory and supervising agency (Infarmed) was also included. Results: 121 articles were found with reference to cutaneous adverse drug reactions associated with psychotropic drugs. The drugs most frequently reported as associated with such adverse effects were anticonvulsants used as mood stabilizers, followed by the antipsychotics. The antidementia drugs were rarely associated with serious cutaneous adverse reactions. Discussion and Conclusion: Cutaneous drug adverse reactions are common in psychiatric clinical practice and typically are minor in severity. The most severe reactions are most often {{associated with the use of}} mood stabilizing medications. Some of these side effects can be solved with reduction or drug discontinuation.

40|$|CONTEXT: Tricyclic <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> {{are widely}} used in suicide {{attempts}} and present a variety of deleterious effects. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication of such poisoning. CASE REPORT: A 55 -year-old woman ingested 120 pills of 25 mg clomipramine in a suicide attempt two days before admission. After gastric lavage in another emergency department {{on the day of}} intake, 80 pills were removed. On admission to our department, she was disoriented, complaining of a dry mouth and tremors at the extremities. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with narrow QRS complexes. Laboratory results showed high creatine phosphokinase (CK = 15, 094 U/l on admission; normal range = 26 to 140 U/l), hypocalcemia, slightly increased serum transaminases and mild metabolic acidosis. The patient's medical history included depression with previous suicide attempts, obsessive-compulsive disorder, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. She presented cardiac arrest with pulseless electric activity for seven minutes and afterwards, without sedation, showed continuous side-to-side eye movement. She developed refractory hypotension, with need for vasopressors. Ceftriaxone and clindamycin administration was started because of a hypothesis of bronchoaspiration. The patient remained unresponsive even without sedation, with continuous side-to-side eye movement and a decerebrate posture. She died two months later. Rhabdomyolysis is a very rare complication of poisoning due to tricyclic drugs. It had only previously been described after an overdose of cyclobenzaprine, which has a toxicity profile similar to tricyclic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Although arrhythmia is the most important complication, rhabdomyolysis should be investigated in cases of clomipramine poisoning...|$|R
40|$|Since ancient times, the {{essential}} oils (EOs) of many aromatic {{plants have been}} used as bioactive ingredients in drug, food and cosmetic formulations all over the world. Significant biological properties have also been attributed to Hypericum EOs. Hypericum is a genus of about 450 species in the Guttiferae family, formerly often treated separately in their own Hypericaceae family. Despite the large number of species, only Hypericum perforatum has been studied in depth by the pharmaceutical industry to control the content of its well known bioactive constituents hypericins, hyperforins and flavonoids in the flowering aerial parts. As a consequence, efficient commercial products based on the hydroalcoholic extracts or oil of H. perforatum are already commercially available as <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> or to treat skin burns. However, only a few studies have been performed on the EO constituents of H. perforatum and other members of this species. In the last few years some papers have been published on Hypericum EOs, but the number of these studies is still limited and the results are not homogenous enough to justify the use of Hypericum EOs as phytomedicines or dietary supplements. The present study is an overview of the production of EOs from Hypericum species. A summary of the typical EO constituents found in wild or cultivated plants, as well as their biological activities, is provided to point out the most significant Hypericum species, valuable as potential sources of EOs and bioactive ingredients...|$|R

However, the incidence of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome has not been fully investigated, and little has been reported on its predictors. The aim {{of this study was to}} survey the incidence of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome and clarify its predictors in a natural clinical setting. Materials and methods: Between January 2009 and July 2012, we prospectively surveyed 301 patients who had not taken any antidepressants for 1 month before presentation, and who were prescribed antidepressants for 1 month after their initial visit. Patients were classified as developing antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome if they experienced any symptoms of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, or mania during the first month. Results: Among the 301 patients, 21 (7. 0 %) developed antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome. Major depressive disorder and a diagnosis of mood disorder in first-degree relatives of patients were significantly associated with induction of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome (odds ratio 10. 2, P= 0. 001; odds ratio 4. 65, P= 0. 02; respectively). However, there was no such relationship for sex, age, class of antidepressant, combined use of benzodiazepines, or diagnosis of anxiety disorder.

40|$|Objective: This review critiques {{published}} randomized placebo-controlled trials {{pertaining to}} the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and venlafaxine {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. Method: Medline was searched for articles meeting defined inclusion criteria. The following key terms were used: depressive disorders, <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents,</b> fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, child, and adolescent. Results: Six articles met inclusion criteria. Only 2 studies claim efficacy by significant results in primary outcomes; both have since been contested in further analysis. Not one study adequately examines safety, particularly with respect to whether a link exists between antidepressant use and induction of suicidal ideation or attempts. Conclusion: Published studies on SSRI or venlafaxine use in children and adolescents are inconclusive with respect to safety and efficacy, owing to inappropriate claims of efficacy, lack of improvement in global functioning scores, nonstandardized data collection regarding adverse effects, exclusion of suicidal subjects in the recruitment process, grouping of children and adolescents together, small sample sizes, conflict of interest posed by pharmaceutical company sponsorship, and publishing bias. Future investigators should consider these factors when developing study designs. (Can J Psychiatry 2004; 49 : 557 – 563) Information on author affiliations appears {{at the end of the}} article.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{literature}} about {{the efficacy of}} antidepressant prophylaxis during interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy. Method: We have performed a database search in PUBMED and ISI Web of Knowledge (1980 -August 2009) for the available literature. the keywords prevention or prophylaxis, and depression, and interferon, and antidepressant or <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> were used. Results: the six eligible studies comprise three randomized controlled trials, two in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients and one in individuals with melanoma, and three open-label studies with HCV patients. {{the results of the}} randomized controlled trials suggest that antidepressant prophylaxis may blunt the magnitude of depressive symptoms in HCV patients and raise the rates of treatment completion. in melanoma patients, this preventive strategy may reduce the incidence of depression during IFN-alpha treatment. in addition, the open-label studies with HCV patients suggest that this strategy may reduce the onset of major depression in specific samples (current psychiatric diagnosis, major depression in remission, past history of IFN-alpha-induced depression) on IFN-alpha (re-) treatment. Conclusions: in the face of so few trials about the usefulness of prophylaxis with antidepressants before IFN-alpha treatment, there is not enough information to sufficiently and widely support this strategy to prevent depression. However, this approach may, nonetheless, bring some beneficial outcomes, if applied to specific patient groups. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The study group consisted of 101 patients suffering from DSM-IV major depression participating in a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial. Patients homozygous for the IL- 1 &beta;- 511 T allele had a significantly faster and more pronounced response to paroxetine treatment than IL- 1 &beta;- 511 C allele carriers. No association was found for the IL- 1 &beta; C- 511 T polymorphism with mirtazapine treatment response. The IL- 1 Ra VNTR showed neither an association with paroxetine nor with mirtazapine treatment response. Our results provide further suggestive evidence that time course of response and antidepressant efficacy of paroxetine, but not of mirtazapine, is influenced in a clinically relevant manner by the IL- 1 &beta; C- 511 T gene variant. Our data {{do not support the}} hypothesis that the IL- 1 Ra (86 bp) n VNTR affects antidepressant treatment response to paroxetine or mirtazapine.

At baseline, DOPPS I patients completed a quality of life survey, including four questions about sexual functioning, from which we created a composite SD scale. DOPPS II patients were asked only one question about SD. We examined predictors of SD with logistic regression, using numerous patient characteristics, comorbid conditions and additional variables. Results. Reported SD ranged from 66. 4 % (France) to 84. 5 % (Spain). The mean composite SD score ranged from 6. 4 (Spain) to 7. 9 (Germany) (on a 3 – 15 scale). Peripheral α-blockers increased odds of DOPPS I patients having their sex life bothered by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (OR = 1. 18), and there were elevated odds of arousal problems with central antagonists, loop diuretics and peripheral α-blockers (OR = 1. 19, 1. 24 and 1. 29, respectively). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines increased odds of problems with enjoyment (OR = 1. 59 and 1. 26, respectively) and arousal (OR = 1. 70 and 1. 24, respectively), and having sex life bothered by ESRD (DOPPS I: OR = 1. 36 and 1. 24; DOPPS II: 1. 30 and 1. 31, respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{are frequently}} {{used as a}} first antidepressant for major depressive disorder but have response rates of 50 % to 60 % in daily practice. For patients with insufficient response to SSRIs, switching is often applied. This article aims to systematically review the evidence for switching pharmacotherapy after a first SSRI. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search (updated until Feb. 10, 2005) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO (all indexed years) identified randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and open studies investigating switching strategies. In the absence of specific keywords for switching, we performed "sensitive" searches using free text words with wildcards ($) : "switch$" or ("alternat$" adj 5 "treat$") or ("alternat$" adj 5 "therap$") {{in combination with the}} Cochrane Collaboration search filter for RCTs, the Cochrane Collaboration Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group search filter for major depressive disorder, and MeSH terms for antidepressants (in combination with additional text words for all <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents).</b> Additionally, we included 4 recent Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression publications. We limited searches to adults and humans but did not apply language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant articles were retrieved and critically appraised. The methodology of the studies, the results on efficacy and dropouts due to side effects, and remarks were summarized in an evidence table. Three studies comparing a switch to venlafaxine or SSRIs were pooled. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eight RCTs and 23 open studies were identified, studying populations with different levels of treatment resistance. Definitions of response and remission rates varied between studies. Observed response rates after switching to any of the classes of antidepressants varied between 12 % and 86 %. Remission rates varied between 7 % and 82 %. The number of previous treatments with antidepressants was negatively correlated with treatment outcome. Rates of dropout due to side effects varied considerably across agents (5 %- 39 %). Switching to venlafaxine showed a modest and clinically equivocal benefit over SSRIs (number needed to treat = 13 [95 % CI = 9. 1 to 25. 0]). CONCLUSIONS: After a first SSRI, any switch within or between classes of antidepressants appears legitimate (second SSRI, novel dual-acting antidepressants, selective norepinephrine or nor-adrenergic/dopaminergic agents, or tricyclic anti-depressant or mianserin). No unequivocal evidence is available to prove an advantage of a between-class switch. More guidance by randomized empirical studies is needed.

Patients and methods: This was a 10 -week (8 -week active treatment/ 2 -week post-treatment) randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study (D 1448 C 00004). Patients received quetiapine XR 150 mg/day, escitalopram 10 mg/day, or placebo; patients with an inadequate response (< 20 % improvement in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score) at week two received double-dose treatment. The primary end point was week eight change from randomization in MADRS total score. Secondary end points included MADRS response (≥ 50 % improvement) and remission (score ≤ 8); Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total and item 1; Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety total, psychic, and somatic; Clinical Global Impressions – Severity of Illness total; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global; and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire – Short Form percentage maximum total scores. Tolerability was assessed throughout. Results: A total of 471 patients was randomized. No significant improvements in MADRS total score were observed at week eight (last observation carried forward) with either active treatment (quetiapine XR, - 17. 21 [P= 0. 174]; escitalopram, - 16. 73 [P= 0. 346]) versus placebo (- 15. 61). There {{were no significant differences}} in secondary end points versus placebo, with the exception of week-eight change in PSQI global score (quetiapine XR, - 4. 96 [P< 0. 01] versus placebo, - 3. 37). Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of observed-case data suggested that the primary analysis may not be robust. Most commonly reported adverse events included dry mouth, somnolence, and dizziness for quetiapine XR, and headache and nausea for escitalopram. Conclusion: In this study, neither quetiapine XR (150 / 300 mg/day) nor escitalopram (10 / 20 mg/day) showed significant separation from placebo.

40|$|Intraoperative hemodynamic {{changes and}} loss of blood with the {{associated}} risk of allogeneic blood transfusion are risk factors for complications in surgical patients. The use of medication in the perioperative period may influence these risk factors and consequently the frequency of complications. Perioperative medication includes both regular drugs that surgical patients receive already for comorbidity, as well as drug therapy especially initiated to optimise a patient’s condition in the perioperative period, e. g. recombinant human erythropoietin. There is scant evidence from randomized controlled trials to guide perioperative medication management. Therefore, the studies in this thesis focused {{on the influence of}} medications on clinical parameters in surgical patients. The main objectives of this thesis were to investigate the effects of antidepressant agents on intraoperative hemodynamics and blood loss in patients who continued the use of their antidepressants during surgery and to investigate the effectiveness of preoperative treatment with erythropoietin in daily clinical practice. We found that severe intraoperative hemodynamic events did not occur more frequently in patients who continued the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the perioperative period compared to nonusers. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) before surgery was associated with a briefer duration of intraoperative hypotensive episodes without introducing severe or sustained hypertensive episodes. Users of serotonergic antidepressants showed a moderate increase in blood loss during orthopedic surgery that did not result in increased transfusion requirements. The use of SSRIs was not associated with an increase in the occurrence of QT interval prolongation. The introduction of a preoperative erythropoietin protocol as part of a multifaceted blood management program reduced the transfusion rate in total hip arthroplasty patients. However, the effectiveness of preoperative erythropoietin therapy in daily clinical practice is lower than the efficacy shown in randomised clinical trials. We found that a substantial number of total hip arthroplasty patients showed a poor response to preoperative treatment with erythropoietin. This poor response was more frequent in patients using angiotensin II receptor antagonists or vitamin K antagonists, and in patients having a high BMI. As a result, poor responders more frequently required allogeneic blood transfusion. In conclusion, we showed that the use of antidepressants in the perioperative period influences hemodynamic parameters and blood loss in patients during surgery, but that the continuation of these <b>antidepressive</b> <b>agents</b> seems safe in daily clinical practice. For these studies, we used only routinely documented patient data. Further investigation should be performed to fill in knowledge gaps on the potential effects of drugs on clinical and hemodynamic parameters in the perioperative period. If routinely documented patient data in electronic medical records will be more accurately recorded as well as become more easily accessible, this will offer many opportunities for clinical research on drug effects in surgical patients. Furthermore, we showed that the effectiveness of preoperative treatment with erythropoietin in daily clinical practice does not meet its efficacy as shown in randomised clinical trials.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} depressive symptoms among oncology patients and identify simultaneous use of antineoplastic and antidepressant agents. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that interviewed 56 oncology patients using two data collection instruments: a questionnaire covering clinical and sociodemographic data and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), for assessment of depressive symptoms. For data analysis, descriptive statistics were used to {{determine the}} prevalence of depressive symptoms and the chi-square test was used to evaluate associations between sociodemographic and clinical variables and depressive symptoms. Results: A 26. 7 % (15 patients) prevalence of depression was detected. Just eight of these 15 patients (53. 3 %) were receiving treatment for depression. In the sample as a whole, 13 of the patients interviewed (23. 2 %) were taking antidepressants and 11 of these 13 patients (19. 6 %) were taking <b>antidepressive</b> and antineoplastic <b>agents</b> simultaneously.
