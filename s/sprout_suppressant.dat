40|$|Chlorpropham, {{also known}} as isopropyl-N-(3 -chlorophenyl) {{carbamate}} or CIPC is a <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressant</b> and plant growth regulator of the chemical class derived from carbamic acid (NH 2 COOH).

40|$|Investigations on potato tuber {{dormancy}} are {{of basic}} importance for both food products and seed tubers. The physiology of dormancy is not clear, although significant {{progress has been}} made in recent years. Plant hormones are involved in dormancy control, but experimental evidence is often contradictory. The auxin indoleacetic acid (IAA) appears to induce sprouting, as its concentration increases in tuber buds during dormancy release. Contrasting results were obtained for abscisic acid. Generally, this hormone is thought to be responsible for both inducing and maintaining bud dormancy, but it was demonstrated that its concentration in bud tissues rises in dormant tubers until they reach sprouting time. Based on recent evidence, a decisive role in tuber dormancy control could be ascribed to sprout-inducing hormones, such as IAA, despite classical hypotheses attributing greater importance to the equilibrium between sprout-promoting and sprout-inhibiting regulators. Potato tuber storage is a crucial phase of the whole production cycle. Storage techniques include physical (low temperature, controlled atmosphere) and chemical (<b>sprout</b> <b>suppressants)</b> treatments, often applied simultaneously, and may change depending on crop product (food or seed). Chemical <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressants</b> may cause food tuber contamination with potentially toxic residues, while their residual phytotoxic activity may negatively affect bud outgrowth of seed tubers. Research has recently highlighted the interesting features of the monoterpene carvone, whose low mammalian toxicity makes its use advisable. The sprout inhibiting activity of this chemical rapidly weakens when treatments are discontinued, thus making it suitable for seed tuber preservation...|$|R
40|$|The 21 st Century {{markets will}} demand a {{continuous}} supply of competitively priced potatoes with an ever higher quality, using minimum, if any, chemicals.

BASIC PARAMETERS Typical storage periods In a normal year the temperate British Isles climate allows potatoes to be held until mid March using only outside air and a controller which can blow the crop during any cool (but not frosty) period. However the predicted upwards trends in temperature through global warming will reduce this ambient storage period. Outside these winter months it is essential to use refrigeration.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of Defra Project OF 0127 T. The main {{objective}} of this review was to establish best storage practice for field vegetables, potatoes, cereals and top fruit. A literature review was carried out and information was also gathered from the industry. Information relevant to growers and farmers has been drawn together to provide a comprehensive base from which technical advisory leaflets can be produced. The costs of different storage methods are provided, and case studies used wherever possible. In general, organic crops can be stored using the same methods as conventional crops {{but there is an}} increased risk that sometimes there will be higher storage losses because pesticides and <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressants</b> are not used. On the whole, specific problems with pests and diseases can be avoided using good organic husbandry techniques and by storing undamaged, healthy crops. In the case of cereals storage at correct moisture content and temperatures can avoid pests and moulds. However, there are some areas where more technical development or research would be useful and these have been identified. Relatively few organic growers store vegetables, but in order to maintain a supply of good quality UK produce throughout the year, more long term cold storage space is required (either on farm or in co-operative type stores). Based on the limited data available, economic analysis revealed that long term storage of organic vegetables has generally not been profitable. However, as the market expands in the future, it is likely that storage will become as essential for vegetables as it is for organic cereals and fruit...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of crops {{of a light}} fry colour, from store, is {{of the utmost importance}} to processors. Poor fry colour leads to rejection of crops on a quality basis. The application of Chlorpropham (CIPC) <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressant,</b> as a thermal fog is associated with a deterioration in fry colour. The BPC funded project at the University of Glasgow and its collaborator Sutton Bridge Experimental Unit investigates the effects of CIPC use on the processing quality of stored potatoes. CIPC is the only <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressant</b> available for medium and long-term storage for processing in Britain. In the UK the majority of CIPC treatments are conducted as thermal fog applications. This is considered to be the most practical means of achieving successful sprout control. The introduction of a hot fog into potato stores has a disruptive influence. It can physiologically alter the potatoes by creating a stressful environment. Tuber respiration rate increases and so the crop will age. Experimental trials conducted as part of this project have shown that it is the fogging process itself that is responsible for the decrease in crop quality following application, not the CIPC formulation applied. Studies revealed that both carbon dioxide and ethylene were produced naturally by crop and from the combustion of petrol used to generate thermal fogs. Initially the fry colour problems were linked with carbon dioxide in combustion gases and from increased respiration. However, carbon dioxide output from thermal fogger machines was less significant than expected. The levels were consistently lower than concentrations shown to have a deleterious effect in previous BPC funded work. Ethylene is present in thermal fogs as a by-product of burning the hydrocarbon fuel used to generate fog. The concentration of ethylene produced is associated with the running conditions of the fogger machine I. e. burner temperature, type and volume of fuel used etc. The ethylene created in a standard CIPC thermal-fog application is sufficient to induce a physiological response in tubers. Exposure of crop to ethylene effects respiration, dormancy period, sprout morphology, reducing sugar concentration and hence fry colour. The extent of the outcome depends on exposure time and concentration. Following assessment of the fogging situation, various means of reducing the impact of CIPC application on fry colour were evaluated. Different approaches were undertaken and included both attempting to control and remove the contaminants present in thermal fogs. By ventilating stores earlier than the recommended twenty-four hour period after treatment a vast improvement in fry colour was observed. In doing this the exposure time of crop to contaminants was greatly reduced. In the experimental work the stores were ventilated eight hours after treatment. This allowed adequate time for the effective fraction of the thermal god to settle. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDormancy {{duration}} is {{an important}} quality aspect of both ware and seed potato tubers and may be extended by the application of chemical <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressants.</b> The replacement of these synthetic compounds by essential oils with sprouting-inhibitory properties {{may contribute to the}} sustainable cultivation of potato. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how the postharvest application of carvone affects potato tubers grown from true potato seed (hybrid CIP IP 88008). Ten days after harvest, tubers were placed in air-tight glass containers and carvone was applied repeatedly (300 mL/ 1000 kg tubers) while untreated tubers were used for the control. The containers were stored at 5, 10 and 20 °C and opened every two days for 10 minutes for aeration. The number of sprouts per tuber, rate of respiration, fresh weight loss and concentration of glucose, fructose and sucrose in tuber tissue from the buds (‘eyes’) and the parenchyma were recorded. Carvone application did not affect bud dormancy duration at 5 °C and buds did not sprout even after 98 days’ storage. At 10 and 20 °C, carvone application prolonged dormancy, but at 20 °C a high percentage of rotted tubers (40 %) was observed. At all storage temperatures, carvone reduced weight loss but increased the rate of tuber respiration. Carvone application did not affect sugar content at 5 οC, but after 68 days of storage at 10 οC the concentration of fructose increased and sucrose decreased. However, after 4 months of storage no differences in sugar concentration were recorded. It is concluded that carvone application can effectively prolong bud dormancy during storage at 10 οC. Even though the concentration of reducing sugars and the tuber respiration rate increased, there were no negative effects on the quality aspects of tubers (concentration of glucose, fructose and sucrose) after long term storage...|$|R
40|$|Potatoes {{are widely}} {{consumed}} in UK {{and many other}} countries. There is a continuous demand for potatoes all year around both from consumers and retailers such that several postharvest technologies {{are being used to}} meet this demand. Sprouting is the main phenomenon affecting both the quality and marketability of potatoes during long term storage. Several <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressants</b> are widely used (e. g. maleic hydrazide and chloropropham, but there are concerns over their toxicity such that alternatives have been sought. Continuous exposure of potato tubers to ethylene (usually 10 µL L- 1) during storage was approved by the Chemicals Regulation Directorate since 2003. Even though potatoes have been regarded as non climacteric, this study aimed to examine the effect of different ethylene regimes in combination with or without 1 -methylcyclopropene on physiological, biochemical and mechanical characteristics of a selection of important UK cultivars. In 2008 - 2009, ten potato cultivars were examined for their response to four different ethylene regimes during storage. Storage time and ethylene treatments had a cultivar specific effect on all the measured parameters (sprouting, sugars, texture). Ethylene applied after first indication of sprouting was as effective at sprout inhibition as when applied continuously for certain potato cultivars; therefore this could be considered as a more environmentally and economical alternative for sprouting inhibition. In addition, sugar accumulation was retarded when tubers were subjected to ethylene at the first indication of sprouting compared to those treated with continuous ethylene. In 2009 - 2010, four potato cultivars were studied and the effect of 1 -MCP either before or after ethylene treatment on sprouting, respiration rate, endogenous ethylene production and texture was investigated. 1 -MCP is believed to interact with ethylene receptors and therefore prevent or retard ethylene dependent responses. 1 -MCP seemed to effectively block ethylene binding sites when applied before storage of tubers in ethylene resulting in less tuber sugar accumulation. In 2010 - 2011, the effect and timings of 1 -MCP and ethylene treatments on sprouting, tuber respiration, endogenous ethylene production and sugars on two potato cultivars was studied. 1 -MCP effectively suppressed the action of ethylene in terms of the increase in the respiration rate or ethylene production and sugar accumulation. Selected potato samples were also analysed quantitavely for an array of phytohormone using a newly developed UPLC QToF MS method. This method had the advantage of quantifying simultaneously a significant number of plant growth regulators that are present in potato (ABA and its metabolites, cytokinins and gibberellins) ...|$|R
40|$|Choice {{of variety}} is more {{important}} when growing organic vegetables than when growing conventional crops since severe restrictions are placed on the treatments which organic growers can apply to maximise yield and maintain quality.

Organic produce may also have higher disease and pest loads which will affect crop value and shelf life. In this study, the shelf life of selected varieties of organically grown early carrots, broccoli, lettuce, novelty salads, parsnips and potatoes will be investigated under cool cabinet (20 ºC, 50 % relative humidity, 1200 lux lighting) and ambient (1 ºC, 80 % relative humidity, 1200 lux lighting) conditions.

40|$|Research {{objectives}} were to study dormancy/sprout control in potato and sweetpotato, {{and to identify}} novel sprout control strategies. Consistent with sprout stimulation by gibberellins (GAs) in potato, 10 mM GA 3 enhanced sprout length and number in sweetpotato roots and sprout growth was decreased by 20 ml/L piccolo (GA synthesis inhibitor). Continuous application of 10 ppm ethylene or greater prevented sprouting in sweetpotato roots over 4 weeks storage at 25 ° C. Sprout growth was also inhibited by 1000 ppm aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) (ethylene synthesis inhibitor) or 625 ppb 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) (ethylene antagonist). Continuous ethylene treatment or single 1 -MCP treatment could be a practical sprout control method for sweetpotatoes stored at > 15 ° C. 5 ppm or greater ethylene increased root respiration rates, but this effect was reduced by 1 -MCP or AVG. Sugar content in ethylene treated roots +/- 1 -MCP or AVG were lower than untreated roots, with lowest levels in roots treated with ethylene alone. Hormonal control of dormancy/sprout growth was studied in excised buds from potato tubers transformed to over-express a bacteria gene encoding 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose 5 phosphate synthase (DXS), which exhibit arrested buds, Five weeks post-harvest over-expressing lines, DXS 1 and DXS 2, showed greater sprout growth compared to wild type when treated with 1 mM GA 3 or tZR in 2009, whereas DXS 1 showed less sprout growth 4 weeks post-harvest in 2007.

40|$|Work {{described}} in this thesis was designed to address a number of environmental issues relating {{to the use of}} chlorpropham (CIPC) as a <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressant</b> in potato stores. Studies considered the behaviour of CIPC during the application process and storage and also the potential for it to be released into the environment. All commercial studies were carried out in box stores, rather than bulk stores. A survey of potato growers was carried out to provide up-to-date industry information on store management practice and {{to determine the extent of}} chlorpropham use in the UK. Results confirmed that the vast majority of crop held in the UK for both pre-packing and processing is treated with chlorpropham. In most cases, several applications are necessary to maintain sprout control throughout the season, which highlights the inefficiency of the application process. Thermal fog application (the industry standard) is known to be inefficient, and to result in uneven distribution of chlorpropham around the store. This can lead to unacceptably high chemical residues in crop at certain locations, and poor sprout control in places that do not receive the correct dose. The imminent introduction of a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for chlorpropham means that store managers must be able to predict with confidence the amount of chemical reaching each tuber. Analysis of crop from commercial stores found chemical levels ranging from 0 - 50 mg kg- 1 following conventional application. Washing significantly reduced these very high levels in most cases. Improvements in chemical distribution (and a lowering of the highest chemical levels) were seen when the movement of air and fog around the store were manipulated using fans or by restricting air flow using polythene sheeting. A method for the collection and analysis of air samples was developed and used to quantify CIPC in samples of air from treated stores. Vapour concentrations were found to be of the order of mg l- 1 (parts per billion), and to increase linearly with air temperature. 3 -chloroaniline (a metabolite of CIPC) was also identified in the air samples, suggesting significant breakdown of the CIPC molecule may occur during chemical application or storage. The mechanism of breakdown was not identified. Contaminated fabrics within the store are believed to provide a reservoir of chemical that can readily volatilise and be found in the vapour phase. The presence of chlorpropham in the air has implications for crop contamination and the extent of chemical loss from the store. Samples of effluent from potato washing plants were collected and analysed on several occasions. The CIPC concentration to liquid effluent (after removal of all suspended material) was found to range from several mg/l (parts per million) in untreated samples to < 0. 01 mg l- 1 following filtration and digestion.

40|$|Onion (Allium cepa L.) is {{the most}} {{economically}} important Allium crop. Onion cultivars adapted for growth in temperate regions require long days for bulb initiation, so the summer crop is stored over-winter. Deterioration in store {{is largely due to}} resumption of growth. Extended storage of onions is currently dependent on the synthetic <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressant</b> maleic hydrazide, whose future use is uncertain due to pressure to reduce residues in foods. Abscisic acid (ABA) has previously been linked with dormancy in a relative of onion (A. wakegi). Bulb ABA concentration in three onion cultivars (viz. Renate, Ailsa Craig and SS 1) with contrasting storage lives declined exponentially during controlled atmosphere (CA – 3 % CO 2, 5 % O 2; 2 °C) storage at the same rate in each cultivar. Sprouting occurred at a minimal ABA concentration (ca. 50 - 120 ng g- 1 DW). It was proposed that extended periods of high concentrations of ABA may delay sprouting. An ABA analogue (PBI- 365) and exogenous ABA, were applied as preharvest foliar sprays (cvs. Renate, Carlos, Dinaro, Hysam, Red Baron and SS 1), or as postharvest bulb soaks (cv. Hysam) with the aim of increasing endogenous ABA concentration and, thereby, extending the storage period. Endogenous bulb ABA concentration was not affected. Bulb ABA concentration again decreased during storage at a range of temperatures (4, 12 and 20 °C) and sprouting occurred at minimal ABA concentration (ca. 75 - 150 ng g- 1 DW). After the onset of sprouting, ABA concentration increased again, probably due to synthesis by the sprout. The concentration of certain carbohydrates has been linked with storage potential. No straightforward relationship between ABA and non-structural carbohydrate (NSC; fructose, glucose, sucrose and fructans) metabolism could be determined. It was therefore postulated that ABA is more likely {{to play a role in}} mediating cell elongation rather than cell division, or that minimal ABA concentration could be a trigger for remobilisation of carbohydrates. Controlled atmosphere (CA) is used to extend storage life of onions; however, shelf-life can be compromised. The effects of the transition between CA (3 % CO 2, 5 % O 2; 2 °C) and air storage on ABA concentration, quality characteristics, respiration rate(RR) and NSCs in three onion cultivars (viz. Renate, Carlos and SS 1) were investigated. The RR of the short storing cultivar, SS 1, was greatest by ca. 0. 5 -fold. The RR increased on removal from CA storage, with no accompanying decrease in carbohydrate concentration, indicating that the increased RR may have been a transient stress response. Storage of onions cv. SS 1 for three weeks in air, followed by three weeks CA was as effective in suppressing sprout growth as six weeks continuous CA storage. Bulb ABA concentration decreased significantly between the time of harvest and after curing. Therefore the current practice of curing onions for extended periods at high temperatures could be reducing bulb ABA concentration, and therefore storage life. The literature concerning the role of ethylene in onion storage is limited and conflicting. The effect of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP; an ethylene perception inhibitor) on sprout growth in onions cv. SS 1 stored at a range of temperatures (4, 12 and 20 °C) was investigated, along with quality characteristics, NSCs and ABA. Sprout growth was reduced in onions treated with 1 -MCP and stored at 4 or 12 °C, but not at 20 °C. Approximately 2 -fold greater concentrations of sucrose, glucose and fructose were maintained in 1 -MCP-treated bulbs stored at 12 °C as compared with untreated bulbs. It appeared that 1 -MCP reduced carbohydrate metabolism. Both ethylene and ABA are highly likely to impact significantly on onion storage life. The results are discussed in relation to the potential to influence storage life by changes in horticultural practices, including the recommendation to re-evaluate the curing and drying protocol, and to investigate the possibility of delaying the start of CA storage.

40|$|Abstract In the UK, up to {{six million}} tonnes of {{potatoes}} are produced annually {{and more than half}} of this production is stored for the fresh market and food processing. To maintain potato quality from sprouting, chlorpropham (CIPC) is currently used as the main <b>sprout</b> <b>suppressant</b> in commercial potato stores. Questions have been raised about the safety of application of this compound in potato stores due to increasing concern about the toxicity of its residue and degradation products mainly 3 -chloroaniline (3 -CA) on the potato tubers. To date, there is no realistic replacement of CIPC for inhibiting sprouting of potatoes destined for processing. Searching for alternatives is crucial particularly as most supermarkets demand foods free of chemicals. The sprout inhibitor 1, 4 -dimethylnaphthalene (1, 4 -DMN) can be a suitable replacement for CIPC as it is naturally occurring in the potato and currently used in many countries in the world. To introduce this compound to the UK for commercial use, many investigations must be conducted to ensure its safety for human health and the environment. This study intended to focus on the determination of the residue level of 1, 4 -DMN, CIPC and its metabolite 3 -CA in potato and water samples, hence developing analytical methods was required as a preliminary step. In this study, three HPLC systems were used for validating a separation method for the analysis of 1, 4 -dimethylnaphthalene and its internal standard 2 -methylnaphthalene (2 -MeN). Under the same chromatographic conditions, all these systems achieved excellent separation on a Jones-ODS column (Hypersil ODS 5 µm, 250 mm x 4. 6 mm) at ambient temperature isocratically using 70 % acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min, 20 µL injection volume, a run time of 10 minutes and a detection wavelength of 228 nm. All three systems showed high precision (RSD% < 1 %), good linearity of the calibration curves at two concentration ranges (0. 02 – 0. 1 and 0. 2 – 1. 0 µg/mL) of each 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN with coefficient of determination (R 2) of the regression line of 0. 990 or more. The best system SpectraSERIES UV 100 -autosampler system was selected for the remainder of this research as it offered lower values for both the limit of detection (LOD) (0. 001 – 0. 004 µg/mL) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) (0. 002 – 0. 013 µg/mL) for both compounds. A second isocratic reversed phase HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for analysis of 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN using methanol as a substitute solvent for standards and mobile phase preparations to overcome the problem of a global shortage of acetonitrile during 2008 – 2009. The best separation was achieved on the Phenomenex® (ODS- 2 250 mm x 4. 60 mm 5 µm Sphereclone) column using 90 % methanol as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min and a 6 minute run time. The method was validated producing good precision, linearity and low values of LOQ (~ 0. 001 µg/mL). A straightforward and rapid isocratic HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of both CIPC and its degradation product 3 -CA using methanol as a solvent and propham (IPC) as an internal standard. To achieve high resolution of the three compounds, the chromatographic conditions selected were: Phenomenex® column (ODS- 2 250 mm x 4. 60 mm 5 µm Sphereclone), 62 % methanol at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min, detection wavelength of 210 nm and a 15 minute run time. Method validation confirmed good precision, acceptable linearity and low values of LOD (~ 0. 01 µg/mL) and LOQ (~ 0. 04 µg/mL) for CIPC and 3 -CA. These proposed HPLC methods are suitable to apply for the determination of the studied compounds in both potatoes and water samples. Quantitative laboratory analysis of 1, 4 -DMN, 2 -MeN, CIPC and 3 -CA in water solutions showed acceptable standard preparations in water with good precision and linearity and lower values of LOD and LOQ close to those obtained in organic solvent preparations. An adsorption study of 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN on laboratory ware showed that glass materials were acceptable to use whereas there was a considerable adsorption to plastic containers and filters. In contrast, 3 -CA showed no adsorption onto any of the laboratory ware tested. CIPC also showed good recoveries with most of the materials tested. In reviewing the literature, no suitable published method for the simultaneous determination of CIPC and its metabolite 3 -CA in potato peel was found. A simple analytical method was developed based on methanol-soaking overnight extraction coupled with HPLC-UV for analysis of CIPC and 3 -CA in potato samples using IPC as internal standard. The method was validated and the calculated limit of quantification was 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 02 µg/g in whole tuber for CIPC, IPC and 3 -CA respectively. The efficiency of the method reported recovery values of up to 90 % for both CIPC and IPC through spiking organic potato peel at three spiking levels of 0. 8, 8. 0 and 80 µg/g. By contrast, 3 -CA recoveries offered very low values of 10 and 23 % at concentration levels of 8. 0 and 80 µg/g respectively and no peak was detected at the lower level of 0. 8 µg/g. This method was compared with the routine Soxhlet-GC method used for the analysis of the residues of CIPC in potato samples at the University of Glasgow laboratory and gave results approximately 23 % higher residues of CIPC. This new method at this stage was suitable to extract CIPC in 20 potato samples daily. Nevertheless, an interesting finding was that despite the low recovery of 3 -CA it was identified in treated potato samples. This unanticipated low recovery is noteworthy and indicates that the actual residue may be much higher. A comprehensive study was made to improve the extractability of 3 -CA from potato samples investigating parameters including potato variety, extracting solvent, extraction method, spiking procedure and different treatments for potato samples. All these experimental trials showed no recovery improvements, thus four possible mechanisms were suggested for poor recovery of 3 -CA including volatilisation, reaction with potato components, enzymatic activity and ion exchange related to pH. Under the laboratory work experimental conditions, no measurable loss of 3 -CA by volatilisation was found. No reaction of 3 -CA was found to occur with other potato components under the experimental conditions used. However, the Schiff base reaction and/or hydrogen bonding may link the amino group of 3 -CA and some functional groups abundant in potatoes (e. g. carbonyl, quinone). This study also showed a potential role for enzymatic activity in the poor recovery of 3 -CA. Using antioxidants or acidity to inhibit this enzymatic activity was shown to enhance the extractability of 3 -CA. Binding of 3 -CA to potato peel substrates by ion exchange is unlikely as the pKa value of 3 -CA is lower than the pH of the potato. However, using sulphuric acid combined with methanol as an extracting solution improved the recovery. Optimising the extraction process showed that using a mixture of 1 M H 2 SO 4 in 50 % methanol as an extracting solution for 24 hours at 50 ºC improved the extraction recovery of 3 -CA up to 85 %. This final extraction method was applied for the determination of the residues of both CIPC and 3 -CA in commercial potato samples which had received many applications of CIPC, thus reporting high residue values. Additionally, potato samples were taken from different UK stores for the storage season 2010 – 2011 which had received CIPC application at high and low temperature (450 ºC and 270 ºC respectively) fogging. Analysis of these potato samples showed no significant difference between high and low temperature for the first application of CIPC for both residues of 3 -CA and CIPC. A significant increase in both compounds was found between the first and second application at 270 ºC indicating a possible build up with time during storage.
