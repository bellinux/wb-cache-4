5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Wallace gave {{evidence}} {{before a}} Royal Commission investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted {{to support his}} testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. The Lancet averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by The Lancet, which stated that it contained {{many of the same}} errors as his evidence given to the commission.|$|E

25|$|Bathypelagic {{fish are}} black, or {{sometimes}} red, with few photophores. When photophores are used, {{it is usually}} to entice prey or attract a mate. Because food is so scarce, bathypelagic predators are not <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> feeding habits, but grab whatever come close enough. They accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping gill rakers which prevent small prey that have been swallowed from escaping.|$|E
25|$|The Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory {{includes}} creativity as {{a subset}} of intelligence. Specifically, it {{is associated with the}} broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include: ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al. conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests, and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor. Martindale extended the CHC-theory {{in the sense that it}} was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{pharmacodynamics}} (what a drug does to the body), the hydrophobic effect is the major driving force for the binding of drugs to their receptor targets. [...] On the other hand, hydrophobic drugs {{tend to be more}} toxic because they, in general, are retained longer, have a wider distribution within the body (e.g., intracellular), are somewhat less <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> binding to proteins, and finally are often extensively metabolized. In some cases the metabolites may be chemically reactive. [...] Hence it is advisable to make the drug as hydrophilic as possible while it still retains adequate binding affinity to the therapeutic protein target. For cases where a drug reaches its target locations through passive mechanisms (i.e., diffusion through membranes), the ideal distribution coefficient for the drug is typically intermediate in value (neither too lipophilic, nor too hydrophilic); in cases where molecules reach their targets otherwise, no such generalization applies.|$|E

50|$|Fay and Wu's H is a {{statistical}} test created by and named after two researchers Justin Fay and Chung-I Wu. The {{purpose of the}} test is to distinguish between a DNA sequence evolving randomly ("neutrally") and one evolving under positive selection. This test is an advancement over Tajima's D, {{which is used to}} differentiate neutrally evolving sequences from those evolving non-randomly (through directional selection or balancing selection, demographic expansion or contraction or genetic hitchhiking).

2500|$|Malaysia has {{a number}} of grammar schools, a {{majority}} of which were established when the country was under the British. They are generally not known as [...] "grammar schools" [...] but are similarly <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> intake. Among the best known being the Penang Free School, the Victoria Institution (Kuala Lumpur), Malay College Kuala Kangsar, the English College (Johor Bahru), King George V School (Seremban) and St George's Institution (Taiping). Mission schools set up by various Christian denominations paralleled the selective state school albeit not with the same degree of selectivity. Notable mission schools include the La Sallian family of schools and those set up by the Marist Brothers and Methodist missionaries. Before the 1970s when Malay was made the medium of instruction, many such selective schools became known for providing excellent English-medium education and have produced many notable alumni, including the current Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Tun Razak (St. John's Institution) and all five of his predecessors.|$|E
2500|$|Herrings, {{along with}} Atlantic cod and sprat, {{are the most}} {{important}} commercial species to humans in the Baltic Sea. The analysis of the stomach contents of these fish indicate Atlantic cod is the top predator, preying on the herring and sprat. Sprat are competitive with herring for the same food resources. [...] This is evident in the two species' vertical migration in the Baltic Sea, where they compete for the limited zooplankton available and necessary for their survival. Sprat are highly <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> diet and eat only zooplankton, while herring are more eclectic, adjusting their diet as they grow in size. In the Baltic, copepods of the genus Acartia can be present in large numbers. However, they are small in size with a high escape response, so herring and sprat avoid trying to catch them. These copepods also tend to dwell more in surface waters, whereas herring and sprat, especially during the day, tend to dwell in deeper waters.|$|E

50|$|Nymphs {{can be very}} <b>selective</b> <b>in</b> {{choosing}} <b>their</b> habitat {{choices and}} will often occur only in certain stretches of a particular river or stream. The upturned tip of their abdomen is exposed when they burrow into the sand. This strategy allows them to breathe while buried by pumping water {{in and out of}} the tip of the abdomen. Unlike most other species, the gray sanddragon nymphs emerge as adults during the day. Although many records are sparse, the adults are believed to fly from early June to September. Gray sanddragons can't tolerate cooler temperatures and are rarely seen flying on cool or cloudy days.|$|R

To solve electromagnetic scattering problems for such electrically large dielectric objects, which can have losses and frequency <b>selective</b> surfaces <b>in</b> <b>their</b> construction, a hybrid FE method has been chosen.

40|$|ABSTRACT Water {{permeability}} through single-file channels {{is affected}} by intrinsic factors such as their size and polarity and by external determinants like <b>their</b> lipid environment <b>in</b> the membrane. Previous computational studies revealed that the obstruction of the channel by lipid headgroups can be long-lived, {{in the range of}} nanoseconds, and that pore-length-matching membrane mimetics could speed up water permeability. To test the hypothesis of lipid-channel interactions modulating channel permeability, we designed different gramicidin A derivatives with attached acyl chains. By combining extensive moleculardynamics simulations and single-channel water permeation measurements, we show that by tuning lipid-channel interactions, these modifications reduce the presence of lipid headgroups in the pore, which leads to a clear and <b>selective</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>their</b> water permeability...|$|R

Thus, early domestication of wolves may have occurred not only as wolf populations became tamer, but also as they exploited human preferences for paedomorphic characteristics. Thes...|$|R
