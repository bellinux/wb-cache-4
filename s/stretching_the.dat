5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but <b>stretching</b> <b>the</b> reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is <b>stretching.</b> <b>The</b> stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|Just {{days before}} his death, Walker had tried to bolster the defences of the central and eastern {{sections}} of the 38th parallel by <b>stretching</b> <b>the</b> South Korean forces from Chuncheon to the Korean east coast. Following his instructions, the ROK III Corps was placed around Chuncheon while the ROK I Corps was deployed on the east coast. Meanwhile, the ROK II Corps, with its strength reduced to a single infantry division {{in the aftermath of}} the Ch'ongch'on River battle, filled the gap between the ROK I and III Corps. However, with the absence of the US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were gaps between the understrength South Korean units. Because the South Korean forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950, most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training, and out of the four South Korean divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy. Taking advantage of the situation, the North Korean forces had been probing the South Korean lines since mid-December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts. On December 27, 1950, the KPA II Corps managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK 9th Infantry Division on the ROK I Corps' left flank at Hyon-ri. This development threatened to destabilize the entire UN eastern front.|$|E
5|$|Thematically, Viking metal draws {{extensively}} on elements of black metal, but the lyrics and imagery are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation {{of violence and}} virility through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and black metal bands, {{with an interest in}} ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology and imagery of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep the Satanic elements of black metal but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes. Visuals such as album art, band photos, website design, and merchandise all highlight the dark and violent outlook of Viking metal lyrics and themes. The art on albums by Viking metal artists frequently depicts Viking Age archeological finds: Thor's hammers are especially common, but other artifacts such as Oseberg posts and even the Sutton Hoo helmet have appeared. Some bands incorporate far more ancient, pre-medieval imagery, such as the Finnish band Moonsorrow's use of prehistoric rock carvings and megaliths. Other Finnish bands, such as Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani, focus on Sami traditions and shamanism, further <b>stretching</b> <b>the</b> definition of Viking metal. Not all bands rely on Viking-related visuals or other ancestral images to aid their musical character: for instance, the members of Týr do not wear Viking costumes on stage, and only their folk-influenced music and lyrical themes distinguish them from other heavy metal bands.|$|E
