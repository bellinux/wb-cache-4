40|$|Objetivo: Este estudo objetivou avaliar a precisão de infusões de medicamentos em dois modelos de Bomba de Infusão (BI), de equipo específico do fabricante e de equipo universal, a concordância entre estes dois modelos e sua relação de custo e efetividade. Método: Foi realizado um ensaio clínico randomizado em pacientes internados em um {{hospital}} geral universitário de 740 leitos. As unidades de internação foram randomizadas através de sorteio simples para cada modelo de equipamento e os pacientes foram incluídos de acordo com indicação de uso de BI, conforme protocolo institucional. Os tipos de erros e reações adversas foram classificados por meio de algoritmos. Foi calculado o custo de cada sistema de bomba de infusão, pela vida útil da tecnologia. Resultados: Em 55 pacientes foram acompanhadas 310 infusões, 117 no grupo da bomba de infusão de equipo universal e 193 na bomba de infusão de equipo especifico. Houve semelhança (p= 0, 40) entre o tempo programado e o observado nas infusões por meio da bomba de equipo específico (- 2, 1 ± 19 min) e universal (0, 08 ± 23 min). Percentualmente, também não foi observada diferença (p= 0, 70) entre a infusão por bomba de equipo específico (- 0, 15 ± 3, 8 %) e universal (0, 1 ± 6, 3 %). Foram observados 14 (4, 5 %) erros de medicação, semelhantes (p= 0, 58) entre os tipos de BI. Os custos cumulativos entre os dois sistemas de bombas se equivaleram em 30 meses, sendo que após 11 anos, foram significativamente maiores para bomba de equipo específico em 184, 29 %. Conclusão: Ambos modelos de BI avaliadas mostraram-se igualmente seguras para administração EV de fármacos, sendo o modelo de equipo universal mais vantajoso economicamente ao longo da vida útil dos equipamentos. Objective: This study {{aimed to}} evaluate the accuracy of drug infusion in two models of infusion pumps (IP), one with a specific IV set and other with universal IV set, the correlation between these two models and their relation of cost and effectiveness. Method: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in hospitalized patients in a university general hospital of 740 beds. The ward units were randomly chosen {{for each type of}} equipment, and patients were included according to indication for use of IP, based on institutional protocol. The types of errors and adverse reactions were classified by means of algorithms. The costs of each system for IP, was calculated considering the useful life of the technology. Results: 310 infusions were monitored: 117 in the universal infusion pump group and 193 in the <b>specific</b> <b>equipment</b> group, in 55 patients. The average difference between the scheduled time and the actual one in the infusions was - 2. 1 ± 19 min. and 0. 08 ± 23 min. (p = 0. 40) for the universal <b>equipment</b> and <b>specific</b> <b>equipment,</b> respectively, which <b>means</b> an average error of - 0. 15 % ± 3. 8 % for the universal equipment and 0. 10 % ± 6. 3 % for the <b>specific</b> <b>equipment,</b> with no difference between the two types of pump. Fourteen (4. 5 %) medication errors were observed during the administration of medication, similar between the two types of IP. The cumulative costs between the two pump systems were equivalent in 30 months, and after 11 years the costs were meaningfully higher for the <b>specific</b> <b>equipment</b> pumps in 184, 29 %. Conclusion: The infusion pumps do not show meaningful difference in accuracy between scheduled time and the actual one qualifying them as safe for the drugs observed. Cumulative costs were significantly distinct between both pieces of equipment...|$|R
