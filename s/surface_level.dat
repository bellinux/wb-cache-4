40|$|BackgroundMalaria {{morbidity}} and mortality have been significantly reduced through {{the proper use of}} insecticide-treated mosquito nets, but the extra protection afforded by the insecticide diminishes over time.

5|$|Although {{many of the}} {{convective}} bands {{were already}} located over the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall. As the eye moved over Mexico {{near the town of}} Majahual in the Costa Maya area, the NHC estimated <b>surface</b> <b>level</b> winds of 175mph (280km/h), making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. At the same time, a dropsonde reading from the hurricane's eye estimated a central pressure of 905mbar, making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. The landfall itself occurred in a sparsely populated area of the Costa Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18.7N 87.8W at 0900UTC August21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12–18ft (3.7–5.5m). A weather station at Chetumal (the capital of Quintana Roo, Mexico) reported 6.65in (17cm) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean's landfall. As expected, the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm; the eye filled and the cold cloud-tops warmed. The land severely disrupted the storm's organization, and by the time Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula it had weakened to a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at <b>surface</b> <b>level</b> (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E

Various models based on the (110) (1 x 1) structure were constructed to investigate the variation of surface states and chemical bonding between surface atoms with the existence of a surface vacancy and adsorbed oxygen.

Mosquito mortality assays (WHO Cone Tests) were performed on a subset of eleven 24 -month old nets and compared with the proportion of failed nets as predicted by the CFT. RESULTS: At six months, the nets retained about 80 % of the baseline (new net) levels of deltamethrin with no significant differences between net positions. At 12 months, ~ 15 - 40 %, and at 24 months < 10 % of deltamethrin was retained on the nets, with significant differences appearing between positions. Results from the CFT show that 93 % of the nets failed (deltamethrin <b>surface</b> <b>levels</b> </= EC 80) at 24 months. This value is in agreement with 91 % failure as determined by the WHO Cone Test on a subset of 11 nets. The CFT results show that 50 % of the nets from Laos failed at 12 months of normal use.

In MHC class I–deficient mice, the Ly 49 A transgene did not prevent expression of endogenous Ly 49 genes. However, in H- 2 d mice that express a Ly 49 A ligand, the transgene caused clear alterations in the endogenous Ly 49 repertoire. The frequency of NK cells expressing another H- 2 d –specific receptor, Ly 49 G 2 �, was substantially reduced. Reduced numbers of cells expressing endogenous Ly 49 A was suggested by reduced endogenous Ly 49 A mRNA levels.
