50|$|For many years, NMOS {{circuits}} {{were much}} faster than comparable PMOS and CMOS circuits, which had to use much slower p-channel transistors. It was also easier to manufacture NMOS than CMOS, as the latter has to implement p-channel transistors in special n-wells on the p-substrate. The major drawback with NMOS (and most other logic families) is that a DC current must flow through a logic gate even when the output is in a steady state (low {{in the case of}} NMOS). This means static power dissipation, i.e. power drain even when the circuit is not switching. A similar situation arises in modern high speed, high density CMOS circuits (microprocessors etc.) which also has significant <b>static</b> <b>current</b> draw, although this is due to leakage, not bias. However, older and/or slower static CMOS circuits used for ASICs, SRAM etc., typically have very low static power consumption.|$|E

It was designed and manufactured by Canadian electronics company Applied Microelectronics Institute (now Amirix). The first Star 4000s were programmed to operate in a text-only mode (displayed over stylized graphical backgrounds), similar to the STAR III, but with two improvements: an improved font was introduced, as was a graphical radar product {{at the end of}} the local forecast segment, showing precipitation that was occurring in the viewer's local geographic area. The first version was just a <b>static</b> (<b>current)</b> image. A second version was added in the fall of 1992, and was a loop showing radar data logged during the previous 90 minutes. Within a brief period of time, the Weather Star 4000 began to produce graphically based local forecast segments, including maps for the regional observation and forecast products. Until 1995, the Star 4000 incorporated a narration track provided by Dan Chandler into the software, which introduced forecast products presented in each flavor; the tracks could be programmed to play either on certain products or all that were featured during that particular flavor. A customized version of the Weather Star 4000 was used by The Weather Network until 1997, when it switched to a technically different system to disseminate local weather information, known as PMX. Due to the cost of upgrading to more advanced units including the IntelliStar, the Weather Star 4000 remained in use in some smaller communities as late as 2014, although it was already being gradually phased out in some areas in favor of the more recent models at that time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{research}} has shown that voltage scaling is a very effec-tive technique for low-power design. This paper describes a voltage scaling technique to minimize the power consumption of a combinational circuit. First, the converter-free multiple-voltage (CFMV) structures are proposed, including the p-type, the n-type, and the two-way CFMV structures. The CFMV structures make use of multiple supply voltages and do not require level converters. In contrast, previous works employing multiple supply voltages need level converters to prevent <b>static</b> <b>currents,</b> which may result in large power consumption. In addition, the CFMV structures group the gates with the same supply voltage in a cluster to reduce the complexity of placement and routing for the subsequent physical layout stage. Next, we formulated the problem and proposed an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve it. The heuristic algorithm has been implemented in C and exper-iments were performed on the ISCAS 85 circuits to demonstrate the effec-tiveness of our approach.
