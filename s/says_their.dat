5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Erin {{tries to}} break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and <b>says</b> <b>their</b> {{relationship}} can work out if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E

25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and <b>says</b> <b>their</b> immortality may hold the key to immortality for human beings, as he says that genetically they are not that much different from humans.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} consequences of guilds {{have led to}} heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, scholars say that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods {{they must have been}} efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). Others say they persisted not because they benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild. Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She <b>says</b> <b>their</b> main goal was rent seeking, that is, to shift money to the membership {{at the expense of the}} entire economy.|$|E

The alien <b>says</b> <b>their</b> planet is dying and they saw Earth as the most suitable replacement, after first killing off humanity. Iskandar {{did not agree with}} this and was imprisoned. Iskandar implants in Yuki the ability to clean the radiation from Earth. As she and Kodai return to the Yamato, Saito and Sanada sacrifice themselves by destroying the Gamilas power source. The Yamato returns to Earth, where Okita dies. The crew rejoices at their return home, but a surviving Gamilas ship ambushes them and severely damages the warship. Dessla now appears and says they no longer wish to invade the Earth; however, since the majority of the Gamilas were killed, he intends to destroy the planet with his ship to avenge his race. Kodai orders the surviving crew to abandon ship before he pilots the Yamato on a kamikaze attack against Dessler's ship. He fires the blocked Wave Motion Cannon, which destroys both spaceships.|$|E

The husband informs Scully, Doggett, and Reyes that they are being watched, and signals to Scully to close the window. He then reveals to Scully that he works for the NSA and has no name.

In an effort to offset food costs, Bart and Homer exhibit Stampy by charging customers to pet and ride him, but they fail to {{make enough money to}} cover the elephant's food costs for one day. Homer and Marge decide that their house is unsuitable for an elephant to live in, and that Stampy is way too expensive to maintain as a pet, and tell the children the elephant must go. The family is visited by a representative of a game reserve, who <b>says</b> <b>their</b> acres of open land similar to African Savannah would be a good habitat for the elephant to live in. However, as the family is pondering what to do about Stampy, a wildlife poacher named Mr. Blackheart offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants to take the money, but Lisa is against the idea — particularly since Mr. Blackheart openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks. Just as Homer and Mr. Blackheart reach a deal, [...] Stampy and Bart run off, wreaking havoc throughout Springfield, and are soon nowhere to be found. The family begins searching and finds them at the Springfield Tar Pits, where Homer gets stuck in one of the tar pits. Homer is freed by Stampy, and gratefully agrees to donate the elephant to a wildlife reserve.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the context}} of organ {{harvesting}} Kilgour and Matas point to a further source of vulnerability. Namely, {{in order to protect}} family members from punishment by security agencies, many detained Falun Gong practitioners refuse to give their names or other personally identifying information to police. “Though this refusal to identify themselves was done for protection purposes, it may have had the opposite effect. It is easier to victimize a person whose whereabouts is unknown to family members than a person whose location the family knows,” <b>says</b> <b>their</b> report. Kilgour and Matas wrote that they had yet to meet or hear of any Falun Gong practitioners who were safely released from custody after refusing to identify themselves, despite the prevalence of this practice. Similarly, Ethan Gutmann reports that in over a hundred interviews with former prisoners, he encountered only one Falun Gong practitioner who had remained nameless while in custody, and “her organs were even more worn out than my own.” ...|$|E

Agrippa replaced his tutors with her own nominees, having convinced Claudius to order their executions, including the execution of Sosibius. Not just his tutors, but the two prefects of the Praetorian Guard, Lusius Geta and Rufius Crispinus, were replaced as well. They were thought to be sympathetic to the cause of Britannicus and his mother, as Tacitus reports: it would have been risky to surround Nero with any but those loyal to Claudius and Agrippina. His step-mother had them replaced with Sextus Afranius Burrus who was a good soldier, but knew to whom he owed his allegiance.|$|E
