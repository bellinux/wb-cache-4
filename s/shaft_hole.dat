The results revealed that compared with the <b>shaft</b> <b>holes</b> area, the diameter of center axis have a marked influence on the flow velocity and pressure of outlet. When the area of suction holes is constant, with the increase of shaft diameter, the outlet velocity increased and pressure decreased; when the diameter of axle is constant, with the <b>shaft</b> <b>holes</b> area increase, the outlet velocity increased and pressure decreased...|$|R

The Alunda moose {{is considered one}} of the most beautiful animal sculptures of the Nordic neolithic and is a 21 cm. ceremonial axe carved from greenish black diorite. One side is shaped like a moose head. The sculpture was realized in a naturalisitic and elegant manner. The axe has a <b>shaft</b> <b>hole</b> but only had a symbolic function since the hole is not completely bored through and the axe hasn't been used in battle. The axe may originate from Karelia where similar animal depictions are known. It is displayed in the Swedish History Museum.|$|E
50|$|In {{a master}} keyed lock, {{some or all}} of the <b>shaft</b> <b>hole</b> in the lock have three pins in them instead of two. Between the driver pin and the key pin is a third pin called the spacer pin. Thus each pin line has two shear points, one where the driver and spacer pins meet, and one where the spacer and key pins meet. So the lock will open with two keys; one aligns the first set of shear points and the other aligns the second set of shear points. The locks are {{manufactured}} so one set of shear points is unique to each lock, while the second set is identical in all the locks. A more secure type of mechanism has two separate tumblers, each opened by one key.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{analytical}} computation of the magnetic field distribution in a wholly superconducting reluctance motor. The rotor is made with high temperature superconductor bulks which nearly present a diamagnetic behaviour under zero-field cooling. The stator consists of superconducting armature windings fed by AC currents of high amplitude. The superconducting stator winding can generate a high rotating magnetic field without the need of ferromagnetic material in the rotor. The electromagnetic torque is obtained by {{the interaction between the}} rotating magnetic field created by the superconducting stator windings and the variable reluctance due to the superconducting bulks. The proposed analytical method is based on the resolution of Laplace's equation (by the separation of variables method) for each sub-domain, i. e. rotor <b>shaft,</b> <b>holes</b> between superconducting bulks and air-gap. The global solution is obtained using boundary and continuity conditions.

40|$|The {{transient}} {{analysis was}} carried out to investigate the dynamic stress and vibration of volute casing for a large double-suction centrifugal pump by using the transient fluid-structure interaction theory. The flow pulsations at flow rate ranging from 60 % to 100 % of the nominal flow rate (Qd) were taken as the boundary conditions for FEM analysis of the pump volute casing structure. The results revealed that, for all operating conditions, the maximum stress located at the volute tongue region, whereas the maximum vibration displacement happened close to the <b>shaft</b> <b>hole</b> region. It was {{also found that the}} blade passing frequency and its harmonics were dominant in the variations of dynamic stress and vibration displacement. The amplitude of the dominant frequency for the maximum stress detected at 0. 6 Qd was 1. 14 times that at Qd, lower than the related difference observed for pressure fluctuations (3. 23 times). This study provides an effective method to quantify the flow-induced structural dynamic characteristics for a large-scale double-suction pump. It can be used to direct the hydraulic and structural design and stable operation, as well as fatigue life prediction for large-scale pumps...|$|E

40|$|For online {{quality control}} of car engine production, {{pneumatic}} measurement instrument plays an unshakeable role in measuring diameters inside engine block {{because of its}} portability and high-accuracy. To the limitation of its measuring principle, however, the working space between the pneumatic device and measured surface {{is too small to}} require manual operation. This lowers the measuring efficiency and becomes an obstacle to perform automatic measurement. In this article, a high-speed, automatic measuring system is proposed {{to take the place of}} pneumatic devices by using a laser-based measuring unit. The measuring unit is considered as a set of several measuring modules, where each of them acts like a single bore gauge and is made of four laser triangulation sensors (LTSs), which are installed on different positions and in opposite directions. The spatial relationship among these LTSs was calibrated before measurements. Sampling points from measured <b>shaft</b> <b>holes</b> can be collected by the measuring unit. A unified mathematical model was established for both calibration and measurement. Based on the established model, the relative pose between the measuring unit and measured workpiece does not impact the measuring accuracy. This frees the measuring unit from accurate positioning or adjustment, and makes it possible to realize fast and automatic measurement. The proposed system and method were finally validated by experiments...|$|R

50|$|Often {{the edges}} of <b>shafts</b> and <b>holes</b> are {{chamfered}} (beveled). The chamfer forms a guide for the pressing movement, helping to distribute the force evenly around the circumference of the hole, to allow the compression to occur gradually instead of all at once, thus helping the pressing operation to be smoother, to be more easily controlled, and to require less power (less force at any one instant of time), and to assist in aligning the shaft parallel with the hole it is being pressed into. In the case of train Wheelsets the wheels are pressed onto the axles by force.|$|R

The plate {{was placed in a}} bridging fashion to provide minimal disruption of the fracture site and minimise surgical time. THE lateral tibial head buttress (LTHB) plate is a tibial plate used in human beings. It has an expanded metaphyseal section to improve the fixation of the tibial plateau. It has also been used to repair supracondylar femoral fractures (Schatzker and Tile 1996) and distal humeral shaft fractures (Levy and others 2005). It is 3 · 8 mm thick and 14 mm wide. The plate is available with a curved right or left proximal flare with a maximum width of 26 mm. The flared portion of the plate is designed to correspond to the proximal aspect of the human tibia, and contains one oval and three round screw holes so that the plate can be applied in compression. The plate is available with five to 13 <b>shaft</b> <b>holes.</b> Its use in dogs has been reported in the repair of supracondylar and distal femoral fractures (Dueland and VanEnkevort 1995, Glyde and others 2003).
