30|$|By {{introducing}} the spatial dimension at the transmit processing, jointly with time and/or frequency dimensions, {{a number of}} different space–frequency MIMO transceivers were proposed to enable orthogonal multiple-access in multiuser systems combining OFDM and CDMA techniques. A spread spectrum-based transmission framework was proposed in [10], therein called multicarrier <b>spread</b> space <b>spectrum</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> (MC-SSSMA), with the idea of fully spreading each user symbol over space, time, and frequency. MC-SSSMA is a generalization of its single-carrier counterpart proposed in [11]. Despite the achieved spectral efficiency gains, the design of [10] was restricted to the case where the number of transmit and receive antennas is equal to the spreading gain.

However, the main difference is that SS-MC-MA systems use FDMA for the user separation and therefore are less vulnerable to <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> interference, and thus are especially of interest for the uplink of mobile radio systems. They allow asynchronism between the mobile users. In this paper we investigate the effects of ISI and ICI due to asynchronism in the uplink of an SS-MC-MA system on the performance of pilot symbol aided channel estimation.

30|$|Most {{significant}} limitation in spread-spectrum {{multiple access}} systems is the interference introduced by {{an increasing number}} of users in the bandwidth-limited channel.

However, in a multi-cell environment, the uplink capacity of SC-FI-SSMA may degrade due to the inter-cell interference. To improve the uplink bit error rate (BER) performance, transmit power control and site selection diversity techniques can be applied. In this paper, we evaluate the uplink capacity of SC-FI-SSMA to show that SC-FI-SSMA provides better uplink performance than DS-CDMA even in a multi-cell environment.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the asynchronism of user signals in the uplink of a <b>spread</b> <b>spectrum</b> multi-carrier <b>multiple</b> <b>access</b> (SS-MC-MA) system. Different propagation delays due to different distances between the mobile transmitters and their base station cause asynchronous arrivals of the uplink signals in addition to multipath propagation. The proposed uplink SS-MC-MA scheme uses for synchronization only the frame structure received on the synchronous downlink and requires no additional synchronization measures. A guard interval that is smaller than the sum of the maximum time offset between the users and the maximum excess delay of the frequency selective multipath channel is used. It minimizes the loss in bandwidth efficiency by allowing residual interference. The residual interference is minimized by proper positioning of the detection interval in the receiver. It is shown that with this approach the guard interval can be reduced by about 50 %. The performance of the proposed uplink scheme is compared to an uplink SS-MC-MA scheme with perfect synchronization. ...|$|R
