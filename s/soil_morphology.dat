During the laboratory work the basic soil features were identified (texture, artefact content, pH, CaCO 3, and amounts of organic matter).

5000|$|In soil survey, {{as practiced}} in the United States, soil {{classification}} usually means criteria based on <b>soil</b> <b>morphology</b> in addition to characteristics developed during soil formation.

USDA soil taxonomy provides the core criteria for differentiating soil map units. This is a substantial revision of the 1938 USDA soil taxonomy which was a strictly natural system. Soil taxonomy based soil map units are additionally sorted into classes based on technical classification systems. Land Capability Classes, hydric soil, and prime farmland are some examples.|$|E

50|$|Soil is {{classified}} into categories {{in order to}} understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil for a particular use.

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of carbonate on Mars {{has been difficult}} to reconcile with the morphologic evidence for a wet epoch in Martian history, and has weakened early interpretations of a water-rich Noachian. Limited soil carbonate from pre-Silurian Earth has created a similar conundrum, and in both instances this paradox has likely led to overreaching interpretations about past climates. To better understand the formation of carbonate on Mars, early Earth, and in present day hyperarid climates, we examined the distribution of carbonate in the Atacama Desert—a region that spans multiple climate regimes and allows us to isolate the effects of precipitation and plant cover on soil mineralogy. To better quantify the influences of vegetation on carbonate we utilized a simple one-dimensional precipitation model and simulated carbonate formation with or without plant cover under a range of relevant climatic conditions and <b>soil</b> <b>morphologies.</b> In the Atacama we found two distinct zones with only trace (< 5 %) carbonate: the "absolute desert" with precipitation too low to sustain plant life, and the high Andes where precipitation was significantly higher, but where the low mean annual temperature (MAT) inhibits plants. The fog-supported, low-elevation coastal "lomas" below approximately 800 meters above sea level (masl) and the higher elevations between approximately 2500 - 4500 masl are variably vegetated and contain abundant carbonate within the soils. Plants increase total evapotranspiration and its distribution with depth, weathering rates, and total pCO₂. Our model results show that all of these factors increase the formation of pedogenic soil carbonate. Without the influence of vegetation the diminished carbonate that is produced is flushed through the shallow soil, where it eventually precipitates in the deep vadose zone or is entrained by groundwater...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} the <b>morphology</b> of <b>soil</b> surfaces dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush at burned-seeded, burned-unseeded, and unburned sites in southern Idaho. Both burning and seeding resulted in {{significant changes in}} <b>soil</b> surface <b>morphology.</b> Unburned sites were dominated by Type I (shrub- and grass tussock-dominant coppice) and Type II (lichen- and moss-covered coppice bench) surfaces, while burned-seeded sites were dominated by Types I, II, and III (bare or lichen-covered microplains between the individual coppices) surfaces. Type V surfaces (severely-disturbed, annual grass-dominant microsites) predominated on the burned-unseeded sites. Burning and subsequent conversion of native shrubland to exotic grassland results in a predominance of Type V surfaces unless seeding is used to reintroduce perennials or the surface is allowed to recover {{in the absence of}} subsequent fire and disturbance.

40|$|Floodplains {{have been}} intensively altered in industrialized countries, but are now {{increasingly}} being restored {{and it is}} therefore important to assess {{the effect of these}} restoration projects on the aquatic and terrestrial components of ecosystems. Soils are a functionally crucial component of terrestrial ecosystems but are generally overlooked in floodplain restoration assessment. We studied the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of <b>soil</b> <b>morphology</b> in a restored (riverbed widening) river reach along River Thur (Switzerland) using three criteria (soil diversity, dynamism and typicality) and their associated indicators.

Soil diversity and dynamism increased five years after the restoration, but typical soils of braided rivers were still missing. Soil typicality and dynamism correlated to vegetation changes.
