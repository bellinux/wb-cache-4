5|$|Screensavers were {{designed}} {{to ensure that there}} would be no phosphor burn-in of images left on a CRT-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic interactivity with its series of <b>screensaver</b> products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{uses the}} Cosm {{software}} libraries for networking. Folding@home was launched on October1, 2000, {{and was the}} first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems. Its first client was a <b>screensaver,</b> which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use. In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with David P. Anderson to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>screensaver</b> was {{allegedly}} {{written for the}} original IBM PC by John Socha, best known for creating the Norton Commander; he also coined the term screen saver. The <b>screensaver,</b> named scrnsave, {{was published in the}} December 1983 issue of the Softalk magazine. It simply blanked the screen after three minutes of inactivity (an interval which could be changed only by recompiling the program).|$|E

25|$|After Dark was {{an early}} <b>screensaver</b> for the Macintosh platform, and later PC/Windows, which {{prominently}} featured whimsical designs such as flying toasters. Perhaps {{in response to the}} workplace environment in which they are often viewed, many screensavers continue this legacy of whimsy by populating the idle monitor with animals or fish, games, and visual expressions of mathematics equations (through the use of fractals, Fourier transforms or other means) as in the Electric Sheep <b>screensaver.</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>screensaver</b> (or screen saver) is a {{computer}} program that blanks the screen or fills it with moving images or patterns when the computer is not in use. The original purpose of screensavers was to prevent phosphor burn-in on CRT and plasm{{a computer}} monitors (hence the name). Though modern monitors are not susceptible to this issue, screensavers are still used for other purposes. Screensavers are often set up to offer a basic layer of security, by requiring a password to re-access the device. Some screensavers use the otherwise unused computer resources to do useful work, such as processing for distributed computing projects.|$|E
25|$|Sony added TV {{output to}} the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can output in a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a <b>screensaver</b> if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a progressive scan signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480×272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720×480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled, meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720×480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released {{a new version of the}} remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The Serial Port is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|E
500|$|One of Delrina's <b>screensaver</b> {{products}} {{was based}} on the licensed Bloom County characters Opus the Penguin and Bill the Cat. The initial Opus 'n Bill <b>screensaver,</b> launched in 1993, landed the company in court as its Death Toasters module depicted Opus taking shots at a number of flying toasters, a well-known [...] emblem in Berkeley System's Flying Toasters module from their After Dark <b>screensaver.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Screensavers</b> {{derive their}} name from their {{original}} purpose, {{which was an}} active method of attempting to stave off screen burn. By ensuring that no pixel or group of pixels was left displaying a static image for extended periods of time, phosphor luminosity was preserved. Modern <b>screensavers</b> can turn off the screen when not in use.|$|R

500|$|A primary {{feature of}} the Rosetta@home {{graphical}} user interface (GUI) is a <b>screensaver</b> which shows a current workunit's progress during the simulated protein folding process. [...] In the upper-left of the current <b>screensaver,</b> the target protein is shown adopting different shapes (conformations) in its search for the lowest energy structure. [...] Depicted immediately to the right is {{the structure of the}} most recently accepted. [...] On the upper right the lowest energy conformation of the current decoy is shown; below that is the true, or native, structure of the protein if it has already been determined. [...] Three graphs are included in the <b>screensaver.</b> [...] Near the middle, a graph for the accepted model's thermodynamic free energy is displayed, which fluctuates as the accepted model changes. [...] A graph of the accepted model's root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), which measures how structurally similar the accepted model is to the native model, is shown far right. [...] On the right of the accepted energy graph and below the RMSD graph, the results from these two functions are used to produce an energy vs. RMSD plot as the model is progressively refined.|$|E
500|$|Most {{consumers}} {{claimed they}} had never {{signed up for the}} free trial, never used the service, and never even heard of Movieland until they got their first pop-up demand for payment. [...] Some said they found the software on their computers after downloading a <b>screensaver</b> or other free utility. [...] The company denied that it installed its software by stealthy means.|$|E
500|$|Like all BOINC projects, Rosetta@home uses idle {{computer}} processing {{resources from}} volunteers' computers to perform calculations on individual workunits.

500|$|Delrina {{subsequently}} {{removed the}} wings from the toasters and {{replaced them with}} propellers in order to avoid trademark infringement. The module was also renamed from [...] "Death Toasters" [...] to [...] "Censored Toaster Module".

500|$|A {{preliminary}} injunction {{was filed}} against Delrina in September 1993 which halted {{the sale of}} the product, and subsequently forced a recall of it through the court. The case drew political satirist Mark Russell to speak in defense of Delrina, who argued in favour of the <b>screensaver</b> as a valid parody, while the estate of composer Irving Berlin sided with Berkeley.. p.300 Morgan Kaufmann. 1-55860-924-5 Commenting on the case involving his characters, cartoonist Berkeley Breathed said: [...] "If David Letterman can depict the NBC peacock wearing men's boxer shorts, then Delrina should be able to plug a flying toaster with hot lead".|$|E

Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua, New Hampshire, where Holly works, and Utica, New York, where Karen works. Michael said he can only prepare for his lectures by listening to [...] "silence or Sam Kinison", an American stand-up comedian known for his extreme and vulgar sense of humor. Michael said he learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the lyrical oath of loyalty to the United States flag, by setting the lyrics to the rhythm of [...] "Old McDonald Had a Farm", a children's song about the various animals on a farm. During one lecture, Michael and Pam both do impressions of the protagonist from Forrest Gump, the 1994 film starring Tom Hanks as a mentally handicapped man. Michael also uses the title from the films Good Morning, Vietnam (at his Nashua lecture by saying [...] "Good morning, Vietna...shua!")
