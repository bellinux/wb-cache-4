50|$|A {{commonly}} used metaphor is a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet has cells that observe the source cell(s). When the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> is changed, the dependent cells are updated from the event.|$|E
50|$|During a {{call one}} or more {{parameters}} of the signal in the channel in the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> are monitored and assessed in order to decide when a handover may be necessary. The downlink (forward link) and/or uplink (reverse link) directions may be monitored. The handover may be requested by the phone or by the base station (BTS) of its <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> and, in some systems, by a BTS of a neighboring cell. The phone and the BTSes of the neighboring cells monitor each other's signals and the best target candidates are selected among the neighboring cells. In some systems, mainly based on CDMA, a target candidate may be selected among the cells which {{are not in the}} neighbor list. This is done in an effort to reduce the probability of interference due to the aforementioned near-far effect.|$|E

Inhibition of Disp 1 function, both by RNAi or dominant-negative constructs, prevents secretion and results in the accumulation of Shh in <b>source</b> <b>cells.</b> Measuring the Shh response in neuralized embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells, with or without Disp 1 function, demonstrates an additional role for Disp 1 in cells transporting Shh. Co-cultures with Shh-expressing cells revealed {{a significant reduction in}} the range of the contact-dependent Shh response in Disp 1 −/− neuralized EBs. These observations support a dual role for Disp 1, not only in the secretion of Shh from the <b>source</b> <b>cells,</b> but also in the subsequent transport of Shh through tissue...|$|R
50|$|For the {{practical}} realisation of handovers in a cellular network each cell is assigned {{a list of}} potential target cells, {{which can be used}} for handing over calls from this <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> to them. These potential target cells are called neighbors and the list is called neighbor list. Creating such a list for a given cell is not trivial and specialized computer tools are used. They implement different algorithms and may use for input data from field measurements or computer predictions of radio wave propagation in the areas covered by the cells.|$|E
50|$|Hard handover: Is one {{in which}} the channel in the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> is {{released}} and only then the channel in the target cell is engaged. Thus the connection to the source is broken before or 'as' the connection to the target is made—for this reason such handovers are also known as break-before-make. Hard handovers are intended to be instantaneous in order to minimize the disruption to the call. A hard handover is perceived by network engineers as an event during the call. It requires the least processing by the network providing service. When the mobile is between base stations, then the mobile can switch with any of the base stations, so the base stations bounce the link with the mobile back and forth. This is called 'ping-ponging'.|$|E
50|$|Growth cones {{that are}} {{located at the}} end of {{developing}} axons during embryogenesis are responsible for the elongation of the axon during migration. Elongation occurs in response to both trophic and atropic factors present in the surrounding environment. Netrins are one such tropic factor secreted by axonal target cells that function as a crucial axonal guidance protein in both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. Studies in multiple organisms including, mice, rats, chicks, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the zebrafish Danio rerio have indicated that secreted netrins are bifunctional, meaning that they can act as either attractants or repellants in directing axonal extension. In addition, many studies have characterized netrins as both short and long range cues, acting in the immediate or distant vicinity of their <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> (the axonal target cell).|$|E

50|$|Until 2008 the 1st Intelligence Battalion {{comprised}} only {{members of}} the Australian Intelligence Corps. Since that time, members of other corps of the Army as well as personnel from the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force have been posted to the battalion to serve as human intelligence operators or interrogators. The 1st Intelligence Battalion maintains teams of specialists on short notice to deploy from the unit's base at Brisbane. As of 2014, the unit's roles included collecting and analysing human intelligence, psychological warfare and information operations. In addition, it was capable of conducting topographical surveys and collecting and making use of geospatial intelligence. At this time the 1st Intelligence Battalion included an All <b>Source</b> <b>Cell</b> which aimed to combine and analyse different sources of intelligence, as well as capabilities to exploit intelligence.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} form of {{handover}} {{is when a}} phone call in progress is redirected from its current cell (called source) to a new cell (called target). In terrestrial networks the source and the target cells may be served from two different cell sites or from {{one and the same}} cell site (in the latter case the two cells are usually referred to as two sectors on that cell site). Such a handover, in which the source and the target are different cells (even if they are on the same cell site) is called inter-cell handover. The purpose of inter-cell handover is to maintain the call as the subscriber is moving out of the area covered by the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> and entering the area of the target cell.|$|E
50|$|The {{creation}} of Polly and Molly {{built on the}} somatic nuclear transfer experiments {{that led to the}} cloning of Dolly the Sheep. The crucial difference was that in creating Polly and Molly, scientists used cells into which a new gene had been inserted. The gene chosen was a therapeutic protein to demonstrate the potential of such recombinant DNA technology combined with animal cloning. This could hopefully be used to produce pharmacological and therapeutic proteins to treat human diseases. The protein in question was the human blood clotting factor IX. Another difference from Dolly the Sheep was the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> type of the nucleus that was transferred. In the case of Dolly the Sheep, the nucleus that was transferred came from mammary gland cells from a 6-year-old ewe; in the case of Polly and Molly, fibroblast cells were used.|$|E

50|$|Typically, morphogens are {{produced}} by <b>source</b> <b>cells</b> and diffuse through surrounding tissues in an embryo during early development, such that concentration gradients are set up. These gradients drive the process of differentiation of unspecialised stem cells into different cell types, ultimately forming all the tissues and organs of the body. The control of morphogenesis is a central element in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of the hard handover is that at any moment in time one call uses only one channel. The hard handover event is indeed very short and usually is not perceptible by the user. In the old analog systems it could be heard as a click or a very short beep; in digital systems it is unnoticeable. Another {{advantage of}} the hard handover is that the phone's hardware {{does not need to}} be capable of receiving two or more channels in parallel, which makes it cheaper and simpler. A disadvantage is that if a handover fails the call may be temporarily disrupted or even terminated abnormally. Technologies which use hard handovers, usually have procedures which can re-establish the connection to the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> if the connection to the target cell cannot be made. However re-establishing this connection may not always be possible (in which case the call will be terminated) and even when possible the procedure may cause a temporary interruption to the call.|$|E
50|$|Cells {{themselves}} can create biomolecular gradients by releasing signaling molecules that diffuse outwardly. These gradients {{are critical for}} cellular identity and cell relocation. Similarly, the gradients produced by cells may influence cellular fate by their temporal and spatial characteristics. In certain organisms, the choice of cell fate can be determined by a gradient, a binary choice, or through a relay of molecules released by a cell. If cell fate is binary, {{the identity of the}} cell is influenced by {{the presence or absence of}} a signaling molecule; consequently, these signals can also induce cell fate acting in a relay. The relay functions by the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> releasing a signaling molecule into the environment. Adjacent cells possessing similar cell identities respond to these signals and can release different signaling molecules to cells in their surrounding area, promoting additional new cell fates. This process continues to all cells in the developing organism. In contrast, a signal can act in a gradient, which induces a specific cell fate as a function of the concentration of the molecule in the gradient. These types of molecules are known as morphogens.|$|E
50|$|Soft handover: Is one {{in which}} the channel in the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> is {{retained}} and used for a while in parallel with the channel in the target cell. In this case the connection to the target is established before the connection to the source is broken, hence this handover is called make-before-break. The interval, during which the two connections are used in parallel, may be brief or substantial. For this reason the soft handover is perceived by network engineers as a state of the call, rather than a brief event. Soft handovers may involve using connections to more than two cells: connections to three, four or more cells can be maintained by one phone at the same time. When a call {{is in a state of}} soft handover, the signal of the best of all used channels can be used for the call at a given moment or all the signals can be combined to produce a clearer copy of the signal. The latter is more advantageous, and when such combining is performed both in the downlink (forward link) and the uplink (reverse link) the handover is termed as softer. Softer handovers are possible when the cells involved in the handovers have a single cell site.|$|E
40|$|Regenerative medicine, tissue {{engineering}} and gene therapy offer {{the opportunity to}} treat and cure many of today’s intractable afflictions. These approaches to personalized medicine often utilize stem cells to accomplish these goals. However, stem cells can be negatively affected by donor variables such as age and health status {{at the time of}} collection, compromising their efficacy. Stem cell banking offers the opportunity to cryogenically preserve stem cells at their most potent state for later use in these applications. Practical stem <b>cell</b> <b>sources</b> include bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and tissue, and adipose tissue. Each of these <b>sources</b> contains stem <b>cells</b> that can be obtained from most individuals, without too much difficulty and in an economical fashion. This review will discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each stem <b>cell</b> <b>source,</b> factors to be considered when contemplating banking each stem <b>cell</b> <b>source,</b> the methodology required to bank each stem <b>cell</b> <b>source,</b> and finally, current and future clinical uses of each stem <b>cell</b> <b>source...</b>|$|R

50|$|One {{advantage}} of the soft handovers is that the connection to the <b>source</b> <b>cell</b> is broken only when a reliable connection to the target cell has been established and therefore the chances that the call will be terminated abnormally due to failed handovers are lower. However, by far a bigger advantage comes from {{the mere fact that}} simultaneously channels in multiple cells are maintained and the call could only fail if all of the channels are interfered or fade at the same time. Fading and interference in different channels are unrelated and therefore the probability of them taking place at the same moment in all channels is very low. Thus the reliability of the connection becomes higher when the call is in a soft handover. Because in a cellular network the majority of the handovers occur in places of poor coverage, where calls would frequently become unreliable when their channel is interfered or fading, soft handovers bring a significant improvement to the reliability of the calls in these places by making the interference or the fading in a single channel not critical. This advantage comes at the cost of more complex hardware in the phone, which must be capable of processing several channels in parallel. Another price to pay for soft handovers is use of several channels in the network to support just a single call. This reduces the number of remaining free channels and thus reduces the capacity of the network. By adjusting the duration of soft handovers {{and the size of the}} areas in which they occur, the network engineers can balance the benefit of extra call reliability against the price of reduced capacity.|$|E

40|$|The {{repair of}} {{articular}} cartilage is challenging {{due to the}} sparse native cell population combined with the avascular and aneural nature of the tissue. In recent years cartilage tissue engineering has shown great promise. As with all tissue engineering strategies, the possible therapeutic outcome is intimately linked with the used combination of cells, growth factors and biomaterials. However, the optimal combination has remained a controversial topic and no consensus has been reached. In consequence, much effort has been dedicated to further design, investigate and optimize cartilage repair strategies.
