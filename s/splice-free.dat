40|$|About 2500 superconducting sextupole {{corrector}} magnets (MCS) {{are needed}} for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN to compensate persistent current sextupole fields of the main dipoles. The MCS is a cold bore magnet with iron yoke. The coils are made from a NbTi conductor, which is cooled to 1. 9 K. In the original CERN design 6 individual sub-coils, made from a monolithic composite conductor, are assembled and spliced together to form the sextupole. The coils are individually wound around precision-machined central islands and stabilized with matching saddle pieces at both ends. The Advanced Magnet Lab, Inc. (AML) has produced an alternative design, which gives improved performance and reliability at reduced manufacturing cost. In the AML design, the magnet consists of three <b>splice-free</b> sub-coils, which are placed with an automated winding process into pockets of prefabricated G- 11 support cylinders. Any assembly process of sub-coils with potential misalignment is eliminated. The AML magnet uses a Kapton-wrapped mini-cable, which allows helium penetration into {{the vicinity of the}} conductor, increasing its cryogenic stability. Eliminating all internal splices from the magnet significantly reduces heat loads and the risk of magnet failure during operation. A tested prototype reached the critical current limit of the conductor in the first quench. (3 refs) ...|$|E
