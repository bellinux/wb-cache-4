5|$|After going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, Arcidiacono {{joined the}} San Antonio <b>Spurs</b> for the 2016 NBA Summer League. On July 14, 2016, {{he signed with}} the <b>Spurs,</b> but was waived on October 22 after {{appearing}} in three preseason games. Seven days later, he was acquired by the Austin <b>Spurs</b> of the NBA Development League as an affiliate of San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning a}} {{championship}} with the <b>Spurs,</b> doubts lingered over Parker's future. The <b>Spurs</b> had attempted {{and failed to}} acquire New Jersey Nets' Jason Kidd, but Parker told coach Popovich {{that he wanted to}} be San Antonio's starting point guard. Parker played well during the regular season, recording 14.7 ppg, 5.5 apg and 3.2 rpg. However, the <b>Spurs</b> were defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, and were denied back-to-back titles.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011–12 NBA season, Parker {{helped the}} <b>Spurs</b> reach {{the best record}} in the West for the second {{straight}} season; the team tied the Chicago Bulls for the best overall record in the league. On 4 February 2012, Parker became the all-time assist leader of the franchise with 4,477, surpassing Avery Johnson, adding 42 points in a victory against Oklahoma City Thunder. The <b>Spurs</b> secured their 13th straight 50 win season despite the lockout (a new NBA record), and Parker received his fourth All-Star nod. He finished fifth in MVP award voting, receiving four first-place votes. Late in the season, the <b>Spurs</b> signed Parker's longtime friend Boris Diaw, who was claimed off waivers from the Charlotte Bobcats. In the 2012 NBA Playoffs, Parker averaged 20.1 points and 6.8 assists as the <b>Spurs</b> swept through the first two rounds, defeating the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers. In the Western Conference Finals the <b>Spurs</b> faced the young Oklahoma City Thunder. After winning Game 1 and Game 2, 101–98 and 120–111 respectively, and taking a 2–0 series lead, the <b>Spurs</b> lost four consecutive games, thus losing the series 4–2.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the <b>Spurs</b> {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed <b>Spurs</b> team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant {{to step into the}} void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the <b>Spurs</b> into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the <b>Spurs</b> ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the <b>Spurs</b> lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as {{one of the reasons for}} the loss.|$|E
5|$|Bowen and the <b>Spurs</b> {{bounced back}} {{and won the}} NBA title in 2005, {{defeating}} the Detroit Pistons. The <b>Spurs</b> could not win back-to-back titles, however, and bowed out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. As a testament to his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E

5|$|Duncan {{started the}} 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his {{performance}} declined {{and he was}} subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis. Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili {{for most of the}} season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record. Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the <b>Spurs</b> were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the <b>Spurs</b> avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the <b>Spurs</b> were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs for the first time since 2000.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{games into}} the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the <b>Spurs</b> {{compiled}} a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, {{in a game}} against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the <b>Spurs</b> have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games. The <b>Spurs</b> were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the <b>Spurs</b> ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the <b>Spurs</b> could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E

5|$|In 2012–13, the <b>Spurs</b> {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals, where they faced the Miami Heat. In Game 5 of the series, Ginóbili scored a season-high 24 points, as the <b>Spurs</b> went up 3–2. However, {{they went on to}} lose Games 6 and 7 to lose the series in seven games.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, the <b>Spurs</b> began {{featuring}} Ginóbili more regularly, starting him in {{half of the}} 77 {{regular season}} games in which he played. His statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the <b>Spurs</b> met their perennial rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot, the <b>Spurs</b> lost Game 6 and the series 4–2. While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game {{as he did in}} 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006–07 season, the <b>Spurs</b> lacked {{energy from}} their {{reserves}} and Ginóbili provided it by {{coming off the}} bench {{for most of the}} second half of the season helping the <b>Spurs</b> attain the best record in {{the second half of the}} season. Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio. The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the <b>Spurs</b> to defeat the Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz, before sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers to win his third and San Antonio's fourth championship.|$|E

5|$|In the 2007–08 regular season, Parker {{recorded}} similar averages as {{the previous}} two seasons for points and rebounds, and slightly increased his assists per game average. The <b>Spurs</b> {{finished third in the}} Western Conference and faced the Phoenix Suns {{in the first round of}} the 2008 NBA Playoffs. For the third time in four years, San Antonio prevailed over Phoenix; Parker had an outstanding first round series, averaging nearly 30 points and 7 assists a game. In the next round against Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, the <b>Spurs</b> dropped the first two road games before responding with a strong win in the third game. In that game, Parker recorded a double-double with 31 points and 11 assists. The experienced <b>Spurs</b> took seven games to defeat the Hornets, but were unable to get past the Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals, and the <b>Spurs</b> once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E
