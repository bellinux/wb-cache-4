50|$|MOBIDIC was a 36-bit binary machine, {{a common}} word size for early computers. The system used 36-bit data throughout, but stored it as 40-bit values to add {{additional}} sign and parity bits, and two spares. This {{allowed it to}} store the full range from -(1 - 2−36) to +(1 - 2−36). Machines were normally equipped with two parallel banks of core memory with 4096 words each, but was expandable to seven banks maximum. It could support up to 63 tape drives, punch tape input and output, {{as well as a}} Flexowriter. One connection could also be dedicated to sending data to another MOBIDIC system. The tape drives used one of the spare bits in the 40-bit word as a <b>STOP</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E

50|$|The use of {{flashing}} lights and sirens is colloquially known as blues and twos {{which refers to}} the blue lights and the two-tone siren once commonplace (although most sirens now use a range of tones). In the UK, only blue lights are used to denote emergency vehicles (although other colours may {{also be used as}} sidelights, <b>stop</b> <b>indicators,</b> etc.). A call-out requiring the use of lights and sirens is often colloquially known as a blue light run.|$|R

50|$|A key {{proposal}} of the Station Area Traffic Improvement Scheme (SATIS) was {{the integration of}} the metro rail system with the BEST. The BEST and the BMC jointly worked towards relocating existing bus stops. BEST bus feeder routes were created along the metro corridor. Bus <b>stops</b> have electronic <b>indicators</b> displaying the expected arrival time of the next train, and information about bus schedules is available inside the metro stations. The MMRDA widened footpaths below metro stations. Parking for bikes and motorbikes is available at all stations.|$|R
50|$|When {{this type}} of valve is tripped, the flow is quickly <b>stopped</b> and an <b>indicator</b> disc tells the {{operator}} that the electrical circuit has been opened by a failure somewhere in the system. When the system failure has been corrected so that the circuit is again closed, the valve can be opened {{by the action of}} the hand lever. If, however, the system failure has not been satisfactorily corrected, the circuit will remain open and moving the hand lever will not open the valve, because the valve stem remains disengaged from the handle.|$|R
25|$|Golf follows {{traditional}} golf rules: players {{must reach}} the {{hole on the}} green in as few strokes as possible by hitting the ball with a club, while avoiding obstacles including sand traps, water hazards, trees, and deep rough grass. In the screen's top left and right corners, players are shown the wind speed/direction and an aerial layout of the course, respectively. In advance of their turn, players choose aspects of the swing, such as speed, direction, stance, club type, swing power, and the ball impact point. Swing power requires players to <b>stop</b> an <b>indicator</b> {{at the right moment}} on a vertical arrow; the ball impact point requires players to <b>stop</b> a zig-zagging <b>indicator</b> as it moves down and then up a close-up of the ball. If players allow the indicator to move {{all the way up the}} vertical arrow, they will be given another chance to time their shot; if they allow the zig-zagging indicator to reach the top, the game will automatically stop it at the very top. If players hit the top of the ball, it will go further while hitting the bottom of the ball will cause the ball to go further but have a more controlled direction. Hitting the ball on the right or left sides will cause the ball to hook in either direction. The ideal spot is the center of the ball; unlike real golf, players do not need to hit the bottom of the ball when in bunkers or deep rough. Players can also place a grid on a nearby portion of the course to aide with the aim and distance of their shots. Players can choose between five different viewing perspectives, change button configurations, and review the positives and negatives of their last shots.|$|R
50|$|Stop bath {{accounts}} for the characteristic vinegar-like odor of the traditional darkroom. In its concentrated form it can cause chemical burns, but is harmless when diluted to a working solution. Stop bath becomes exhausted when bases carried over from the developer cause the solution to become alkaline. For <b>indicator</b> <b>stop</b> bath - a stop bath that changes colours to indicate when the stop bath is exhausted and no longer effective - a pH indicator like bromocresol purple is used to determine when the solution has become too alkaline to use. Low-odor stop baths use citric acid or sodium bisulfite in place of acetic acid.|$|R
50|$|The patent {{describes}} Burt's machine {{as having}} a set of typeface characters that were arranged on the under side {{of a set of}} parts that had a lever pivoted to swing vertically and horizontally. The desired typeface character is brought to the printing point by moving this lever horizontally to a position over the same character in the index, and the impression on the paper is made by then depressing the lever. Different styles of typeface characters could be used. They were arranged in two rows on a lever. The rows of typeface characters could be shifted on the lever to bring either one to the printing point. The paper was carried in an endless band that traveled crosswise of the machine and the band was moved for letter space by the impression lever every time the lever is depressed to print. The line space was made by shifting the frame carrying the printing mechanism toward the front or rear of the machine, with the paper remaining stationary. Ink-pads were located at each side of the impression point, and all the typeface characters, except the one in the printing position, were inked every time the impression lever was depressed. Upper and lower case typeface letters could be used. A dial was provided that indicated the length of paper (inches) which had passed the printing point in printing each line. The operator knew the width of the paper being used each time. There was a <b>stop</b> printing <b>indicator</b> for end of the line.|$|R
40|$|Assembling a {{complete}} subsystem as a rear lamp, {{it is necessary}} several different machines and tasks, for producing the final product. The technology {{presented in this paper}} has de capability {{to reduce the number of}} tasks needed for producing a final subsystem/product. In this case will be necessary only one injection moulding machine with three injection units. This was achieved by combining several technologies, as in-mould assembling, laser welding and LEDs. The challenges began by studying several polymeric materials, for understanding their behavior when they are welded by a laser beam. This was helpful also for determine the best welding properties. At the same time were analyzed different conductive polymers. This had the objective to determine their suitability for conducting the electric current between the different LEDs. The development of the rear lamp was made take in consideration the legislation of UNECE Vehicle Regulations - 1958 Agreement; Regulation No. 50 -Rev. 2 - Position lamps, <b>stop</b> lamps, direction <b>indicators</b> for motorcycles.

40|$|Delay {{and number}} of vehicle <b>stops</b> are {{important}} <b>indicators</b> that define the level of service of a signalized intersection. Therefore, they are usually considered for optimizing the traffic signal timing. In this study, ANNs are employed to model delay {{and the number of}} stops estimation at signalized intersections. Intersection approach volumes, cycle length and left turn lane existence were utilized as input variables since they could easily be obtained from field surveys. On the other hand, the average delay and the number of stops per vehicle were used as the output variables for the ANNs models. Four-leg intersections were examined in this study.   Approach volumes including turning volumes are randomly generated for each lane of these intersections, then the traffic simulation program was run 196 times with each generated data. Finally, average delay and the number of stops per vehicle were obtained from the simulations as outputs. In this study, various network architectures were analyzed to get the best architecture that provides the best performance. The results show that the ANNs model has potential to estimate delays {{and number of}} vehicle stops...|$|R
30|$|Epicardial {{pacemaker}} wire insertion {{is standard}} following cardiothoracic surgery in most centers [1]. These wires are valuable in diagnosing and treating cardiac arrhythmias following surgery, maintaining an appropriate heart rate, and may facilitate the reestablishment of circulatory integrity and normal hemodynamics [2]. They also suppress both atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias [3]. The R-on-T phenomenon {{is a well-known}} entity that predisposes to dangerous arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation (Vf), a fatal arrhythmia. The phenomenon is also related to undersensing of temporary pacing wires. To check its sensitivity, the pacemaker rate should be set below the endogenous rate (if present), and placed in ventricular demand (VVI), atrial demand (AAI), or atrioventricular universal (also known as dual-chamber (DDD)) modes. The sensitivity is increased until the sense <b>indicator</b> <b>stops</b> flashing and that number is the threshold. It is recommended to leave the pacing generator set at half the pacing threshold. If there is no endogenous rhythm, {{it is impossible to}} determine the pacemaker sensitivity, in which case the sensitivity is typically set to 2  mV [4]. There is currently no consensus on the threshold for premature ventricular contraction (PVC).|$|R

In studies of volitional inhibition, successful task performance usually requires {{the prevention of}} all movement. In reality, movements are selectively prevented {{in the presence of}} global motor output. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the ability to prevent one movement while concurrently executing another, referred to as selective inhibition. In two experiments, participants released switches with either their index and middle fingers (unimanual) or their left and right index fingers (bimanual) to <b>stop</b> two moving <b>indicators</b> at a fixed target (Go trials). Stop trials occurred when either one or both <b>indicators</b> automatically <b>stopped</b> before reaching the target, signaling that prevention of the prepared movement was required. Stop All and selective Stop trials were randomly interspersed among more frequently occurring Go trials. We found that selective inhibition is harder to perform than nonselective inhibition, for both unimanual and bimanual task contexts. During selective inhibition trials, lift time of the responding digit was delayed in both experiments by <= 100 ms, demonstrating the generality of the result. A nonselective neural inhibitory pathway may temporarily "brake" the required response, followed by selective excitation of the to-be-moved digit's cortical representation. After selective inhibition trials, there were persistent asynchronies between finger lift times of subsequent Go trials. The persistent effects reflect the behavioral consequences of nonspecific neural inhibition combined with selective neural disinhibition. status: publishe...|$|R

ISBN 978 - 0 - 7354 - 1227 - 9 ”To Assemble a {{complete}} subsystem as a rear lamp, {{is necessary to}} have different machines and to perform several tasks. This necessity obliges the companies to have large structures to support all the assembling process. These huge structures are very costly and have as a consequence {{the reduction of the}} competitiveness of the companies. The process presented in this document has the intention of reducing the number of tasks needed to produce the final subsystem/product. To achieve this goal were combined several technologies, as in-mould assembling, laser welding and LEDs (light-emitting diode). One of the advantages of this process was the utilization of only one injection molding machine with three injection units to do all the assembling process. To achieve the main objective, firstly, the rear lamp was designed according to with the legislation of UNECE Vehicle Regulations - 1958 Agreements; Regulation No. 50 -Rev. 2 - Position lamps, <b>stop</b> lamps, direction <b>indicators</b> for motorcycles. Posterior several polymeric materials were studied at different levels. Initial were studied several concentrations of carbon nanotubes mixed with PC (polycarbonate). This had the objective of determine, if these materials are suitable to conduct the necessary electric current to turn on the different LEDs. One of the main advantages of this process is the use of the laser transmission welded process. Since, with this welding technology is possible reduce the complexity of the final part. To understand the potentialities of this technology a combination of two materials was studied. The studied showed that all materials presented a high transparency to the laser beam. In terms of weld process, the study showed that the best welding conditions are the lowest velocity, diameter and power. With these studies was possible conclude that this new process is suitable to be implemented at the industrial level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{aims to examine}} the concept of museum and the {{transformation}} of museums to centers of education in its historical development. Museum, as a concept, comes from the 9 muses each possessing a different ability and source of inspiration (Calliope- the muse of epic poetry; Clio-the muse of history etc). Open and enclosed spaces (gardens and inside temples) dedicated to these 9 muses were called museums in Ancient Greece. However, The Museum of Alexandria, established in 4 th century B. C, was the first museum that presented collection, exhibition, preservation and classification missions for museums in the historical development. A comprehensive archive was developed in Alexandria by visiting all settlements in the Mediterranean to collect artifacts sometimes through copying sometimes by seizing by means of pillages. In this sense, the Museum of Alexandria is {{the temple of the}} thought to bring together all cultural indicators of the world in the same location. Medieval collections were the means to collect cultural treasures and to pursue what is different to display them. With the discovery of the New World and the resulting conquests to faraway lands, not only the land but also the universe of images of The Other was conquered. Museums with their Cabinets of Curiosity, that display everything that is extraordinary and rare, living and nonliving, are exalted to mysterious settings. Along with the Renaissance-the conveyor of the Ancient Greece and the messenger of the modern world view- museums transformed into visual encyclopedias established with a philosophy of classification and documentation rather than sorting the mysterious objects or the living things. In this sense, the museums have started to develop as service facilities that contribute to the progress of the society instead of settings that only collect and store objects. While Palazzo Medici built in 15 th century laid the foundations of the modern museum, arts and science started to transform into academic structures. Now, the most precious artifacts of history are presented in the museum setting in a chronological order. The function of object based information usage started to be dominant in the 18 th century along with the establishment of the institutional structure and the 19 th century brought the provision of services to educate the working class that started to rapidly increase in the cities as a result of industrialization and the museums have obtained the mission of training citizens as well. As a result, museums <b>stopped</b> being the <b>indicators</b> of wealth for rulers and the bourgeois in the history and started to gain importance as educational institutions. Hence, modern museums are settings in which research towards the preservation of cultural heritage is undertaken on one hand and training, publications, knowledge-document centers, performances, meetings, discussions and workshops are provided on the other...|$|R
