40|$|Owing to the {{concentrated}} {{and severe}} nature of blackbird depredation on corn and sunflower crops in the Portage la Prairie area of Southern Manitoba, {{a group of}} area farmers formed the Central Plains Special Crops Protection Association to examine this problem during 1979. With financial support from Agro-Man, a Federal-Provincial cost sharing <b>sub-agreement,</b> they established a pilot project demonstrating field control techniques during the 1980 crop season. In a total of 40 fields surveyed for damages, demonstration fields suffered damages averaging 1. 7 % and 2. 8 % (weight of crop loss) for corn and sunflowers respectively (range: 6. 3 - 0. 1 % corn; 6. 1 - 0. 1 % sunflowers) compared to 17. 5 % and 12. 0 % averages on non-demonstration field (range: 44. 6 - 1. 9 % corn; 62. 4 - 0. 1 % sunflowers). These results were considered promising enough to justify a four year study commencing in 1981...|$|E
40|$|Developing a {{workforce}} to meet {{national health}} needs will require sustained efforts over time, building coalitions among all stakeholders, including national TB control programmes (NTPs). The strengths and sustainability of NTPs depend on timely, adequate, and ongoing hiring, training, deployment, motivation, {{and management of}} health workers {{to ensure that the}} Stop TB Strategy can be implemented in the context of national guidelines to reach the TB-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Services for TB control are provided within the framework of national health systems. It is now widely accepted that the dire shortage of health workers in many places is among the most significant constraints to achieving the health-related MDGs: to reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, and combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases such as TB and malaria. The development of the health workforce is concerned with the different functions involved in planning, managing, and supporting the professional development of the health workforce within the health system. HRD aims to secure the right people, with the right skills and motivation, in the right place, at the right time. Terminology in this area is constantly evolving, with lack of consensus on definitions. In this document, health workforce development, human resources for health (HRH), and human resource development are used interchangeably. HRD in this context refers to the process of planning, managing, and supporting the health workforce for comprehensive TB control within overall health workforce development.

40|$|Firms are key actors {{interfering with}} the {{negotiations}} of international environmental agreements. However, their ability to engage in collective lobbying via the establishment of business transnational coalitions has received little attention so far. In order to fill this gap, this article conducts a micro–macro analysis of corporate lobbying during the negotiations of two <b>sub-agreements</b> of the Convention on Biological Diversity. In particular, it scrutinises the degree of transnationalisation of two senior business lobby coalitions in these negotiations: the Global Industry Coalition and the International Chamber of Commerce. In contrast to former studies of business lobbying on environmental agreements, the analysis stresses the variety of business interests represented in international negotiations and underlines the bargaining processes taking place inside each transnational business coalition. Transnational business lobby coalitions are found useful for business networking activities, either as tactical tools or as information platforms. Yet corporate lobbying efforts are still conducted predominantly on an individual basis. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|South Africa 2 ̆ 019 s {{policy of}} Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) is {{intended}} to alleviate the racially determined disparities {{in the distribution of}} the country 2 ̆ 019 s wealth and income. It aims at increasing the participation of black South Africans in the formal private sector economy: more black company owners; more black investors; and more formal jobs, preferably at management level, reserved for blacks. To this end, BEE comprises a wide range of policy instruments aimed at domestic market regulation in favour of black South Africans. Some of these instruments are, however, inconsistent with fundamental rules of international trade set out by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which puts BEE at odds with WTO and may jeopardise the success of the policy 2 ̆ 019 s raison d 2 ̆ 019 : bringing wealth, prosperity and white-collar jobs to black South Africans. This paper analyses the problematic relationship between BEE and WTO. It approaches the issue step-by-step: first, it provides an overview of WTO, its relevant <b>sub-agreements</b> and the obligations these impose on South Africa. Second, it introduces BEE and systematically examines the inconsistencies between BEE and WTO rules. Finally, it reviews the possible repercussions and concludes...|$|R
40|$|The beleaguered {{progress}} of the Doha Development Agenda of the WTO presents something of a puzzle for economic theory: if multilateralism is an effective forum for liberalisation (as {{it has been in}} the past), then why have the current round of talks faltered amid the proliferation of preferential trade negotiations? Several authors have argued that the consensus decision-making and single-undertaking principles of the WTO have lead to coordination failures amongst an increasingly expanded and diverse membership which has caused frustrated WTO members to form PTAs. This paper constructs a formal model which shows that the combination of the single-undertaking and consensus decision-making principles with an expanded and more diverse membership can lead to more than just coordination failure; it can render multilateralism less desirable for some parties than bilateralism. It is argued that these principles give countries de facto veto power meaning that their threat point during multilateral negotiations is a reversion to bilateral negotiations between all parties. Accordingly, countries with relatively less to gain from multilateralism can use their veto power to extract gains from those that would benefit substantially from the WTO. If an expanding membership has increased the number of such countries, then the benefits of multilateralism versus regionalism from the perspective of their negotiating partners may have been diminished to such an extent that they are no longer willing to wait for the conclusion of the Doha round before engaging in regional negotiations. This result adds credence to the idea that ‘variable geometry’ be introduced into the WTO system, such that it acts as an umbrella organisation for a web of <b>sub-agreements.</b> ...|$|R
