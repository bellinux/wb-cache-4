40|$|The {{application}} of the GUM (Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) to calculate standard uncertainties for routing uranium isotope mass spectrometry measurements for nuclear safeguards and nuclear metrology is introduced. The benefit {{of this approach is}} an improved coherency and transparency of the uncertainty calculation, which should include contributions from all potentially significant sources of uncertainty to the mass spectrometric measurement result. The GUM approach puts the responsibility for quantifying the uncertainty on the analyst who makes the measurements and not with the user of the data.

It identifies the dominant components of the measurement uncertainty and allows for better understanding, management, and improvement of the measurement process.

5000|$|Photomultipliers are {{typically}} constructed with an evacuated glass housing, containing a photocathode, several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the photocathode material, {{which is usually}} a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer {{on the inside of}} the entry window of the device. Electrons are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier,</b> where <b>electrons</b> are <b>multiplied</b> by the process of <b>secondary</b> emission. The <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier</b> consists of a number of electrodes called dynodes. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3 eV for [...] "blue" [...] photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100 eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 512 ≈ 108 electrons. This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.|$|R

Direct measurements of the 236 U/ 238 U ratios for all 3 mixtures were performed by TIMS using a <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier</b> operated in ion counting mode to detect the 236 U ion beam. The results agree well with the ratios obtained from the mixing calculations. This confirmation is considered a proof for the reliability to our TIMS procedure used to measure 236 U/ 238 U ratios within a wide dynamic range. Based on the confidence provided by the synthetic uranium isotope mixtures, the minor isotope ratios 234 U/ 238 U and 236 U/ 238 U were re-measured and re-certified by TIMS for the reference materials IRMM- 183 - 187. On the new certificates for IRMM- 183 - 187 the minor ratios 234 U/ 238 U and 236 U/ 238 U are certified with a ten times lower uncertainty compared to previous values. JRC.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{applicability}} and {{the improvement of}} the detection sensitivity of a particle mass spectrometer (PMS) were studied. The PMS was originally used by Hospital and Roth for the investigation of the growth of soot-particles produced in combustion processes. It consists of a molecular beam sampling system and a high vacuum chamber which contains the necessary measurement instrumentation for the in-situ particle sizing. Three reactors were employed to investigate the applicability: a low-pressure flame reactor, a microwave reactor and a spark reactor. The reactors are different in respect of the energy transfer into the reactive gases and the bulk material respectively. The flame reactor was used to produce well-known soot particles as reference particles for the experiments related to {{the improvement of the}} detection sensitivity of the PMS. Soot-, Silver-, Carbon-, Siliconoxide-, Tinoxide and Nickel- Nanoparticles were produced. The results have shown that the applicability of the PMS could be extended and be applied to particles generated in the microwave reactor {{as well as in the}} spark reactor. Neutral charged Soot- and Tinoxid-Nanoparticles which were produced in the flame reactor were charged by electron impact ionisation in the high vacuum chamber of the PMS. The charging effect increases with decreasing amount of charged particles in the aerosol. Thus, in the case of neutral or weakly charged aerosols the particles could be characterised with the PMS leading to a further extension of the application range. A new detector was developed to improve the detection sensitivity of the PMS. The detector consists of a <b>secondary</b> <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier</b> (SEM) and an external conversion dynode. The dynode was set to a high electrical potential. Thus, the particles were accelerated to a velocity which is sufficient to release secondary electrons or ions from the dynode after the impaction of the particles with the surface of the dynode. Afterwards these secondary electrons and ions respectively were amplified by the SEM. In comparison with the conventional detector, a Faraday-Cup, an increase of the signals of about 10 5 was achieved with this new detector...|$|E
