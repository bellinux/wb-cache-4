This approach targets the monitoring of critical structural locations, such as welds, near which strain sensors can be applied during construction and/or locations with limited inspection possibilities during <b>structural</b> <b>operation.</b> We investigate several anomaly detection techniques to detect changes in statistical properties, indicating structural degradation.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{simultaneous}} co-existence of mythological and descriptive thinking in common sense discourse. Specifically, it concentrates on the synthesis of types of thought in those understandings that are characterized by the well-known expression having (one’s) two-feet-on-the-ground. In order to provide concreteness for {{the meaning of the}} expression, I investigated Estonian cyberspace {{as one of the most}} prevalent arenas of common sense discourse, and it appeared that two-feet-on-the-ground is used to refer to rationality, sanity and practicality as opposed to, for example, dreamers, bohemians and people who talk about karma or believe in UFOs. People who use having (one’s) two-feet-on-the-ground as a key element in their self-description assume that the way they understand the world is more rational and closer to reality than that of bohemians and spiritualists. Behind the above-mentioned two notions, which in themselves are not easy to define, there is a gleam of a more general tendency of Western thought. This is the conclusion reached by Rein Vihalemm, who has argued that what is accepted as truthful knowledge on the level of common sense is usually understood as being synonymous with scientific knowledge; in turn, the notion of the scientific is usually connected with inductive-empirical science. This article argues that the understandings that are posited as having two-feet-on-the-ground are mixed with categories that cannot be considered as belonging to inductive-empirical logic. The question of values, metaphysics and teleology is always (at least implicitly) present in those representations. That idea seems to be natural in academic discourse but is not as self-evident on the common-sense level. Those who describe themselves as standing with their two-feet-on-the-ground usually think of metaphysics and teleology as being subjective, useless and distant. In describing the specificity of the logic of two-feet-on-the-ground representations, it is fruitful to use the meta-language of cultural semiotics. This allows for the explication of two fundamental and fundamentally different ways of constructing knowledge: mythological and descriptive logics of signification. The general parameters of mythological thinking are that objects belong in the same class and they cannot be organized in intersections or categories. The other aspect that is characteristic of mythological thinking is that the world is structured according to a binary logic – it is divided into Good and Evil, right and wrong, order and chaos. Non-mythological thinking is based on creating abstractions and organizing objects according to the principles of logic. The main <b>structural</b> <b>operation</b> of mythological thinking is the creation of analogies. Descriptive thinking focuses on the relations of chronology, particular-general and cause-effect. Two-feet-on-the-ground understandings have a tendency to create a holistic approach that connects mythological and descriptive thinking. If a statement is recognized as having (one’s) two-feet-on-theground, i. e. if it contains schemes, calculations, formulae or other items that indicate scientificity (=inductive- empirical) etc., then it is likely that at the common-sense level it is perceived as something good=valuable=rational. Some radical two-feet-on-the-ground representations can even use the apparatus of scientific discourse to explain the purpose of life or the way God connects with his addressees during mystical experiences. I do not mean to imply that the presence of mythological thinking in those understandings is bad or dangerous. I agree with Lotman's idea that it is, instead, unavoidable because in contemporary culture pure forms of mythological or descriptive thinking do not exist: they are always entangled to some extent. However, I do think that not acknowledging a high concentration of mythological thinking in understandings that posit themselves as two-feet-on-the-ground can be a bit tricky because resorting to a purely practical interpretation of the phrase (and the understanding) can result in its manipulative use by demagogues who act under the aegis of science...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the constitutional validity of business combination antitakeover statutes. Delaware and other important corporate law jurisdictions enacted these statutes during the 1980 s to inhibit hostile leveraged corporate takeovers and protect incumbent managements. These statutes work by prohibiting transactions which enable a hostile acquirer with a mere majority of target stock to sell target assets for cash and retain all the cash to service acquisition debt while paying off with securities the minority shareholders 2 ̆ 7 interest in the assets sold. This allows the takeover to be financed with the assets acquired. Analyzing the <b>structural</b> <b>operation</b> of these statutes in greater depth than either the courts or other commentators reveals previously unidentified bases to challenge their constitutional validity. Using the Delaware statute as an example, the article describes a series of transactions which either evade the prohibitions of these statutes or require the enacting jurisdiction to repudiate the internal affairs doctrine for their prohibitions to remain effective. This doctrine is the consensus choice of law rule for all U. S. jurisdictions and one virtually constitutionalized by CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America. Existing assessments of the constitutionality of these statutes {{have focused on the}} fact that they explicitly apply only to target corporations incorporated in the state enacting the statute. In this respect they appear consistent with the internal affairs doctrine, which looks to the jurisdiction of incorporation to determine the controlling law for matters peculiar to corporations, such as voting rights and board duties. This appearance of consistency with the internal affairs doctrine is deceiving. The effective application of these statutes to the described transactions requires the repudiation of the internal affairs doctrine because these transactions involve no formal corporate action by the Delaware target. Instead, they use foreign majority owned subsidiaries of the target. Only if Delaware law controls the internal governance of these foreign subsidiaries can the business combination statute actually bar the transactions. Since the antitakeover prohibition applies even without injury or harm to the Delaware target, these statutes go far beyond well established prohibitions against cleverly structured self dealing or unfair transactions. Without injury to the Delaware target, Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s antitakeover statute essentially mobilizes the private, economic power of the Delaware target to control the internal decisions of its foreign subsidiaries (whose very existence is owed to their own jurisdictions of incorporation and their governance requirements) to compel compliance with Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s prohibitions. To extend its regulatory mandate extraterritorially in this manner without the jurisdictional basis of injury within its jurisdiction exceeds constitutional limits. If Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s antitakeover statute purports to govern the internal affairs of a foreign subsidiary, then Delaware and the subsidiary 2 ̆ 7 s state of incorporation both claim to govern the internal affairs of the same corporation. Moreover, upon completion of the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s tender offer, the Delaware target becomes the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s majority owned foreign subsidiary. This status provides the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s state of incorporation with the same legislative basis as Delaware to extend its own legislative mandate over foreign subsidiaries, including the Delaware target. The bidder 2 ̆ 7 s state could then enact an antidote statute to Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s and supplant Delaware law for the internal affairs of the Delaware target. The potential for inconsistent or conflicting state regulation created by this situation exceeds what the Supreme Court found sufficient under the dormant commerce clause to invalidate an earlier generation of antitakeover statute in Edgar v. MITE. These statutes are vulnerable to constitutional challenge on other grounds as well. For a state to deviate from the internal affairs doctrine as its choice of law rule only when necessary to prevent a foreign corporation from escaping its regulatory jurisdiction may well violate the equal protection clause even under rational basis scrutiny. Lastly, the assertion of regulatory power over a foreign subsidiary, absent either contact with the regulating state or harmful effects within its jurisdictional territory, is an extraterritorial exercise of power fundamentally inconsistent with a federal system of co-equal sovereign states and in violation of due process...|$|E
