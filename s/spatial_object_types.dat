40|$|Lately, {{a need to}} {{integrate}} specialized data manage-ment systems such as geographic information systems (GIS), or multimedia systems has gained importance [6]. A large variety of dierent data sets are available in various specialized repositories, and users would like to access and manipulate these data sets in a uniform way. Additionally, it is desirable to make the special-ized functionality provided by the individual reposito-ries available to the user application through a homo-geneous interface. At UCLA Data Mining Laboratory, we are developing geoPOM (geoscientic Persistent Object Manager), a heterogeneous geoscientic object system which provides a homogeneous interface to het-erogeneous spatial data repositories [20]. geoPOM provides an object-oriented spatial data model for the denition of user-dened <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> <b>types.</b> Internally, geoPOM maps user-dened <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> <b>types</b> to dierent specialized spatial data repos-itories, and employs their storage, search and spatial query capabilities. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} goals, problems and approach taken in geoPOM towards den-ing the spatial functionality of the heterogeneous geosci-enti c object system available to the user, as well as, the mapping of the spatial object model to the diverse semantic and functional characteristics of the hetero-geneous spatial data repositories. ...|$|E

This version is now available for the public consultation. Based {{on the results of}} the consultation (received comments and the testing reports), the final version 3. 0 will be prepared by the TWGs. The data specification is based on a common template used for all data specifications and has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I data specifications. This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the draft Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. This document includes two executive summaries that provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on Natural Risk Zones in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first. The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> <b>types,</b> attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are/will be responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of Natural Risk Zones. The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes. In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> <b>types,</b> the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in italics...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{associative}} classification {{takes advantage}} of employing association rules for spatial classification purposes. In this work, we investigate spatial associative classification in multi-relational data mining setting to deal with spatial objects having different properties, which are modeled by as many data tables (relations) {{as the number of}} <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> <b>types</b> (layers). Spatial classification is based on two alternative approaches: a propositional approach and a structural approach. The propositional approach uses spatial association rules to construct an attribute-value representation (propositionalisation) of spatial data and performs spatial classification according to well-known propositional classification methods. Since the attribute-value representation should capture relational properties of spatial data, multi-relational association rules are used in propositionalisation step. The structural approach resorts to an extension of naïve Bayes classifiers to multi-relational data where the classification is driven by multi-relational association rules modelling regularities in spatial data. In both cases the spatial associative classification is performed at different levels of granularity and takes advantage from domain knowledge expressed in form of hierarchies and rules. Experiments on realworld geo-referenced census data analysis show the advantage of the structural approach over the propositional one...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of automated vector extraction from Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data in urban areas. The recent popularity of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has stimulated research on automated object extraction {{in order to simplify}} the data acquisition and update process. By automatically generating GIS inputs and updates from a single data source, the cost of data acquisition and processing will be kept to a minimum. Compared with other remote sensing techniques, extraction of objects from ALS data is in its infancy. ALS sensor technology has evolved rapidly and now allows the acquisition of very dense point clouds {{in a short period of}} time. ALS data is unique in that it explicitly contains 3 D information and is acquired from an active sensor. As such, there are several benefits that can be immediately realised by using an ALS only data approach; data acquisition will not be limited to daylight hours as with other sensors and accurate height information is contained in the data. This means that registration of different data sources is not required and as only one data source is used, acquisition costs are minimised. Apart from these facts, ALS data has some other unique properties that have not been utilised to their full potential. An ALS sensor can record both height and intensity information from multiple returns in a single swath. To date, all the available information has rarely been used. For example, the intensity of a laser return has regularly been dismissed as it was considered under-sampled and noisy. This data still contains usable information and until this information is used, the optimum object recognition results will not be achieved; thus the use of as much of this information as possible is a major focus of this thesis. As ALS is an explicit 3 D data source, the early stages of development were primarily focused on topographic mapping of terrain in forested areas in order to generate Digital Terrain Models (DTMs). As sensor technology has improved, so has the achievable resolution of point clouds from ALS data, and methods to extract objects from stand-alone ALS data have emerged. Attempts have been made to create city models and maps from ALS data that included buildings, roads, trees and powerlines. Each of these <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> <b>types</b> has unique attributes, which means that automatic map creation is not an easy task. For example, buildings in general are easily detected in ALS data but the building outline is not easily delineated. Another difficulty with building detection is the separation of buildings and bridges as they have many of the same properties as observed by an ALS system. Bridges can usually be found in a road network but road extraction techniques typically produce poor detection rates and often require existing data and / or user interaction in semi-automatic techniques. These simple examples highlight the complexity of automatically generating vectorised maps from ALS data or in fact any data source. In this thesis, new methods are presented for the automatic creation of vectorised maps from ALS data. A two-step processing paradigm is adopted for this purpose, namely the classification of the ALS data and the vectorisation of the classification results. A classification strategy is introduced that creates a hierarchy for object detection with respect to the ALS data itself. This approach develops an ontology between the spatial object classes and the ALS data. The hierarchical framework highlights the fact that one object might not be discernable within the data without considering another. New classification algorithms are then presented within this framework. Each algorithm attempts to exploit the attributes of the data that are consistent within the spatial object class being considered as described by the classification framework. New algorithms for the classification of roads, trees and powerlines are all introduced whilst an extension to existing building classification methods is presented. Once classification is complete, a vectorisation process specific to the task at hand can be employed to yield vectorised results. These developed vectorisation processes are new and include an algorithm that has been generalised to allow the vectorisation of thick lines in images by detecting the centreline, direction and width. The primary goal of this thesis is to present a framework of new algorithms that will allow automatic spatial object detection and vectorisation whilst providing results of an acceptable quality. The algorithms presented rely solely on ALS data and require minimal operator knowledge. Each algorithm has been designed to exploit the way in which the object exhibits itself in the data. The new algorithms are integrated into a software package called JTD (Join The Dots) that will facilitate the effective automatic processing of ALS data. The results of the new algorithms have been evaluated over four 2 x 2 km areas that have been sampled with medium resolution ALS data. The results for each area are displayed and analysed to show the applicability of the whole process in an exemplary way...|$|E

SDO_GEOMETRY is a <b>spatial</b> database <b>object</b> <b>type</b> {{that can}} be used to store a wide variety of spatial data like points, lines, polygons etc. Different mapping tools like Shape Objects, Shape Viewer etc., or full featured GIS products like ArcGIS, are used to visualize spatial data.

Shapefiles provide a simple, non-topological file format for storing geographic and attribute data. It is comprised of three main files with extensions. shp,. shx and. dbf. The. shp file has geodetic descriptions, the. shx file is an index into the shape file, and the. dbf file contains the descriptive attributes of the <b>spatial</b> <b>object,</b> such as name, area, length, population, etc. This thesis concentrates on developing a software tool to convert Oracle spatial tables, which contain an SDO_GEOMETRY column, into ESRI shapefiles to achieve the inverse functionality of shp 2 sdo, available on Oracle website.

For example, we can consider storing regions of different population densities for each city in an attribute density: num → region. Although then the relation is not in first normal form anymore, we can “recover” the first normal form by encapsulating the function num → region in an abstract data type. The important aspect is that all the required operations on such a type as well as on regions and other complex types can be defined to a large degree independently from the data model. 1 The most important point about the preceding discussion is the way in which complex types can be easil...|$|R

Dependencies among observations are possible, in which case they are described by a directed graph, called spatial discrete structure, which is considered by CORSO when it cluster observations. In particular, CORSO partitions the graph structure so that each partition corresponds to a cluster of possibly homogeneous (i. e., similar) observations. Similarity between two observations {{is based on a}} flexible matching function which is defined for relational representations. In this work we present some issues occurring in the original proposal of CORSO and we propose some solutions to these issues.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a general {{approach}} for reasoning in space. The approach is composed of a set of two general constraints to govern the <b>spatial</b> relationships between <b>objects</b> in space, and two rules to propagate relationships between those objects. The approach is based on a novel representation of the topology of the space as a connected set of components using a structure called adjacency matrix which can capture the topology of objects of different complexity in any space dimension. The formalism is used to explain spatial compositions resulting in indefinite and definite relations and it is shown to be applicable to reasoning in the temporal domain. The main contribution of the formalism is that it provides means for constructing composition tables for objects with arbitrary complexity in any space dimension. A new composition table between <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> of different <b>types</b> is presented. A major advantage of the method is that reasoning between objects of any complexity can be achieved in a defined limited number of steps. Hence, the incorporation of spatial reasoning mechanisms in spatial information systems becomes possible...|$|R

40|$|Motivation Several {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} for mining spatial data (i. e., generalization-based methods, clustering, spatial associations, approximation and aggregation, mining in image and raster databases, spatial classification and spatial trend detection). However, we argue that these approaches do not consider all the elements found in a spatial database (spatial data, non-spatial data and spatial relations among the <b>spatial</b> <b>objects)</b> in an extended way. Some of them focus first on spatial data and then on non-spatial data or vice versa, and others consider restricted combinations of these elements. We think {{that it is possible to}} enhance the generated results of the data mining task by mining them as a whole and not as separate elements (they are related elements). A graph representation provides the flexibility to describe these elements together and this is the motivation to explore the area of graph-based spatial knowledge discovery. Proposal Our idea is to create a unique graph-based model to represent spatial data, non-spatial data and the spatial relations among <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> We will generate datasets composed of graphs with a set of these three elements. We consider that by mining a dataset with these characteristics a graph-based mining tool can search patterns involving all these elements at the same time improving the results of the spatial analysis task. A significant characteristic of spatial data is that the attributes of the neighbors of an object may have an influence on the object itself. So, we propose to include in the model three relationship types (topological, orientation, and distance relations). In the model the spatial data (i. e., <b>spatial</b> <b>objects),</b> non-spatial data (i. e., non-spatial attributes), and spatial relations are represented as a collection of one or more directed graphs. A directed graph contains a collection of vertices and edges representing all these elements. Vertices represent either <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> <b>spatial</b> relation <b>types</b> between two <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> (binary relation), or non-spatial attributes describing the <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> Edges represent a link between two vertices of any type. According to the type of vertices that an edge joins, it can represent either an attribute name or a spatial relation name. The attribute name can refer to a <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> or a non-spatial entity. We use directed edges to represent directional information of relations among elements (i. e., object x covers object y) and to describe attributes about objects (i. e., object x has attribute z). We propose to adopt the Subdue system, a general graph-based data mining system developed at the University of Texas at Arlington, as our mining tool. Subdue discovers substructures using a graph-based representation of structural databases. The substructures (a connected subgraph within the graphical representation) describe structural concepts in the data (i. e., patterns). The discovery algorithm follows a computationally constrained beam search. The algorithm begins with the substructure matching a single vertex in the graph. On each iteration, the algorithm selects the best substructure and incrementally expands the instances of the substructure. An instance of a substructure in the input graph is a subgraph that matches (graph theoretically) that substructure. A special feature named overlap has a primary role in the substructures discovery process and consequently a direct impact over the generated results. However, it is currently implemented in an orthodox way: all or nothing. If we set overlap to true, Subdue will allow the overlap among all instances sharing at least one vertex. On the other hand, if overlap is set to false, Subdue will not allow the overlap among instances sharing at least one vertex. So, we propose a third approach: limited overlap, which gives the user the capability to set over which vertices the overlap will be allowed (vertices representing remarkable elements that refer, for instance, to a <b>spatial</b> <b>object</b> in a <b>spatial</b> database or to some characteristic defining a particular topic of a dataset). We visualize directly three motivations issues to propose the implementation of the new algorithm: search space reduction, processing time reduction, and pattern oriented search. Contribution The contribution to the discovery knowledge in the spatial data domain, described in this dissertation, is the development of a new approach for spatial data modeling and mining using a graph-based representation. This contribution includes the following results: " A new graph-based data representation for spatial, non-spatial data and spatial relations. " A new algorithm to discover substructures using a limited overlap approach in the Subdue system. " A prototype system implementing the proposed model...|$|R

This extension handles the standard <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> found in geographic information systems, multiple representations of the <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> temporal representations, and the traditional coordinate and topological attributes associated with <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> and relationships. <b>Spatial</b> operations are also included in this extended E-R modeling approach to represent the instances where relationships between <b>spatial</b> data <b>objects</b> are only implicit in the database but are made explicit through spatial operations. The extended E-R modeling methodology maps directly into a detailed database design {{and a set of}} GIS function...|$|R

There is also the MPEG-4 Low Delay MPEG Surround <b>object</b> <b>type</b> (LD MPEG Surround), which was {{published}} in 2010. The <b>Spatial</b> Audio <b>Object</b> Coding (SAOC) was published as MPEG-D Part 2 - ISO/IEC 23003-2 in 2010 and it extends MPEG Surround standard by re-using its spatial rendering capabilities while retaining full compatibility with existing receivers. MPEG SAOC system allows users on the decoding side to interactively control the rendering of each individual audio object (e.g. individual instruments, vocals, human voices). There is also the Unified Speech and Audio Coding (USAC) which will be defined in MPEG-D Part 3 - ISO/IEC 23003-3 and ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009/Amd 3. MPEG-D MPEG Surround parametric coding tools are integrated into the USAC codec.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of high-performance spatial access methods that can support complex operations of large spatial databases continues to attract considerable attention. This paper introduces QSF-trees, an efficient and scalable structure for indexing <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> which has some important advantages over R*-trees. QSF-trees eliminate overlapping of index regions without forcing object clipping or sacrificing the selectivity of spatial operations. The method exploits the semantics of topological relations between <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> to further {{reduce the number}} of index nodes visited during the search. A series of experiments involving randomly-generated <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> was conducted to compare the structure with two variations of R*-trees. The experiments show QSF-trees to be more efficient and more scalable to the increase in the data-set size, the size of <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> and the number of dimensions of the spatial universe...|$|R
40|$|Spatial vagueness {{has been}} {{required}} by geoscientists to handle vague <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> i. e., <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> {{that do not}} have exact locations, strict boundaries, or sharp interiors. However, there is a gap in the literature in how to handle these <b>objects</b> in <b>spatial</b> database management systems since they mainly provide support to crisp <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> i. e., objects that have well-defined locations, boundaries, and interiors. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing VagueGeometry, a novel abstract data type that handles vague <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> includes an expressive set of vague spatial operations, and its implementation is open source. Experimental results show that VagueGeometry improved the performance of spatial queries with vague topological predicates from 23 % up to 84 % if compared with functionalities available in current spatial databases.

40|$|Qualitative spatial {{reasoning}} {{is important in}} large spatial databases. It {{is based on the}} manipulation of qualitative spatial relationships and used to derive new spatial knowledge. Spatial reasoning has so far been studied only for simple areal <b>objects.</b> <b>Spatial</b> databases usually consists of <b>objects</b> of different <b>types</b> and complexity. In this paper, a general reasoning approach is proposed for deriving the composition of topological relationships between <b>spatial</b> <b>objects</b> of arbitrary complexity in any space dimension. The reasoning rules proposed are used to derive a new composition table between different <b>types</b> of <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> The approach is a step towards the development of general {{spatial reasoning}} engine for handling different types of spatial relations in spatial databases. 1 Introduction 1 Spatial databases such as geographic databases in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), geometric databases in CAD, or image databases in Multimedia Information Systems and Medical Inform [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} S²-Tree, an {{indexing}} method for subsequence matching of <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> The S²-Tree locates subsequences within {{a collection of}} spatial sequences, i. e., sequences made up of <b>spatial</b> <b>objects,</b> such that the subsequences match a given query pattern within a specified tolerance. Our method is based on (i) the string-searching techniques that locate substrings within a string of symbols drawn from a discrete alphabet (e. g., ASCII characters) and (ii) the spatial access methods that index (unsequenced) <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> Particularly, the S²-Tree {{can be applied to}} solve problems such as subsequence matching of time-series data, where features of subsequences are often extracted and mapped into <b>spatial</b> <b>objects.</b> Moreover, it supports queries such as "what is the longest common pattern of the two time series?", which previous subsequence matching algorithms find difficult to solve efficiently...|$|R
