5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, {{because of the}} demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy.

The drum <b>shell</b> <b>wall</b> thickness, material and wood grain directions, because of alterations in the shell tension, also affects the fundamental note. The thinner wall in wooden ply constructed shells usually produces lower tone, because there are less horizontal grained wood, giving the shell less tension. A wider drum with a larger head would be capable of a lower tuning. Shorter drum shell, however, does not require as much force to vibrate the drum heads.|$|E

40|$|A ring is {{generally}} provided {{at the intersection}} between the cylinder and cone of an elevated storage silo or tank to resist a large circumferential compressive force at the intersection (the transition junction). This ring is a main structural member and {{is often referred to}} as a ringbeam (in contrast to relatively light rings as stiffeners on <b>shell</b> <b>walls).</b> A common cross-sectional form of this ringbeam is a T-section. This paper presents an investigation into the elastic out-of-plane distortional buckling behaviour and strength of T-section ringbeams clamped at their inner edge. A clamped inner edge represents a limiting case of the inner edge support condition. The buckling strength of clamped T-section ringbeams provides a close approximation for cases in which the rotational restraint from the <b>shell</b> <b>walls</b> is heavy and a basis for formulating a buckling approximation for T-section ringbeams with a semirigid rotational restraint at the inner edge.

40|$|A ring is {{generally}} provided {{at the intersection}} between the cylinder and the cone of an elevated storage silo or tank to resist a large circumferential compressive force at the intersection (the transition junction). This ring is a main structural member and {{is often referred to}} as a ringbeam (in contrast to relatively light rings as stiffeners on <b>shell</b> <b>walls).</b> A common cross-sectional form of this ringbeam is a T-section. Previous studies by the authors have led to simple strength approximations for the elastic buckling of T-section ringbeams which are either simply-supported or clamped at the inner edge. This paper is aimed at establishing a simple elastic buckling strength approximation for these ringbeams with elastic (i. e. semirigid) rotational restraint as {{is generally}} provided by the adjacent <b>shell</b> <b>walls</b> in a silo or tank. This is achieved by a suitable interpolation of the buckling strength approximations of the two limiting cases mentioned above, and using the effective section method to relate the loading on a silo or tank to the circumferential compressive stress at the inner edge of the ringbeam. An existing interpolation formula previously developed by Jumikis and Rotter for annular plate ringbeams is found to be satisfactory for T-section ringbeams as well. The developed elastic buckling strength approximation can be used in practical design directly. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
