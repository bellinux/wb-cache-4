Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the most widely used indicator for assessing the environmental sustainability of biodiesels and received particular attention among decision makers in business and politics, as well as consumers.

S. was completed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in 1998, and the energy inventory for this analysis was updated in 2009 using 2002 data. The continual adoption of new technologies in farming, soybean processing, and for biodiesel conversion affects the life‐cycle energy use over time, requiring that LCA practitioners update their models as often as possible. This study uses the most recently available data to update the energy life‐cycle of <b>soybean</b> <b>biodiesel</b> and makes comparisons with the two past studies. The updated analysis showed that the fossil energy ratio (FER) of <b>soybean</b> <b>biodiesel</b> was 5. 54 using 2006 agricultural data. This is a major improvement over the FER of 3. 2 reported in the 1998 NREL study that used 1990 agricultural data and significantly better than the FER of 4. 56 reported using 2002 data. The improvements are primarily due to improved soybean yields and more energy‐efficient soybean crushing and conversion facilities. The energy input in soybean agriculture was reduced by 52 %, in soybean crushing by 58 % and in transesterification by 33 % per unit volume of biodiesel produced. Overall, the energy input reduction was 42 % {{for the same amount}} of biodiesel produced.

Measurement of dielectric property have provided an important approach to understanding the structure of matter.

The dielectric constant ([varepsilon] 2 ̆ 7) and loss ([varepsilon] 2 ̆ 2) are the most convenient indicators for quality control in commercial biodiesel manufacturing. Dielectric properties were correlated with chemically measured changes in soybean oil such as free fatty acids, amount of catalyst and alcohols at different temperatures as well as reaction times.

The material presented highly homogeneous particles with an average diameter of 250 nm according to SEM images. It was applied in the transesterification of <b>soybean</b> oil for <b>biodiesel</b> production. The biodiesel conversion reached a yield of 96. 2 ± 1. 4 % after 3 h of transesterification reaction catalised by SiO 2 /ZrO 2 (SiZr). The catalyst was recovered and reused six times, maintaining a catalytic efficiency of about 84. 1 %...|$|R
