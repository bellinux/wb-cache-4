The complete genome sequences comprised 142, 348 bp and 140, 961 bp, and contained 213 and 203 open reading frames, respectively.

In addition, four genes encoding tRNAs were identified in phiIPLA-RODI. Comparative DNA sequences analysis showed its high similarity with two phages GH 15 and 676 Z, belonging to the Twort-like virus genus, (nucleotide identity > 84 %); for phiIPLA-C 1 C a high similarity with phage phiIBB-SEP 1 was observed (identity of 80 %). Challenge assays of phages phiIPLA-RODI and phiIPLA-C 1 C <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> planktonic cells confirmed their lytic ability to remove 5 log-units in 8 h. Exposure of biofilms to phages phiIPLA-RODI and phiIPLA-C 1 C reduced adhered bacteria to about 2 log-units in both mono-species and dual-species biofilms, but phiIPLA-RODI {{turned out to be}} as effective as the mixture of both phages. Moreover, the frequency of bacteriophage insensitive mutants (BIMs) of S. aureus and S. epidermidis to phiIPLA-RODI and phiIPLA-C 1 C was low, 4. 05 x 10 (- 7) ± 2. 34 x 10 (- 9) and 1. 1 x 10 (- 7) ± 2. 08 x 10 (- 9), respectively.

The median MIC value was 6. 25 μg/ml. The minimal bactericidal value (MBC) never exceeded 12. 5 μg/ml. The growth curves obtained with the MS- 2 system showed that regrowth did not occur at cefsulodin concentrations MIC x 2, x 4, x 8. No regrowth was observed after 24 hours.

40|$|Introduction: The {{ability of}} staphylococci to produce biofilm is an {{important}} virulence mechanism that allows bacteria both to adhere and to live on artificial surfaces and to resist to the host immune factors and antibiotics. <b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>infections</b> have become increasingly difficult to treat due their antibiotic resistance. Therefore, there is a continuous need for new and effective treatment alternatives <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>infections.</b> The main goal {{of this study was}} to test N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vancomycin alone and in combination against S. epidermidis and S. aureus biofilms. Methods: Biofilms were treated with NAC at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 10 × MIC concentrations and vancomycin at MIC and peak serum concentrations. Results: The use of NAC 10 × MIC alone showed a significant antibactericidal effect, promoting a 4 - 5 log 10 CFU/ mL reduction in biofilm cells. The combination of NAC 10 × MIC with vancomycin (independently of the concentration used) reduced significantly the number of biofilm cells for all strains evaluated (5 - 6 log 10). Conclusion: N-acetylcysteine associated to vancomycin can be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of infections associated to biofilms of S. epidermidis or S. aureus...|$|R

In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody targeting the housekeeping protein IsaA, a suggested soluble lytic transglycosylase of S. aureus, and tested its therapeutic efficacy in two experimental mouse infection models. A murine anti-IsaA antibody of the IgG 1 subclass (UK- 66 P) showed the highest binding affinity in Biacore analysis. This antibody recognized all S. aureus strains tested, including hospital-acquired and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains.

40|$|AbstractGrowing {{bacterial}} {{resistance in}} Gram-positive pathogens means that what were once effective and inexpensive treatments for infections caused by these bacteria {{are now being}} seriously questioned, including penicillin and macrolides for use against pneumococcal infections and—in hospitals—oxacillin for use <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>infections.</b> As a whole, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive pathogens are rapidly becoming an urgent and sometimes unmanageable clinical problem. Nevertheless, and despite decades of research into the effects of antibiotics, the actual risk posed to human health by antibiotic resistance has been poorly defined; the lack of reliable data concerning the outcomes resulting from antimicrobial resistance stems, in part, from problems with study designs and the methods used in resistence determination. Surprisingly little is known, too, about the actual effectiveness of the many types of intervention aimed at controlling antibiotic resistance. New antibiotics active against MDR Gram-positive pathogens have been recently introduced into clinical practice, and the antibiotic pipeline contains additional compounds at an advanced stage of development, including new glycopeptides, new anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) β-lactams, and new diaminopyrimidines. Many novel antimicrobial agents {{are likely to be}} niche products, endowed with narrow antibacterial spectra and/or targeted at specific clinical problems. Therefore, an important educational goal will be to change the current, long-lasting attitudes of both physicians and customers towards broad-spectrum and multipurpose compounds. Scientific societies, such as the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), must play a leading role in this process...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of Staphylococcus aureus infections {{is influenced}} by multiple virulence factors that are expressed under variable conditions, and this has complicated the design of an effective vaccine. Clinical trials that targeted the capsule or clumping factor A (ClfA) failed to protect the recipients <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>infections.</b> We passively immunized lactating mice with rabbit antibodies to S. aureus capsular polysaccharide (CP) serotype 5 (CP 5) or CP 8 or with monoclonal antibodies to ClfA. Mice immunized with antibodies to CP 5 or CP 8 or with ClfA had significantly reduced tissue bacterial burdens 4 days after intramammary challenge with encapsulated S. aureus strains. After several passages in mice passively immunized with CP-specific antiserum, increasing numbers of stable unencapsulated variants of S. aureus were cultured from the infected mammary glands. Greater numbers of these unencapsulated S. aureus variants than of the corresponding encapsulated parental strains were internalized in vitro in MAC-T bovine cells. Furthermore, small-colony variants (SCVs) were recovered from the infected mammary glands after several passages in mice passively immunized with CP-specific antiserum. A combination of antibodies effectively sterilized mammary glands in {{a significant number of}} passively immunized mice. More importantly, passive immunization with antibodies to both CP and ClfA fully inhibited the emergence of unencapsulated “escape mutants” and significantly reduced the appearance of SCVs. A vaccine formulation comprising CP conjugates plus a surface-associated protein adhesin may be more effective than either antigen alone for prevention of S. aureus infections...|$|R
40|$|Late-onset Infections of {{synthetic}} vascular grafts (LO-SVGIs) are generally caused by staphylococcl that produce a slime polysaccharide and grow as a biofilm on the graft surface. We developed an ELISA to detect <b>serum</b> antibodies <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> slime polysaccharide antigens (SSPA). Patients with an ongoing staphylococcal LO-SVGI had greater titres of IgM antibodies against SSPA than did patients In other groups. Antibody titres of 0. 40 ELISA units (EU) or more, or 0. 35 EU or more detected 97 % and 100 % of staphylococcal LO-SVGIs, respectively, 0 % and 2 % titre/unit false-positive results. Our {{findings suggest that}} such an ELISA represents a sensitive, specific, and non-invasive diagnostic test for staphylococcal LO-SVGIs...|$|R
40|$|Kill-kinetic {{methods were}} used to provide data on the {{bactericidal}} activity of subinhibitory (0. 5 x MIC), inhibitory (1 x MIC), and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations of LY 146032 against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These bactericidal activities were {{compared with those of}} methicillin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. LY 146032 was among the most active of the antistaphylococcal agents tested, as determined by broth microdilution methods, with all strains being inhibited at concentrations of {{less than or equal to}} 1 microgram/ml. Time kill-kinetic studies demonstrated that at 4 x MIC, LY 146032 was rapidly bactericidal against all strains of staphylococci. Our data show that LY 146032 has significant bactericidal activity against staphylococci in comparison with other antistaphylococcal agents. Further evaluation of LY 146032 <b>against</b> serious <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>infections</b> is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Small colony {{variants}} (SCVs) of Staphylococcus aureus typically lack {{a functional}} electron transport chain and cannot produce virulence {{factors such as}} leukocidins, hemolysins or the anti-oxidant staphyloxanthin. Despite this, SCVs are associated with persistent infections of the bloodstream, bones and prosthetic devices. The survival of SCVs in the host has been ascribed to intracellular residency, biofilm formation and resistance to antibiotics. However, the ability of SCVs to resist host defences is largely uncharacterised. To address this, we measured survival of wild-type and SCV S. aureus in whole human blood, which contains high numbers of neutrophils, the key defense <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> Despite the loss of leukcocidin production and staphyloxanthin biosynthesis, SCVs defective for heme or menquinone biosynthesis were significantly more resistant to the oxidative burst than wild-type bacteria in human blood or the presence of purified neutrophils. Supplementation of the culture medium of the heme-auxotrophic SCV with heme, but not iron, restored growth, hemolysin and staphyloxanthin production, and sensitivity to the oxidative burst. Since Enterococcus faecalis is a natural heme auxotroph and cause of bloodstream infection, we explored whether restoration of the electron transport chain in this organism also affected survival in blood. Incubation of E. faecalis with heme increased growth and restored catalase activity, but resulted in decreased survival in human blood via increased sensitivity to the oxidative burst. Therefore, the lack of functional electron transport chains in SCV S. aureus and wild-type E. faecalis results in reduced growth rate but provides resistance to a key immune defence mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{a leading}} cause of human skin infections, {{contributing}} to disease in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals, also complicating burn and surgical wound sites and lesions of atopic dermatitis (Lowy, 1998; Ong and Leung, 2010). Host defense <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> skin <b>infection</b> is multifaceted, relying on local immunologic control through TH 17 and IL- 1 β–driven recruitment of neutrophils in addition to the protective actions of antimicrobial peptides and physical properties of the cutaneous barrier (Miller and Cho, 2011). Pathogen virulence in <b>staphylococcal</b> skin <b>infection</b> is likewise multifactorial (Weidenmaier et al., 2010), relying in part on the action of α-hemolysin, a pore-forming cytotoxin secreted by almost all strains of S. aureus. Hla is required for dermonecrotic changes during infection, also contributing to abscess size (Kennedy et al., 2010). Immunization strategies targeting Hla protect against dermonecrosis (Kennedy et al., 2010), however the molecular mechanism by which the toxin causes pathologic disturbance of the epithelial barrier is ill-understood. We recently identified the zinc-dependent metalloprotease ADAM 10 as the cellular receptor for Hla (Wilke and Bubeck Wardenburg, 2010). ADAM 10 regulates epithelial functio...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Staphylococci {{are among}} common causes of {{community}} acquired and nosocomial infections around the world. Over the last decade, {{the resistance of}} these bacteria in hospital environments is increasing to various antibiotics such as vancomycin. The aim of {{present study was to}} determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values among a clinical collection of staphylococci isolated from hospitalized children in Tabriz.   Methods: In this prospective and descriptive study, 88 staphylococcal isolates including 53 S. aureus and 35 coagulase-negative staphylococcus species were recovered from various clinical specimens referred to microbiology laboratory of Children Hospital during study period (April 2011 to March 2012). Susceptibility of the isolates against 15 different antimicrobial agents and MIC values of vancomycin was tested using standard disk diffusion and E-test methods respectively.   Results: According to the results of drug susceptibility testing, vancomycin and rifampin were the most effective but clindamycin and penicillin were the least effective drugs against tested isolates. Accordingly, the prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains was determined more than 80 %. According to MIC values, 13. 2 % of S. aureus and 3. 3 % of coagulase-negative staphylococcus isolates showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin. None of the isolates was fully resistant to vancomycin isolates in this study.   Conclusion: Although fully vancomycin resistant staphylococci was not found among tested isolates in this study, there was VISA strains. Since there are reports on the emergence of VRSA strains from Iran and other countries, it is necessary for the clinician to care in prescription of vancomycin as a selective drug <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>infections.</b> Moreover, the necessity of MIC measurement in determining of vancomycin susceptibility is more apparent...|$|R
40|$|AC 98 - 6446 {{is a novel}} semisynthetic {{derivative}} of a natural product related to the mannopeptimycins produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Naturally occurring esterified mannopeptimycins exhibited excellent in vitro activity but only moderate in vivo efficacy <b>against</b> <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> The in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AC 98 - 6446 were investigated in murine acute lethal, bacterial thigh and rat endocarditis infections. Pharmacokinetics were performed in mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs. Acute lethal infections were performed with several gram-positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The 50 % effective dose for all isolates tested ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 39 mg/kg of body weight after intravenous (i. v.) administration. Vancomycin was more than fivefold less efficacious against all of these same infections. Results of the thigh infection with S. aureus showed a static dose for AC 98 - 6446 of 0. 4 mg/kg by i. v. administration. Reduction of counts in the thigh of > 2 log 10 CFU were achieved with doses of 1 mg/kg. i. v. administration of 3 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days resulted in a > 3 log 10 reduction in bacterial counts of vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecalis in a rat endocarditis model. Pharmacokinetics of AC 98 - 6446 showed an increase in exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) from mouse to dog species. The i. v. half-life (t 1 / 2) increased threefold between rodents and the higher species dosed. Efficacy of AC 98 - 6446 has been demonstrated in several models of infection with resistant gram-positive pathogens. This glycopeptide exhibited bactericidal activity in these models, resulting in efficacy at low doses with reduction in bacterial load...|$|R
