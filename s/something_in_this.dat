25|$|For example, in the Rishabaandhika or the Vrishabavahana murthy pose, we see Shiva {{standing}} {{with one leg}} youthfully crossed across the other and his arm elegantly flexed and raised as if resting or leaning on <b>something.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> elegant posture, it can be surmised that the youthful and athletic Shiva is leaning on his bull-vahana, Nandhi, on whose shoulders He is resting His arm.|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E

2500|$|Importantly, the ready-to-hand only {{emerges from}} the prior {{attitude}} in which we care {{about what is going}} on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there [...] "in order to" [...] do <b>something.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our [...] "average-everyday" [...] understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.|$|E
2500|$|Barnett quotes {{additional}} {{criticism of}} Race, Intelligence and Education from Sandra Scarr-Salapatek, {{who wrote in}} 1976 that Eysenck's book was [...] "generally inflammatory" [...] and that there [...] "is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> book to insult almost everyone except WASPs and Jews." [...] Scarr was equally critical of Eysenck's hypotheses, {{one of which was}} the supposition that slavery on plantations had selected African Americans as a less intelligent sub-sample of Africans. Scarr also criticised another statement of Eysenck on the alleged significantly lower IQs of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek immigrants in the US relative to the populations in their country of origin. [...] "Although Eysenck is careful to say that these are not established facts (because no IQ tests were given to the immigrants or nonimmigrants in question?" [...] Scarr writes that the careful reader would conclude that [...] "Eysenck admits that scientific evidence to date does not permit a clear choice of the genetic-differences interpretation of black inferiority on intelligence tests," [...] whereas a [...] "quick reading of the book, however, is sure to leave the reader believing that scientific evidence today strongly supports the conclusion that US blacks are genetically inferior to whites in IQ." [...] Some of Eysenck's later work was funded from the Pioneer Fund, an organization often criticised for allegedly promoting scientific racism, However, Eysenck himself was vehemently opposed to racism. As Eysenck stated, [...] "My hatred of Hitler and the Nazis, and all they stood for, was so overwhelming that no argument could counter it (p. 40)." ...|$|E
