5|$|During {{the reign}} of George I, between 1703 and 1707, the South West front was extended. The south west wing was {{decorated}} in the 1780s and the north east <b>service</b> <b>range</b> was added in the early 19th century. The house contains plaster work from each of these eras.|$|E
5|$|By 1853 a <b>service</b> <b>range</b> {{had been}} added to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{fame and}} notoriety {{were to be}} short-lived. Subsequent generations settled down in Somerset to live the lives of county gentry, {{representing}} Somerset in Parliament and when necessary following occupations {{in the army and}} the church. This peaceful existence was jolted when the estate was inherited by William Phelips (1823–89), who in his early days made many improvements and renovations to Montacute. He was responsible for the Base Court, a low <b>service</b> <b>range</b> adjoining {{the south side of the}} mansion. and the restoration of the Great Chamber, which he transformed into a library. Later, he was to become insane; an addicted gambler, he was eventually incarcerated for his own good. Sadly for his family, this was after he had gambled away the family fortune and vast tracts of the Montacute Estate. In 1875, when his son William Phelips (1846–1919) took control of the estate, agricultural rents from what remained of the mortgaged estate were low, and the house was a drain on limited resources. Selling the family silver and art works delayed the inevitable by a few years, but in 1911 the family were forced to let the house, for an annual sum of £650, and move out. The Phelipses never returned.|$|E
