5000|$|Aside from faster access, {{the drive}} {{is very similar}} to the 1541. Like the 1541, it is a {{single-sided}} 170-kilobyte drive for 5¼" [...] disks, with each disk split into 664 256-byte blocks available for user data plus 19 blocks for DOS data and directory; the file system makes each block its own cluster. As with the other Commodore <b>single-sided</b> <b>diskette</b> drives, 1540 and 1541, both sides of double-sided media could be used only after punching a second write-protection marker hole in the diskette's jacket and inserting the medium upside-down into the drive. This became common practice, even more so since single-sided media became rarely available with prices matching those of double-sided disks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{floppy disk}} drives, {{known as the}} RX50, {{accepted}} proprietary 400 kB <b>single-sided,</b> quad-density 5¼-inch <b>diskettes.</b> Initial versions of the operating systems on the Rainbow did not allow for low-level formatting, requiring users to purchase RX50 media from Digital Equipment Corporation. The high cost of media ($5 per disk) led to accusations of vendor [...] "lock-in" [...] against Digital. However, later versions of MS-DOS and CP/M allowed formatting of diskettes.|$|R
