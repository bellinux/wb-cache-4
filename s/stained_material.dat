In other spots there were tracks of slimy ooze in which one might sink a long way. None of them, however, was fastidious, and they waded out into the mire, {{shouting}} warnings to one another, disappearing now and then among the grass. The search was partially rewarded, for while Prescott and a companion were skirting a clump of reeds they saw part of a soaked garment protruding from the slime. For a few moments they stood looking at it irresolutely; and then Prescott, mustering his courage, advanced and seized the <b>stained</b> <b>material.</b> It came away more readily than he had expected, {{and he turned to}} his companion, conscious of keen relief, with a brown overall jacket in his hand. A further examination, shrinkingly made, revealed nothing else, and after marking the place they waded to the bank. The garment was carefully washed in the creek and the men gathered in a ring round Curtis when he inspected it.|$|E

It presents a strong affinity for PTA and becomes then very electron dense. This affinity disappears afterdigestion by hyaluronidase and remains unchanged after the action of proteases (trypsin, pronase).
