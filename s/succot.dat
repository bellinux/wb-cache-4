The inability of the messengers to reach communities outside Israel before mid-month High Holy Days (<b>Succot</b> and Passover) led outlying communities to celebrate scriptural festivals for two days rather than one, observing the second feast-day of the Jewish diaspora because of uncertainty of whether the previous month ended after 29 or 30 days.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} are not allowed to mingle during prayer services, and Orthodox synagogues {{generally}} include a divider, called a mechitza, creating separate men's and women's sections. This idea comes from the old Jewish practice during the times of the temple in Jerusalem when there was a women's balcony in the Ezrat Nashim to separate the male and female spectators at the special <b>Succot</b> celebrations. There is also a prophecy in Zechariah (Zechariah 12:12) that talks about {{men and women}} mourning separately. The Talmud took this account and inferred that if men and women should be separate in times of mourning, then they certainly should be separate in times of happiness.|$|E

50|$|The Chagim {{are also}} unique experiences. There are no minyanim for Rosh Hashanah nor {{for the first}} days of <b>Succot</b> and Pesach, but luckily there are shuls around the area that can suffice.

The chazanim are students and there typically is either a student or Rabbi who explains the service during the day.|$|E

In 2004 he stated before an Israeli court that any Jew guilty of selling parts of what he termed the Land of Israel falls under the law of Din Rodef, meaning he is subject to being killed legally under religious law.

The agents attempted to negotiate to make him surrender, but because of the attacker's resistance and his continuous shots, the forces were forced to open fire on him because he had aroused the panic among a large number of hotel guests who were resting there during the holiday of <b>Succot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The case arose after Orthodox Jews in Montreal erected succahs {{on their}} {{balconies}} {{in a residential}} building which they owned. Succahs are small dwellings in which Jews live during <b>Succot,</b> a Jewish holiday, {{in accordance with the}} Hebrew Bible. However, those who managed the buildings, Syndicat Northcrest, claimed the succahs violated by-laws forbidding structures to be built on the balconies. The Orthodox Jews had not seen this requirement as applying to religious requirements because Christmas decorations and the like were allowed. Syndicat Northcrest denied all requests that succahs be built, except one to be shared but this did not however meet minimal Jewish Halachic requirements. Consequently, an injunction by Syndicat Northcrest was filed against further succahs.|$|E

50|$|The yahrzeit candle is lit {{during the}} week of Shiva (mourning).

These holidays all have yizkor (memorial) in synagogue as well. Many observant Jews light Yahrzeit candles at the start of holidays which last for two or three days in order to allow the lighting of candles on other days, since on holidays other Shabbat and Yom Kippur lighting of flames is prohibited, while transfer of fire is permitted. 48 hour and 72 hour candles have also been manufactured for these purposes.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the ways}} to use a bamboo mat for S'chach (for the top of a sukkah). The Bamboo Mat is made from Bamboo sticks then it's cut {{vertical}} and tied with a thin string. Although you can use palm leaves and pine tree branches etcetera, But the Bamboo Mat can be used yearly as opposed to palm leaves and pine tree branches etcetera that can't be used yearly. Also another advantage is that if you will use palm leaves and pine tree branches etcetera, leaves and chips of wood might fall off from the palm leaves and pine tree branches etcetera , but if you use a bamboo mat for S'chach usually leaves and chips of wood would less likely to fall off from the s'chach Once <b>Succot</b> is over, it can just as easily be rolled up into about 6" [...] in diameter depending on your bamboo mat so for example if you have a bamboo mat that's 5' x 10' it will usually be 5' feet tall, making storage and retrieval simple year after year.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about a Jewish folk-vernacular {{building}} type called the succah (plural <b>succot).</b> The succah is a temporary ritual-dwelling built for and lived in during the eight days of the festival of <b>Succot.</b> This holiday commemorates the protection provided by God for the biblical Israelites during their forty year sojourn in the Sinai desert. The first historical reference to <b>succot</b> is literary; they are mentioned in the Hebrew bible and thus {{have a history of}} almost three millennia. <b>Succot</b> are still being built in contemporary Jewish communities world-wide. My thesis is an attempt to place the contemporary succah in historical context by drawing upon the considerable literary tradition in which the structure is rooted. I will also investigate the succah as it exists today, drawing on six case studies conducted in the Jewish community of Montreal in the fall of 1996. My first chapter will explore the nature of the succah in terms of the interplay of holy and profane space that is particular to Judaism. My second chapter will focus on the profane function of the succah, or the succah as dwelling. My final chapter focuses on the building processes and the results of these processes in contemporary Montreal. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Thesis (M. A.) [...] Carleton University (Canada), 1997.

40|$|Professor Moon {{discusses}} the religious freedom case of Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem which {{held that a}} condominium association’s refusal to permit Orthodox Jewish unit-owners to construct succahs on their balconies {{as part of the}} Jewish festival of <b>Succot</b> breached their freedom of religion. Although this case was decided under the Quebec Charter, Professor Moon believes that the principles directly apply to a claim under section 2 (a) of the Charter. In holding that the condominium association had violated the appellants’ freedom of relgion, the majority judgment of Justice Iacobucci made two significant determinations concerning the scope of the freedom. First, Justice Iacobucci held the freedom of religion protects practices that are not part of an established religious belief system. Second, a practice will be protected under the section even though it is not regarded as obligatory by the individual claimant. He argues that the two holdings do not sit well together. The first suggests that religious beliefs/practices are a personal matter and should be protected under the single right to freedom of conscience and religion because they have been chosen by the individual or because they are the outcome of his or her autonomous judgment. The second holding suggests that spiritual beliefs are different from other moral and fundamental beliefs and practices and should receive special protection because they are part of an individual’s deeply rooted cultural identity, and connect him to a larger cultural religious community...|$|E
