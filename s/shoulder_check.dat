25|$|On February 22, 2011, in a {{game against}} the Carolina Hurricanes, Staal was checked by his brother, Eric. Marc was looking down, {{fighting}} for the puck with another Hurricanes player, when Eric came and threw a hard <b>shoulder</b> <b>check,</b> and Marc was slow to get up. It was a legal check, and Marc played {{for the rest of the}} season, setting career highs with 22 assists and 29 points. However, it was revealed before the Rangers' 2011 training camp began that Staal was suffering from post-concussion symptoms. He did not play until January 2, 2012, in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic against the Philadelphia Flyers. He only played 46 games in 2011–12, struggling to get his timing back from the injury as he posted a career worst −7 and only five points (two goals and three assists). He got better as the season went on, however, and helped the Rangers reach the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Check</b> Challenge is a {{challenge}} where contestants must drive {{in a straight line}} until they pass a sign on each side. The signs determine which of the two exits the contestants must take when the road forks ahead; however, the signs are posted in the reverse direction, so the contestants must briefly look behind them to read the signs. If neither exit is permitted, they are simply instructed to stop in front of the fork in the road. The lesson of this challenge is to only turn the head when performing a <b>shoulder</b> <b>check.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Camaro Challenge: The <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Check</b> Challenge - The {{traditional}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> {{challenge will}} {{be done in the}} Camaro this year. In this challenge, drivers must drive past a set of lights at 80 km/h and look behind them to see which way to go to avoid a large stop sign in front of them (if neither side is safe, they are directed to stop in front of the sign). Paul, despite Andrew's visible concern due to a perceived larger blind spot, passes easily. Jamie fails as she turns her wheel as she does her checks. Lance does not turn in time, and hits the stop sign. Dean passes easily, while Brad goes too fast and goes the wrong way. Dale also passed, but she didn't see which way to go and blindly guessed. Diane, who has trouble accelerating to highway speeds, accelerates to 80 km/h, but didn't <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> at all, crashing into the stop sign. Scott drives too fast and doesn't have time to check both shoulders, resulting in him taking the wrong turn and failing, but his joking about the failure is the straw that breaks the camel's back for Danny. As they leave the course, Danny lashes out at Scott for failing to take things seriously, calling him [...] "Hollywood". Danny then goes on to tell Andrew that he had overheard Scott bragging about his speeding habits to Jamie and Raeanne the previous night, and intending to tell the panel that he hadn't learned anything, further proving Scott's unwillingness to improve his attitude.|$|E
50|$|The Lane Change Challenge is a {{challenge}} where the drivers are on a two-lane course. The goal is to pass Andrew twice as he drives around. Key to this challenge is learning the proper technique for lane changes (Check the side mirrors, Activate the indicator, <b>Shoulder</b> <b>check,</b> Lane change). Each infraction committed or improperly-executed lane change requires the guilty driver to pass Andrew one extra time. The challenge concludes when only one contestant is left on the course.|$|E
5000|$|Shoulder Checks - In a new challenge, {{the contestants}} must {{accelerate}} their car up to 60 km/h before encountering a sign. After reading the sign by shoulder checking, they {{must take the}} correct exit at {{a fork in the}} road. Contestants have five attempts, failing if they fail to make the <b>shoulder</b> <b>check,</b> making the wrong exit, or hitting any obstacle. Teagan tries to cheat by removing his head restraint (though with it he passes on his third try), while Lindsay learns to [...] "watch the road" [...] when she passes on her second try (no one passes on their first try, while Ashley is the only other contestant to pass on her second). Emily, who is too vision-impaired to drive without glasses, makes it on her final attempt, but it is later discovered that she guessed an exit at random and had guessed right. Donna is too scared to go up to 60 km/h, and she even failed a run at 50 km/h (but did pass a 30 km/h run). Amy fails all five runs, but discovers that while making the <b>shoulder</b> <b>check,</b> she drifts her car to the right to overcompensate a natural leftwards drift when she turns her body.|$|E
25|$|His next fight, April 1994, he met former WBO Light Heavyweight Michael Moorer, who was {{attempting}} {{to become the first}} southpaw to become the universally recognised world heavyweight champion. He dropped Moorer in round two, but lost a twelve-round majority decision. When he went to the hospital to have his <b>shoulder</b> <b>checked,</b> he was diagnosed with a heart condition and had to announce his retirement from boxing. It later surfaced that the chairman of the medical advisory board for the Nevada State Athletic Commission believed his condition to be consistent with HGH use.|$|R
60|$|De Chavasse {{would again}} have interposed. He stooped {{and picked up}} Sue's cloak which had fallen to the ground, and as {{he went up to}} her with the obvious {{intention}} of replacing it around her <b>shoulders,</b> she <b>checked</b> him, with a slight motion of her hand.|$|R
40|$|Forty-two {{percent of}} concussions in ice hockey {{are caused by}} hits {{involving}} shoulder-to-head contact. The goal of this project was to determine how shoulder pad stiffness affects head impact severity when players delivered checks to an instrumented dummy. Fifteen participants administered “the hardest <b>shoulder</b> <b>checks</b> they were comfortable delivering” {{to the head of}} an instrumented dummy. Trials were conducted with participants wearing two common types of shoulder pads, with and without a 2 cm thick layer of polyurethane foam over the shoulder pad cap. The study found that a 2 cm thick foam layer overlying the shoulder cap reduced peak linear accelerations to the head by 21. 6 - 27. 7 %, peak rotational velocities by 10. 5 - 13. 8 %, while causing no significant increase in shoulder impact velocity. Therefore, integration of foam padding on top of plastic caps warrants further examination as a method for preventing brain injuries in ice hockey...|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Andrew recalls an {{incident}} in the past year where a contestant on the Dutch equivalent of this series, De Allerslechtste Chauffeur van Nederland, injured host Ruben Nicolai and a cameraman during its <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> challenge, and how it has put him on edge (Canada's Worst Driver 7 was filmed as the Dutch series was airing in the Netherlands). The episode also opens with Tab and Afiya seeking help from Shyamala between episodes to address Tab driving anxiety and Afiya's lack of taking on responsibility.|$|E
50|$|In the 2006-07 season, Eaves {{recorded}} career highs {{in points}} (32) and assists (18) which included 10 points (6-4) in 13 games in January. In game {{three of the}} first round of the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs on Sunday, April 15, 2007, Eaves took a violent <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> to the head after coming around the Penguins' net from Pittsburgh Penguins forward Colby Armstrong, causing him to be carried off the ice on a stretcher. He did not return to play the rest of the series. In the Eastern Conference finals against the Buffalo Sabres, Eaves returned to the lineup in the series-deciding game five.|$|E
50|$|VandeVelde {{was summoned}} {{for a hearing}} with the NHL Department of Player Safety {{as a result of}} an elbow he {{delivered}} to the head of Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews in a game on March 16, 2016. VandeVelde approached Toews with a lowered posture and back from a side angle, and could have delivered a legal <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> through the body. Instead, prior to impact, VandeVelde raised and extended his left elbow to deliver a direct hit to the head and jaw of Toews. On March 18, 2016, the league announced that VandeVelde had been suspended for two games for the elbow, forfeiting $7,661 US in salary.|$|E
50|$|Following the World Cup McIntosh {{came home}} to have her <b>shoulder</b> <b>checked</b> out by Doctors after it had been giving her grief for 8 months leading into and during the games & World Cup. Scans showed McIntosh needed surgery but {{due to the fact}} that she was the only B {{qualifier}} for Australia for the upcoming 2004 Athens Olympic Games the surgeon Greg Hoy tried to do as little as possible to not hamper her preparations for the Olympics. But 3 months to go before Athens and the pain was too much and Cecilia just couldn't get a decent pre-departure throw out and needed to go back into surgery for a full shoulder reconstruction meaning she would miss the 2004 Olympic Games. Ten months later saw her have more complications with the shoulder forcing her to go in for surgery yet again. Trying desperately hard to return to her best and qualify for the 2006 Melbourne, Australia Commonwealth Games Cecilia just couldn't get over the shoulder injury that had plagued her for 4 years. She then left the sport because of the problems with her shoulder.|$|R
50|$|After {{a career-high}} 19 goals, 29 assists and 48 points, in 2006-07, Ouellet {{signed with the}} Tampa Bay Lightning.

50|$|During the 2011 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2011, Steckel {{landed a}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> {{directly}} {{to the head of}} Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby, who was not any way near in possession of the puck. Crosby experienced mild concussion symptoms and neck pain but remained in the game. A subsequent hit from Tampa Bay's Victor Hedman left Crosby with severe concussion symptoms and he did not return {{for the rest of the}} regular season, the 2010-11 Stanley Cup Playoffs, or the first twenty games of the 2011-12 NHL season. Hedman later said that he believed it was Steckel's hit which had caused Crosby's severe concussion, and many observers concurred that it was the hit from Steckel which indeed caused Crosby's head injury.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Check</b> Challenge - {{to teach}} {{shoulder}} checking, contestants must speed down a straightaway at 70 km/h, {{and check on}} both sides {{to see if the}} signs are green or red, and if necessary, take an appropriate turn at a fork in the road ahead. Contestants have only one attempt at this challenge. Jakob is the first to pass after stopping at the fork when he is faced with reds on both sides. Jojo passes facing a left-side green. Crystal and Arun hit the side of the road, while Mike, Melissa, and Angelina all plow into the fork in the road. As for Father Giles, he goes too slow and does not make his exit, leading Andrew to teach him how to accelerate to 120 km/h (so high it is over the speed limit everywhere in Canada).|$|E

60|$|They were in {{the open}} road again, and John Willet was walking on behind his escort, as he had come, {{thinking}} very steadily {{of what he had}} just now seen, when Hugh drew him suddenly aside, and almost at the same instant three horsemen swept past--the nearest brushed his <b>shoulder</b> even then--who, <b>checking</b> their steeds as suddenly as they could, stood still, and waited for their coming up.|$|R
50|$|This game mimics real {{ice hockey}} {{in that the}} player can shoot, pass or dump the puck, and he can perform hip, <b>shoulder</b> and poke <b>checks.</b> The player can even fake a slap shot and aim his shot on goal to a {{particular}} corner of the net. There are numerous penalties that the player can commit, including tripping, cross checking, slashing, roughing, hooking, interference, icing and offsides. The player on offense could exploit a tactic of dumping the puck over the goalie's head, thereby creating an indefensible shot.|$|R

50|$|Hamilton made {{a rather}} auspicious debut with the Rangers on a Wednesday night hockey broadcast. As Frank Mahovlich came flying down the boards {{at the old}} Maple Leaf Gardens as only the Big M could, 19-year-old Al {{suddenly}} entered the playing surface from the New York bench (allegedly) on a line change and decked the unsuspecting Mahovlich with a thundering <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> that required smelling salts to the prone Big M. While he played a few games for the Rangers in 1966, he toiled {{for the next three}} seasons in the minors, winning all-star accolades for the Omaha Knights of the Central Hockey League in 1967 and spending the two years thereafter with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League. Hamilton finally cracked the Rangers' lineup in 1969, playing in 59 games, but he had arrived {{at a time when the}} Ranger defence was stacked and a new kid named Brad Park was turning heads. Hamilton was left unprotected for the 1970 NHL Expansion Draft and was selected by the Buffalo Sabres as their third choice.|$|E
50|$|Challenger Challenge: The Shoulder-Check Challenge - After {{a posture}} lesson from Philippe, the annual {{challenge}} {{must be taken}} at 60 km/h. Contestants have up to two attempts to try and clear the course this year. Shirley passes easily on her first try. Aaron accelerates to 80 km/h in his first run, {{and when he does}} his <b>shoulder</b> <b>check,</b> he takes one hand of the wheel when checking to the right (as if he's preparing to drive in reverse), takes an exit (which {{turned out to be the}} right one), and careens out of control for a long period after the exit is taken. After a bit more practice, he narrowly passes his second run. In both of Sly's runs, he hits the lane obstacles as he prepares to take the correct exit. Lauri passes on her first try, despite temporarily going under speed. Afiya also passes on her first try. Tab also speeds to 80 km/h before taking the wrong exit (but clearing it) in her first run. She attributes the failure to panicking, and she similarly panics in her second run, randomly guessing (correctly) an exit. Because she guessed, she fails. Ben accelerates to 90 km/h in his first run and hits the center marker. He also goes over-speed in his second run, but he does clear the course.|$|E
5000|$|Mustang Challenge: <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Check</b> Challenge: This challenge, {{in which}} drivers must {{accelerate}} to 70 km/h and then correctly perform a <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> to determine on {{which side of}} an obstacle {{it is safe to}} turn in order to avoid it, has a new twist in that the drivers have two runs and will always be told to stop before the obstacle on the first run, thus also making this a test of their braking and speed control. Dallas drives too fast in her first run and her hair {{gets in the way of}} her eyes, resulting in her taking the right turn rather than stopping. After resetting (and putting in a hair clip) for her second run, she passes without difficulty. Diane has a similarly poor initial run, speeding and turning the wheel as she turns her head; on her second run, she correctly identifies the lane she needs to go into, but turns too early and takes out some of the lane markers, though is felt to have understood the lesson, despite failing it. Klyne correctly identifies that he's meant to stop on his first run, but drives far too fast and hits the central obstacle before he can stop. Keeping his speed under control, he passes with no trouble on the second run. Azim drives too fast and with only one hand on the wheel in his first run, meaning he can't stop or fully avoid the central obstacle; on his second run he repeats the same mistake and even turns into the wrong lane, clearly failing the challenge. Due to a misunderstanding of the rules, Flora takes the right-hand exit on her first run instead of stopping, but passes the challenge without any trouble on the second run. Margherita drives at over 90 km/h in her initial run and doesn't even have time to check both shoulders before plowing into the lane markers, only narrowly avoiding the obstacle. On her second run, she speeds again, turns into the wrong lane and smashes the passenger side wing mirror when she clips the central obstacle. Since Kevin has an inherent disadvantage with only one eye, Andrew tells him ahead of time that he will be required to stop on his first run, only for Kevin to brake too late and hit the obstacle. On his second run, Kevin attempts to cheat by only checking over his left shoulder and reasoning that due to the red signal on that side he must be required to turn to his right; while he does this successfully, he fails for not understanding the challenge. Robert is the last to take the challenge, after Andrew gives him a lesson in driving at high speeds, and ironically ends up driving too fast and completely demolishing the central obstacle on his first run. His second run goes more successfully, and he completes the challenge.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the <b>shoulder</b> to <b>check</b> to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|R
50|$|When Brown {{was four}} years old, he {{witnessed}} {{the murder of his}} father. He was then sent, along with his brothers and sisters, to live at the Texas Masonic Home, an orphanage for the children of deceased Freemasons in Fort Worth, Texas. At the Masonic Home, Brown became friends with Tex Coulter. Brown was a standout football player for the Mighty Mites, leading them to the state semi-finals his senior year. He then enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, serving as a Paramarine during the Second World War, before playing football at Tulsa and eventually professionally. Brown became {{known as one of the}} roughest defensive players in the game, knocking out numerous opponents with his trademark shoulder push. The Rams once offered a bounty to any player who could take him out, and he had his <b>shoulder</b> pads <b>checked</b> before a game once to make sure he did not have metal plating or other such material stuffed in them.|$|R
50|$|Ivy (Maggie Geha) {{has gone}} with an antiquities dealer to his house. Using a potion, he obliges him {{to open a}} vault and then knocks him unconscious. After stealing, the man attacks her but she manages to escape. Meanwhile, Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) has become worried about Isabella and then {{receives}} {{a phone call from}} the GCPD. He finds about Isabella's death, with the GCPD describing it as an accident and he cries on Cobblepot's <b>shoulder,</b> devastated. Gordon <b>checks</b> on Barnes' office when he returns, suspicious as he was the last person with Symon before dying but Gordon says he didn't see anything. Barnes tells him to accompany him with an enforcer named Sugar who may be connected to the crime scene. Gordon confides to Bullock the address before leaving.|$|R
50|$|Camaro Challenge: The <b>Shoulder</b> <b>Check</b> Challenge: In {{one of the}} show's most {{frequent}} challenges, the drivers each have to approach a split lane at 70 km/h, and then check left and right over their shoulder to see which lane (designated by a green marker) they must turn into. Each driver has two runs. Angelina is first-up, and on her first run drives at 100 km/h and closes her eyes, crashing straight through the central barrier, splitting the Camaro's front bumper in half and damaging its radiator. After the Camaro is repaired, Angelina takes another attempt, and nearly gets it right, but understeers and clips the barrier. Kevin understeers on his first turn, also clipping the barrier, and on his second run he steers too early and hits the lane markers; as he and Andrew note however, even this result is an improvement on the previous year. Shelby gets the challenge exactly right on the first go, as does Shirley. On his first run, Sly can't even {{make it to the}} end of the straight before driving through the lane markers, due to him turning his whole body rather than just his head. He then hits the lane marker again on his second run, this time by steering too soon. On his first run, Michael drives too slowly (at just 60 km/h) and slows down further toward the end of the straight. Andrew asks Yolanda for her honest opinion, and she launches into a tirade against Michael, which Andrew and the experts feel is an overreaction, and theorize is caused by pent-in anger at the driving-related injuries she's suffered in the past. On his second go, Michael passes with ease. Dale seems to get the technique right on her first go, but inexplicably turns into the lane she's told not to turn into. On her second go, she only checks over one shoulder and clips the central barrier, causing her to fail.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} cycling performance of middle-aged (30 – 45 years old; n = 30) versus older (65 + years; n = 31) participants during low-speed tasks for which stabilization skills {{are known to}} be important. Additionally, participants’ self-ratings of their cycling skills and performance were assessed. Participants rode once on a conventional bicycle and once on a pedelec, in counterbalanced order. Three standardized tasks were performed: (1) low-speed cycling, (2) acceleration from a standstill, and (3) <b>shoulder</b> <b>check.</b> During Tasks 1 and 3, the mean absolute steering angle (a measure of the cyclist’s steering activity) and the mean absolute roll rate (a measure of the amount of angular movement of the frame) were significantly greater for older participants than for middle-aged participants. These large lateral motions among older cyclists may indicate a difficulty to control the inherently unstable system. Comparing the conventional bicycle and the pedelec, participants reached a 16 km/h threshold speed in Task 2 sooner on the pedelec, an effect that was most pronounced among the older participants. Correlations between skills assessed with the Cycling Skill Inventory and actual measures of cycling performance were mostly not statistically significant. This indicates that self-reported motor-tactical and safety skills are not strongly predictive of measures of actual cycling performance. Our findings add to the existing knowledge on self-assessment of cycling skills, and suggest that age-related changes in psychomotor and sensory functions pose hazards for cycling safety.

40|$|Concussions {{occur at}} an {{unacceptable}} {{rate in the}} sport of ice hockey. Efforts are made to improve its prevention by modifying protective equipment and implementing rules of conduct; yet {{the effectiveness of these}} methods remains unknown as {{there is a lack of}} evidence pointing to a mechanical metric able to adequately predict concussion. The purpose of this thesis was to identify metrics which best characterize concussion following ice hockey collisions and provide values reflecting concussion risk. The first study reported effective mass of shoulder checks, extended elbow strikes, and tucked-in elbow strikes using 15 competitive ice hockey players as subjects. The results were used to guide the impact mass and compliance of laboratory reconstructions of real-world ice hockey collisions done in the second study. Analysis of these reconstruction showed that concussions following shoulder and elbow to head collisions in ice hockey occurred at low peak linear and angular accelerations and that impulse duration played a large role in the mechanism of injury. The results also indicated that concussion risk estimations are specific to the mechanism of loading. A 50 % likelihood of concussion following a <b>shoulder</b> <b>check</b> to the head was established for peak angular accelerations of 9. 2, 6. 9, 4. 6, and 2. 2 krad/s^ 2 for impulse durations of 15, 20, 25, and 30 ms, respectively. A 50 % likelihood of concussion following an extended elbow to the head was established for peak linear accelerations of 23, 15, and 7 g for impulse durations of 15, 20, and 25 ms, respectively. Finally, the third study reported brain tissue stress and strain comparable to the ones obtained reconstructing concussive impacts in American football, rugby, and Australian rules football despite having lower peak linear and angular acceleration values. This thesis has provided a new sport concussion data set acquired using a methodology guided by the biomechanics of ice hockey player volunteer testing, has identified metrics which can adequately predict concussion, and has established concussion risk levels. This information will be of use to helmet manufacturing companies, companies developing concussion detection sensors, and governing bodies in their efforts to eliminate concussion from the sport of ice hockey...|$|E
50|$|During {{his three}} {{seasons in the}} Western Hockey League with the Saskatoon Blades, Scissons made an impact, scoring 30 goals and 56 assists in his rookie season, plus 40 goals in his sophomore one, to climb up on the scout rankings for the 1990 draft. However, soon the {{injuries}} that would mar his career would manifest. At 18, Scissons went through a discectomy, and a wrist injury would follow, ailments that would cut him spots at Team Canada for two straight World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Scissons made his NHL debut with the Islanders, appearing in one game {{at the end of}} the 1990-91 season. He then spent the 1991-92 season playing with the Canadian National Hockey Team, and during a game with the Montreal Canadiens injured his <b>shoulder</b> in a <b>check</b> by John LeClair.

30|$|All {{patients}} {{received a}} prophylactic dose of 1 gm cefoperazone + sulbactum intravenously preoperatively. The operation {{was done in}} supine position with small sand bag under shoulder, under general anaesthesia. Fracture was exposed through delto-pectoral approach. Fracture fragments were reduced without stripping periosteum to maximum possible achievable anatomical position and reduction was held with Kirschner wires. Reduction was checked under image intensifier. Definitive fixation with locking proximal humeral plate was done with plate positioned lateral to bicipital groove sparing tendon of long head of biceps. The plate was placed at least 1  cm distal to {{the upper end of}} greater tubercle. Plate was fixed with screw at longitudinal dynamic hole. After achieving near anatomical reduction, multidirectional screws were used to fix proximal fragments. Meticulous repairs of the rotator cuff, capsule and subscapularis muscle tears/avulsions were carried out, if found pre-operatively. Lesser tuberosity was fixed with a separate screw/wire if found avulsed. Range of motion of <b>shoulder</b> was <b>checked</b> on the table for impingement. Wound was closed under negative suction, which was removed after 48 hours. The patient were followed up at 15  days, then monthly for 6  months, and then at 12  months for final evaluation. Standard anteroposterior and axillary radiographs were obtained and evaluated for bony healing, non-union, malunion, loosening of implant, loss of reduction and avascular necrosis of head of humerus. Comparing the immediate postoperative radiographs and those taken {{at the time of the}} final assessment assessed loss of reduction. Assessment and analysis of any complications including axillary nerve injury and impingement due to plate was done. Functional outcome was assessed according to Constant–Murley score [13]. The Constant–Murley score was graded as poor (0 – 55 points), moderate (56 – 70), good (71 – 85), or excellent (86 – 100).|$|R
50|$|In the slow, {{strategic}} race {{held in a}} {{light rain}} on a muddy dirt track Michel Jazy {{was more of a}} 1500 meter runner and expected to be ready for a fast finish. He kept himself in the lead or close to the lead throughout. Schul found himself on the curb boxed in by a loping Keino who seemed to be marking the field {{on the outside of the}} pack that also included future world record holder Ron Clarke. With 600 metres to go, the future coach of Steve Prefontaine, Bill Dellinger made the first move coming around the entire pack and into the lead. At age 30, old for an amateur athlete in this era, Dillinger came out of retirement to make one last attempt after failing to make the Olympic final the previous two Olympiads. Dillinger's move was marked by Jazy as the pace quickened. Nikolay Dutov came around the entire pack to challenge Jazy and Dillinger. Shortly after the bell, Jazy decided to take off, jumping to the lead with Harald Norpoth coming from mid pack to become his closest pursuer 5 metres back as the field stretched out. A one speed runner, Clarke had no answer for the speedsters. With 300 to go, Schul came from fifth place to start picking off runners to get to Norpoth with 200 to go. Through the turn he passed Norpoth with Jazy constantly looking over his <b>shoulder</b> to <b>check</b> his pursuer. Jazy still had a two metres lead as they reached the final straight. But that lead disappeared rapidly as Schul sprinted by to take the gold medal. Jazy now watched Norpoth as he slowly edged by just before the finish. Given all he could, Jazy tried to maintain and glide across the finish line, but Dellinger, in full sprint, caught Jazy at the line to take the bronze medal.|$|R
