50|$|Screw-in studs {{are often}} longer and sharper than {{permanent}} caulkins {{and thus are}} removed when the horse is not working. The hole for the stud is plugged with cotton, rubber plugs, or a stud blank so dirt does not ruin the threads of the hole. Due to risk of injury, horses are not shipped in studs or left unattended with <b>studs</b> <b>screwed</b> in.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "stop" [...] part {{comes from}} the fact that the string ends are held in place or they [...] "stop" [...] inside the bar. The bar is mounted on top of the guitar body usually by means of sturdy {{threaded}} metal <b>studs</b> <b>screwed</b> into threaded sleeves embedded into the body of the guitar. The studs and stopbar are located behind the separate bridge piece.|$|R
50|$|Screw-in <b>studs</b> simply <b>screw</b> {{into the}} {{existing}} threaded bolt {{hole in the}} hub. The end that screws into the hub is usually either threaded with a higher tolerance fit or installed with a chemical thread-locking fluid {{to keep it from}} backing out from the hub when the lug nut is removed.|$|R
50|$|Hoof {{boots are}} {{commonly}} {{seen as a}} substitute to horseshoes, either as a backup for a thrown shoe when a farrier is not available, or as an alternative form of hoof protection for a barefoot horse. Horse boots are used in all riding disciplines and are particularly popular for trail riding and endurance riding. They are also used on horses in parades and on police horses who work on hard pavement. Hoof boots may also be used when transitioning a horse from shod to unshod riding, or carried during a ride in case a horse throws a shoe. In areas with persistently slippery conditions in winter, hoof boots are often used in combination with <b>studs</b> <b>screwed</b> into the soles. This allows the horse to be ridden safely on slippery surfaces. This must be done with a hoof boot with a sufficiently thick and inflexible sole to avoid bruising of the hoof sole. Boots with soles that are too flexible are unsuitable for studding.|$|R

60|$|Next morning {{men from}} the shore saw the Haliotis through a cloud, for {{it was as though}} the deck smoked.

The donkey-engine worked - at a price - the price of constant attention and furious stoking- worked long enough to allow a wire-rope (it was made up of a funnel and a foremast-stay) to be led into the engine-room and made fast on the cylinder-cover of the forward engine. That rose easily enough, and was hauled through the skylight and on to the deck, many hands assisting the doubtful steam. Then came the tug of war, for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed piston-rod.

After four hours of this furious work, the piston-rod suddenly slipped, and the piston rose with a jerk, knocking one or two men over into the engine-room. But when Mr. Wardrop declared that the piston had not split, they cheered, and thought nothing of their wounds; and the donkey-engine was hastily stopped; its boiler was nothing to tamper with.|$|R

50|$|For {{use with}} heavy loads (such as {{encountered}} by {{a milling machine}} spindle), there is usually a key to prevent rotation and/or a threaded section, which is engaged by a drawbar that engages either the threads or {{the head of a}} pull <b>stud</b> that is <b>screwed</b> into them. The drawbar is then tightened, drawing the shank firmly into the spindle. The draw-bar is important on milling machines as the transverse force component would otherwise cause the tool to wobble out of the taper.|$|R

Modern designs started using power drawbars that gripped pull studs (also known as retention knobs) that were screwed into the tool shank rather than screw-in drawbars. The power drawbar would grip the pull <b>stud</b> rather than <b>screwing</b> into the tool shank.|$|R

This paper will present the full derivation of the author&# 039;s theory of the air borne sound transmission of double leaf cavity walls due to the structure borne sound transmission across the air cavity via point or line connections which are modeled as four pole networks. The theoretical results will be compared with experimental results on wooden stud cavity walls from the National Research Council of Canada because the screw spacing is given for these results.

50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal <b>screws,</b> <b>studs</b> and bolts. Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks. A heavy object can be raised by turning the jack shaft, but when the shaft is released it will stay at whatever height it is raised to.|$|R
5000|$|The stopbar {{can either}} simply slip onto notches {{on top of}} the studs, or be held in place using set screws.

When it is held in place using the screws, it is sometimes referred to as a [...] "locking stopbar". In these designs, the Tune-o-matic bridge section is also usually fastened to its embedded <b>studs</b> by set <b>screws.</b> This fastening of the key components in a stoptail bridge system is claimed to impart more sustain and tone to the guitar's sound.|$|R
40|$|As per {{the modern}} Industrial requirements, higher surface finish {{mechanical}} components and mating parts with close limits and tolerances, {{is one of}} the most important requirement. Abrasive machining processes are generally the last operations performed on manufactured products for higher surface finishing and for fine or small scale material removal. Higher surface finish and high rate of removal can be obtained if a large number of grains act together. This is accomplished by using bonded abrasives as in grinding wheel or by modern machining processes. In the present study, Taguchi method or Design of experiments has been used to optimize the effect of cylindrical grinding parameters such as wheel speed (rpm), work speed, feed (mm/min.), depth of cut and cutting fluid on the surface roughness of EN 15 AM steel. Ground surface roughness measurements were carried out by Talysurf surface roughness tester. EN 15 AM steel has several industrial applications in manufacturing of engine shafts, connecting rods, spindles, <b>studs,</b> bolt, <b>screws</b> etc. The results indicated that grinding wheel speed, work piece speed, table feed rate and depth of cut were the significant factors for the surface roughness and material removal rate. Surface roughness is minimum at 2000 r. p. m. of grinding wheel speed, work piece speed 80 rpm, feed rate 275 mm/min. and 0. 06 mm depth of cut...|$|R
40|$|The use of accelerometers {{to monitor}} the {{vibrations}} of either complex machinery or simple component involves some considerations about the mounting of the sensor to the structure. Different types of mounting solutions are commonly used but in all cases they can be classified {{in one of these}} categories: <b>stud</b> mounting, <b>screw</b> mounting, adhesive mounting, magnetic mounting and probe sensing. Indeed each of them has a specific field of application depending on e. g. the mounting surface conditions, the temperature, the accessibility to the specific mounting point, etc. The choice of the mounting solution has a important effect on the accuracy of the usable frequency response of the accelerometer, since the higher the stiffness of the fixing, the higher the low-pass frequency limit of the mounting. This paper specifically focuses on adhesive mounting of accelerometers, which includes a great number of different products from the temporary adhesives like the beeswax to the permanent ones like cyanoacrylate polymers. Among the variety of commercial adhesives, three specific glues have been experimentally compared to assess their transmissivity and the results are reported in this paper. A two component methylmethacrylate (HBM X 60), a modified silane (Terostat 737) and a cyanoacrylate (Loctite 401) adhesives have been used to joint two aluminium bases, one connected to an accelerometer and the other to the head of electromagnetic shaker.

The published article is copyrighted by Crop Science Society of America {{and can be found}} at: [URL] simulators are often utilized when researching turfgrass wear tolerance and recovery. However, the availability of a durable traffic simulator capable of producing dynamic force is limited. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to: 1) evaluate a novel traffic simulator with improved durability and capable of producing dynamic force and 2) evaluate the bio-physical effects of the traffic simulator on a native soil turfgrass system. The Baldree Traffic Simulator is a modified Ryan GA 30 riding aerification unit, equipped with fabricated, spring loaded steel plate feet <b>studded</b> with <b>screw</b> in cleats. The effects of this unit on a ‘Tifway’ bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon [L. ] Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) system established on a Tifton loamy sand (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults) were evaluated at the Coastal Plains Experiment Station, Tifton, GA. Factors included location (1 and 2) and traffic rate (0, 12 and 24 passes applied over a 6 week period). Field data included soil bulk density, turf density, and percent green turf cover. An in-ground force plate at the McPhail Equine Performance Center, East Lansing, MI was used to quantify vertical and net shear ground reaction force produced by the Baldree traffic simulator when operated in the forward and backward direction. The Baldree traffic simulator produced more cleat marks per pass than the Brinkman and Cady traffic simulators, as well as vertical force values comparable to that of a trotting horse. At the low traffic rate the Baldree traffic simulator increased soil bulk density, while turf density, percent green turf cover and vegetative indices decreased, therefore, the tool can be used to simulate heavy traffic conditions with a minimum number of passes...|$|R
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 26, 2014). [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Cold-formed steel studs {{have been approved}} for their blast-resistance capability. Research concerns nowadays focus on how to adapt and develop the wall system to resist different levels of blast threats. Recently, experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate several proposed ways to enhance stud resistance against moderate blast loading. However, lab testing is of a time and a cost consuming nature. Consequently, the provision to develop a comprehensive numerical model for cold-formed steel stud walls using various connection details and bracing scenarios is urgently needed. This research puts a spotlight upon the nonlinear finite element analysis focusing on developing a suitable numerical model using ABAQUS as a finite element analysis tool. The developed model passed {{through a series of}} verifications using existing quasi-static tests data, obtained over the past 10 years, to examine the model efficiency in tracing the full load-deflection response of the wall system. The verified model was exploited to study the effect of <b>stud</b> gauge and <b>screw</b> configuration on the blast resistance. To provide an alternative tool to performing lab experiments, a failure criterion was developed, based on the different limit states of the wall components, to predict the model failure point from which the toughness was estimated. Applying ABAQUS along with the developed failure criterion, the overall performance of steel stud walls was investigated and analyzed through a total of twenty numerical simulations...|$|R
50|$|The 300 series {{equipment}} {{was introduced in}} 1937. The Tele. 332 ASTIC, Handset Micro Telephone was the standard telephone instrument issued by the GPO from 1937 until 1959, although 242Ls continued to be supplied for pay-on-answer kiosks. Essentially it was a redesign of the 232/bellset 26 combo. The term ASTIC indicates {{the use of an}} anti-sidetone induction coil, to permit only a small, controlled amount of speech signal back to the talker's ear to provide necessary sidetone for a natural communication experience. It continued in production until the mid-1960s. This was usually only available in black although ivory, red and, the especially rare, green were also produced. Although 332 is the generic for this model, by dint of superior numbers, there were four other models in the range. The glossy, sharp styled 332 gestated from the much poorer quality 330. Though similar, the quality and finish of the 330s moulding was poor, by comparison. Then there were the button phones. A 332 with the facility for one button is a 312, two buttons a 328 and three buttons a 314. For this reason, in the photos below the instrument on the left is, strictly speaking, a 314 and the one on the right a 312, despite the fact that their full potential is not being utilised.The Tele. 332L shown on the left is a bedside extension from an Extension Plan 1A. Note the addition of the BELL ON - BELL OFF push buttons, forward of the switchook cradle. The centre button position is filled with a blanking stud and only a 2 way label is installed.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three years I've worked with various {{materials}} such as glass, brass screws, vinyl, wood, wire and metal studs. This installation was a compilation of those materials. The installation and performance was autobiographical and dealt specificly with the last twenty-eight years of my life. It appeared to confuse the viewer; most thought I was making accusations against the "institution???. With all of its negative conotations, the blame lands neither on myself or on the "institution". There was no blame or revolt, it simply was a cause-effect situation. Exposure was a key point to the pieces. When you view the xerox copies you will see a series of three steps. The first step started with twenty-eight pieces of glass painted black. They were placed directly below twenty-eight boxes and attached to the wall with brass screws. People were curious as to what was under the glass or what these twenty-eight pieces of glass meant. Secondly, during the performance every piece of glass was smashed or shattered, which then exposed the blueprints. The blueprints were exactly the same thing we saw to begin with, only on a two dimensional surface. I then wrote the note, "THE PIECES FOR THIS EXHIBITION ARE ENCLOSED IN THESE BOXES". The third step, the boxes were closed throughout the installation and sold for fifty dollars. They were left closed for a specific reason which was not revealed until those who had bought them opened them. When the installation was taken down the materials that were on the outside and exposed, (tar paper, metal <b>studs,</b> blueprints, brass <b>screws</b> and broken glass), were put into the boxes. On the tar paper I wrote a similar note to the one at??? the performance, "THESE ARE THE PIECES FROM THE EXHIBITION AFTER TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS". So what was once exposed all went inside the box and the only thing left on the outside was the title or comment. The outside of each box had separate titles; a list {{can be found at the}} end of this paper. The titles played an important role in the piece because they gave clues to the personal narrative quality of the installation. (See more in text...|$|R
40|$|Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) is a {{material}} {{used in the}} fabrication of structural and non-structural elements {{for the construction of}} commercial and residential buildings. CFS exhibits several advantages over other construction materials such as wood, concrete and hot-rolled steel (structural steel). The outstanding advantages of CFS are its lower overall cost and non-combustibility. The steel industry has promoted CFS in recent decades, causing a notable increase in the usage of CFS in building construction. Yet, structural steel elements are still more highly preferred, due to the complex analysis and design procedures associated with CFS members. In addition, the seismic performance of CFS buildings and their elements is not well known. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} develop a method for the seismic assessment of the lateral-load resistant shear wall panel elements of CFS buildings. The Performance-Based Design (PBD) philosophy is adopted as the basis for conducting the seismic assessment of low- and mid-rise CFS buildings, having from one to seven storeys. Seismic standards have been developed to guide the design of buildings such that they do not collapse when subjected to specified design earthquakes. PBD provides the designer with options to choose the performance objectives to be satisfied by a building to achieve a satisfactory design. A performance objective involves the combination of an earthquake (i. e., seismic hazard) and a performance level (i. e., limit state) expected for the structure. The building capacity related to each performance level is compared with the demand imposed by the earthquake. If the earthquake demand is less than the building capacity, the structure is appropriately designed. The seismic performance of a CFS building is obtained using pushover analysis, a nonlinear method of seismic analysis. This study proposes a Simplified Finite Element Analysis (SFEA) method to carry out the nonlinear structural analysis. In this study, lateral drifts associated with four performance levels are employed as acceptance criteria for the PBD assessment of CFS buildings. The lateral drifts are determined from experimental data. In CFS buildings, one of the primary load-resistant elements is Shear Wall Panel (SWP). The SWP is constructed with vertically spaced and aligned C-shape CFS studs. The ends of the <b>studs</b> are <b>screwed</b> to the top and bottom tracks, and structural sheathing is installed on one or both sides of the wall. For the analysis of CFS buildings, Conventional Finite Element Analysis (CFEA) is typically adopted. However, CFEA is time consuming because of the large number of shell and frame elements required to model the SWP sheathing and studs. The SFEA proposed in this study consists of modeling each SWP in the building with an equivalent shell element of the same dimensions; that is, a complete SWP is modeled by a 16 -node shell element. Thus, significantly fewer elements are required to model a building for SFEA compared to that required for CFEA, saving both time and resources. A model for the stiffness degradation of a SWP is developed as a function of the lateral strength of the SWP. The model characterizes the nonlinear behaviour of SWP under lateral loading, such that a realistic response of the building is achieved by the pushover analysis. The lateral strength of a SWP must be known before its seismic performance can be assessed. In current practice, the lateral strength of a SWP is primarily determined by experimental tests due to the lack of applicable analytical methods. In this investigation, an analytical method is developed for determining the ultimate lateral strength of SWP, and associated lateral displacement. The method takes into account the various factors that affect the behaviour and the strength of SWP, such as material properties, geometrical dimensions, and construction details. To illustrate the effectiveness and practical application of the proposed methodology for carrying out the PBD assessment of CFS buildings, several examples are presented. The responses predicted by the SFEA are compared with responses determined experimentally for isolated SWP. In addition, two building models are analyzed by SFEA, and the results are compared with those found by SAP 2000 (2006). Lastly, the PBD assessment of two buildings is conducted using SFEA and pushover analysis accounting for the nonlinear behaviour of the SWP, to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed technology...|$|R
