50|$|Fig 1. {{shows the}} {{various levels of}} utility (U1, U2, U3) derived by the manager by {{combining}} different amounts of discretionary profits and <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Higher the indifference curve, higher {{is the level of}} utility derived by the manager. Hence the manager would try to be on the highest level of indifference curve possible given the constraints. <b>Staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> is plotted on the x-axis and discretionary profits on the y-axis.|$|E
50|$|The {{discretionary}} {{profit in}} this simplified model {{is equal to}} the discretionary investment. The indifference curves are downward sloping and convex to the origin. This shows diminishing marginal rate of substitution of <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> for discretionary profits. The curves are asymptotic in nature which implies that at any point of time and under any given circumstance the manager will choose positive amounts of both discretionary profits and <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{find the}} {{equilibrium}} in the model, Fig 1. is superimposed on Fig 2. The equilibrium {{point is the}} point where the discretionary profit curve is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve of the manager, which is point E in Fig 3. Staying at the highest profit point would require the manager to be at a lower indifference curve U2. In this case the highest attainable level of utility is U3. At equilibrium, the level of profits would be lower but <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> S* is higher than the <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> made at the maximum profit point. As indifference curve is downward sloping, the equilibrium point would always be on the right of the maximum profit point. Thus the model shows the higher preference of managers for <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> as compared to the discretionary investments.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies of}} health system {{responsiveness}} {{focus on the}} demand-side by investigating the association between socio-demographic characteristics of patients and their reported level of responsiveness. However, {{little is known about}} the influence of supply-side factors. This paper addresses that research gap by analysing the role of hospital-specialty characteristics in explaining variations in patients' evaluation of responsiveness from a sample of about 38, 700 in-patients treated in public hospitals within the Italian Region of Emilia-Romagna. The analysis is carried out by adopting a two-step procedure. First, we use patients' self-reported data to derive five measures of responsiveness at the hospital-specialty level. By estimating a generalised ordered probit model, we are able to correct for variations in individual reporting behaviour due to the health status of patients and their experience of being in pain. Secondly, we run cross-sectional regressions in order to investigate the association between patients' responsiveness and potential supply-side drivers, including waiting times, staff workload, the level of spending on non-clinical facilities, the level of spending on staff education and training, and the proportion of <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> between nursing and administrative staff. Results suggest that responsiveness is to some extent influenced by the supply-side drivers considered...|$|E

40|$|Public {{institutions}} of {{lower secondary education}} are financed mainly from the public resources allocated from the local budget. Expenditures incurred from these resources have a maximum limit and a destination {{set out in the}} budget of each educational unit. The revenue and expenditure budget or only the expenditure budget of a lower secondary education institution provides for the maximum amounts to be used for the expenses made throughout a budgetary exercise. Therefore, reducing the share of social security contributions from your employer by five percentage points would affect the budget of such institutions as it would lead to a modification of the social insurance contributions expenses. In this paper we have described the structure of the current expenditure of a lower secondary education institution, especially with regard to staff expenses, because they hold the largest share in the total expenditure constantly incurred by the units concerned and are affected by the social security rate change. We have also presented the theoretical aspects related to the staff expenses, the budgetary execution phases that staff expenses must cover, the accounting treatment of costs of employers' social insurance contributions, the recognition of employers’ expenses for the social insurance State contributions in the bookkeeping of lower secondary education institutions, as well as the influence of changes in rates of the social security State contributions from the employer on the <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> of the institutions mentioned...|$|E
40|$|The Austrian Federal Railway ÖBB {{was given}} a legal {{personality}} of its own on 1 January 1993. Its board was granted considerably more leeway in its decision-making power. The transport policy framework within which the ÖBB is set has changed in that bilateral truck transport with EU countries was liberalised {{in the wake of}} Austria's accession to the EU in 1995. More investment in rail transport was to strengthen the railway's competitive position. Higher taxes for the use and maintenance of cars nevertheless did not really affect competition between road and rail. In the seven years since the reform, the ÖBB kept its <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> level unchanged. Revenues from goods transport rose, which has continuously improved the expenditure/revenue ratio (excluding government payments) since 1995. The company's labour productivity rose by more than 36 percent between 1992 and 1999. Most railways in Western Europe were even more successful in their efforts to improve efficiency. The Swiss Railway SBB was even able to further boost its already high productivity level by another 50 percent. Both companies were faced with a 10 percent decline in transport prices between 1995 and 2000. The transport-specific expenditure per ton and passenger kilometre dropped by 2 percent for ÖBB, and by 16 percent for the SBB. Accordingly, {{over the past five years}} the SBB was more successful than the ÖBB in their efforts to improve business results. The ÖBB is still in a position to explore rationalisation potentials, mainly by concentrating its network and by outsourcing some activities. Both ÖBB and SBB have taken preparatory action to open their network to other railway transport businesses in accordance with Directive 91 / 440 /EEC governing fair competition. So far, two quite insignificant contracts have been signed in Austria, and none in Switzerland.

40|$|Abstract Background Special {{services}} within {{public hospitals}} {{are becoming increasingly}} common in low and middle income countries with the stated objective of providing higher comfort services to affluent customers and generating resources for under funded hospitals. In the present study expenditures, outputs and costs are analysed for the Maputo Central Hospital and its Special Clinic {{with the objective of}} identifying net resource flows between a system operating two-tier charging, and, ultimately, understanding whether public hospitals can somehow benefit from running Special Clinic operations. Methods A combination of step-down and bottom-up costing strategies were used to calculate recurrent as well as capital expenses, apportion them to identified cost centres and link costs to selected output measures. Results The results show that cost differences between main hospital and clinic are marked and significant, with the Special Clinic's cost per patient and cost per outpatient visit respectively over four times and over thirteen times their equivalent in the main hospital. Discussion While the main hospital cost structure appeared in line with those from similar studies, salary expenditures were found to drive costs in the Special Clinic (73 % of total), where capital and drug costs were surprisingly low (2 and 4 % respectively). We attributed low capital and drug costs to underestimation by our study owing to difficulties in attributing the use of shared resources and to the Special Clinic's outsourcing policy. The large <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> would be explained by higher physician time commitment, economic rents and subsidies to hospital staff. On the whole it was observed that: (a) the flow of capital and human resources was not fully captured by the financial systems in place and stayed largely unaccounted for; (b) because of the little consideration given to capital costs, the main hospital {{is more likely to be}} subsidising its Special Clinic operations, rather than the other way around. Conclusion We conclude that the observed lack of transparency may create scope for an inequitable cross subsidy of private customers by public resources. </p...|$|E
40|$|Banking {{is a major}} {{employment}} sector, {{which has}} experienced phenomenal growth over the last decade. Following the de-regulation of the financial marketplace and the entry of ‘new players', the industry has suffered from an almost ruinous internal struggle between its traditional, gentlemanly ethos (Clarke and Vincent, 1989) and the enforced adoption of aggressive sales and marketing strategies (Knights and Tinker, 1997). My research has investigated the various ways that ‘change’ (particularly strategic change consequential to the piecemeal adoption of ‘Japanese-style' systems of working and management -'HRM, TQM and lean production) have been met, experienced, negotiated, {{and to some extent}} contested, by branch-based employees working for Bank UK (one of the historic 'big four' clearing banks). Data was gathered through varying periods of participant observation in seven branches of Bank UK over two years, supplemented by group and individual interviews with managers and staff. A key informant was later recruited, who added both depth and a greater understanding of raw data. My thesis suggests that changing strategies (particularly those introduced in order to strengthen market position and expand sales opportunities) have created multiple paradoxes in the management and organisation of work in Bank UK, mostly through issues of cost At the same time as attempting to drive through a whole raft of changes that clearly involved increasing employee participation and commitment through teamworking, Kaizen activity, performance related pay and individual sales bids, the bank had been concerned to decrease operating costs in an attempt to improve key economic ratios. Between 1999 and 2000, Bank UK reduced <b>staff</b> <b>expenditure</b> by £ 72 million by shedding 7, 300 employees. This significant loss of staff created huge difficulties in the everyday operation of branches, resulting in growing customer dissatisfaction with the service on offer, {{at the same time that}} weekly individual and branch sales targets were introduced, which clearly demanded extended customer interaction. The composition of the workforce in Bank UK has become increasingly flexible (both numerically and functionally) and two-tiered. Permanent staff enjoy the traditional 'perks' of employment, including performance related pay, whilst the growing number on 'casual' or flexible contracts (mostly ex-permanent staff) do not. Yet, paradoxically my research reveals that Bank UK's successful integration of sales and marketing strategies into the branch network can be generally attributed to the attitudes of its ‘casual' workforce who appear to have made a bigger contribution in terms of sales results and commitment to flexible working practices than their 'permanent' colleagues, despite lacking the same level of recognition and reward.
