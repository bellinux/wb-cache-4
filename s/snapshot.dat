5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a <b>snapshot</b> of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E
5|$|Combinations also trigger special modes, {{including}} alternative camera angles, {{a sniper}} mode, and a <b>snapshot</b> mode, which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable {{versions of the}} 1981 Donkey Kong and 1983 Jetpac are hidden within the game. The player-character can also ride animals, such as a rhino and swordfish, who recur from earlier series games. Optional hardware support includes a widescreen mode and Rumble Pak compatibility.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} {{of this system}} with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orm's pronunciation {{was in no way}} unusual, this permits scholars of history of English to develop an exceptionally precise <b>snapshot</b> of exactly how Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century (Matthew 2004, p.936).|$|E
5|$|The gaps are {{not seen}} in a simple <b>snapshot</b> of the {{locations}} of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps.

5|$|Unlike {{the usual}} product {{development}} cycle, which grows a concept into a final product, {{most of the}} development work in Rare Replay was in converging 30 games across six platforms onto one disc. The engineering challenge lay in the quantity of games and platforms being emulated rather than the emulation effort itself. Rare worked in close collaboration with Microsoft, who were secretly developing the Xbox One's backward-compatibility features, which Rare ultimately used in Rare Replay. The Microsoft team helped prepare Rare's nine Xbox 360 games for the release. Their discontinued online services were not restored for the compilation. On Rare Replay design, lead designer Paul Collins added that the <b>Snapshot</b> challenges were built to encourage players to sample all of the games, and that the rewind feature was to help all players finish the games without quitting in frustration. The compilation's opening musical number was a compromise from the original vision: a musical history of the company's oeuvre, as told through small musical introductions to each <b>Snapshot.</b> The final opening was intended to evoke players' memories of Rare properties, and includes several Easter eggs.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} network evolution, we see low {{similarity}} between school week <b>snapshots</b> and break (holiday) week <b>snapshots.</b> Focusing {{only on the}} more meaningful school week <b>snapshots,</b> we see high node overlaps. However, only <b>snapshots</b> from consecutive time periods have high edge overlaps. Yet, even though many edges form and break with time, global network properties such as the snapshots’ degree distributions remain stable.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we compute {{similarities}} between all pairs of network <b>snapshots</b> {{with respect to}} 15 measures (NO, EO, GCD, GDDA, RGFD, and the 10 centrality measures, “Computing {{similarities between}} network <b>snapshots</b> at different time points” section) in order to study whether network <b>snapshots</b> of school weeks and break weeks are similar and whether consecutive <b>snapshots</b> are more similar than non-consecutive <b>snapshots.</b> 15 measures can be classified into three groups: 1) network size-related measures, NO and EO, 2) graphlet-based measures, GCD, GDDA, and RGFD, and 3) the 10 centrality-based measures.|$|R

5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a tag team match where MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) (with Melina) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against the team of Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas. The match started off with Nitro and Haas in the ring. Haas took the advantage in the match {{and was able to}} tag in Holly. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all of the superstars were able to participate in the match. After a <b>Snapshot</b> to Haas, Mercury pinned Haas, which resulted in MNM retaining the WWE Tag Team title.|$|E

It also includes results of the Labour Party National Executive Committee elections, European Parliamentary elections from 1994 onwards, a list of members expelled since the 1660 Restoration, and recent regional elections for the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Greater London Authority. The earliest <b>snapshot</b> of the website in the archival database Internet Archive is from 1996. The website is located at www.election.demon.co.uk.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a <b>snapshot</b> of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
30|$|Similarly {{as for the}} PEBL-ROM approach, two {{use cases}} of this {{algorithm}} can be distinguished. First, for approximation experiments, the POD is applied to state <b>snapshots.</b> Second, for dynamic MOR experiments, the POD is applied to local increment <b>snapshots</b> and not the state <b>snapshots</b> themselves.|$|R

50|$|Read-write <b>snapshots</b> are {{sometimes}} called branching <b>snapshots,</b> because they implicitly create diverging versions of their data. Aside from backups and data recovery, read-write <b>snapshots</b> are frequently used in virtualization, sandboxing and virtual hosting setups {{because of their}} usefulness in managing changes to large sets of files.|$|R
5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some <b>snapshot</b> of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
5|$|After {{school is}} over, Yumi's classmate Tsutako Takeshima meets with Yumi {{to show her}} that she took a {{photograph}} of Yumi's meeting with Sachiko earlier that morning. Yumi asks if she can have the photo, but Tsutako says she will give her the <b>snapshot</b> under two conditions: one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival, and two being that Yumi get Sachiko's permission to do so as well. Yumi agrees to this, which sets in motion {{a series of events}} involving the entire Yamayuri Council. A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko, Yumi accepts Sachiko's rosary and therefore agrees to become her petite sœur. This officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayuri Council where she assists them in school matters alongside Yoshino Shimazu and Shimako Tōdō—the petite sœurs of Rei Hasekura and Sei Satō, respectively. Through her activities in the Yamayuri Council, Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a <b>snapshot.</b> Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snapshots</b> {{form the}} basis for NetApp disk {{replication}} technology SnapMirror, which effectively replicates <b>snapshots</b> between two NetApp filers. Later versions of Data ONTAP introduced cascading replication, where one volume could replicate to another and then another etc. NetApp also offers a backup product based around replicating and storing <b>snapshots,</b> called SnapVault. Open Systems SnapVault allows Windows and UNIX hosts to back up data to a NetApp filer and store any filesystem changes in <b>snapshots.</b>|$|R

5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a <b>snapshot</b> of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a <b>Snapshot</b> on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E
