Below this threshold, the relationship between SR and soil temperature weakened. We observed contrasting responses of SR of target oak species to drought and thinning. Reduced rainfall had a strong negative impact on SR of Q. cerrioides, whereas the effect on SR for Q. ilex was marginal or even positive. Meanwhile, <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> increased SR of Q. cerrioides, but reduced that of Q. ilex.

Average consumption of fuel and lubricant is 17. 43 mL x tree– 1, on the plots 20. 27 mL x tree– 1, average consumption of lubricant per tree on skid roads is 9. 4 mL x tree– 1, on the plots 11 mL x tree– 1. The higher consumption of fuel and lubricant on the plots with <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> is the consequence of the longer time needed for the conversion per tree, compared to that in clear felling The consumption of fuel per unit area on the skid roads (clear felling) is 22. 9 L x ha– 1, on the plots (<b>selective</b> <b>thinning)</b> 7. 6 L x ha– 1. The consumption of lubricant on the skid roads is 13. 3 L x ha– 1, on the plots 4. 29 L x ha– 1.

The progeny test was installed in June 1986, following a 10 × 10, triple square lattice design, containing ten trees in linear plots in 3. 0 × 3. 0 m spacing. Twelve years after the planting, a <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> based on Multi-effect index (selection for DBH) was performed, leaving six trees per plot. The assessments were done in four situations: A (before thinning); B (among thinned trees); C (among remnant trees at 13 years of age) and D (two years after the thinning). The following traits were analyzed: total height (H), diameter at breast height (DBH), volume (VOL), stem form (FOR), foxtail (FT), wood density at 1. 3 m (WD 1) and wood density at the half height (WD 2). The thinning led to increase in the estimates of variability among progenies for VOL and decrease for ALT and DBH. There was a high and positive genetic correlation among the growth traits, mainly between DBH and VOL. The latter remained unchanged after thinning. The narrow-sense heritabilities at the individual level, showed a slight increase while at the family mean level had a reduction with the thinning.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Presentation date: 1986 - 04 - 28 Western hemlock-Sitka spruce forests, where prior precommercial {{thinning}} has occurred, constitute one of {{the most}} productive young-growth management types along the Pacific Coast from Oregon to southeast Alaska. These stands are ready for a first commercial thinning entry, however, {{the costs and benefits of}} such entries and resulting impacts at final harvest are not well documented. The purpose of this study was to provide appropriate harvesting, silviculture and economic data in a comprehensive evaluation of four alternative stand management treatments (three different thinning prescriptions with a basal area per acre removal ranging from 49 percent to 67 percent and a no-thin, control prescription) conducted on a 32 year old managed western hemlock-Sitka spruce plantation. A detailed logging production/cost study of Skyline thinning showed high harvesting cost and resulting negative stumpage values. Thinning treatments influenced harvesting costs; herringbone strip thinning costs 31 percent less than a conventional <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> method with the same volume removal. Also, a residual tree damage study, conducted during logging, showed that damage was considerably lower for strip <b>thinning</b> compared with <b>selective</b> <b>thinning.</b> Various logging techniques and crew skill levels influenced stand damage. An assessment of wind damage and tree growth rates was completed two years after skyline thinning. Annual windthrow losses totalled only 0. 28 trees per acre for all treatments and was significantly lower in strip <b>thinning</b> than <b>selective</b> <b>thinning.</b> Windthrow also appeared to be related to specific site, tree or stand conditions. Diameter growth increment rates declined in the unthinned units. However, in all thinned units, an immediate diameter growth response occurred. In the herringbone strip thinning method, trees exhibited a growth response regardless of distance from strip edge. A stand table projection model and harvest simulation model were used for determining costs and revenues from clearcutting at rotation age. Final harvest costs and revenues per cunit were similar for all treatments. The unthinned stand had the highest present net worth per acre. A sensitivity analysis of real interest rate changes along with changing harvesting cost and pond values during thinning or final harvest did not alter the outcome. Results of this study suggest that managed plantations of western hemlock-Sitka spruce can receive sufficient density control from precommercial thinning to maintain adequate stand development to a rotation age harvest without commercial thinning entries...|$|R

Moreover, {{it will be necessary to}} assess whether traditional management practices can mitigate the effects of climate change on these forests. The main aim of this study has been to analyze the effects of increased drought on the mortality, growth and resprouting patterns of two co-occurring Mediterranean oak species with contrasting leaf habit (the evergreen Quercus ilex and the winter-deciduous Quercus cerrioides), and to assess the effects of <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> on their response to increased drought.

Our results show that increasing aridity in Mediterranean areas can be a constraining factor for deciduous oaks, thus potentially causing their decline in mixed forests and favouring their substitution by the evergreen congeneric species. However, as seen in this study, management can strongly encourage growth both for deciduous and evergreen species, thus reversing the effects of increased water stress on Mediterranean coppices...|$|R

Yet, choosing between alternative forest management practices is not straightforward as it necessarily involves ES trade-offs. Forest management decisions have to reconcile the socio-economic and ecological contributions of forest ecosystems by fostering a synergistic relation between multiple ES while lowering ES trade-offs. The aim of the study is to analyze different forest management practices (<b>selective</b> and traditional <b>thinning)</b> in black pine peri-urban forest in Central Italy, by investigating their contribution in terms of provisioning (wood production), cultural (recreational benefits), regulating (climate change mitigation) ES. For each management option was performed: (1) the biophysical assessment of selected ES by using primary data and calculating indicators for wood production with special regard to biomass for energy use (living trees and deadwood volume harvested), recreational benefits (tourists’ preferences for each forest management practice), climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration in above-ground and below-ground biomass), and (2) the economic valuation of wood production, recreational benefits and climate change mitigation ES using direct and indirect methods (environmental evaluation techniques). The results show that the effects of the <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> on ES is higher that the effects of the traditional thinning. The economic value of the three ES provided by traditional and <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> are respectively: bioenergy production 154. 2 € ha - 1 yr - 1 and 223. 3 € ha - 1 yr - 1; recreational benefits 193. 2 € ha - 1 yr - 1 and 231. 9 € ha - 1 yr - 1; carbon sequestration 29. 0 € ha - 1 yr - 1 and 36. 2 € ha - 1 yr - 1.

The evaluations were done at four situations: A (before the thinning); B (thinned trees); C (remaining trees after thinning) and D (one year after thinning). The analyzed traits were: height, diameter at breast height (DBH), volume, form of stem and wood density. The genetic divergence among the progenies was studied with aid of the canonical variables and of clustering of Tocher method, using the generalized distance matrix of Mahalanobis (D 2) as estimate of the genetic similarity. The progenies were grouped in four groups in situation A, fourteen in the situation B, two in the situation C and three in the situation D. The <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> of the trees within of the progenies caused a change in the genetic divergence among the progenies, genetically homogenizing the progenies, as demonstrated by the generalized distances of Mahalanobis, clustering of Tocher' and canonical variables methods.

One year after thinning {{at the age of}} four, the DBH, total height (H), and average by tree of basal area () and of volume () presented no differences among the treatments; the current annual increment (CAIV) was not affected by the intensities. In the plantation thinned at the age of five, the CAIV and H were similar in all treatments; the DBH, and were not affected by the tested intensities, but they were greater than the control. The first <b>selective</b> <b>thinning</b> may be applied at the age of five, in Tectona grandis plantations with similar conditions, at any tested intensity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the surface {{enhanced}} Raman scattering (SERS) performance of gold coated patterned silicon surfaces of different morphology and period was investigated. Arrays of inverse pyramids, spheres and rounded pyramids {{of different sizes}} were fabricated by photolithography and <b>selective</b> etching. <b>Thin</b> layer of gold was sputtered {{onto the surface of}} the samples. The SERS performance of the substrates was tested using a highly dissolved organic solution...|$|R
