40|$|The STORM project {{investigates the}} {{deposition}} and resuspension of representative (SnO 2, CsOH) aerosols in selected components (e. g. pipes, bends, steam generator) under typical accident conditions of a reactor. To characterize the phenomena of deposition and resuspension the aerosol deposit {{has to be}} well observed without disturbing the process under investigation. To fulfill this objective the attenuation of gamma radiation (60 keV Americuium 241) by {{the formation of a}} deposit in a test pipe has been measured. The Americium source has been mounted in a frame which can be moved in the x and y direction (<b>stepwidth</b> 0. 2 mm) and roteted around the pipe (<b>stepwidth</b> 0. 1 degree). The measurement object can be scanned over a certain range. The frame can house objects of up to 500 mm in diameter. Windows of 0. 7 mm thickness {{have been made in the}} testpipe surface. A deposit resolution of 1 mg/cm 2 is achieved. The instrument, the calibration measurements with SnO 2 and CsOH and its application during the STORM experiments are presented. The use of an energy selective detector to additionally characterize the deposit composition are discussed. JRC. (ISIS) -Institute For Systems, Informatics And Safet...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the author's {{work on the}} compression of vector geospatial data intended for transport on the Internet. WebGIS vector data format is shifting to ASCII code such as XML. In some applications, however, the technique of vector map data compression is still needed. The author proposes four innovations regarding WebGIS vector spatial data compression. (1) Not only integer, but also short data {{can be used to}} replace traditional double or float data of WebGIS. (2) A formula to calculated width of 'virtual screen ' is proposed, (the formula is 'vituralScreenWidth = dispWidthPixel*maxEnlargeRatio / stepWidth'). The 'virtual screen ' is used to map the original double or float geographic coordinate data to short data. In this formula, if <b>stepWidth</b> equals 1, the compression has no loss in precision. If <b>stepWidth</b> is larger than 1, the compression is less precise. (3) Three ways of dealing with the special case of long segments are proposed in the paper. The first is 'long segment add points', which fits in with having only few long segments. The second is 'long-short segments grouping', the third is 'respective deal with on layer', the second and third ways fit in the case many long segments, such as a traffic route map or street block map. After these operations a vector data map may be compressed to 1 / 5 or less than the original data. And (4) when the 'vituralScreenWidth ' is given different values, it can form a 'hierarchy ' of geospatial data versions, somewhat like cartographic generalization, but having the problem of feature selection. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We analyze {{spectral}} {{scans of}} narrow-band images across the Na D 2 line. They {{were obtained from}} disc centre of the Sun with our Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) in the Vacuum Tower Telescope at the Observatorio del Teide. The FPI was set to a bandwidth of 200 m ˚A FWHM and the spectral <b>stepwidth</b> was 100 m ˚A. Our aim is to study the variation of the granulation pattern with height in the atmosphere. To achieve high spatial resolution the simultaneously taken broad-band images are restored with speckle methods. With the knowledge of these reconstructed images we were also able to restore the narrowband images. The formation heights are found from temperature response functions RFT. In the wings of NaD 2, the response functions for different wavelengths exhibit a substantial overlap in atmospheric heights. Therefore we use linear combinations which allow a better height discrimination. Applying the same combinations to the D 2 images we can visualize the height variation of the granular pattern. The granular intensity fluctuations are {{a matter of the}} deep photosphere alone. They disappear at heights of about 100 km (above τ 5000 = 1) ...|$|E
50|$|Because the Lab {{space is}} larger than the gamut of {{computer}} displays and printers and because the visual <b>stepwidths</b> are relatively different to the color area, a bitmap image represented as Lab requires more data per pixel to obtain the same precision as an RGB or CMYK bitmap. In the 1990s, when computer hardware and software were limited to storing and manipulating mostly 8-bit/channel bitmaps, converting an RGB image to Lab and back was a very lossy operation. With 16-bit/channel and floating-point support now common, the loss due to quantization is negligible.|$|R
40|$|Practical {{application}} of the general rate model is often hindered by computational complexity and by unknown parameter values. Model simplifications and parameter correlations are not always applicable, and repeated model solutions are required for parameter estimation and process optimization. We have hence developed and implemented a fast and accurate solver for the general rate model with various adsorption isotherms. Several {{state of the art}} scientific computing techniques have been combined for maximal solver performance: (1) the model equations are spatially discretized with finite volumes and the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method. (2) A non-commercial solver with variable <b>stepwidth</b> and order is applied for time integration. (3) The internal linear solver module is replaced by customized code that is based on domain decomposition and can be executed on parallel computers. We demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our solver with numerical examples. The WENO method significantly improves accuracy even on rather coarse grids, and the solver runtime scales linearly with relevant grid sizes and processor numbers. Code parallelization is essential for utilizing the full power of multiprocessor and multicore technology in modern personal computers. The general rate model of a strongly non-linear two component system is solved in few seconds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{addresses}} {{the properties of}} finite element solutions for the Helmholtz equation. The h-version of the finite element method with piecewise linear approximation is applied to a one-dimensional model problem. New results are shown on stability and error estimation of the discrete model. In all propositions, assumptions are made on the magnitude of hk only, where k is the wavelength and h is the <b>stepwidth</b> of the FE-mesh. Previous analytical results had been shown {{with the assumption that}} k 2 h is small. For medium and high wavenumber, these results do not cover the meshsizes that are applied in practical applications. The main estimate reveals that the error in H 1 -norm of discrete solutions for the Helmholtz equation is polluted when k 2 h is not small. The error is then not quasioptimal; i. e., the relation of the FE-error to the error of best approximation generally depends on the wavenumber k. It is noted that the pollution term in the relative error is of the same order as the phase lead of the numerical solution. In the result of this analysis, thorough and rigorous understanding of error behavior throughout the range of convergence is gained. Numerical results are presented that show sharpness of the error estimates and highlight some phenomena of the discrete solution behavior. The h-p-version of the FEM is studied in Part II...|$|E

In recent years, {{it has become clear}} that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have difficulty with gross motor function and coordination, factors which influence gait. Knowledge of gait abnormalities may be useful for assessment and treatment planning. This paper reviews the literature assessing gait deviations in children with ASD. Five online databases were searched using keywords “gait ” and “autism, ” and 11 studies were found which examined gait in childhood ASD. Children with ASD tend to augment their walking stability with a reduced stride length, increased <b>stepwidth</b> and thereforewider base of support, and increased time in the stance phase. Children with ASD have reduced range of motion at the ankle and knee during gait, with increased hip flexion. Decreased peak hip flexor and ankle plantar flexormoments in children with ASDmay imply weakness around these joints, which is further exhibited by a reduction in ground reaction forces at toe-off in children with ASD. Children with ASD have altered gait patterns to healthy controls, widened base of support, and reduced range of motion. Several studies refer to cerebellar and basal ganglia involvement as the patterns described suggest alterations in those areas of the brain. Further research should compare children with ASD to other clinical groups to improve assessment and treatment planning. 1...|$|E
40|$|Relaxor ferroelectrics are multi-functional {{materials}} {{with a number}} of technological applications due to their outstanding dielectric, electro-mechanical and electro-optic properties. Synthesis and characterisation of novel relaxors are among the main goals of modern solid-state science. Recently a new single-crystal compound of perovskite-type and a chemical formula Pb 0. 78 Ba 0. 22 Sc 0. 5 Ta 0. 5 O 3 was synthesized. The dielectric measurements revealed typical relaxor behaviour [1], namely diffuse phase transition and strong frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Also, comparing to PbSc 0. 5 Ta 0. 5 O 3 the incorporation of Ba substantially broadens the dielectric-constant maximum vs temperature and extents the improper ferroelectric (relaxor) state to lower temperatures. In order to elucidate the Ba-doping-induced structural changes responsible for the observed alterations in the dielectric behaviour we analysed the new relaxor compound by complementary single-crystal X-ray diffraction and inelastic light scattering [1]. The presence of heavy elements as well as the complexity of the structure (co-existence of two types of nano-scale ordered/disordered regions, compositionally B-site ordered/disordered and ferroelectric/paraelctric) required the utilization of a high-energy probe radiation for performing the XRD experiments. Thus the structure of Pb 0. 78 Ba 0. 22 Sc 0. 5 Ta 0. 5 O 3 was studied at the beamline F 1 at HASYLAB/DESY, using a wavelength of λ = 0. 4 Å and a MarCCD 165 detector. Data were collected at a distance of 50 mm with a <b>stepwidth</b> of 1 °/frame. Exposure times varied between 60 sec up to 160 sec for low and high order data, respectively. The XDS software package [2] was used for data evaluation and integration. The structural refinement was carried out using the Jana 2000 software package [3]. A typical diffraction frame is shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1 : X-ray diffraction image of Pb 0. 78 Ba 0. 22 Sc 0. 5 Ta 0. 5 O 3 at arbitrary crystal orientation.
