The instrument is reliable, easy to use, and does not require any adjustments by a technician. It has been demonstrated that the “debubbler ” used on continuous-flow analyzers greatly decreases system effi-ciency (1, 2). Habig et al.

This output-toinput path can be used for several purposes— control output voltage, control gain, reduce distortion, improve stability, or create instability, as in an oscillator. This short tutorial reviews feedback, with emphasis on the classic negative feedback amplifier. Notes are also included on the methods for sampling the output and injecting the control signal at the input. Feedback Principles For a classic concept like feedback, classic reference texts are a good source of instruction. This section was written with the aid of three of those references [1, 2, 3]. A feedback control system consists of the building blocks shown in Figure 1. Although this is not the traditional control theory textbook diagram, it includes the necessary elements: the signal path, a means of sampling the output, processing of the feedback signal, and a means of reintroducing the error signal at the input. In the simplest feedback systems, the feedback signal processing may be one or two passive components, with direct connections to the through circuit at the output and input. The diagram can also become much more complex, with extensive signal processing and the addition of reference <b>signals,</b> <b>comparators,</b> delay lines and even multiple feedback loops. Intuitively, feedback control loops are used to achieve a specific performance objective.

When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals.
