5|$|The wide main street, down which farmers once drove their sheep to market, is lasting {{evidence}} of its market town status. A market square once <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre, {{marked by a}} cross in honour of Queen Eleanor. Today, the square has gone and the cross is a ruin.|$|E
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} a {{communications}} hub and has <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of five railway lines since the 19th century. The arrival of the railways became a source of employment {{and contributed to the}} town's growth. With the opening of the international passenger station it is now a European communications centre, with new lines running between London and the Channel Tunnel (via High Speed 1). The M20 motorway also links Ashford to those two destinations for road traffic.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Shila of Nawha (a place east of Gadara in the Galilee) {{interpreted}} the word [...] "needy" [...] ( [...] , evyon) in [...] to teach {{that one should}} give to the poor person from one's wealth, for that wealth is the poor person's, given to you in trust. Rabbi Abin observed that when a poor person <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> one's door, God <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> person's right, as [...] says: [...] "Because He <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> right hand of the needy." [...] If one gives something to a poor person, one should reflect that <b>the</b> One who <b>stands</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> poor person's right will reward the giver.

5|$|Stela J {{was erected}} by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD702 and {{was his first}} monument. It <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{entrance}} {{to the city and}} is unusual in being topped by a sculpted stone roof, converting the monument into a symbolic house. It bears a hieroglyphic text that is woven into a criss-cross mat design to form a convoluted puzzle that must be read in precisely the right order to be understood.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore Stone is a {{fragment}} of a large sandstone slab which originally <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Singapore River. The large slab, which is believed to date back to at least the 13th century and possibly {{as early as the}} 10th or 11th century, bore an undeciphered inscription. Recent theories suggest that the inscription is either in Old Javanese or in Sanskrit, which suggested a possibility that the island was an extension of the Majapahit civilisation in the past.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Summer Olympics, {{the stadium}} hosted the {{football}} preliminaries. For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during the Second World War the North Bank terrace was bombed {{and had to}} be rebuilt; the roof was not restored until 1956. Floodlights were fitted in 1951, with the first floodlit match being a friendly against Hapoel Tel Aviv on 19 September of that year. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park, once <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Arsenal stadium. They were shipped to Dublin in 1962. The inaugural floodlit match saw Arsenal beat Bohemians 3–8. Undersoil heating was added in 1964. Unlike at many other grounds, Arsenal refused to install perimeter fencing, even at the height of hooliganism in the 1980s, which made it ineligible for use as an FA Cup semi-final venue.|$|E

5|$|One of these, The Talk of the Town, was {{the first}} three-time World Grand Champion. Midnight Sun was also great-grandsire of I Am Jose, the second three-time winner. Most of the leading Tennessee Walker sires {{in recent years have}} {{themselves}} been descendants of Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI). Through his offspring, he has also influenced the Racking Horse and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds. For many years, a life-size statue of Midnight Sun, commissioned after his death by his former owner Geraldine Livingston, <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> TWHBEA headquarters in Lewisburg, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the lord’s table, on his dais, {{by the side of}} his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{driven by}} the will to take revenge for the {{destruction}} of Palmyrene trade centers and discourage Shapur from initiating future attacks, Odaenathus launched an invasion against the Persians. In the spring of 262, the king marched north into the occupied Roman province of Mesopotamia, driving out the Persian garrisons and freeing Edessa and Carrhae. The first onslaught was aimed at Nisibis, which Odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward the Persian occupation. The Palmyrene monarch destroyed the Jewish city of Nehardea, 45km west of the Persian capital Ctesiphon, as he deemed the Jews of Mesopotamia loyal to Shapur. By late 262 or early 263, Odaenathus <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> walls of the Persian capital.|$|E

5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that it may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E
5|$|Sudirman died in Magelang at 18:30 on 29January 1950; {{this was}} {{reported}} in a special broadcast over RRI. Upon receiving news of his death, the Sudirman family home received numerous visitors, including {{the entirety of the}} 9thBrigade, which was stationed nearby. The following morning Sudirman's body was brought to Yogyakarta. As the funeral convoy passed, led by four tanks and consisting of eighty motor vehicles, thousands of mourners <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sides of the streets. The convoy was organised by members of the 9thBrigade.|$|E
5|$|The Hupa {{lived in}} the fertile Hoopa Valley along the Trinity River and the Hyampom Valley on the South Fork – some of the few flat lands in a region {{otherwise}} dominated by rugged mountains. A Hupa village called Weitspus <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site of present-day Weitchpec at {{the confluence of the}} Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The Hupa traded with the coastal Yurok and Karok by using canoes to navigate the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The trade arrangements with neighboring tribes were complex and involved the use of dentalium shells as currency.|$|E

5|$|The Presidio {{was built}} to {{standard}} plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick, solid adobe outer walls. The main gate opened into an open parade ground/plaza {{in the center of}} the square. The chapel <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of the back of the square, facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue {{marks the}} {{boundary}} with Glastonbury, {{to the north}} of Street. At the time of King Arthur, the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it was here that Sir Bedivere is thought to have thrown the sword Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.|$|E
