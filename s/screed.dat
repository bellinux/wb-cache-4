25|$|Depending on the {{temperature}} {{at which it}} is applied, asphalt is categorized as hot mix, warm mix, or cold mix. Hot mix asphalt is applied at temperatures over 300°F (150°C) with a free floating <b>screed.</b> Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E
25|$|Roof {{and floor}} screeds and {{insulating}} concretes: exfoliated vermiculite (typically the finer grades) {{can be added}} at site to Portland cement and other aggregates, rheological aids, and water to produce roof and floor concrete screeds which are lightweight and insulating. In many cases, vermiculite-based roof screeds are {{used in conjunction with}} other insulation materials, such as polystyrene board, to form a total roofing system. A bituminous binder can also be used with exfoliated vermiculite to produce a dry, lightweight roof <b>screed</b> which has the advantages of low thermal conductivity, low moisture content, and ease of placement (by pouring from the bag and then tamping).|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the {{skylight}} was repaired; improvements {{made to the}} electrical system were made in order to install a projector; reconstruction of the wood structures and stuccoing of the ceilings; construction of hydraulic rigging and <b>screed</b> in the pavement; painting of the walls with water-based paints. There was a proposal by the LNEC and IJF to study the area in order to treat the deteriorating stoneworks {{at the end of}} the 1970s. But, in 1978, the facade panel was partially destroyed through the restoration attempts of the IJF. By the end of 1979, there was a further reassessment of the roofing in the registry, altar and lateral chapels for repairs; demolition and reconstruction of the framework and pavement of the lateral chapels; substitution and assessment of the zinc eavestroughs and flaps; and repair and cleaning of the roof.|$|E

500|$|Posters and {{publicity}} photos were often tantalizing. Women appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed {{in the films}} themselves.

Hays became outraged at the steamy pictures circulating in newspapers around the country. The original Hays Code contained an often-ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new advertising <b>screed</b> {{in the style of the}} Ten Commandments that contained a set of twelve prohibitions. The first seven addressed imagery. They prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the characteristics and development of <b>scree</b> slopes; theoretically from a range of climatic environments, and practically from the Western Desert in Egypt. The account is in two parts, each comprising three Chapters. The first part is an integrated review of the theory of the major gecmorphic processes and variables which influence <b>scree</b> development and is based on available published material. The second part involved detailed field measurement in the New Valley Province of Egypt. This part presents the results of surveying the characteristics of thirty <b>screes</b> situated within the El Kharga and El Dakhla depressions. At present this is an area of extreme aridity, although during late Pleistocene times there were several significant pluvial phases. From the survey of thirty profiles, three classes of <b>scree</b> form were identified. A basal concavity was present on all <b>screes</b> varying in degree and length of curvature from site to site due to the form of the accumulation surface and the evolutionary stage. Dpper straight segments of the profiles ranged between 30 and 37 with the greatest frequency between 31 and 33. The steepest measured angle was 39. 5. Sampling of debris size and shape revealed two types of distribution; on seme <b>screes</b> an identifiable downslope sorting is attributed to rockfall processes, whilst on others a lack of well defined sorting patterns is ascribed to localized avalanching. Potential mechanisms of particle movemeit were examinei by studies of <b>scree</b> fabric and by field experiments. Late Pleistocene processes induced landslides, rockfalls and the undermining of cliffs. At present, insolation is significant in its effect on both bedrock and <b>scree</b> surfaces. Rockfall still occurs at all rates but at a much slower rate than during the wetter Pleistocene periods. Other processes currently active include dry avalanching, aeolian action and wild animal movement...|$|R
