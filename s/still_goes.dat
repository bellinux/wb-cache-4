Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is hungry and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him {{in order to protect}} him. Chip <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> to the dance, hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed with a pool skimmer by a fatally injured Chip. Jennifer escapes while Needy watches her boyfriend die.|$|E

25|$|For a long time, lattice {{simulations}} {{seemed to}} indicate that the modified gluon and ghost propagators proposed by Gribov and Zwanziger were correct. In 2007, however, computers had become sufficiently strong to probe the region of low momenta, where the propagators are most modified, {{and it turned out that}} the Gribovndash&Zwanziger picture is not correct. Instead, the gluon propagator goes to a constant value when the momentum is taken to zero, and the ghost propagator <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> like 1/k2 at low momenta. This is the case for both 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. A solution to this discrepancy has been proposed, adding condensates to the Gribovndash&Zwanziger action.|$|E

25|$|Though the Shannon estuary fishing {{industry}} is now depleted, {{at one time}} it provided employment for hundreds of men along its length. At Limerick, fishermen based on Clancy's Strand used the Gandelow to catch Salmon. The Abbey Fishermen used a net and a boat known as a Breacaun to fish between Limerick City and Plassey until 1929. In 1929, {{the construction of a}} dam at Ardnacrusha severely impacted salmon breeding and that, and the introduction of quotas, had by the 1950s caused salmon fishing to cease. However, recreational fishing <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> on. Further down the Shannon Estuary at Kilrush the Currach was used to catch herring as well as drift netting for salmon.|$|E
25|$|In 1843 Wheatstone communicated an {{important}} {{paper to the}} Royal Society, entitled 'An Account of Several New Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit.' It contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor, which <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> {{by the name of}} Wheatstone's Bridge or balance, although it was first devised by Samuel Hunter Christie, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, who published it in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833. The method was neglected until Wheatstone brought it into notice. His paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of Ohm. He introduced a unit of resistance, namely, a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains (6.5 g), and showed how it might be applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance. He was awarded a medal for his paper by the Society. The same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of a thermometer or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an electric contact made by the mercury. A sound telegraph, in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell, was also patented by Cooke and Wheatstone in May of that year.|$|E

500|$|In 1980 the Oslo Tunnel was opened, {{allowing}} trains {{along the}} Drammen Line {{to go to}} the new Oslo Central Station, an upgrade of the former Oslo Ø. As a consequence of this, passenger trains were since the late 1980s rerouted via Drammen instead of via Roa, following the Drammen Line and the Randsfjord Line to Hønefoss. This allows the trains to pass through more densely populated areas and on trackage with more capacity. However, the change of route actually increased the length between the two termini by [...] But the better track standard via Drammen results in about the same travel time.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Junpei wakes up in a cabin inside a cruise liner, wearing a {{bracelet}} displaying the number [...] "5". He escapes the room, and encounters eight people, including June. Zero announces over a loudspeaker that all nine are participants in the Nonary Game. Zero explains the rules, and states each carry an explosive in their stomach that will go off if they try to bypass the digital root door locks. The 9th Man <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> through a door by himself, and is killed. Fearing what harm might come to them, the group adopts code names, and splits up to explore the ship. The player has the option to select which group that Junpei travels with, which affects the story; several choices lead to Junpei's death. Through various choices, Junpei learns of a previous Nonary Game, played nine years earlier, and the connections of the other characters through that, as well as studies about morphic resonance and stories of the Egyptian priestess Alice, who is frozen in ice-9.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} 1986 in fictional Vice City, {{which is}} based heavily on the city of Miami. Vice City {{previously}} appeared in the original Grand Theft Auto (1997); the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase. They wanted to satirise a location that was not contemporary, unlike Grand Theft Auto IIIs Liberty City. The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to New York City—the inspiration of Liberty City—eventually leading them to Miami, which producer Leslie Benzies describes as [...] "a party town, all sun and sea and sex, but with that same dark edge underneath". Sam Houser called it [...] "the grooviest era of crime because it didn't even feel like it was crime... it was a totally topsy-turvy back-to-front period of time". The team intended to make Vice City a [...] "living, breathing city", for the player to feel like [...] "life <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> on" [...] while the character is inside a building.|$|E
