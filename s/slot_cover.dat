5000|$|Shuttle pipes are {{a type of}} {{bagpipes}} which {{derive their}} name from the drones used to produce the harmony. Rather than the long tube-like drones of most bagpipes, shuttle pipes use a shuttle drone, a cylindrical chamber enclosing a series of drone tubes, each terminating in a <b>slot</b> <b>covered</b> by a sliding [...] "shuttle" [...] which can be adjusted to lengthen or shorten the distance traveled by air moving through the tube, thus flattening or sharpening the pitch of the note produced.|$|R
50|$|Blackout {{regulations}} were imposed on 1 September 1939, before {{the declaration of}} war. These required that all windows and doors should be covered at night with suitable material such as heavy curtains, cardboard or paint, to prevent the escape of any glimmer of light that might aid enemy aircraft. The Government ensured that the necessary materials were available. External lights such as street lights were switched off, or dimmed and shielded to deflect light downward. Essential lights such as traffic lights and vehicle headlights were fitted with <b>slotted</b> <b>covers</b> to deflect their beams downwards to the ground.|$|R

5000|$|The FH type {{comprised}} a coil assembly, {{first in}} a plain chrome-plated brass cover, a single slot—then finally a two <b>slotted</b> <b>cover</b> fixed to a 1/8" [...] rod parallel to and slightly below the sixth (low [...] "E") string. DeArmond called the rod a pressure rod. Players soon nicknamed the assembly (with pickup) the [...] "monkey on a stick" [...] because of a resemblance to a popular childs toy of the time. The rod ("stick") passes through a small hole {{on the left side}} of the pickup (the [...] "monkey"), which lightly grips the rod. This rod clamps to the guitar strings behind the bridge. A half moon shape loop goes around the bridge continuing just short of the fingerboard.

50|$|The {{other common}} type of furling system is for the {{mainsail}}. The mainsail may be furled into the mast or the boom, with boom furling systems being simpler and more common. The simplest boom furling system consists of a boom that can rotate along its axis, with a latch to lock it in place. Provision {{must be made to}} allow the mainsail to wrap around the boom without interfering with the mainsheet, such as end-boom sheeting or a bridle. To furl the mainsail, the boom is unlocked, and then rotated to take up the desired amount of mainsail, and then locked in place. More advanced boom furling systems will wrap the furling mechanism in a <b>slotted</b> <b>cover,</b> so the sail furls inside the cover; this also makes sheeting easier, since the sheet may be attached to the outer portion of the boom. These systems use either a line, a hand operated crank, or a hydraulic or electric powered furler.|$|R
5000|$|When RedEye appeared, it was {{in direct}} {{competition}} with another paper Red Streak, which the Tribunes Chicago competitor the Sun-Times began publishing at the same time. Initially, both papers were handed out for free by [...] "hawkers" [...] on street corners, usually with one vendor from each paper directly next to each other. After about 6 months of the free papers, both companies placed vending boxes throughout the city with the papers thereafter costing 25 cents. At the end of 2005, the Sun-Times discontinued Red Streak. According to Sun-Times publisher John Cruickshank, Red Streak was only launched [...] "to stop Tribune from gaining {{a foothold in the}} paid tabloid market...". Its only purpose was to undermine RedEyes attempt at drawing commuters, customers which have historically belonged to the Sun-Times. [...] At the beginning of 2006, RedEye became a free paper once again, with vending boxes being unlocked and coin <b>slots</b> <b>covered</b> over.|$|R

It is an adaptation of the WICS code operational at the 12 ft pressure wind tunnel (12 ft PWT) of NASA Ames Research Center (NASA ARC). This paper discusses the details of implementation of WICS at the NTF including, tunnel calibration, code modifications for tunnel and support geometry, changes made for the NTF wall orifices layout, details of interfacing with the tunnel data processing system, and post-processing of results. Example results of applying WICS to a semispan test and a full span test are presented. Comparison with classical correction results and an analysis of uncertainty in the corrections are also given. As a special application of the code, the Mach number calibration data from a centerline pipe test was computed by WICS. Finally, future work for expanding the applicability of the code including online implementation is discussed...|$|R

All are low-wing aircraft, and the wing skin is aluminum. <b>Slotted</b> flaps <b>cover</b> 70% of the trailing edge. Earlier models use a hydraulic hand pump to extend the flaps, while later models have electrically operated flaps. The forward fuselage has a steel tube cabin structure covered in aluminum skin; the aft portion of the fuselage is of semi-monocoque design. In many places on the skin of the airplane, flush-mounted rivets are used to reduce drag.|$|R
5000|$|Improving {{brightness}} {{was another}} major {{line of work}} in the 1960s. The use of rare earth phosphors produced brighter colors and allowed the strength of the electron beams to be reduced slightly. Better focusing systems, especially automatic systems that meant the set spent more time closer to perfect focus, allowed the dots to grow larger on the screen. The Porta-Color used both of these advances and re-arranged the guns to lie beside each other instead of in a triangle, allowing the dots to be extended vertically into <b>slots</b> that <b>covered</b> much more of the screen surface. This design, sometimes known as a [...] "slot mask", became common in the 1970s.|$|R

40|$|The {{protection}} against environment pollution requests active actions for land remediation, with removal of pollutantnts and pathogenic agents. The waste landfills are incumbent dangers, with leachates polluting water beds. The fact is main {{concern of the}} EU and the enacted regulations requests decommissioning operations. Today techniques transfer and encapsulate the landfills, by expensive and humans unsafe methods, without fully cancelling out the leachate risk. This project overcomes the limitations of current solutions with resort to a mixed technique, mainly based on a robotic equipment, capable of creating a draining manifold through remotely operated fixtures. The technique combines micro-tunnelling technology, to create proper collecting lines under the landfill [1], with implantation in the waste bulk of the patented SIDRA® draining elements, to obtain a cost effective system for safe and final remediation of landfills. The SIDRA® pipes consist of hollow rods with draining <b>slots</b> <b>covered</b> by water soluble plastic caps, to prevent occlusion by the debris during drilling. To bring this concept into an exploitable industrial set-up, the project required the ideation and implementation of a reliable and effective robotic equipment, capable of moving and positioning within the small microtunnels, while accomplishing the drilling from the bottom, up to 20 - 30 m afar in the waste bulk with implantation of the piping system. No operator is allowed (nor would accept) to drill below leachate pools; thus the all task needs be fulfilled without human intervention. The paper gives details {{on the development of}} the drilling sequence and draining pipes implantation robot, with annexed local feeding, buffering and pre-setting modules and related monitoring and governing equipment. The SIDRA ® technique is registered method...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{measurements}} of fluctuating static pressure levels were made using flush mounted high frequency response pressure transducers at eleven {{locations in the}} circuit of the National Transonic Facility (NTF) over the complete operating range of this wind tunnel. Measurements were made at test section Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 1. 2, at pressure from 1 to 8. 6 atmospheres and at temperatures from ambient to - 250 F, resulting in dynamic flow disturbance measurements at the highest Reynolds numbers available in a transonic ground test facility. Tests were also made independently at variable Mach number, variable Reynolds number, and variable drivepower, each time keeping the other two variables constant thus allowing for the first time, a distinct separation of these three important variables. A description of the NTF emphasizing its flow quality features, details on the calibration of the instrumentation, results of measurements with the test section <b>slots</b> <b>covered,</b> downstream choke, effects of liquid nitrogen injection and gaseous nitrogen venting, comparisons between air and nitrogen, isolation {{of the effects of}} Mach number, Reynolds number, and fan drive power, and identification of the sources of significant flow disturbances is included. The results indicate that primary sources of flow disturbance in the NTF may be edge-tones generated by test section sidewall re-entry flaps and the venting of nitrogen gas from the return leg of the tunnel circuit between turns 3 and 4 in the cryogenic mode of operation. The tests to isolate the effects of Mach number, Reynolds number, and drive power indicate that Mach number effects predominate. A comparison with other transonic wind tunnels shows that the NTF has low levels of test section fluctuating static pressure especially in the high subsonic Mach number range from 0. 7 to 0. 9...|$|R
