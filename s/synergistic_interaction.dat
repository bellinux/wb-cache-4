500|$|Quantum {{evolution}} was {{a controversial}} hypothesis advanced by Columbia University paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, who was regarded by Stephen Jay Gould as [...] "the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist {{of the twentieth}} century." [...] Simpson's conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new families, orders, and classes of organisms. This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects. First, punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope, {{in that it was}} addressing evolution specifically at the species level. Simpson's idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups. Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a <b>synergistic</b> <b>interaction</b> between genetic drift and a shift in the adaptive fitness landscape, Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr's concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution. In his Major Features of Evolution Simpson stated, [...] "Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it." [...] Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as Sewall Wright as well as Simpson himself—have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground Litter {{decomposition}} is {{a fundamental}} process of biogeochemical cycles, {{and there is a}} strong consensus that litter mixture interactions are one of the factors driving the decomposition process. A better understanding of how climate change can alter interactionsbetween species and the litter decomposition process could facilitate projections of ecosystem functioning into the future. Methods A 24 -month litterbag decomposition experiment was carried out in a Mediterranean forest to analyze the effects of climate and species diversity changes on litter mixture interactions and the decomposition process. Results In the control plot, <b>synergistic</b> <b>interactions</b> increased with time and species diversity in litter mixtures, leading to more efficient litter decomposition. Drier conditions obtained in the field with a rain exclusion device decreased decomposition rates, resulting in three-fold less <b>synergistic</b> <b>interactions</b> and five-fold more antagonistic interactions during the decomposition process. Furthermore, <b>synergistic</b> <b>interactions</b> were better preserved in the drought conditions with increasing number of species. Conclusions Our findings underline how a longer drought season could strongly affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Drier climate led to slower mass loss rates and a strong shift in the litter mixture <b>interactions,</b> with fewer <b>synergistic</b> <b>interactions</b> and more antagonistic interactions...|$|R

50|$|A {{thin coating}} of nanocrystals {{embedded}} in glass can provide selective control over both visible light and heat-producing near-infrared (NIR) light independently climates. The technology employs a small jolt of electricity to switch the material between NIR-transmitting and NIR-blocking states. Nanocrystals of {{indium tin oxide}} embedded in a glassy matrix of niobium oxide form a composite material. The voltage ranges over 2.5 volts. The same window can also be switched to a dark mode, blocking both light and heat, or to a bright, fully transparent mode. The effect relies on a <b>synergistic</b> <b>interaction</b> in the region where glassy matrix meets nanocrystal that increases the electrochromic effect. The atoms connect across the nanocrystal-glass interface, causing a structural rearrangement in the glass matrix.

50|$|In {{lean and}} obese mice, {{selective}} and combined norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition reduces food intake and body weight. Yet selective reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine and dopamine (nisoxetine and a substance codenamed GBR12783, respectively) independently {{have no effect}} on food intake in mice. However, when given in combination, there is profound inhibition of food intake. This demonstrates a <b>synergistic</b> <b>interaction</b> between dopamine and norepinephrine in controlling ingestive behavior, similar to the action of SNRIs. The fact that nisoxetine alone does not affect food intake suggests that norepinephrine alone is insufficient to affect feeding or that the blocked reuptake of norepinephrine by nisoxetine is acting in the wrong place. Unlike nisoxetine, its sulfur analog thionisoxetine reduces food consumption in rodents and is a more promising treatment for obesity and eating disorders.|$|E

To better understand the role of these two proteins in homologous recombination in the RecF pathway [recBCsbcB(C) background], we investigated the interactions between helD, uvrD and the following RecF pathway genes: recF, recO, recN and ruvAB. We observed <b>synergistic</b> <b>interactions</b> between uvrD and the recF, recN, recO and recG genes in both conjugational recombination and the repair of methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) -induced DNA damage.

Specifically, noise damage typically damages the first layer of the outer hair cells.

Also, the combined effects of these chemicals and the noise produce greater auditory fatigue than when an individual is exposed to one factor immediately followed by the next.|$|E
