40|$|Financial analysis, which {{includes}} in-depth monitoring of financial indicators, {{is crucial for}} the development of companies and the economy as a whole. Knowledge of the financial indicators greatly reduces business risk. The aim of the research was to assess the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> and the degree of financial risk for the entire Slovenian wood industry in the period 2007 - 2011. It was found out that the values of the studied financial indicators worsened considerably {{at the beginning of the}} economic crisis, therefore it can be deduced to decreased solvency and increased business risk. Some indicators slightly improved in the last four years, but not much. This indicates a high risk of both sectors (C 16 and C 31), both for creditors and owners. However, there are little differences between the two sectors, what was also statistically approved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the legislation that}} regulates the Romanian unit-linked life insurance market. The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no. 32 / 2000 on insurance undertakings and insurance supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and reinsurance undertakings, of mutual undertakings, {{as well as of}} insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive, 2002 / 83 /EC, unit-linked life insurance products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the insurance undertaking, usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the insurance undertaking's entire business, of its <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvency,</b> the establishment of technical provisions, including mathematical provisions, and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the home Member State pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all life insurance products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance products and the one regarding traditional life insurance products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{supervisory}} {{regulation of}} the New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II, 2004) defines the guidelines for internationally active banks management of credit, operational and trading risks. Concerning the credit risk, Basel II mainly imposes the minimum consistency of capital required to banks as proportional {{to the risk of}} exposure and determines the prerequisites for an internal rating based approach. The Accord has had a potentially strong impact on both the banks, because consistencies of capital requirements depend on the evaluation of the risk and the enterprises, because it may determine a reduced access to bank financing. In this framework the small and medium business (SMEs), amounting to over the 95 % of all the enterprises, play a key role because bank loans are still the prime source of their finance but they are generally perceived as more risky than large corporations. For these reasons in the last few years, the economic and statistical communities have largely focused the attention toward the production of automatic procedures and models aimed at the accurate estimation of an enterprise risk of default. From a statistical point of view, the problem has a very standard formulation: given a set of predictors (usually attributes of the borrower, balance sheet items and financial ratios) and the information about the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> of a sample of data, any model for binary response can be used for estimating the probability of default. Hence, a number of possible solutions have been applied to this aim, including both parametric and nonparametric models. However, several largely neglected problems occur when applying these procedures. A first issue concerns with a possible form of bias emerging in sample selection, which may affect the classification. In fact, credit scoring models are often based on data of large corporations which are not randomly selected. Further problems arise in model estimation and when evaluating the goodness of fitting. These issues are mainly {{due to the fact that}} most of the classification methods are based on the implicit assumption that the distribution of the responses is well balanced over the sample. However, the proportion of defaulter business is very close to zero, leading to an high class imbalance. In this work some issues emerging in credit scoring models are discussed and a possible remedy is presented. The proposed technique represents an unified and systematic framework for coping with unbalanced data, it includes most of the existing solutions as a special case and is supported by a theoretical framework...|$|E
30|$|Various {{scholars}} in the finance research field supplement their research on the absolute level of debt by offering work on the composition of debt as an additional substream of research on financial restructuring during distress (Gennaioli and Rossi 2013). Asquith et al. (1994) and James (1996) note that debt composition is equally important for turnaround. Resorting to agency theory, Brown et al. (1993) state that the power shift from equity holders to creditors implies that the restructuring firm offers equity to private lenders and senior debt to public debt holders, leading to positive market reactions. Thus, debt covenants can act as an effective disciplinary mechanism during distress (DeAngelo et al. 2002). However, management and shareholders often counteract by trying to diminish creditors’ increase in power; managers and owners choose investment projects with lower net present values during distress to force creditors to accept poorer terms in private debt renegotiations, generating greater returns to shareholders in <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> (Bernardo and Talley 1996). Creditors as residual claimants will inevitably agree to concessions to avoid a costly liquidation, irrespective <b>of</b> a company’s <b>state</b> <b>of</b> distress (Mella-Barral 1999; Noe and Wang 2000; Routledge and Gadenne 2000). Thus, the decision to default can even be understood as the distressed firm’s endogenous response to anticipated foreclosure outcomes (Brown et al. 2006). Transaction costs for private debt restructuring remain comparably high due to these agency problems and limit the degree of debt structure alterations during distress (Gilson 1997). This argument yields an incentive for default, as transaction costs are significantly smaller.|$|R

40|$|Invited paper {{submitted}} by the United <b>States</b> <b>of</b> America* Abstract. The valuation of farmland is used for several purposes {{in the development of}} agricultural and trade policy. Farmland values have historically represented 68 percent of the agricultural balance sheet in the United States. In addition, farmland values are important considerations in the calculation of index numbers used to analyze changes in productivity and competitiveness. Farmland values, however, may be affected by factors tangential to agricultural policy concerns. This study examines two such impacts. First, the study examines the effect of changes in sector solvency on farmland valuation. Second, the study examines the potential impact of spatial differences in productivity. Measurement of these impacts may be complicated by the presence of urban sprawl in the United <b>States.</b> The effect <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> is important due to concept of the decoupling of farm program payments...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{conditions}} of an unstable economic situation characterized by unprofitability of business entities’ activities, growing number of enterprises subject to insolvency proceedings, special attention {{is given to the}} diagnosis of enterprise insolvency. The issues of enterprise insolvency have been studied by many national and foreign scientists, however, the problem of distinguishing between the concept of "insolvency" of an enterprise and the related concepts of "bankruptcy", "ordinary default", "technical default" and "crisis" remains unsolved as they are equated in papers of a number of scientists, which complicates the process of identifying the insolvency status of an enterprise and the stabilization of its financial condition. The article aims at investigating the essence of the concepts which characterize the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affected <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> an enterprise and the clarification of their economic sense using the morphological analysis. This article investigates the causes and consequences <b>of</b> violating the <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> enterprise, the possibility <b>of</b> restoring <b>solvency</b> and functioning <b>of</b> the enterprise for various forms <b>of</b> the <b>solvency</b> violation. The analysis has shown that there are different opinions on the meaning, causes and roles of judicial bodies in the process of bankruptcy of an enterprise. As for the default of an enterprise, this category should be divided into ordinary and technical default, though this division is not applied in most literary sources, including regulatory acts. However, the above-said categories have different essence which preconditions their division and detailed analysis. Bankruptcy and default of an enterprise are defined as the result, a form <b>of</b> a crisis <b>state,</b> the essence <b>of</b> the category "crisis of an enterprise" have been researched. As a result of regulatory acts and scientific work of national and foreign scientists analysis, we have also distinguished the concept of "insolvency" of an enterprise from the related concepts of "bankruptcy", "ordinary default", "technical default" and "crisis", characterizing the violation <b>of</b> <b>solvency.</b> Based on the morphological analysis we have clarified the economic concept of enterprise "insolvency" {{from the point of view}} of its essence, causes and consequences.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a critique <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> regulation such as imposed on banks by Basel I and II. It argues that banks seeking to maximize {{rate of return}} on risk-adjusted capital (RORAC) aim at an optimal level <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> because on the one hand, solvency S lowers the cost of refinancing; on the other, it ties costly capital. In period 1, exogenous changes in mean returns dµ and in volatility occur, causing optimal adjustments dS * / dµ and dS * / ds in period 2. Since banks reallocate their assets with certain µ and s values in response to the changed solvency level, an endogenous trade-off with slope dµ / ds results in period 3. Both Basel I and II are shown to modify this slope, inducing at least some banks to opt for a higher value of s in certain situations. Therefore, this type <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> regulation can prove counter-productive...|$|R

40|$|At {{the light}} of what {{happened}} in 2010 and 2011, a lot of European countries founded themselves in a difficult position where all the credit rating agencies were downgrading debt <b>states.</b> Problem <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> and guarantees on the states' bond were perceived as too risky for a Monetary Union as Europe is. Fear of a contagion from Greece as well was threatening the other countries as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland; while Germany and France asked for a division between risky and riskless bond in order to feel more safe. Our paper gets inspiration by Roch and Uhlig (2011), it refers to the Argentinian case examined by Arellano (2008) and examine possible interventions as monetization or bailout as proposed by Cole and Kehoe (2000). We propose a model in which a state defaults and cannot repay a fraction of the old bond; but contrary to Roch and Uhlig that where considering a one-time cost of default we consider default as an accumulation of losses, perceived as unpaid fractions of the old debts. Our contributions to literature is that default immediately imply that economy faces a bad period and, accumulating losses, government will be worse-off. We studied a function for this accumulation of debt period by period, in order {{to get an idea of}} the magnitude of this waste of resources that economy will face when experiences a default. Our thesis is that bailouts just postpone the day of reckoning (Roch, Uhlig); so it's better to default before accumulate a lot of debts. What Europe need now is the introduction of new reforms in a controlled default where the Eurozone will be saved in its whole integrity and a state could fail with the future promise of a resurrection. As experience show us, governments are not interested into reducing debts since there are ECB interventions. That clearly create a distortion between countries in the same monetary union, giving to the states just an illusion about their future debtor position. ...|$|R
