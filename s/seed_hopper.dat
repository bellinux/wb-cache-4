50|$|Drilling is {{the term}} used for the {{mechanised}} sowing of an agricultural crop. Traditionally, a seed drill used to consist of a hopper filled with seeds arranged above a series of tubes that can be set at selected distances from each other to allow optimum growth of the resulting plants. Seeds are spaced out using fluted paddles which rotate using a geared drive {{from one of the}} drill's land wheels—seed rate is altered by changing gear ratios. Most modern drills use air to convey seed in plastic tubes from the <b>seed</b> <b>hopper</b> to the coulters—it is an arrangement which allows seed drills to be much wider than the seed hopper—as much as 12 m wide in some cases. The seed is metered mechanically into an air stream created by a hydraulically powered on-board fan and conveyed initially to a distribution head which sub-divides the seed into the pipes taking the seed to the individual coulters.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to develop the seeder for sowing tray to reduce the labor cost and the operation time for preparing sowing tray. Papaya seeds were selected for test on this machine. The sowing tray used for test has 60 cells per one tray. The dimensions of seeder developed have a width of 1, 044 [*]mm, a length of 679 [*]mm. and a height of 1, 348 [*]mm. The important components of machine consisted of <b>seed</b> <b>hopper,</b> seed metering device, seed releasing units, soil compressing units and depth controlling units. The seed metering device was established by plastic sheet. The plastic rods cut into keyway along its axis for keeping seeds were inserted into the seed metering device in order to convey the seeds from the <b>seed</b> <b>hopper</b> to the flexible tube. The flexible tubes brought the seeds into seed releasing units located under the part of seed metering device in order to drop the seeds 1 – 2 seeds per cell of sowing tray. The seed metering devices were set 3 units, 1 unit for releasing seeds on 20 cells of sowing tray, on the seeder frame. Chain drive mechanism was set to drive the system for releasing seeds on sowing tray. The efficiency test of releasing seed on sowing tray of this seeder was equal to 79 %. For operation time of releasing seeds on sowing tray, Comparing between this seeder and human hand found that the sowing by the seeder was 7. 88 times quicker than the sowing by human hand. In parts of economic analysis of seeder, breakeven point, payback period and benefit cost ration were considered for economic analysis. Their results found that were 152, 050 trays, 0. 03 year and 3. 05 respectively. Therefore, the seeder of papaya sowing tray developed is suitable for using in local farmers in Thailand...|$|E
40|$|For {{planting}} {{fine seeds}} in cellular trays, an automatic pneumatic seeder was designed, constructed and evaluated. CATIA software {{was used to}} design and analysis the system parts of the seeder. Different parts of the seeder, including vibrating <b>seed</b> <b>hopper,</b> vacuum boom, seed picking nozzles, seed tube, pneumatic system and electronic control unit for automation of the seeder, were designed and constructed. The area of nozzle orifice was {{used to calculate the}} required pressure of nozzle tip. The seeder was evaluated using two sizes of trays. Experiments were performed with five replications and the error of planting the seeds in the 105 and 390 -cellular trays were 1. 9 and 0. 46 percent, respectively. The time of planting for 105 and 390 cellular trays reduced from 20 min (for manual seeding) to 35 s and from 90 min to 160 s, respectively...|$|E
40|$|As {{the working}} width of sowing {{implements}} increases, {{the use of}} conventional mechanical <b>seed</b> drills, with <b>hoppers</b> above all the implement working width, has reachedits limits. Any further increase of the working width (more than 4 - 6 m) or the coupling of conventional additional apparatus is expensive, complex and time-consuming. Air-seeding appears thus as the best solution to solve this problem. One storage hopper is able to supply the working width of 24 m or more. However, it should be noticed that to ensure uniform crop growing, a machine needs an accurate, technical solution to ensure seeding material to be distributed across the full implement working width. Indeed, low transversal distribution accuracy {{is one of the}} most important shortcomings of modem air-seeders. Even if air-seeding has been used for more than 50 years, few developments have been carried out on divider headers responsible for distribution accuracy. This paper deals with a study on the influence of divider head geometry and functioning conditions on the seed's distribution accuracy. The first part concerns the study of the influence of the air velocity and the material flow rate on the distribution accuracy. A second study deals with the influence of the outlet closing, of different outlet pipes lengths, of distribution head tightness, of the angle position of distribution heads. Finally the influence of the structural elements such as the pipe elbow, the tower configurations, the tower height and the cone shape deflectors' implementation on the divider lid is proposed. Moreover, observation of the seed's behaviour is undertaken using a high-speed camera system. These experimental results allowed for proposals of hypothesis about the parameters influencing the final result. This paper also proposes theoretical and mathematical explanations of the observed effects, necessary for future divider heads design...|$|R
40|$|Autosprout is {{the mass}} {{manufacturing}} equipment envisioned to produce Sprout, a pencil with a seed. This pencil concept {{was developed by}} MIT students a successful round of funding and first production run through Kickstarter. The goals for Autosprout are to fully automate the manufacturing process, and to reduce the manufacturing costs from eighty cents per pencil to less than thirty, while also producing a completely assembled pencil every five seconds. The original assembly process was slow and required a lot of manpower. However, it laid a foundation to design the automated process described in this thesis. The new system will feature two carousel systems. The first carousel will load the cedar pencil, cut a shoulder using a specially designed router, and finally add a dab of glue around the shoulder. The second carousel will load a pill capsule body and fill it with soil and two to three seeds. At {{the end of each}} carousel process the pill capsule and pencil will come together and the capsule will be placed onto the shoulder and the glue will hold it in place. Before the capsule is loaded into the carousel, it must be sorted and properly aligned. Models for a vibratory feeder were first designed and tested, but, due to the inconsistent performance of the models, an industrial vibratory feeder was purchased and modified. The modification consists of a chute leading to a vacuum system that removes the capsule from the feeder, rotates, and finally loads the capsule into the carousel by switching a valve making the vacuum into a stream of high air pressure. A similar system will be used for removing <b>seeds</b> from a <b>hopper</b> and placing them in the capsule. by Eric A. Del Castillo. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|A {{prototype}} of integrated machine for tillage, planting and fertilizer application for corn cultivation powered by hand tractor was modified {{to improve the}} planting and fertilizing performances. The fertilizer hopper was redesigned and separated to be two hoppers for urea, and for a mixture of TSP and KCl. The hoppers which had a bigger capacity were placed on left and right sides of the machine. For a better arrangement, the <b>seed</b> <b>hopper</b> was set on the middle part between the fertilizer hoppers. The rotor of fertilizer metering device were redesigned to become an edge cell type rotor, and equipped with a metering cylinder. Materials of the driving wheel were changed by thinner and lighter materials. To improve its driving force, the wheel was equipped by radial lugs and side rims which were set on the main rim. The stationer test result showed that the fertilizer application rate could be varied by setting the rotor opening of the metering device. Capacity of the fertilizer hopper was increased from 5 kg to 12 kg. By modification, the machine weight could be decreased and the vertical load on {{the handle of the}} tiller could be decreased from 50 kg (the first prototype) to 31 kg (modified prototype).

40|$|Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam) and fipronil for maize (Zea mays L.) {{seed dressing}} have been claimed {{to play a}} role in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) decline, since pneumatic precision drills used for sowing contribute to the dispersion of the abrasion dust produced by dressed seeds. The active ingredients (a. i.) can contaminate the environment and can lead to the exposure of operators and bystanders during sowing operations. To achieve a significant reduction of dust drift and to enhance the safety for the operators, CRA-ING studied and developed novel engineering solutions applicable to drills, based on an air-recycling/filtering system. In the first system, the air’s excess is forced outward through suitable filters placed on the modified lid of the <b>seed</b> <b>hopper.</b> It can be easily applied to commercial drills in use. The second system was specifically designed for new drills. It consists of a collector duct that receives the air expelled from the vacuum fan opening, creating constant pressure conditions. Part of the air is recycled into the seed hoppers, as the air in excess is directed outward through a single main filter. A third system, based on the second one, entails the use of an electrostatic filter to improve its efficiency. Moreover, to avoid the operator’s exposure to the dust during the seed loading, we show an integrated solution based on the use of a modified pre-charged plastic container that replace the drill’s hoppers. Preliminary tests ascertained the regular seed distribution with the drills equipped with the prototypes. Then, trials were carried out at fixed point and in field, for detecting the amounts of the drifted a. i., using commercial maize seed dressed with thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin and fipronil. The test results show powder and a. i. drift reductions up to a maximum of 94. 5 % measured at ground level (with fipronil as a. i.) as a consequence of the use of the prototypes...|$|E
40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a <b>seed</b> <b>hopper</b> installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each harrow tine functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|E
