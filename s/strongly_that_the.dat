5|$|Ross felt <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{state should}} {{adequately}} care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility {{had run out}} of room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected enough money to move to a larger location.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} Hubble to be {{serviced}} in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, {{in which the}} orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions {{had to be able}} to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers felt <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.|$|E

25|$|Materialistic {{evolution}} is {{the acceptance of}} biological evolution, combined with the position that if the supernatural exists, it has little to no influence on the material world (a position common to philosophical naturalists, humanists and atheists).

Subsequent studies using the length of limb bones to estimate LM3's height, suggest a height of 196 centimetres (77inches or 6ft 5 in), a height that is unusually tall for modern Aboriginal males.|$|E

25|$|The Penitentiary was {{intended}} {{not simply to}} punish, but to move the criminal toward spiritual reflection and change. While {{some have argued that}} the Pennsylvania System was Quaker-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's Pennsylvania Prison Society) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, William White. Proponents of the system believed <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts of their behavior and the ugliness of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.|$|E
25|$|Nyfløt and Khan was on Thursday 14 May 2011 convicted {{respectively}} on {{the counts}} of second-degree murder and kidnapping of Faiza Ashraf. Neither {{of the two}} was convicted of premeditated murder. They were sentenced to 8 and 17 years in prison, respectively. However both sentences personally ordered appealed by attorney general Tor-Aksel Busch who felt <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court had made the wrong decision, and during the second trial, both men were convicted of premeditated murder and kidnapping and had their sentences increased to 19 years for Khan and 18 years for Nyfløt. In addition, both men were to pay NOK 200.000 in compensation to Ashraf's parents.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by the {{beginning}} of 1919 the positions taken up by those involved were fairly well defined. Robert Munro, himself a Highlander, believed passionately in the reinstatement of the crofts and he also felt <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Westminster Parliament was unlikely to tolerate any departure from the implementation of land reform, but he saw no reason why Lewis should not have Leverhulme's industrial schemes as well as more crofts. Leverhulme refused to budge, believing that the break-up of his farms would lead to seriously inefficient, probably unsustainable, and ultimately abandoned smallholdings as crofters moved away in search of better incomes. Ranged against this at least ostensibly reasonable prediction was the formidable influence wielded by prospective crofters away fighting in France, as well as by supporters of the Highland League which was politically dedicated to land reform.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century in the U.S., however, Decalogue monuments and plaques in government spaces had become a legal battleground between religious as well as political liberals and conservatives. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Americans United for Separation of Church and State launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the American Jewish Congress), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider culture war between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the Liberty Counsel, have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the U.S. Supreme Court {{as a threat to the}} expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.|$|E
