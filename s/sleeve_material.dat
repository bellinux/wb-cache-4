50|$|Major {{components}} of a pinch valve consists of body and a sleeve. The sleeve will contain the flow media and isolate it from the environment hence reducing contamination to the environment. Generally used for slurries or processes with entrained solids, because the flexible rubber sleeve allows the valve to close droptight around solids—solids that would typically be trapped by the seat or stuck in crevices in globe, diaphragm, butterfly, gate, or ball valves. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>material</b> can be selected upon the corrosiveness and abrasiveness of the flow media, a suitable synthetic polymer can be chosen.

50|$|Conventional SiC, or {{sometimes}} the less expensive SiSiC, {{have been used}} successfully for more than 25 years in slide or journal bearings of pumps. The pumped liquid itself provides the lubricant for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low friction coefficients are {{the basis of this}} success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, shrink-fitted in its metallic environment, and a rotating shaft sleeve, mounted on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC shaft sleeve does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100-350 mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance - for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as a shaft <b>sleeve</b> <b>material</b> has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with a shaft sleeve made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80 °C as lubricant.The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in W/mm2 and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.|$|E

A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using photopolymer plates.

40|$|Pile {{sleeving}} is {{an annulus}} of compressible material between a laterally loaded pile and the adjacent ground {{and is a}} method adopted in Hong Kong for protecting the stability of sloping grounds and retaining walls. In practice, sloping grounds of various inclinations can be encountered and an appropriate sleeving thickness has to be selected for particular sites considering site-specific factors. To evaluate the effects of slope inclination and sleeving thickness on behavior of piles, a series of 3 D analyses {{of the behavior of}} laterally loaded piles was conducted considering several, sleeving thicknesses (0, 100, and 250 mm) and slope inclinations [level, 1 (vertical) : 2 (horizontal), and 3 : 4]. At a typical design lateral load, the effects of slope inclination on the pile response are found to be minor but the effects of sleeving thickness are significant. At large lateral loads, however, the horizontal displacements and bending moments of the pile will increase as the ground becomes steeper, especially when the ground is steeper than 1 : 2. Empirical relations between the displacements and bending moments of the pile in a sloping ground and those in the level ground are proposed.

The purpose of sleeves is {{to fix the}} permanent magnets and protect them from being destroyed by the large centrifugal force. However, the <b>sleeve</b> <b>material</b> characteristics have a great influence on the PMSM, and therewith, most of the rotor eddy-current losses are generated in the rotor sleeve, which could increase the device temperature and even cause thermal demagnetization of the magnets. Thus, a sleeve scheme design with low eddy-current losses is necessary, and a method suppressing the local temperature peak of permanent magnets is presented.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Nonlinear simulations {{were used to}} predict and further understand the load transfer between trunnion shafts and yoke plates within a tainter gate trunnion assembly. Traditionally, yoke plates have been sized for an average stress based on the projected bearing area between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate; however, finite element analyses proved that the stress is not uniform across {{the thickness of the}} yoke plate. The non-uniform stress distribution is attributed to the transverse shaft rotations that exist at the supports, concentrating load on the inboard edges of the yoke plates. Further study showed that the installation of either a bronze or composite sleeve between the yoke plate and the trunnion shaft will reduce the magnitude of the stress concentrations. A series of finite element models was developed to investigate the effects that shaft diameter, yoke plate thickness, and <b>sleeve</b> <b>material</b> have on the trunnion shaft to yoke plate load path. The finite element models were developed utilizing solid elements in order to capture the stress distribution across the yoke plate thickness by including multiple solution points across the yoke plate thickness. The analyses showed that a trend can be identified between the magnitude of the edge stress and the L/D ratio (shaft clear span to shaft diameter). As the L/D ratio of the system is increased, the magnitude of the edge stress increases; however, when a sleeve with a lower modulus of elasticity is introduced into the system, it is observed that the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced. The results proved that the reduction in stress is sensitive to shaft diameter, <b>sleeve</b> <b>material,</b> yoke plate thickness and L/D ratio. Typically for a yoke-shaft detail, the L/D ratio is designed to be close to 1. 0 in order to minimize the inboard edge stress; however, trunnion assemblies with larger L/D ratios are desirable from a tainter gate design perspective. Larger clear spans (L) simplify the connection between the strut arms and the trunnion assembly, and small shaft diameters (D) reduce the trunnion pin friction moment demand on the tainter gate strut arms. By installing a low modulus sleeve between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate, the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced; therefore, the design can accommodate L/D ratios larger than 1. 0 while still keeping the stresses below an acceptable level. The simplified detailing and the reduction in strut arm demand will produce a more cost effective tainter gate design.

The antennas operate in Ku and Ka bands and must support multiple beams, polarizations, and frequencies with a single aperture. ^ The first antenna, developed for NASA 2 ̆ 7 s High-Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler, is a single, offset-fed reflector that supports dual-band beams incident at 30 ° and 40 ° off-nadir. The antenna uses two compact, dual-band feeds {{moved away from the}} reflector 2 ̆ 7 s focal point to meet the dual beam requirement. The radar is to be flown on the Global Hawk Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle which has a small payload bay requiring the feeds to be both rugged and compact. ^ The second antenna, developed for Remote Sensing Solutions 2 ̆ 7 Dual-Wavelength Precipitation Radar, is a dual-offset Gregorian reflector. The antenna supports a single, dual-band, beam with dual-polarization at each band. Additionally, the antenna has high polarization purity and matched half power beamwidths at Ku and Ka bands. The strict requirements of the antenna are met by precisely controlling feed radiation characteristics. ^ The two antennas necessitated several advances in feed design. A foam sleeve is demonstrated as an effective method to reduce the beamwidth of a tapered dielectric rod antenna. The foam sleeve is an attractive design because it allows dual-band feeds where a corrugated horn is used to control radiation at lower frequencies and the sleeve corrected rod is used to control the upper band. By judiciously choosing <b>sleeve</b> <b>material,</b> independent control of the radiation pattern and phase center at each band is achieved allowing higher performance feeds. This dissertation also focuses on new developments in the backend design of feeds. Specifically, the use of tuning arms in the feed backend and double ridged waveguide to couple the signal into the feed allow more compact designs with greater bandwidth. ...|$|E
40|$|Plasticine {{and other}} soft {{materials}} {{are often used}} for physical modeling of metal- forming processes. In this experiment, two colors of Plasticine are used to model coextrusion of a non-axisymmetric channel with a thin copper sleeve of uniform thickness surrounding an aluminum core. Since analysis of the flow behavior is cumbersome, {{the foundation of the}} die design is drawn from the process of upsetting described by S. Kivivuori in a recent paper. The upsetting involves the compression of the desired final cross-section between parallel plates. After a sufficient reduction in thickness, the cross- section transforms to a circular shape. The path taken by the material, as described by intermediate profiles,is the reverse of the path through the die. Therefore,the intermediate profiles provide the contour of the extrusion die cavity. In 1988, Kulick discovered that, {{in the case of the}} profile in question, the channel collapses upon itself. Unfortunately, the path which includes this collapse is not reversible with an extrusion die, as part of the die would need to be infinitely thin. Kulick's solution was to change the billet design to a solid core with a 40 ° sector of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>material,</b> all surrounded by a sleeve of uniform thickness. In order to facilitate production, it is desirable to have an axisymmetric billet design. Therefore, rather than change the billet design, the extrusion die design must depart from the least-work path of the upsetting. The upsetting experiment was modified to prevent the channel from collapsing upon itself. A constraint was placed where the material was not permitted to flow, as conducted by S. Kivivuori, in order to modify the material flow in the upsetting experiment, yielding the correct die design. Computer modeling allowed three dimensional analysis before die construction. CADKEY generated a three dimensional image of the extrusion die, and later versions of the same software can link the profiles and interpolate the surface of the die. If plans for die design could have been generated in the proper format, these would be input to a computer driven machining device, in order to make smaller, precision dies for extrusion of metal rather than clay. This work has been left as a path for future work on the project. The prospect of the generation of the desired profile from a cylindrical, axisymmetrical billet is good. The upsetting method has been proven by Kivivuori, and the modification of the constraints is permitted in the process, so the prototype should be successful. To facilitate the continuation of the project, appendices have been added which give instructions as to how various elements are conducted...|$|E

The disking method is a cutting method that uses the tensile stress generated internally by putting high isostatic pressure {{to the side of}} these materials. The influence of and lubrication on cutting, and the cutting pressure and time was examined by using pyrex glass, fused silica, and polycrystal SiC in this experiment. It was found that lubrication between outer <b>sleeve</b> and <b>materials</b> and low cutting pressure are preferable to reduce the surface roughness of the cutting plane...|$|R
50|$|Each nerve {{is covered}} {{externally}} by a dense sheath of connective tissue, the epineurium. Underlying {{this is a}} layer of flat cells, the perineurium, which forms a complete sleeve around a bundle of axons. Perineurial septae extend into the nerve and subdivide it into several bundles of fibres. Surrounding each such fibre is the endoneurium. This forms an unbroken tube {{from the surface of}} the spinal cord to the level where the axon synapses with its muscle fibres, or ends in sensory receptors. The endoneurium consists of an inner <b>sleeve</b> of <b>material</b> called the glycocalyx and an outer, delicate, meshwork of collagen fibres. Nerves are bundled along with blood vessels, since the neurons of a nerve have fairly high energy requirements.|$|R
