40|$|Background Little {{is known}} about child {{disability}} and dynamic aspects of poverty. Method Analysis of data collected over a 12 -month period for families (<b>a)</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> child with intellectual disability (n = 370), (b) <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> child with other disability (n = 1, 418), and (c) <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> child with no disability (n = 7, 215). Results When compared to families not <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> child with disability, families <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> child with intellectual disability were (a) {{more likely to be}} poor, (b) more likely to become poor, (c) less likely to escape from being poor. Half of poverty transitions were associated with identifiable potential trigger events. Conclusions There were few differences between families supporting or not <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> child with disability with regard to either levels of exposure to potential trigger events or to the strength of the association between exposure and poverty transitions...|$|R

5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia that <b>supported</b> <b>a</b> decentralized federation to give greater {{autonomy to}} Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that <b>supported</b> <b>a</b> centralized federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E

5|$|Both Abrictosaurus and Heterodontosaurus {{had very}} large eyes. Underneath the eyes, the jugal bone {{projected}} sideways, a feature {{also present in}} ceratopsians. As in the jaws of most ornithischians, the anterior edge of the premaxilla (a bone {{at the tip of}} the upper jaw) was toothless and probably <b>supported</b> <b>a</b> keratinous beak (rhamphotheca), although heterodontosaurids did have teeth in the posterior section of the premaxilla. A large gap, called a diastema, separated these premaxillary teeth from those of the maxilla (the main upper jaw bone) in many ornithischians, but this diastema was characteristically arched in heterodontosaurids. The mandible (lower jaw) was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischians. This bone also <b>supported</b> <b>a</b> beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone.|$|E
