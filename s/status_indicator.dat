25|$|All AEDs {{approved}} {{for use in}} the United States use an electronic voice to prompt users through each step. Because the user of an AED may be hearing impaired, many AEDs now include visual prompts as well. Most units are designed for use by non-medical operators. Their ease of use has given rise to the notion of public access defibrillation (PAD), which experts agree {{has the potential to be}} the single greatest advance in the treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest since the invention of CPR. Some advances include a CPR feedback device by Zoll and Cardiac Science, non-polarized pads (they can be placed in either location) by Cardiac Science, a <b>status</b> <b>indicator</b> most AEDS, and simple voice and text prompts with an adjustable skill level, on most AEDs.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{specific}} upgrades and improvements {{made to the}} machines produced after the 82-30, with after-market solid-state/microprocessor-operated controllers available for the 82-30 itself. The 82-70 is the general standard in most AMF-equipped modern bowling centers today. It features a microprocessor-operated chassis that is upgraded to short cycle the machine for strikes, gutter balls, or 7–10 pick-offs. It features solid state motors. The 82-90 and the 82-90XLI are further upgrades, basically using the 82-70's mechanics, which replaced the older, completely electro-mechanical controls with machine <b>status</b> <b>indicator</b> lights, much more sophisticated [...] "pin storage" [...] design, single control centers that handle two machines, {{and perhaps the most}} important upgrade is the self shutdown control, which shuts the machine down to prevent damage from continuing to operate with a fault. The 82-90 models feature a deck that is thinner than the 82-70.|$|E
