25|$|Public-key {{algorithms}} {{are based}} on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these is integer factorization (e.g., the RSA algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring), but the discrete logarithm problem is also important. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time). For instance, the best known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, other things being equal, to achieve an equivalent <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> resistance, factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.|$|E

For the adversary, using a graph theoretic approach, an efficient algorithm with polynomial-time complexity is obtained {{for the design of}} unobservable malicious data attacks. When the unobservable attack does not exist due to restrictions of meter access, attacks are constructed to minimize the residue energy of attack while guaranteeing a certain level of increase of mean square error. For the control center, a computationally efficient algorithm is derived to detect and localize attacks using the generalized likelihood ratio test regularized by an L 1 norm penalty on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack...</b>|$|E

30|$|In this research, a five-pixel {{modification}} {{is chosen}} as the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> by considering the practicability. First, the few-pixel modification is more efficient than the global perturbation [14] that modifies each or most pixels of an image due to less variables need to solve. On the other side, one-pixel attack numerically requires the least cost among most of the attacks [23]. However, the one-pixel attack can be hardly imperceptible in practice since all attack strength concentrates on the single modified pixel. By adding the number of pixels that can modify, the strength can be distributed to make the modification less visible. In practice, a scenario that one-pixel attack is available but five-pixel attack is not is not common. The pixel values modified by the proposed attack are still 8 bits (0 – 255) which are legal for three-channel RGB pixels.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the first type of DoQoNS (Denial of Quality of Network Service) attacks: attacks {{directly}} on the resource reservation and setup protocol. In particular, we have studied and analyzed the RSVP protocol. Two important research contributions are presented: First, we performed a security analysis on RSVP which demonstrates the key vulnerabilities of its distributed resource reservation and setup process. Second, we proposed a new secure RSVP protocol, SDS/CD (Selective Digital Signature with Conflict Detection) for RSVP, which combines the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> prevention and intrusion detection. SDS/CD resolved a fundamental issue in network security: how to protect the integrity, in an End-to-End fashion, of a target object that is mutable along the route path. As a result, we will show that SDS/CD can deal with many insider attacks {{that can not be}} handled by the current IETF/RSVP security solution: hop-by-hop Authentication...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{the modern}} {{computer}} world, {{use of the}} internet is increasing day by day. However, the increasing {{use of the internet}} creates some security issues. These days, such new types of sophisticated security attacks occurred and {{it is not easy to}} detect and prevent those attacks effectively. One common method of attack involves sending large amount of request to site or server and server will be unable to handle such huge requests and site will be offline for many days depends upon the attack. This is major security threat to internet services and most critical attack for cyber security world is called distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. How to detect and prevent against a DDOS attack is currently a hot topic in both industry and academia. Traditionally, DDOS attacks are carried out at the network layer. Since many studies have noticed this type of attacks and have proposed different schemes and solutions (e. g., network measure or anomaly detection) to protect the network. It is not as easy as in the past for attackers to launch the DDOS attacks based on network layer. So, attackers shift their offensive strategies to application layered attacks and establish a more sophisticated type of application layer DDOS attacks such as HTTP flooding. The significance of the application layer DDOS attack and increased occurrence and <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> led my work to use creative, effective and efficient mechanism that address the DDOS flooding problem. Here, I am looking forward to detect and mitigate the effect of DDOS attack against web server. I will propose such a mechanism that will detect DDOS attack, differentiate the attack traffic from normal traffic, and mitigate the effect of DDOS attack. My main goal is to increase the availability of web server for legal users...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is a {{valuable}} tool to localize, characterize, and evaluate anomalous prostate tissue. Ultrafast gradient-echo acquisitions of MRI volumes are generated at regular time intervals while the patient receives a paramagnetic contrast agent. The result is a time series where each voxel exhibits a particular behavior of contrast uptake (wash-in) and posterior wash-out. In this work, a segmentation method is proposed that groups together neighboring voxels with similar contrast wash-out responses, using {{a variant of the}} region growing GrowCut cellular automaton algorithm, that evolves iteratively according to the relationship of a cell to its neighboring cells. Initially, seed cells are determined through morphological filters that identify homogeneous regions in the volume that are representatives of the clinically relevant types of tissues in the prostate. Each cell is characterized by three parameters: a label that identifies the type of tissue in the associated voxel, a vector with the values of the DCE-MRI time series, and a strength coefficient with values between 0 and 1 that represents the probability with which the cell belongs to its assigned label. Every non-seed cell can modify its state; this occurs when each cell is attacked by its neighbors with a <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> that is inversely proportional to the similarity of the values of the time series between the cells. If the strength of the attacked cell is less than the strength of the attack of one of its neighbors, its state changes to the one of the attacking cell. The attacked cell also updates its strength making it equal to the strength of the attack with which it was conquered. To perform a clinical validation of the resulting segmentations, we used various cases from the database of The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), National Cancer Institute (NCI).

40|$|Anomaly-based DDoS {{detection}} systems construct {{profile of}} the traffic normally seen in the network, and identify anomalies whenever traffic deviate from normal profile beyond a threshold. This extend of deviation is normally not utilised. This paper reports the evaluation results of proposed approach that utilises this extend of deviation from detection threshold to estimate <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> DDoS <b>attack</b> using various regression models. A relationship is established between number of zombies and observed deviation in sample entropy. Various statistical performance measures, such as coefficient of determination (R 2), coefficient of correlation (CC), sum of square error (SSE), mean square error (MSE), {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), normalised mean square error (NMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index (η) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to measure the performance of various regression models. Internet type topologies used for simulation are generated using transit-stub model of GT-ITM topology generator. NS- 2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation test bed for launching DDoS attacks with varied attack strength. A comparative study is performed using different regression models for estimating <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> DDoS <b>attack.</b> The simulation results are promising as we are able to estimate <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> DDoS <b>attack</b> efficiently with very less error rate using various regression models...|$|R
