25|$|The <b>sequential</b> <b>numbering</b> of his symphonies {{has also}} been confused: (a) they were {{initially}} numbered by order of publication, not composition; (b) the first four symphonies to be composed were published after the last five; and (c) the last five symphonies were not published in order of composition. This explains why, for example, the New World Symphony was originally published as No. 5, was later known as No. 8, and definitively renumbered as No. 9 in the critical editions published in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Many northeastern states label exit numbers sequentially, {{regardless}} of how many miles have passed between exits. States in which Interstate exits are still numbered sequentially are Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont; as such, five of the main Interstate highways that remain completely within these states (87, 88, 89, 91, and 93) have interchanges numbered sequentially along their entire routes. Maine, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, and Florida followed this system {{for a number of}} years, but since converted to mileage-based exit numbers. Georgia renumbered in 2000, while Maine did so in 2004. The Pennsylvania Turnpike uses both mile marker numbers and sequential numbers. Mile marker numbers are used for signage, while sequential numbers are used for numbering interchanges internally. The New Jersey Turnpike, including the portions that are signed as I‑95 and I‑78, also has <b>sequential</b> <b>numbering,</b> but other Interstates within New Jersey use mile markers.|$|E
500|$|After the Challenger disaster, NASA {{returned}} to using a <b>sequential</b> <b>numbering</b> system, {{with the number}} counting {{from the beginning of}} the STS program. Unlike the initial system, however, the numbers were assigned based on the initial mission schedule, and did not always reflect actual launch order. This numbering scheme started at 26, with the first flight as STS-26R—the R suffix stood for [...] "reflight" [...] to disambiguate from prior missions. The suffix was used for two years through STS-33R, then the R was dropped. As a result of the changes in systems, flights under different numbering systems could have the same number with one having a letter appended, e.g. flight STS-51 (a mission carried out by Discovery in 1993) was many years after STS-51-A (Discovery's second flight in 1984).|$|E

This step continued until of the box of square numbers is full of <b>sequential</b> <b>number.</b> The box of square has been full was stored.

5000|$|Most states use trinomials of {{the form}} [...] "nnAAnnnn", but some specify a space or dash between parts of the identifier, i.e., [...] "nn AA nnnn" [...] or [...] "nn-AA-nnnn".

Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont use two-letter abbreviations of the state name instead of the Smithsonian number. Alaska uses three-letter abbreviations for USGS map quadrangles {{in place of the}} county code. Arizona uses a five-part identifier based on USGS maps, specifying quadrangles, then rectangles within a quadrangle, a <b>sequential</b> <b>number</b> within the rectangle, and a code identifying the agency issuing the <b>sequential</b> <b>number.</b> California uses a three-letter abbreviation for counties. Connecticut and Rhode Island do not use any sub-state codes, with site identifiers consisting of the state abbreviation and a <b>sequential</b> <b>number</b> series for the whole state. Delaware uses a single letter code for counties and adds a block code (A-K) within each county, with <b>sequential</b> <b>numbers</b> for each block.
