During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as [...] "violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm". He was quoted in 1950 remarking, [...] "If you say why not bomb [...] tomorrow, I say, why not today? If you <b>say</b> <b>today</b> at five o'clock, I say why not one o'clock?" ...|$|E

50|$|Tradition III is {{the newer}} Roman Catholic view that {{practices}} and {{demonstrates that the}} real source of revelation is neither Scripture nor tradition but instead is the living magisterium. Whatever Rome <b>says</b> <b>today</b> is the apostolic faith. This has taken over its predecessor, Tradition II. Theoretically speaking, there are now three authorities: Magisterium, Tradition, and Scripture; in practice, however, it is the Magisterium that interprets both Scripture and Tradition for its adherents.|$|R

50|$|In {{speculative}} theology, {{the science}} of the absolute person, or God, Boström gives a more detailed justification {{of the principle of}} his system.

This {{is the only thing that}} is simple. Since the complex presupposes the simple, self-consciousness must also be the ultimate principle of all reality. This self-consciousness — which Boström identifies with life—can thus not be conceived as attached to a substrate or a substance, but is precisely what is primary and original in everything.|$|E

There the circle of the summer tropic {{is the same as the}} Arctic Circle (see below on Arctic Circle). Moreover, says Strabo, none of the other authors mention Thule, a fact which he uses to discredit Pytheas, but which to moderns indicates Pytheas was the first explorer to arrive there and tell of it.|$|R
