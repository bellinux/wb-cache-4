40|$|The {{potential}} for direct {{measurement of the}} acceleration of stellar winds from the supergiant component of Zeta Aurigae-type binary stars is discussed. The aberration angle of the interaction shock cone centered on the hot star provides {{a measure of the}} velocity of the cool star wind at the orbit of the secondary. This is confirmed by direct observations of stellar wind (P Cygni) line profile variations. This velocity is generally smaller than the final (terminal) velocity of the wind, deduced from the P Cygni line profiles. The contrast between these results and previously published supergiant wind models is discussed. The implication on the physics of energy <b>source</b> <b>dissipation</b> predicted in the theoretical models is considered...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to the {{determination}} of heat <b>source</b> <b>dissipation</b> from infrared thermographic measurements. Such procedure is mainly based on the heat diffusion equation provided by thermodynamics principles. Especially, this requires time and spatial derivation of temperature fields and the knowledge of the material thermal conductivity. This work intends to extend such classical procedure for isotropic materials to the anisotropic context. At first, we propose a comparative study of several filtering methods required for the data processing of noisy and discrete thermal acquisitions. In a second part, a transversely isotropic effective thermal conductivity tensor is estimated by means of a homogenization-based method. From these both results, a heat source application is presented in order to analyze damage phenomena in transversely isotropic CFRP submitted to tensile tests...|$|E
40|$|The Voyager {{mission to}} {{the outer solar system}} {{discovered}} that the thermospheres of all the giant planets are remarkably hot. To date, no convincing explanation for this phenomenon has been offered; however, {{there are a number of}} recent observational results which provide new information on the thermal structure of Jupiter's upper atmosphere that bear on this outstanding problem. We present an analysis of Jupiter's thermal structure using constraints from H 3 + emissions, Voyager UVS occultation data, ground-based stellar occultation data, and the properties of the Jovian UV dayglow. Although the initial, separate analysis of these data sets produced contradictory results, our reanalysis shows that the observations are consistent and that the temperature profile in Jupiter's upper atmosphere is well constrained. We find that the data demand the presence of a large temperature gradient, of order 3 - 10 K/km, near a pressure of 0. 3 bar. Analysis of the temperature profile implies that an energy source of roughly 1 erg cm - 2 s - 1 is required to produce the high thermospheric temperature and that this energy must be deposited in the 0. 1 - 1. 0 bar region. It is also necessary that this energy be deposited above the region where diffusive separation of CH 4 occurs, so that the energy is not radiated away by CH 4. We show that dissipation of gravity waves can supply the energy required and that this energy will be deposited in the proper region. Moreover, because the turbulent mixing caused by gravity waves determines the level at which diffusive separation of CH 4 occurs, the location of the energy <b>source</b> (<b>dissipation</b> of waves) and the energy sink (radiation by CH 4) are coupled. We show that the gravity waves will deposit their energy several s [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The non-hermitian quantum {{dynamics}} of excitonic energy transfer in photosynthetic systems is investigated using a dissipative two-level dimer model. The approach {{is based on}} the Green's function formalism which permits consideration of decoherence and intersite transfer processes on comparable terms. The results indicate a combination of coherent and incoherent behavior at higher temperatures with the possibility of exceptional points occurring at the coherent-incoherent crossover regime at critical temperatures. When each dimer site is coupled equally to the environmental <b>sources</b> of <b>dissipation,</b> the excitonic wavepacket evolves with time with a coherent component, which {{can be attributed to the}} indistinguishability of the <b>sources</b> of <b>dissipation.</b> The time evolution characteristics of the B 850 Bchls dimer system is analysed using typical parameter estimates in photosynthetic systems, and the quantum brachistochrone passage times are obtained for a range of parameters.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of sports}} balls during impact defines some special features of each sport. The {{velocity of the}} game, the accuracy of passes or shots, {{the control of the}} ball direction after impact, the risks of injury, are all set by the impact mechanics of the ball. For inflated sports balls, those characteristics are finely tuned by the ball inner pressure. As a consequence, inflation pressures are regulated for sports played with inflated balls. Despite a good understanding of ball elasticity, the <b>source</b> of energy <b>dissipation</b> for inflated balls remains controversial. We first give a clear view of non-dissipative impact mechanics. Second we review, analyse and estimate the different <b>sources</b> of energy <b>dissipation</b> of the multi-physics phenomena that occur during the impact.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a new {{formulation}} of the spectral <b>dissipation</b> <b>source</b> term Sds for wind-wave modelling applications. This new form of Sds features a nonlinear dependence on the local wave spectrum, {{expressed in terms of}} the azimuthally integrated saturation parameter B(k) =k^ 4 F(k). The basic form of this saturation-dependent Sds is based on a new framework for the onset of deep-water wave breaking due to the nonlinear modulation of wave groups. The new form of Sds is successfully validated through numerical experiments that include exact nonlinear computations of fetch-limited wind-wave evolution and hindcasts of two-dimensional wave fields made with an operational wind-wave model. The newly-proposed form of Sds generates integral spectral parameters that agree more closely with observations when compared to other <b>dissipation</b> <b>source</b> terms used in state-of-the-art wind-wave models. It also provides more flexibility in controlling properties of the wave spectrum within the high wavenumber range. Tests using a variety of wind speeds, three commonly-used wind input source functions and two alternative full-development evolution limits further demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the new saturation-dependent <b>dissipation</b> <b>source</b> term. Finally, improved wave hindcasts obtained with an implementation of the new form of Sds in a version of the WAM model demonstrate its potential usefulness in operational wind-wave forecasting applications...|$|R

40|$|Equilibrium {{states are}} used as limit states to define {{thermodynamically}} reversible processes. When these processes are implemented in statistical physics, these limit states become unstable and can change with time, due to thermal fluctuations. For macroscopic systems, the changes are insignificant on ordinary time scales and what little there is can be suppressed by macroscopically negligible, entropy-creating dissipation. For systems of molecular sizes, the changes are large on short time scales and can only sometimes be suppressed with significant entropy-creating dissipation. As a result, at molecular scales, thermodynamically reversible processes are impossible in principle, even as approximations, when we account for all <b>sources</b> of <b>dissipation.</b> ...|$|R
