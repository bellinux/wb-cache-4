40|$|The {{need for}} {{additional}} power on spinning satellites required development of deployable solar arrays activated, as on a 3 -axis vehicle, after separation from a booster or shuttle orbiter. Mechanisms were developed for telescopically extending a secondary 36. 3 kg (80 lb.), 2. 13 m (84 in.) diameter spinning <b>solar</b> <b>drum</b> for a distance of 2. 0 m (80 in.) or more along the spin axis. After extension, the system has the capability of dynamically controlling the drum tilt angle about the spin axis to provide precision in-orbit balancing of the spacecraft. This approach was selected for the SBS, ANIK C, ANIK D, WESTAR B and PALAPA B satellites. It was successfully demonstrated during the in orbit deployment of the aft solar panels of the SBS F- 3 and F- 1 satellites, subsequent to the November 1980 and September 1981 launches...|$|E
