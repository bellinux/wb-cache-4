25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a <b>semi-worsted</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most handspinners make a {{blend of}} a woolen and worsted yarn, using {{techniques}} from both categories, and thus ending up with a mix, named a <b>semi-worsted</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|E
