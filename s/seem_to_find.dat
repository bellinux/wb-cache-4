5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times {{more often than}} they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to a}} month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish and crustaceans <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E
25|$|The decimalisation {{movement}} even entered fiction. In Anthony Trollope's Palliser novels (and {{more so in}} {{the television}} series based on them), Plantagenet Palliser is a passionate advocate of decimalisation, a cause the other characters <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> intensely boring. Palliser's scheme would have divided the shilling into ten (presumably revalued) pennies. This would have changed the threepence into 2.5 new pence, the sixpence into fivepence and the half crown into a two shilling, five pence piece. It would also have required the withdrawal and reissuance of the existing copper coinage. At {{the end of the}} fifth book in the series, The Prime Minister, Palliser (now Duke of Omnium) muses that the reform will not be accomplished, since it can only be done by a Chancellor of the Exchequer sitting in the House of Commons, and the Duke now sits in the House of Lords.|$|E

25|$|The biggest bone of {{contention}} between {{the advocates of}} the 'modern' orthographies and the 'traditionalist' orthographies {{is the use of}} w and y to show the semi-vowels. In general native speakers in literacy classes <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> y and w very difficult to learn, and that u and i are the 'logical' letters to use. Syllabification of words by untrained speakers suggests that u and i are really the underlying sounds. Thus, a word like dhaudhai 'mainland, continent' syllabifies as dha-u-dha-i, not dhau-dhai. In songs, the glide-u/i can also be given full syllable status. Historical considerations also point to the semi-vowels often being vocalic rather than consonantal. Thus, lagau, the genitive of laag 'place' is in underlying form +ngu>; the full form of the genitive ending -ngu is only retained where the nominal has a monosyllabic stem (see the section on Nominal Morphology). Similarly, verbal nouns end in -i, e.g. lumai, stem luuma- 'search, look for, seek, hunt'. The mid-19th century to early 20th century records of Kauaraigau Ya show that the verbal noun ending was previously -ri (thus lumari), where the -r- was presumably the rhotic glide rather than the rhotic tap/trill.|$|E
500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When they sent me the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember calling my agent asking, 'Are you sure they want me for this episode because I can't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> me?' And then I get to the last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E
500|$|Stacy goes {{to visit}} House again in [...] "Three Stories", {{five years after}} their break up. She has married Mark Warner (Currie Graham), a high school {{guidance}} counselor. Stacy believes Mark is ill, and wants House to treat him. However, Mark does not believe anything is wrong with him, {{as well as the}} members of House's diagnostic team, who cannot <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any medical problems. After various failed attempts to diagnose Mark, House tests Marks urine for porphobilinogen; the test turns out positive, and Mark is diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). He is therefore required to have [...] "close monitoring" [...] at the hospital for a while. Stacy makes a deal with Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) to become the hospital's lawyer during Mark's stay at the hospital. During Stacy's time as the hospital's lawyer, she and House grow closer together. In [...] "Need to Know", they end up spending the night together. However, when Stacy prepares to leave Mark for House, House rejects her, stating that he cannot make her happy, because he cannot change. Stacy quits her job and returns to Short Hills, New Jersey, with Mark. She later appears in the series finale, [...] "Everybody Dies", first as one of House's hallucinations and then at House's funeral.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars and jurists <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a Scottish origin {{prior to}} the first American use of the concept. [...] Some writers see the {{doctrine}} of FNC as having developed from an earlier doctrine of forum non competens ("non-competent forum"). Many early cases in the U.S. and Scotland involving FNC were cases under admiralty law. FNC thus may ultimately have a civil law origin, as has been asserted by several writers, since admiralty law is based in civil law concepts.|$|E

2500|$|On the one hand, {{film and}} {{television}} producers <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Catholicism irresistible. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this. First, more than any other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes – {{to say nothing of the}} symbols of the sacraments – are all things that more [...] "word oriented" [...] Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends itself perfectly to the visual media of {{film and television}}. You can be sure that any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, for that matter, any sort of irruption of the transcendent into everyday life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue. (See, for example, [...] "End of Days," [...] "Dogma" [...] or [...] "Stigmata.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is {{afflicted with}} {{schizoaffective}} disorder that presents {{itself in the}} form of disembodied voices (auditory hallucinations). The illness emerged a week after his first LSD consumption. It formed a major component of Bill Pohlad's Love & Mercy (2014), a biographical film which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration, constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them. Wilson has said of the voices: [...] "Mostly [...] derogatory. Some of it's cheerful. Most of it isn't." [...] He added that his hallucinations will inspire a song [...] "every now and then". In 2002, Wilson felt that his successful treatment initiated a writer's block: [...] "I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I think I need the demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a melody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time you <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> yourself in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fellow crime writer Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} nom de plume of Francis Iles, {{reviewed}} the novel in the 6 December 1957 issue of The Guardian, {{in which he}} confessed to being disappointed with the work: [...] "I have only pity for those poor souls who cannot enjoy the sprightly stories of Agatha Christie; but though sprightliness is {{not the least of}} this remarkable writer's qualities, there is another that we look for in her, and that is detection: genuine, steady, logical detection, taking us step by step nearer {{to the heart of the}} mystery. Unfortunately it is that quality that is missing in 4.50 from Paddington. The police never <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out a single thing, and even Miss Marples (sic) lies low and says nuffin' to the point until the final dramatic exposure. There is the usual small gallery of interesting and perfectly credible characters and nothing could be easier to read. But please, Mrs Christie, a little more of that incomparable detection next time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Need You" [...] was filmed on 13 September 2009. It was {{produced}} by Luti Fagbenle who has produced music videos {{for the likes of}} Craig David and Mr Hudson. The video was directed by American director Dale [...] "Rage" [...] Resteghini and edited by John Holloway. The official music video premiered on 4music on 20 September 2009. Rage also directed the group's music video for previous single [...] "Wouldn't You". The music video begins with the [...] "N-Dubz" [...] logo appearing onscreen. The group is then shown arriving at the (Battersea) London Heliport in an atmosphere of stormy weather. Dappy arrives in a personalized helicopter also with the N-Dubz logo on, Fazer arrives on a 2004 Yamaha R1 with race fairings, and Tulisa arrives in a white Lamborghini Gallardo SE. The three members then come together as a group and start performing the song at the Heliport in front of the modes of the transport they came in. This scene is continuously in a call-and-response with the scene in the nightclub. In this Dappy wears a black hoodie underneath a white Adidas pullover and black sunglasses. Tulisa sports a new hairstyle from previous music videos, with straight hair and a fringe which is tied up in this scene. She is wearing tight black pants and a blue sweater over a white shirt. Fazer is seen wearing a black leather jacket lined in white on the bottom ends, black sunglasses and a black beanie. The group are then arrive together at the Vendome nightclub in Mayfair London and cuts back to the roof throughout the video. In this scene Dappy is seen wearing his characteristic headpiece, coloured in red for the video to contrast with its black-red colour theme, he wears a red hoodie that is striped with black lines. Tulisa is seen wearing a 'LBD' and 'bang bang shoes,' with her hair untied and made-up with red lipstick. Fazer has a red hoodie on with a matching red cap. [...] Each member is seen singing to a partner in the club, where when they leave to go somewhere and come back their partner disappears. Dappy's scene takes place on a red sofa, Tulisa's in a secluded white room and Fazer's on the dancefloor. After the group members' partners left them, they can all be seen sitting on a sofa in the dancefloor area of the nightclub singing. In one scene Dappy can be seen accessing Facebook to find his missing partner - contrasting with the song's lyric 'I've been searching all over Facebook but I can't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> you'. Tulisa in another scene can be seen taking a picture of herself and her partner with a mobile phone. Prominent flashing lights and neons are visible throughout the video, of which take on a red colour in the nightclub and a white colour on the rooftop and at the Heliport. The music video ends with the members walking away from the camera which then cuts to a view of city lights.|$|E
