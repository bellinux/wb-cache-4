His contributions to the literature on this subject numbered nearly 100, including 20 dealing with penicillins. He confirmed that pneumococcal meningitis was the classical disease for producing deafness. He was asked whether he had ever come across any information which would suggest that an overdose of intrathecal penicillin causes or could cause deafness. He said he had <b>searched</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature,</b> he had computer scans done by three different processes, he had watched for years and in his experience there was no single recorded case of deafness from such an overdose.He was asked in terms by the Lord Ordinary whether, as a bacteriologist, he was saying there was any reason why an overdose of penicillin injected intrathecally could not cause deafness. His reply was: ...|$|E

I'm not into religion, I'm into a relationship with him. Several years ago I was in a Seattle airport washroom during an earthquake (what a place to die!).

But the earthquake shook me hard. (As the place shook, the guy in the stall next to me yelled, 'Did I do that?') Back on the plane, I wrote down my definition of success on an airline napkin: 'I will consider myself a success when I'm walking close to Jesus every day, when I'm building a strong marriage and performing meaningful work. I'll consider myself a success when I'm making others homesick for heaven.' That's my life mission and I can't believe how much fun I'm having following it." ...|$|E

40|$|Background. As {{a result}} of changes in {{information}} technology and {{the rapid growth of}} publications methods of <b>searching</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> have changed.

It is not known whether researchers in general practice search systematically, and whether they have incorporated computerized sources in their research practice. Objectives and methods. We aimed to assess <b>the</b> methods of <b>literature</b> research used by GPs. We interviewed eight GP researchers, two information specialists and a psychologist working in primary health care organizations. Results. The GP researchers began their search in their private book collections, or asked colleagues for information. Later in <b>the</b> <b>search</b> process, they used computerized information sources. Medline on CD-ROM and the computer-based indexes of two Dutch journals were most widely used. The GPs found it difficult to locate the appropriate terms to describe their research questions. Knowledge of <b>the</b> methodology of <b>literature</b> research, and skills required to use the information sources efficiently were lacking. There was a need for instruction and training in the use of information sources. GPs need a telephone help desk where their questions can be answered adequately. Conclusions. GP researchers <b>search</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> unsystematically. Although computerized databases were being used, knowledge and skills related to the use of these information sources must be improved...|$|R
