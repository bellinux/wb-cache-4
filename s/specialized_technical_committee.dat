40|$|The ACM Multimedia Systems conference {{provides}} {{a forum for}} researchers, engineers, and scientist to present and share their latest research findings in multimedia systems. While research about specific aspects of multimedia systems is regularly published in the various proceedings and transactions of the networking, operating system, real-time system, and database communities, MMSys aims to cut across these domains {{in the context of}} multimedia data types. This {{provides a}} unique opportunity to view the intersections and interplay of the various approaches and solutions developed across these domains to deal with multimedia data types. Furthermore, MMSys provides an avenue for communicating research that addresses multimedia systems holistically. Embedded within this year's technical program is a special session on Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). The papers within the special session were chosen from submissions to a separate Call For Papers and selected by a more <b>specialized</b> <b>technical</b> program <b>committee.</b> Hosted By Cisco This year the conference will be hosted by Cisco. The MMSys organizing committee gratefully acknowledges this generous show of support for this research community and welcomes the participation of all industry researchers...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{proposes a}} methodology {{to devise a}} taxonomy that can enable researchers to identify specialised <b>Technical</b> <b>Committees</b> according to their research interests. The paper elaborates on two general issues to devise such as taxonomy.
