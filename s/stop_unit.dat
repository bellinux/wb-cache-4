Sprinters reach with some weight relief {{temporarily}} speeds of up to 45 km/h must therefore run on a large deck of up to 300 cm in length and have up to 100 cm width. At high physical exertion and increased risk of falling a fall <b>stop</b> <b>unit</b> is required to prevent a fall of the subjects or patients. This fall stop device is usually implemented by a safety arch on which a rope is attached to an electrical switch. A harness bears the subject preventing from falling and shuts down the running belt.|$|E
40|$|The {{interactive}} race {{model of}} saccadic countermanding assumes that response inhibition results from {{an interaction between}} a go unit, identified with gaze-shifting neurons, and a <b>stop</b> <b>unit,</b> identified with gaze-holding neurons, in which activation of the <b>stop</b> <b>unit</b> inhibits the growth of activation in the go unit {{to prevent it from}} reaching threshold. The interactive race model accounts for behavioral data and predicts physiological data in monkeys performing the stop-signal task. We propose an alternative model that assumes that response inhibition results from blocking the input to the go unit. We show that the blocked-input model accounts for behavioral data as accurately as the original interactive race model and predicts aspects of the physiological data more accurately. We extend the models to address the steady-state fixation period before the go stimulus is presented and find that the blocked-input model fits better than the interactive race model. We consider a model in which fixation activity is boosted when a stop signal occurs and find that it fits as well as the blocked input model but predicts very high steady-state fixation activity after the response is inhibited. We discuss the alternative linking proposi-tions that connect computational models to neural mechanisms, the lessons to be learned from model mimicry, and generalization from countermanding saccades to countermanding other kinds of responses...|$|E

Structural instructions translated during the crystallization process to generate semi-crystalline morphology were encoded.

40|$|Bus Stops {{for school}} busses {{incorporate}} a special risk to school children. Most accidents {{on the way}} to school occur at or close to the school bus stops. Modern ITS telecommunication technology can be applied to make bus stops safer and inform car drivers about dangerous bus stops on their route. In order to raise the acceptance of speed limits at bus stops it can help to reliably inform the drivers if there are actually children close to the bus stop. When no children are using the bus stop the traffic can circulate without special precautions. Modern ITST technology can be used to detect the presence of school children. In a European funded project within FP 7 framework the Amparo Solutions tagbased technology is used to detect nearby children who carry a radio transmitter. A bus <b>stop</b> <b>unit</b> receives this information and can activate special warnings to the surrounding traffic. In the current paper an empirical experimental study is described where 3 warning conditions have been compared in a driving simulator: a school bus stop sign, a school bus stop sign with flashing lights on top of it and a school bus stop sign in combination with an invehicle information design. The experimental design allows comparison of driver behavior at bus stops with and without children under the three different warning conditions. Dependent variables are: speed, lateral distance, reaction time to a child jumping on the street and the number of collisions. Overall 60 drivers participate to the driving simulator study. This number allows statistical evidence on the safety effects of different bus stop warnings. Results show that the two warning strategies are highly effective in terms of speed reduction in comparison to not providing any special warning about the children. The comparison of the two warning strategies (road sign with lightning and in-vehicle information) show no significant differences in driver behavior and very small effect sizes. In conclusion either system can be applied to reduce the speed when passing by bus stops with children, the number of collisions however could not be reduced significantly in this study...|$|E

40|$|Our first {{aim was to}} {{characterize}} spontaneous motor unit activity in thenar muscles influenced by chronic cervical spinal cord injury. Thenar surface electromyography (EMG), intramuscular EMG, and abduction and flexion forces were recorded. Subjects were instructed to relax for 2 min. Units still firing after 10 s were considered spontaneously active. Two distinct patterns of spontaneous unit activity were recorded. Units either fired tonically at a mean frequency of 6. 1 Hz or were active sporadically (2. 2 Hz), Stimuli (e. g., light touch of nearby skin) were then used to influence tonic spontaneous unit activity. Most stimuli produced a change in firing frequency, usually a temporary increase, but sometimes unit frequency decreased or new activity was initiated. Inputs to these motoneurons clearly make important contributions to changes in unit activity. However, the difficulty that subjects had in <b>stopping</b> <b>unit</b> activity, and the initiation of activity when subjects relaxed, suggest {{that the source of}} spontaneity may be the motoneuron itself.
