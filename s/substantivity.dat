40|$|N the 1980 s vat dyes, bearing {{about 60}} 1 C. I. Names (I), were {{available}} in the U. S. under about 260 different trade names. This collection of dyes has not changed much in recent years. About 60 % of them have C. I. Numbers-i. e., ihe chemical structure of the principle color component is known; 85 % are derivatives of anthraquinone, and of these almost 50 % fall into only five chemical structure subgroups; indigo derivatives and the related thioindigo derivatives account for about 10 % of the list. As a class, vat dyes are expensive, although they share this characteristic with some fiber reactive dyes. One shouid not overlook the 10 % of so-called sulfurized vat dyes, which are more economical hybrids of sulfur and vat dyes. The practical details of using vat dyes in both batch and continuous processes are covered in this second and final part of Chapter 3. Vat dyes generally offer superior fastness properties. Potential drawbacks to selecting vat dyes include a tendency for phototendering and a limited color gamut. Based on the <b>substantivities</b> of leuco-vat anions, the traditional classification system for vat dyes offers batch dyers a better means for selecting vat dyes to be used successfully in combination. Leuco-vat dyeing, prepigmentation, semipigmentation and batch aftertreatments are covered. While continuous dyeing with vats offers economic advantages, several precautions are required to ensure a satisfactory result.

The aim of this thesis was to investigate the salivary interactions between two antiplaque agents and saliva and microorganisms at defined solid/liquid and air liquid interfaces. The plaque control agents used in this study were delmopinol and chlorhexidine in varying concentrations. Sample of polled whole saliva collected from 16 subjects were used for adsorption experiments to solid surfaces. Whole saliva from one individual was used to study the adsorption of chemical agents to bacterial cell walls. Whole saliva samples from five subjects were used to study the binding or precipitation of salivary components by the antiplaque agents in solution. The interactions between the chemical antiplaque agents and the salivary components were investigated with ellipsometry, tensitometry, electrophoresis, video-densitometry, electrobloting, and radiolabeling. The results indicate that chlorhexidine is a surface active compound that has the capability to adsorb onto bare solid surfaces of well-defined chemical characteristics and onto surfaces preconditioned with salivary films. Chlorhexidine and delmopinol were shown to have binding sites for salivary proteins and to induce precipitation of salivary proteins. Delmopinol appears to precipitate more high molecular weight salivary proteins than chlorhexidine. It was also demonstrated that the composition of saliva as well as the concentration of chlorhexidine or delmopinol play a role in the amount of salivary proteins precipitated. In addition, chlorhexidine and delmopinol were round to bind to the salivary films coating the tested bacteria. The <b>substantivities</b> of both agents are related to their binding capabilities to salivary proteins. Thus, interactions between chemical agents and salivary components influence the availability of salivary components to the biofilms...|$|R

It is well known by perfumers that citrus and green notes are perceived as fresh {{and they tend to}} evaporate quickly, while odors most dissimilar to &# 8216;fresh&# 8217; (e. g., oriental, powdery, erogenic and animalic scents) are tenacious. However, studies aimed at quantifying the relationship between fresh odor quality and <b>substantivity</b> have not received much attention. In this work, perceptual olfactory ratings on a fresh scale, estimated in a previous study, were compared with <b>substantivity</b> parameters and antierogenic ratings from the literature. It was found that the correlation between fresh odor character and odorant <b>substantivity</b> is quite strong (r = &# 8722; 0. 85). &# 8216;Fresh&# 8217; is sometimes interpreted in perfumery as &# 8216;cool&# 8217; and the opposite of &# 8216;warm&# 8217;.

Assuming that odor perception space was shaped throughout evolution in temperate climates, results reported here are consistent with the hypothesis that &# 8216;fresh&# 8217; evokes scents typically encountered in the cool season, while &# 8216;warm&# 8217; would be evoked by odors found in nature during summer.

40|$|This article aims to expound {{the ontological}} theory of Xavier Zubiri {{in order to}} come up with a «theory of substantivity» capable of {{incorporating}} the classical theory of substance. An even more fundamental difference than classical theory’s distinction between substance and accidents is the distinction between whole and parts: the independent or autonomous parts that structure the real are not principally «substances» but «substantivities» or wholes. But defending a theory of <b>substantivity</b> does not presuppose rejecting the theory of substance. In the theory of <b>substantivity,</b> substance continues to play an important ontological role for two reasons. First, because we cannot descriptively do away with the substance-accident relation: a <b>substantivity</b> has to be considered a substance (not in the strictsense) insofar as it supports accidents and the same is true with the «independent parts», since their independence is precisely the expression of their substantiality. Second, we cannot give up the theory of substance because we have to admit at least the existence of a substance in the strict sense, of a simple substance (simplicity in the strict sense), which is the «I» as pure subject (the «soul» of classical theory).

CHX concentration in eluates was spectrophotometrically analyzed at 260 nm. Results. Significant amounts of CHX remained retained in dentin substrates (MD, PPD or TDD), independent on the CHX-applied dose or time of incubation (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{selected}} disperse dyes and bis- 3 -carboxypyridinium-striazine reactive dyes {{have been widely}} promoted for the exhaust dyeing of polyester/cotton blends in a one-bath-one-stage ('All-in') process under neutral conditions. However, despite the time and energy savings afforded by this elegant dyeing process, there is {{a belief in the}} dyeing industry that economical production is limited to pale and medium depths of shade. The two dye classes (disperse dyes on polyester and bis- 3 -carboxypyridinium-striazine reactive dyes on cotton) were investigated to understand why heavy depths of shade could not readily be obtained, economically, using this process. The bis- 3 carboxypyridinium- s-triazine reactive dyes were responsible for the inability to achieve heavy depths of shade, economically, when dyeing at 130 Ã‚Â°C and neutral pH. The poor colour yield of the dyes was due to their low exhaustion level and low fixation efficiency at 130 Ã‚Â°C and pH 7. 0 - 7. 5, particularly when compared with the parent bis-monochlorotriazine dyes, fixed under alkaline conditions at 80 Ã‚Â°C. The synthesis and evaluation of some bis- 3 -carboxypyridinium-s-triazine reactive dye structures, possessing highly substantive chromophores, were investigated as a mecm of obtaining high colour yield, on 100 % unmercersised cotton, at 130 Ã‚Â°C and pH 7. 0 - 7. 5. When a highly substantive bis- 3 -carboxypyridinium-s-triazine dye chromophore was incorporated into the reactive dye structures, heavy depths of shade could be readiiy obtained when dyeing at 130 Ã‚Â°C and neutral pH, using conventional salt concentrations. However, the wet fastness properties of the dye were poor, due to the slow removal of the hydrolysed dye and its propensity for back-staining adjacent white areas. If the high <b>substantivity</b> of a dye could be assigned to the reactive group, which is removed during the fixation of the dye, {{it may be possible to}} offer both acceptably high levels of build-up (and costeffectiveness) and wet fastness. The synthesis and evaluation of novel reactive dye structures, possessing substantivity-conveying reactive groups, when applied to cotton at 130 Ã‚Â°C and pH 7. 0 - 7. 5, were investigated. When a substantivity-conveying reactive group was incorporated into a reactive dye structure, as a replacement for a chlorine atom, the dye exhibited a higher <b>substantivity</b> than the parent monochlorotriazine dye. The use of amide derivatives of nicotinic acid as the reactive group in a s-triazinyl reactive dye resulted in an increase in the <b>substantivity,</b> compared with the parent 3 carboxypyridinium- s-triazinyl dye. When two substantivity-conveying reactive groups were incorporated into a dye molecule, without changing the reactivity of the dye, the above effect is enhanced, resulting in higher colour yield than from the corresponding Kayacelon React dye. Since the substantivity-conveying reactive group is removed during the fixation of the dye, the high <b>substantivity</b> of the parent dye should not be an impediment to achieving good wet-fastness properties, without the need to use excessively long wash-off sequences.

The specimens were di-vided into five groups as follows: Tetraclean; 5. 25 % NaOCl/Tetraclean; 5. 25 % NaOCl/ascorbic acid/Tetraclean; infected dentin tubes (positive control); and ste-rile dentin tubes (negative control). At experimental times of 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days, dentin chips were removed from the canals by sequential sterile low-spee...|$|E
40|$|The syntheses and {{properties}} of several azo dyes, prepared by coupling selected diazonium salts with N-(γ-ketobutyl) -and N-ethyl-(γ-ketobuty) aniline, have been described. In {{an examination of}} the dyeing properties and colour fastness of these azo dyes, it has been observed that all of the dyes have a very good <b>substantivity</b> for cellulose acetate, good for nylon and fairly good for vinylon. Their fastness to washing was very good, but their light fastness varied moderate to good. Most of the dyes have given the very bright shades on cellulose acetate, moderate shades on vinylon and somewhat dull shades on nylon...|$|E
