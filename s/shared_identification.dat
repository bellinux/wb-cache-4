However, {{little is known about}} the impact of the shared nature of crowd identification on different stages of adolescent drinking behavior, or the way crowd identification interacts with participation in school-sponsored sports activities. This study examines drinking influences from (1) peers with shared crowd identities, and (2) peers who jointly participate in organized sports at their school (activity members). This study introduces a new network analytic approach that can disentangle the effects of crowd identification and sports participation on individual behavior. Using survey data from adolescents in five high schools in a predominantly Hispanic/Latino district (N = 1, 707), this paper examines the association between social influences and each stage of drinking behavior (intention to drink, lifetime, past-month, and binge drinking) by conducting an ordinal regression analysis.

40|$|Mangrove {{systems are}} one of the most complex and {{productive}} ecosystems on Earth, providing crucial livelihood support to coastal communities in developing countries. However, mangrove systems are being degraded and lost at an alarming rate globally. In Vietnam, the principal threat to mangrove systems is their conversion to aquaculture. Historically, mangrove system dependent communities (MSDC) have responded to change through their livelihoods and social networks, using social capital to self-organise and access crucial livelihood resources. However, little is known about the impact of different degrees of aquaculture on MSDC livelihoods and social networks, and what this means for the resilience of these communities and their ability to self-organise in response to change. Using a quantitative approach based on empirical household survey data, we assess the association between aquaculture and the livelihoods and social networks of three coastal communities of northern Vietnam. Results indicate that greater degrees of aquaculture are associated with: greater income inequality and lower livelihood diversity; and larger and less dense social networks. The increased influence of market-based relations associated with greater degrees of aquaculture has implications for resilience through the socio-economic differentiation and fragmentation of MSDC networks, which reduces social capital and the ability to self-organise in response to change. A diversity of network ties is required in order to connect various groups within MSDC. This can enable <b>shared</b> <b>identification</b> and understanding of the issues facing mangrove systems in order to facilitate self-organisation, and foster the resilience necessary for the sustainable governance of mangrove systems...|$|E
40|$|This book arose as a {{consequence}} of a brainstorm with colleagues at a higher education institution where we discussed what the personality of the profession of teacher education might look like. We used this <b>shared</b> <b>identification</b> of the construction and personality of the teacher education profession to identify chapters that we thought might be of use to early career teacher educators (ECTE). These are people making the transition from their successful professional practice to the teacher education arena. Thus the book is aimed at people who are early career teacher educators. While most might be within an academic institution there are growing numbers of mentors in school-based programmes of teacher education. Regardless of where you sit on this spectrum of teacher education provision, we believe that anyone apprenticing future teachers needs to have an understanding of the similarities and differences between their original status and their status as a teacher educator. An expert classroom teacher does not necessarily result in an efficient or effective teacher educator or mentor. However, if we can develop and support informed professionals such educators could make a difference to the learning experiences of students in education programmes. The intention of this book was to provide a means to encourage those new to the teacher education profession to consider the signature pedagogy of teacher education by considering aspects of pedagogy, subject, reflection, ethics, working with others, and quality assurance. In essence, if you were a new teacher educator, what would be useful to know in order to develop an identity as a knowledgeable skilled teacher educator...|$|E

40|$|Recognized {{public health}} {{relevant}} risk {{factors such as}} obesity, physical inactivity, smoking or air pollution are common to many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs cluster and co-morbidities increase in parallel to age. Pleiotropic genes and genetic variants have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) linking NCD entities hitherto thought to be distant in etiology. These different lines of evidence suggest that NCD disease mechanisms are in part <b>shared.</b> <b>Identification</b> of common exogenous and endogenous risk patterns may promote efficient prevention, an urgent need {{in the light of}} the global NCD epidemic. The prerequisite to investigate causal risk patterns including biologic, genetic and environmental factors across different NCDs are well characterized cohorts with associated biobanks. Prospectively collected data and biospecimen from subjects of various age, sociodemographic, and cultural groups, both healthy and affected by one or more NCD, are essential for exploring biologic mechanisms and susceptibilities interlinking different environmental and lifestyle exposures, co-morbidities, as well as cellular senescence and aging. A paradigm shift in the research activities can currently be observed, moving from focused investigations on the effect of a single risk factor on an isolated health outcome to a more comprehensive assessment of risk patterns and a broader phenome approach. Though important methodological and analytical challenges need to be resolved, the ongoing international efforts to establish large-scale population-based biobank cohorts are a critical basis for moving NCD disease etiology forward. Future epidemiologic and public health research should aim at sustaining a comprehensive systems view on health and disease. The political and public discussions about the utilitarian aspect of investing in and contributing to cohort and biobank research are essential and are indirectly linked to the achievement of public health programs effectively addressing the global NCD epidemic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{services}} provided by health and social care organisations for older people living at home rely on interprofessional working (IPW). Although there is research investigating what supports and inhibits how professionals work together, less is known about how different service models deliver care to older people and how effectiveness is measured. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe how IPW for older people living at home is delivered, enacted and evaluated in England. Method An online survey of health and social care managers across England directly involved in providing services to older people, and a review of local strategies for older people services produced by primary care organisations and local government adult services organisations in England. Results The online survey achieved a 31 % response rate and search strategies identified 50 local strategies that addressed IPW for older people living at home across health and social care organisations. IPW definitions varied, but there was an internal consistency of language informed by budgeting and organisation specific definitions of IPW. Community Services for Older People, Intermediate Care and Re-enablement (rehabilitation) Teams were the services most frequently identified as involving IPW. Other IPW services identified were problem or disease specific and reflected issues highlighted in local strategies. There was limited agreement about what interventions or strategies supported the process of IPW. Older people and their carers were not reported to be involved in the evaluation of the services they received and it was unclear how organisations and managers judged the effectiveness of IPW, particularly for services that had an open-ended commitment to the care of older people. Conclusion Health and social care organisations and their managers recognise the value and importance of IPW. There is a theoretical literature on what supports IPW and what it can achieve. The need for precision may not be so necessary for the terms used to describe IPW. However, there is a need for <b>shared</b> <b>identification</b> of both user/patient outcomes that arise from IPW and greater understanding of what kind of model of IPW achieves what kind of outcomes for older people living at home</p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{dynamics}} of sociality and local identity on Warraber Island in the Torres Strait. I argue that Warraber residents' representation {{of themselves as}} a distinctive collectivity needs to {{be understood in terms}} of indigenous conceptions of relatedness and difference and with reference to local moral terms of communal life, in particular a valorised striving towards the idealised vision of moral relations known as gud pasin. This value is informed by a dense network of cognatic connections existing among Warraber residents – encapsulated in the local discourse of “ol wan pamle” (all one family), in addition to <b>shared</b> <b>identification</b> as a Christian community. Warraberans envision the past through ideas of temporal rupture, indexed to the arrival of Christianity in the region and linked to the positive transformation of Warraber life. This forms a reference point in local thinking about ancestors. Warraberans depict their ancestors as both 'natives' and 'foreigners' linked respectively to the pre-Christian period and the marine industries of the post-missionised colonial era. These temporal associations, and their implicit moral inscriptions, generate poignant areas of ambiguity concerning personal ancestry, and also prominent pre-Christian sites and dance performances thought to be associated with head-taking and sorcery. The image of the sorcerer is itself contentious, appearing partly as a moral Other, and partly as a source of local power. Such {{dynamics of}} difference appear as integral to contemporary social life on Warraber. Differing Christian affiliations, ancestral emphasis and perspectives on the past certainly contain potential for contestation. Productive activities are markedly gendered and family networks involve strong personalised loyalties that compete with broader social obligations. However, the value of gud pasin is shown as ultimately valorising inclusiveness, generosity and a concern with community harmony. Moreover residence on Warraber Island emerges as an important context for common experiences that help distinguish the population as a distinctive, emplaced community within the diversity of Torres Strait populations. Intense attachments to Warraber Island are communicated in local notions of 'belonging' to place. This is characterised by knowledge and familiarity and also by birth and residence. In this context, the marine realm continues to be a central component within Warraber collective identification and notions of local distinctiveness. Warraberans represent themselves both in historical and contemporary terms as incomparable marine workers, hunters and fishers. Transactions in marine products, whether related to generating income or for consumption, continue to be a focus of Warraber life and are inextricably woven into the practice of familial relations, whereby marine resources are transformed by human activity into a ‘currency’ of relatedness shaped by moral understandings that inflect the landscape as much as the conduct of sociality...|$|E

We explored the possible influence of the models offered by television (TV) on adolescents’ body image, body uneasiness, eating-disordered behavior, depression, and anxiety. Methods: Three hundred and one adolescents (aged 14 - 19) from southern Italy participated. They completed a questionnaire on media exposure and body dissatisfaction, the Eating Disorder Inventory- 2, the Body Uneasiness Test, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – Form Y. Results: The main factors contributing to females’ eating-disordered behaviors were their own desires to be similar to TV characters, the amount of reality and entertainment TV they watched, and the discrepancy between their perceptions of their bodies and those of TV characters. Friends’ desire to be similar to TV characters contributed most to depression, anxiety, body uneasiness, and eating disorders for both males and females.
