5|$|Natascha McElhone as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia {{was hired}} to play a {{background}} extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but {{was thrown out of}} the show before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so. She then becomes a protester against The Truman Show, urging Christof to release its lead.|$|E
5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> – which in reality {{was far more}} than the vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
60|$|Patty {{went downstairs}} and {{stood for a}} moment in the hall, rapt in reflection. If she had been at home, she verily {{believed}} she would have sat down and cried. Oh, it was too bad, too disappointing! Clifford would certainly lose all chance of the permanency, even if the irate news editor did not discharge him at once. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> anything? She must do something.|$|R

25|$|Suddenly, {{it was her}} {{regime that}} was in trouble. She could not {{comprehend}} how Nwe's small band of men could have defeated the Pegu army. But she also realized from the open bickering between Zeik-Bye and Maru {{that she was in}} no position to organize another attack. She ordered an immediate upgrade of Pegu's moats and fortified walls. Zeik-Bye meanwhile kept Nwe apprised of the developments. By then, her authority was too weak. When Nwe and his small army appeared outside Pegu's walls on 10 December 1383, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing other than hunker down inside the city walls.|$|E
25|$|Severin was Marvel's head colorist until 1972, as {{which point}} she turned {{most of her}} {{coloring}} duties over to George Roussos so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more penciling assignments. She continued to expand from colorist to do penciling and inking, and occasionally also lettering, on various titles. She drew stories of the Sub-Mariner and the Hulk, and the covers or interiors of titles including Iron Man, Conan the Barbarian, Kull the Conqueror, The Cat, and Daredevil. Additionally, she worked on Marvel's satiric humor magazine Crazy, {{as well as the}} company's self-lampooning comic book, Not Brand Echh.|$|E
25|$|The 1552 book, however, {{was used}} only for a short period, as Edward VI {{had died in the}} summer of 1553 and, as soon as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, Mary I, {{restored}} union with Rome. The Latin Mass was re-established, altars, roods and statues were reinstated; an attempt was made to restore the English Church to its Roman affiliation. Cranmer was punished for his work in the English Reformation by being burned at the stake on 21 March 1556. Nevertheless, the 1552 book was to survive. After Mary's death in 1558, it became the primary source for the Elizabethan Book of Common Prayer, with subtle if significant changes only.|$|E

But though a kind person in the main, Mary replied that she gave away enough to beggars in her own street (which was true enough) without looking after the whole neighborhood.|$|R
25|$|Back home, Selena learns {{from her}} father that Yolanda has been {{stealing}} money from the fan club. On March 9, 1995, Selena and her father, along with Suzette, confront Yolanda about the missing funds at a meeting. Yolanda denies this and says she would never take anything from Selena. Selena, angry and hurt by the betrayal, asks Yolanda how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this to her, and to her fans. Yolanda pleads for time to return the boutique's financial records and claims she can prove that she has done nothing wrong. Selena and Chris discuss the prospect of starting their family when the crossover tour is finished. The future seems bright with promise.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Stephen Kay, {{who had worked}} for the {{prosecution}} in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said she was sure <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.|$|E
25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that, and not sure what to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E

Mercy also, as well as <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>did</b> what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to shift them. Christiana again said to them, [...] "Stand back, and be gone; for we have no money to lose, being pilgrims, as you see, and such, too, as live upon the charity of our friends." ...|$|R

25|$|Jean Grey {{appears as}} a central {{character}} in the animated TV series , voiced by Venus Terzo. She is a popular soccer player and also teaches and trains the mutant students of Xavier Institute. Jean is also a popular athlete of Bayville. She wears a black costume with green accent. Since she is a telepath, she's the one who operates Cerebro aside from Professor Xavier. When humans {{found out about the}} existence of mutants, Jean was accused of using her physic/psionic abilities for things that she successfully accomplished without using her powers, such as playing basketball in school. At one point, Jean lost control of her powers which caused her to be uncontrollably read people's minds telepathically. The X-Men were having a hard time trying to help her, but luckily Rogue was present and used her own powers to drain enough of Jean's energy for Scott to prompt her to focus on Scott. Jean appears to have a fear of clowns, to which Mesmero uses this to take control of her mind, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the villain's bidding.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the three}} Pisa-class armored cruisers were {{originally}} built for the Regia Marina. The third ship was built on speculation and was sold to Greece and completed as Georgios Averof, named after a wealthy Greek businessman who had left a sizeable legacy for the increase of the Greek Navy in his will. The ship participated in the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V of the United Kingdom in 1911 shortly after commissioning. She served in the Balkan Wars and {{was instrumental in the}} Greek victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Battles of Elli and Lemnos during the First Balkan War. During World War I, Georgios Averof did not see much active service, as Greece was neutral during {{the first years of the}} war. After the Noemvriana riots of 1916, she was seized by the French to ensure that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing against the Entente. After the war's end, the ship participated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22 and helped in the evacuation of the refugees after the Greek Army's defeat. In 1925–27 Georgios Averof was reconstructed in France and rearmed.|$|E

500|$|During the {{recording}} for Butterfly, Carey {{was in the}} midst of her separation from then husband, Tommy Mottola. While writing the material for the album, she wrote a house music record titled [...] "Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)" [...] with David Morales. When the song was finished, Carey felt there was something more <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with the song; the lyrics were very personal and a perfect fit for a ballad. After contemplating on the matter, Carey re-wrote [...] "Fly Away" [...] in ballad form, and incorporated new lyrics and vocals.|$|E

500|$|After Robert Cardus's {{death in}} 1900 {{the family moved}} several times, {{eventually}} breaking up altogether. Cardus left school in 1901 and took a variety of short-term, unskilled jobs before finding more secure employment as a clerk with Flemings' marine insurance agency. He lived for a time with his Aunt Beatrice with whom, according to Brookes, he had {{at an early age}} [...] "embarked on a lifelong love affair... In his eyes <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> no wrong". A flamboyant character, Beatrice brought colour into Cardus's life; she encouraged him to read worthwhile books and her memory, Brookes asserts, [...] "remained a potent inspirational force" [...] throughout his later life as a writer. She also bought him his first cricket bat.|$|E
500|$|Boris and Minka first {{appeared}} in the series' first episode, [...] "Tommy's First Birthday". Melanie Chartoff, voice of Minka and Jewish herself, had already been cast to play Didi when she was called by her agent to try out for a second voice role on the series as Minka. When given the description of the character, Chartoff felt she was incredibly cliched, but still wanted to try out for the role. When reading her lines, she found it difficult to grasp the character's personality, as [...] "Although the show had been created by Jews, this script had clearly not been written by them;" [...] so she took a break so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> research into her family memorabilia and conceive a personality to reflect in the character's voice.|$|E
