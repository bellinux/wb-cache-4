5000|$|The <b>solidarity</b> <b>economy</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} part of the social economy, forming what might be termed the [...] "social and solidarity economy" [...] (from the French [...] ""). The concepts are still under development and {{the difference between the two}} terms is gradually being clarified. An organization seeing itself as part of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>economy</b> generally goes beyond achieving purely social aims: it aims to put right an injustice by expressing solidarity.

40|$|Scholarly {{approaches}} to the Greek crisis usually centered on its political character, tackle it as “a state of exception” or emphasize its “exceptional” features. Departing from a discussion {{on the nature of}} the crisis, in this article I examine social reactions to “it,” focusing on grassroots economic activity. I undertake a case study of a “solidarity economy” movement and from there I explore the wider political repercussions of this activity that has appeared in contemporary Greece where grassroots social welfare projects are organized in order to address hardships in the actors’ livelihoods. In this way, I explore the meaning of solidarity, a term that has become ubiquitous in the public discourse of contemporary Greece. Through an ethnographic study of the activities of a movement that organizes anti-middleman food distributions in Greece, I argue that such activities not only tackle the immediate effects of the crisis but also pose a conscious, wider critique to austerity politics. Activists’ appeal to <b>solidarity</b> <b>economies</b> is informed by their aim to formulate more efficient distribution cooperatives in the future. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|More {{than twenty}} years after the World Trade Organization was created, there is deep scepticism about the {{promises}} of global trade agreements. Protest and disillusionment against such agreements originate in a denial of the desire that economy obey democracy, not vice-versa. The same desire gives origin {{to the search for}} concrete alternatives that might bring us beyond protest and disillusionment. For some, one of these alternatives is represented by <b>solidarity</b> <b>economies.</b> From an anthropological perspective, it is useful to define 'solidarity economy' both as an object and a form of inquiry. The reason for this is twofold. On the one hand, we are dealing with empirical phenomena whose actors explicitly choose to identify through the term. On the other, the term {{can be traced back to}} a theoretical approach that sees economy as comprising all the 'substantive' values and practices through which human societies organize themselves to provide for their material and social reproduction, instead of only formal rationality and price-making markets. This brief essay discusses both dimensions. The essay is not intended as a full research article, but as a contribution to public debate through the 'light' application of anthropological concepts to current trends, in the vein of publications such as Anthropology Today...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ The paper raises {{questions}} about how the economic crisis is being played out ‘in place’ taking an embodied, generational and gender perspective. We place in a political context – examining how global realities are experienced in place and argue {{that we need to}} look at the every day realities of the crisis from a gendered and generational perspective in order to counter grand narratives of gloom and doom where women (whether old, young, migrant, heterosexual or otherwise) are particular victims. We seek to show how by contextualizing the gendered and generational realities of the crisis in southern Europe can we change the narrative of overwhelming paralyzing crisis to one of potential transformation. We focus on the rise of resistance, <b>solidarity</b> <b>economies</b> and new types of communities in the search for alternatives to neoliberal capitalism by women and youth in southern Europe. We look at how people are organizing differently as a result of the crises, creating news forms of political economic and social relations. Dominant narratives tend to exclude the stories of the unprivileged in such reshapings of political, economic and social relations, this paper is the beginnings of bringing the experience and understandings of women and youth in southern Europe to the centre of the analysis of the economic crisis in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Future {{professionals}} in fields, {{which are in}} increasing demand on the labour market, need “Learning in Depth”. Such approach ensures that every student becomes familiar with specific EU issues they may choose to specialize on. It can be achieved via employing different teaching methodologies and technics. Developing in-depths learning materials, including hand-outs, power point presentations, tutorials materials, video-lectures, open on-line courses {{are part of this}} approach. Instead of traditional face-to-face lecturing, it implements lectures with open discussions and game simulations, targeting in particular cross-cultural peculiarities for sustainable development fostering based on achievements of Industry 3. 0 and Industry 4. 0. Much of the attention would be paid for the debates as a part of learning by doing methodology. The basic here is the Karl Popper format of debates. Its extended format with Government and Opposition as two confronting parties is preferable, modelled by debates with NGOs participation, local government, business, developers, and active citizens. The other type of team-work projects are round tables discussions, during which global scale issues will be simulated, where each student would need to become an expert for solving critical issues. There would be specific tasks of modelling production/consumption nets, including those achieved by social and <b>solidarity</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R
40|$|The 2005 {{election}} of Evo Morales {{as the president}} of Bolivia marked a moment of celebration for the social movements who backed the rise to power of the Movimiento al Socialismo party (MAS – Movement for Socialism), with Morales as its leader. Morales adopted discourses derived from popularly supported Buen Vivir, alternatives to development, social and <b>solidarity</b> <b>economies,</b> and other forms of localized political and economic autonomy, creating a politics of possibility around such proposals. However, despite initial commitments and actions taken by Morales to improve well-being without replicating historically unsustainable and destructive pathways to industrial development, Bolivia continues to be characterized by fiscal dependence and macroeconomic prioritization of growth-centric policies sustained by extractive activities. In addition, the country is now rife with socio-environmental conflict. This paper will explore Morales’ neglect of longer-term political goals for economic independence, self-sufficiency, and sustainability by considering competing theories of social movements, political parties, and the state that provide different lenses for understanding MAS’ abandonment of its original political platform for change, Twenty-First Century Socialism (Socialismo del Siglo XXI). The paper reveals how the current scenario creates new barriers for the social movements that continue to uphold proposals for sustainable futures, including deepened structural entrenchment in extractivism, the cooptation of alternatives to development proposals by government, the division of once-unified popular fronts, shifting electoral constituencies, and the emergence of new economic elites. Lessons from the Bolivian case are significant for guiding wider efforts at building sustainable alternatives to capitalist development...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{engagement}} {{of a group}} of Mapuche-Pewenche communities with tourism in southern Chile. I argue that Trekaleyin, their tourism initiative, is part of a broader and long history of resistance and struggles for autonomy, territory and decolonisation, in which identity, development, agency and relations with other beings are negotiated, revitalised and re-produced. From my experience working as a development practitioner with these communities in the beginnings of Trekaleyin, I became interested in understanding the ways in which, as a collective experience, it is embedded in and articulated with political concerns and contestation with regards to neoliberalism and multiculturalism. I also became interested in how the communities are incorporating and reactivating diverse and <b>solidarity</b> <b>economies</b> in their work on tourism, {{while at the same time}} reworking their relations with and the market economy itself. I suggest that through Trekaleyin, the communities are also re-producing a relational and open sense of place and connectivity, mobilising particular ways of knowing, being and relating to territory and more-than-human beings in a context of global neoliberalism, reshaping scales and their possibilities. With this thesis I aim to explore how, through their engagement in tourism, community members are disrupting, expanding and hybridising discourses and practices around development, the economy, nature and cross-cultural relations, reworking them so as to craft a better position from where they can participate in them, but the consequences of which extend beyond the “local”, affecting us all, both indigenous and non-indigenous. Therefore, from an ethnographic site and poststructural, post-human and decolonising geographic approaches, this thesis brings new perspectives to the study of development, tourism and the environment, particularly among indigenous peoples, in which autonomy, hybridity, diversity and relational ontologies are articulated...|$|R
