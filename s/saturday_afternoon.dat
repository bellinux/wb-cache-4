5|$|A {{break in}} the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but to little effect.|$|E

5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} in the ground in September 1958. The supporters' association raised the £15,000 cost of the new lights. When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961, {{one of his many}} influential changes was {{to take advantage of the}} lights, playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War {{thousands}} of children were evacuated from metropolitan areas such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool. One evacuee from Woolwich, Patricia Armstrong aged nine, was knocked down by a passenger train and killed on a <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> in May 1943 while using the Gelynis foot crossing at Morganstown. She was lodged with a family in Morganstown. As air raids on Cardiff increased, even younger children from Radyr were evacuated to boarding schools at Rhoose and Bridgend.|$|E

5|$|Loeb, driving an all new Citroën C4 WRC car {{which had}} been in {{development}} throughout 2006, {{took control of the}} race from the outset, winning the two stages on the first day and four more stages over the following three days. His teammate Sordo kept the pressure on, winning three stages, but on Stage 6, Loeb extended his lead from 6.6 seconds to nearly 24 seconds, and from thereon became unattainable. Each stage on the first two Legs were won by either Loeb or Sordo, and it wasn't until <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> on the second run of the day's stages, that other drivers could effectively challenge them. The last two days of the race consisted of a duel between Mikko Hirvonen, who drove a factory 2006 model Ford Focus RS WRC, and Chris Atkinson in a factory Subaru Impreza WRC 2006. After Hirvonen completed Stage 2 in fourth place, Atkinson took the position on Stage 3 and held onto it throughout Friday and into Saturday morning's stages. On Stage 12 on <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Hirvonen retook fourth, Atkinson regained it on Stage 13 but then lost it to Hirvonen again following Stage 14. Atkinson won the final stage on Sunday morning, and finished the race back in fourth position.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> was split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th or lower. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver {{set a time}} within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 17. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> was split into threeparts.

The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the race; {{the first on}} Friday, which lasted 90 minutes. The second and third were both on <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The first Saturday practice lasted 45 minutes, while the second lasted 60. Edwards was quickest {{with a time of}} 30.710 seconds in the first session, 0.134 seconds faster than Kyle Busch. Johnson was just off Busch's pace, followed by Matt Kenseth, Jamie McMurray, and Jeff Gordon. Kasey Kahne was seventh, still within a second of Edwards's time.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before the race; {{the first was}} held on Friday morning, with the second held on Saturday morning. Both were held in damp conditions due to overnight rain with the track drying towards {{the conclusion of the}} respective sessions. Both sessions lasted 1hour and 45minutes. Qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The fastest time from either of the two qualifying sessions counted towards their final grid position.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{were dry}} for {{qualifying}} on <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Qualifying {{consisted of three}} parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Only the two Mercedes drivers were capable of proceeding into the second part of qualifying (Q2) without having to use the faster, soft tyres. Nico Rosberg was fastest, ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton. As Carlos Sainz was unable to compete following his crash in practice, only four running drivers were eliminated. Those were both Marussia drivers, the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson and Fernando Alonso for McLaren.|$|E

5|$|Euler's formal {{education}} started in Basel, {{where he was}} sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, aged thirteen, he enrolled at the University of Basel, and in 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. During that time, he was receiving <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics. At that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek, and Hebrew at his father's urging in order to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E

The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which {{failed to make the}} final session could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.|$|E

5|$|Tranmere Rovers Football Club are an English team {{founded in}} 1884, and based in Birkenhead, Wirral. As {{of the end}} of the 2014–15 season, the club has had 28 managers. The first man to hold this {{position}} was Bert Cooke, appointed in 1912. He oversaw the club's entry into the Football League and remained in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. Major changes were not seen until businessman Dave Russell took over in 1961. His introductions included the team's current all-white kit and regularly arranged floodlit home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s {{a series}} of cost {{reductions}} were introduced on the line, after major reorganizations between 1965 and 1970; the last commuter train for the workers to the plants went on 25 May 1968, while on 31 May 1970 the last passenger train {{in connection with the}} ferries went on Rjukan Line, being replaced with bus. In 1972 Norsk Transport applied to terminate passenger transport with the railway ferry, since they were operating trips with only passengers and no cargo. The application was declined by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, but in 1978 they permitted that the <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and Sunday departures be terminated—these were not used to transport freight trains. By the mid eighties passenger numbers had fallen dramatically, and in 1985 the department gave in and permitted the termination of passenger services with Storegut and Ammonia.|$|E
