50|$|The Shadows are superhumans able {{to travel}} through time, walk through walls, and revive the dead. Once in the city, Cargill is given the <b>Shadow</b> <b>training,</b> which {{consists}} of a single lecture hypnotically imprinted on his brain. Now armed with all their powers and abilities, Cargill emerges from the training session to witness {{a celebration of the}} election results: the Shadows elect their leaders retroactively through time, voting only after the leader's term of office is up, and reporting it back through time to themselves on election day. To his surprise and dread, Cargill finds he is the new leader.|$|E
40|$|This essay, through montage {{rather than}} monologue, seeks {{to open a}} debate about the {{politics}} of training for learning disabled actors. The journey of the disabled actor from participant in social drama to specialised agent in a professional theatre economy has involved experiments in different forms of actor training. Drawing on interviews with actors, directors and allied professionals involved in Mind the Gap's Staging Change training programme, the essay examines what barriers exist to the establishment of learning disabled artists as professionals intheir own right. The article reflects the contested nature of current training provision: its position in the wider theatrical economy and its relation to both disability studies and applied theatre. Debate in this latter field centres on ‘authenticity’: exactly what kind of performance are these actors being trained for? Is {{there such a thing as}} an authentic learning disability culture? If so, how might performance, and its professional <b>shadow,</b> <b>training,</b> represent, conceal, critique and even threaten this culture? Furthermore, must the required training be radically different: more an undoing of repressive social mechanisms than a goal-driven acquisition of a set of formal skills? The article reverses this concern and suggests that withholding ‘mainstream’ training opportunities from disabled performers risks continued disablement. Via a collage of diverse voices the article argues for a close examination of the meaning and implications of authenticity as a value system. It suggests a move toward an engagement with the politics of craftsmanship: a reframing of the work of learning disabled artists as vocational labour rather than a supposed ‘authentic’ presentation of self...|$|E

Twenty-four university students were given five 10 -minute weekly <b>shadowing</b> <b>training</b> sessions utilizing an English song. A shadowing test was administered to the students after the last training session in order to measure their latencies and shadowing performance. A simple regression analysis between their latencies and shadowing performance showed that latency had a significant effect on shadowing performance (p<. 00). However, the analysis of listening tests and latencies did not show a significant effect of latency on listening comprehension ability...|$|R

40|$|This action {{research}} study pursues productive {{methods of teaching}} a relatively unknown technique called shadowing for gaining suprasegmental pronunciation skills. In this technique, a learner listens to recorded input and simultaneously speaks along to try to match suprasegmental features. The research features five South Korean participants who individually took part in <b>shadowing</b> <b>training</b> over two meetings and were queried about their shadowing experiences using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Shadowing recordings were also documented and analysed from both meetings. The shadowing was conducted using two contrasting procedures: a scaffolded instruction method and a more raw and unguided method called blind shadowing. The results pointed {{to the need for}} shadowing to be scaffolded, as it is a challenging technique that is not always grasped intuitively. This is particularly true in the beginning stages, where shadowing can carry a significant cognitive burden. Recommendations for the pedagogy are prescribed, along with suggestions for materials development...|$|R
40|$|Since {{several studies}} {{reported}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>shadowing</b> <b>training,</b> <b>shadowing</b> has been put to use {{at every level of}} English classrooms in Japan in recent years to improve listening comprehension skills. However, methods for improving learners' listening skills have not been fully examined. In order to explore a more effective way for teaching listening through shadowing, this study utilizes an online shadowing module (Wimba VoiceBoard) with which participants can record their own shadowing voices and compare the model sounds with their own in order to make sure that shadowing practice is conducted in an appropriate way. This online module also allowed them to compare their own recordings with those of other participants. In this way, they were able to perform self-monitoring, and evaluate each other in their learning community. This shadowing-oriented class was conducted for ten months. CASEC tests were administered to the participants before and after implementation of the listening program in order to ascertain whether the participants might have benefited from the shadowing activities. The test scores show that {{there was a significant difference}} between the pre- and posttests. The results suggest that students will enhance their overall English ability as well as their listening ability by way of online shadowing practice. A questionnaire was given to participants to determine their attitudes toward the class activities and the program's effectiveness. Finally, some suggestions are made for future improvement of the shadowing program...|$|R
