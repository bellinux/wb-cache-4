40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> with steam under {{pressure}} and additives, such as CaO or KOH that react exothermically in water, {{is an alternative}} technology to fumigants. The influence of <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> (system dBioflashT, Ecoflash SC 600) on the chemical behaviour of organic matter, heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb) and clay mineralogy was investigated on three typical soil materials (Ap horizons) with different carbonate contents. These materials were treated in the laboratory in wooden containers. Soil heating produced temperatures ranging between 60 â€“ 80 8 C for at least 20 min. The treatment generally seemed to increase the pH values and may lead in the long-term to a certain alkalisation with high dosages of CaO or KOH. The effects of the CaO treatment on the K and Ca speciation in the soil were rather small, whereas those of the KOH treatment were more pronounced for K. The addition of KOH favoured the fixation of K in the interlayers of smectite. The XRD measurements were {{in agreement with the}} chemical speciation of K. The K chemistry was affected by the treatment by higher contents of the fixed fraction. Organic matter partially decreased after the soil heating treatment. The behaviour of the heavy metals was also affected. In some cases, the EDTA-extractable fractions of Cu, Zn or Pb as well as the soluble fractions of Cu and Zn were distinctly changed after the treatment. The soil-heating treatment probably affected the type and amount of organic ligands and also the adsorbing surfaces that control the solubility of the heavy metals. The heavy metal solubility, however, still remained low after the treatment. The effects of the <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> on the chemical and mineralogical properties {{did not seem to be}} dramatic. It is, however, difficult to predict possible changes if the treatment is repeated over years to decades. We presume that there might be quite substantial effects (especially on the behaviour of organic matter under certain circumstances) in the long term if, as seen at some sites, changes (i. e. decrease) are already measurable after one treatment. Mulching or the addition of organic manure would be possible measures to counter a destabilisation of the soil (i. e. increase in soil erosion susceptibility) and a continuous disintegration of the organic matter pool...|$|E
40|$|The {{colonisation}} of a radish {{root system}} by strains ofPseudomonas fluorescens, selected {{for their ability}} to promote potato and radish growth under different environmental conditions is reported. In pot experiments colonisation of different parts of the root system was measured at different temperatures, in different watering regimes and in sterile and recropped soil. Root colonisation was extensive but populations were highest on the upper root system and their distribution throughout the root system was greatly affected by environmental factors. percolation of water through the soil and partial <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> enhanced colonisation but the effects of temperature and recropping were complex. Growth promotion was unpredictable and there was no simple relationship between PGPR colonisation and stimulation of plant growth...|$|E
40|$|The use of gamma (-) {{irradiation}} as {{a method}} for <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> for laboratory experiments has been recommended over other sterilisation techniques. We reviewed literature dating back over 50 years to investigate the chemical and biological effects on -irradiated soils and to determine its practicality for sterilising soils which will subsequently be used for experimental purposes. Typically, -irradiation at 10 kGy will eliminate actinomycetes, fungi and invertebrates in most soils. The majority of soil bacteria are eliminated by 20 kGy, however, a dose higher than 70 kGy {{may be required to}} kill certain radio-resistant bacteria. We recommend prior to experimentation that the radiosensitivity of soils are determined so as to ensure the desired chemical and biological effects are achieved. -Irradiation may not be an appropriate method for all experiments as it can influence soil chemical properties, in particular soil nitrate and ammonium levels. Where chemical stability is required we recommend sterilising soils air-dry rather than moist...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge facing}} {{the study of}} arbuscular mycorrhiza is the establishment of suitable non-mycorrhizal treatments that can be compared with mycorrhizal treatments. A number of options are available, including <b>soil</b> disinfection or <b>sterilisation,</b> comparison of constitutively mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plant species, comparison of plants grown in soils with different inoculum potential and the comparison of mycorrhiza-defective mutant genotypes with their mycorrhizal wild-type progenitors. Each option has its inherent advantages and limitations. Here, the potential to use mycorrhiza-defective mutant and wild-type genotype plant pairs as tools to study the functioning of mycorrhiza is reviewed. The emphasis of this review is placed on non-legume plant species, as mycorrhiza-defective plant genotypes in legumes have recently been extensively reviewed. It is concluded that non-legume mycorrhiza-defective mutant and wild-type pairs are useful tools {{in the study of}} mycorrhiza. However, the mutant genotypes should be well characterised and, ideally, meet a number of key criteria. The generation of more mycorrhiza-defective mutant genotypes in agronomically important plant species would be of benefit, as would be more research using these genotype pairs, especially under field conditions.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an IMIS-DSS for {{the cultivation of}} vegetable crops in low tech greenhouses. It comprises: (1) a Diagnostic Expert System (DES) for {{the identification of the}} principal pests, diseases and nutritional disorders of six common vegetable crops (aubergine, bean, cucumber, lettuce, pepper and tomato) and provides guidance for their control, (2) a Control Expert System (CES) for the irrigation, fertilisation and aeration of one of these crops (tomato) based on its known physiological requirements and local climatic conditions, (3) an information presentation package to provide decision support for the grower in respect of cultivation practices such as <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation,</b> plant propagation, planting dates, harvest etc., and (4) a market presentation module, incorporating the quality requirements of the European Union, to provide decision support for the packaging and market presentation of produce. In its present form the CES assists the grower to make critical decisions for the cultivation of his crops, while the DES aids the diagnosis and treatment of pests, diseases and disorders. Produce quality is thus improved and economy in fertiliser and water usage achieved. 1...|$|E
40|$|This review mainly {{discusses}} flaming with LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), {{used primarily}} in horticultural crops. A brief survey is made also of other thermal weed control methods, for example: with infra-red radiation, using steam, microwaves, electrical treatment using high voltage current with continous contact or spark discharges. The biological effects of flaming on plants, weed seeds and soil are described. Technique {{and type of}} equipment in use are discussed, and also methods and economical aspects of its use in vegetable crops, root crops, fruit crops, on hard surfaces in urban areas, and for potato haulm desiccation. Other possible applications such as using flaming for <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation,</b> to control plant diseases and crop pests are discussed briefly. Thermal weed control by flaming is today used commercially mainly by alternative vegetable growers and on hard surfaces in urban areas. Flaming is generally more expensive than chemical weed control. Flaming is an important and profitable aid primarily when one wishes or is compelled {{to cut down on}} the use of herbicides and the alternative is handweeding...|$|E
40|$|Catalytic {{activity}} of extracellular enzymes in soil controls many biogeochemical cycles. The efficiency of extracellular enzymes {{depends on their}} interaction with soil organo-mineral surfaces and their resistance to degradation and inactivation. Little {{is known about the}} factors that control the time dependence of enzyme activity in soil. We have monitored catalytic {{activity of}} native and added phosphatase incubated for up to one month in moist soil. Two fungal phosphatases and three tropical soils (two acrisols with contrasting organic matter content and a vertisol) were compared and the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> measured. The enzymes had different stabilities in solution. Activity of Hebeloma cylindrosporum phosphatase was protected in acrisols, but not in contact with the vertisol. In contrast, the decline of activity of Suillus collinitus phosphatase followed the same trend in solution and in the presence of each of the soils. Sterilisation decreased native phosphatase activity. The rate of decline of added phosphatase activity was identical in sterile and non-sterile soils. We discuss the effects of degradation of the enzyme in soil and changing relative activity in the adsorbed state. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Lettuce drop, {{caused by}} Sclerotinia minor, {{can result in}} {{considerable}} yield losses worldwide (Adams, 1986). In Australia, yield losses ranging from 20 to 70 % have been reported by growers (Porter pers. comm.). Control of this disease has relied on {{the application of a}} limited number of fungicides, predominantly Sumisclex, however over recent years the fungicide has been reported to be losing effectiveness. <b>Soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> with metham sodium has been used on a limited basis and long crop rotations have reduced, but not consistently eliminated disease. There is also concern about the sustainability of fungicides and the associated problems with their continued use, including; i) damage to the environment, ii) food safety iii) development of resistance to the fungicides by Sclerotinia, and iv) enhanced degradation that may occur after repeated use. Many reports have shown that experimental formulations of mycoparasitic fungi, such as Coniothyrium minitans and Trichoderma spp., have effectively controlled Sclerotinia diseases in controlled experiments but given unreliable results in the field (Turner and Tribe, 1976, Budge and Whipps, 1991). More recently commercial formulations of biological controls have been developed which have consistently given good control of Sclerotinia in New Zealand and Germany (Stewart, 2001). Development of biological controls is particularly important for sustainable control of Sclerotinia...|$|E
40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{which might}} explain a recent {{increase in the}} incidence of verticillium wilt of chrysanthemums in glasshouses in the Netherlands were investigated, viz whether selection for increased resistance to elevated temperatures has occurred due to frequent steaming of soils in the glasshouses, or whether the strains of Verticillium dahliae occurring in chrysanthemum glasshouses are particularly virulent towards this host. Following artificial inoculation, five isolates of V. dahliae from chrysanthemum were pathogenic on chrysanthemum but five isolates from potato were non-pathogenic for this host. When inoculated onto potato plants, all isolates caused early senescence with {{no significant difference between the}} two groups of isolates. In amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, the potato isolates formed a cluster distinct from all other isolates. As a group the chrysanthemum isolates were no more diverse than the potato isolates but did not form a cluster distinct from 12 other isolates tested. This suggests that high pathogenicity to chrysanthemum has developed on several occasions but that the group of potato isolates were possibly monophyletic. Microsclerotia produced in vitro from the chrysanthemum isolates had significantly lower average lethal temperature tolerance than those from the five potato isolates suggesting that being able to resist the effects of <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> by steam is not a factor in wilt of chrysanthemums in the Netherland...|$|E
40|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} - especially {{root knot}} and cyst nematodes - are economically important pests in numerous crops. Chemical <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> {{and the use}} of other unselective pesticides to control plant parasitic nematodes are still a common practice in many European countries and at present no realistic alternatives are available. For the identification of handles to control root knot and cyst nematodes we need to know how they interact with their host. Two main types of endoparasitic nematodes can be distinguished: root-knot and cyst nematodes, both inducing a feeding site in the plant root, but in a different way. To get insight into the molecular mechanisms behind this complex interaction, several strategies to analyse plant gene expression in response to nematode infection have been followed. Random in vivo gus fusions have been particularly successful in identifying plant promoter sequences that are highly activated in nematode feeding sites, with very little expression elsewhere in the plant, but the isolation of the corresponding genes is often not straightforward. Many highly transcribed plant genes have been identified in the feeding sites, but few have been characterised in such detail as to know how important they are for a successful infection. The available data are nevertheless providing interesting tools for novel strategies to engineer nematode resistance into crops. Concomitantly, the signals coming from the nematode that are triggering this plant response or that are important in other steps of the infection process are being characterised. This study has revealed that plant-parasitic nematodes produce many different enzymes to enable them to infect the plant root and to protect themselves against the plant defence response...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} role of {{earthworms}} in the early colonisation of contaminated soils as well as sediment and waste deposits, which are worm-free because of anthropogenic activities such as open-cast mining, <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation,</b> consistent pollution or remediation of contaminated soil. Earthworms live in close interaction with their soil environment {{and are able to}} change it considerably by their burrowing and litter comminuting behaviour. While earthworms have been studied extensively, several questions still remain unanswered such as: What are the characteristics of successful early colonisers? Do they function well in dispersal, individual establishment or population growth? Do the negative environmental conditions in these kinds of anthropogenic soils hamper colonization or are these colonizers relatively resistant to it? To what extent does colonization change the characteristics of the colonized substrate? In short, do earthworms impact the soil? In this paper, the characteristics that make earthworms successful colonisers are briefly described as well as which species are the most successful and under what circumstances, and what do earthworms contribute to the total process of succession. We propose that {{it is not so much}} eco-type or r-K strategy that govern success and succession of earthworm colonisation but rather environmental flexibility not only towards pH, desiccation, and temperature but also towards contaminants such as heavy metals. Moreover, the formation of an organic litter layer, in close connection with re-vegetation of the area, is essential for establishing earthworm populations, which, at first, are mainly superficially and shallow active species. The burrowing and organic matter digesting activity of these earthworms changes the upper soil to a well mixed humus layer suitable for deep burrowing earthworm species...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{experimental}} and numerical results related to micro-organism population control in greenhouse soil {{by means of}} direct soil burning are reported, and an original device for this operation is presented. Results of the micro-organism soil treatment are also reported. In the perspective of evaluating high temperature side thermal effects on the greenhouse soil, biological and chemical effects of the soil treatment are described as well. The heating {{and the loss of}} water in the experimental tested configurations do not involve any meaningful transformation in the physical structure of the mineral present in the clay fraction. In fact, the slight transformations detected do not modify the fundamental structure, but they are essentially related to reversible loss of water. The loss of moisture and a light diminution of the organic substance have been anyway noticed by chemical analysis performed on the treated soil. The moisture concentration in the soil before and after the treatment becomes a very important index to prevent possible transformations of the organic substances in the soil, due to the heating effect. Pulverisation of the soil is possible if moisture levels decrease under a minimum level, and in this case it is also possible to perform an unwanted cooking of the clay present in the soil. Insofar we have considered that the water which is always present in the soil evaporates in an uniform way, balancing the local temperature and protecting the soil itself against the direct effect of the flame. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} thermal effects of the phenomena related to the <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation</b> process a numerical simulation of the proposed device has been performed and results are compared with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Aphanomyces root rot, {{caused by}} the oomycete Aphanomyces euteiches, is the most {{important}} and destructive disease of pea. Since the inoculum is persistent in the soil, and no resistant cultivars or means of chemical control are available, the disease is difficult to manage. The occurrence of soil suppressiveness against the disease was previously reported, and the main aim {{of this study was to}} understand the mechanism. By analysing chemical data for naturally infested soil samples from a large number of fields, we found that disease suppression was correlated to the Ca content of the soil. This was also true for artificially inoculated soil samples. Suppressiveness was only inconsistently affected by <b>soil</b> <b>sterilisation,</b> and was concluded to be abiotic in nature. Amendments of non-suppressive soils with both neutral and alkaline Ca salts strongly reduced disease severity. In contrast, amendment of suppressive soils with NaHCO 3 solutions lowered the content of soluble Ca, increased pH and made the soil less suppressive. It was concluded that high concentrations of Ca in the soil solution was a major factor causing suppressiveness. The effect of Ca in the field was evaluated by adding a neutral Ca salt, CaSO 4 in a naturally infested field trial. A clear delay in the onset of disease symptoms was seen at all doses evaluated. A quantitative molecular detection method based on quantitative PCR was developed and compared with the greenhouse biotest traditionally used to detect the pathogen in soil samples. Using the qPCR assay, it was possible to detect and quantify the pathogen at concentrations under 10 oospores g soil- 1. The Swedish population of A. euteiches was analysed using co-dominant DNA sequence markers. It was found that the population was dominated by a globally distributed genotype, but that distinctly different genotypes also exist. These results were interpreted as evidence of a predominantly clonal mode of reproduction, but also of occasional sexual recombination...|$|E
