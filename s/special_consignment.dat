KALO BHARI Loadswas the name given to a <b>special</b> <b>consignment</b> compactly packed in black tarpaulin. The British sold arms and ammunitions to Tibet. The terrain and the inclement weather condition made the trading difficult. The commodities to save them from rain and snow were wrapped in card boards and put inside gunny bags bedaubed with tar. The tar protected the commodities from outside rain, and it also hid the commodities within. The black colour gave the load its local name Kalo Bhari or black load.|$|E
