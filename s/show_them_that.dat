5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E

25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

500|$|As {{a college}} prospect, Rivals.com ranked him 30th nationally among dual-threat quarterbacks, Scouts, Inc. ranked him 33rd nationally among wide receivers, and SuperPrep placed him on its Virginia 33. ESPN {{assessed}} {{him as a}} [...] "do-it-all prospect" [...] and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed. Smith was recruited by Maryland, Penn State, and Virginia Tech. He was shown interest by Virginia, but did not receive a scholarship offer. The Virginia staff, which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year, asked Smith to run a 4.5-second 40-yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University, which he did. The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus, but Maryland offered a scholarship, which Smith accepted. He later said, [...] "I kind of hold a grudge against U.Va. a little bit. I'm not afraid to say it.

The club wants revenge on Sebastian; Kurt says he should be expelled from Dalton, but Will asks them to let the system handle it. Artie (Kevin McHale) refuses: he is fed up with being told it will get better and says it should be better now, and leaves. Despite wanting revenge, Kurt is unwilling to use violence, so Santana goes to Dalton and accuses Sebastian of lying about {{the composition of the}} damaging slushie. He challenges her to a duel: the song [...] "Smooth Criminal". He admits after they finish that he rigged the slushie with rock salt, and hits her with an unadulterated one.

Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: [...] "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!" [...] In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That does it for me. I {{am not going to}} play the Beatles any more". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|E

500|$|The second video, {{created to}} {{accompany}} the 1992 single release that was recorded at Sound City Studios, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had previously directed the band's videos for [...] "Come as You Are" [...] and [...] "Lithium". Cobain's original concept for the video {{told the story of}} a young girl born into a Ku Klux Klan family who one day realizes how evil they are. His concept was too ambitious, so Cobain instead decided to parody musical performances by bands on early 1960s variety shows, such as The Ed Sullivan Show. The humorous tone of the video was a result of Cobain being [...] "so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously [...] [...] [...] I wanted to fuck off and <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> we have a humorous side to us". Kerslake filmed the video on old Kinescope cameras, and the band improvised its performance. The video begins with an unnamed variety show host (played by Doug Llewelyn, former host of The People's Court) introducing Nirvana to an in-studio crowd of screaming teenagers; their non-stop screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song. The band members, whom the host refers to as [...] "thoroughly all right and decent fellas", perform dressed in Beach Boys-style outfits; Cobain wears glasses that blurred his vision, while Novoselic cut his hair short and liked it so much he kept it that way afterwards. As the video progresses, the band destroys the set and its instruments.|$|E
500|$|On 11 October 2016, Buffon {{became the}} first goalkeeper ever to win the Golden Foot Award. Buffon had {{initially}} suffered criticism in the media {{at the beginning of}} the 2016–17 season over a high-profile error against Spain in a World Cup qualifier with Italy, followed by another mistake with Juventus against Udinese in Serie A; although certain analysts questioned his longevity, on 18 October, Buffon drew praise from pundits for his performance in his club's third fixture of the 2016–17 Champions League group stage, as he helped a ten-man Juventus to a 1–0 away win over Lyon. During the match, he saved Alexandre Lacazette's penalty in the 35th minute (his first penalty save in the Champions League since 2003), and later also made a decisive stop on Nabil Fekir's deflected shot early into the second half, while he used his legs to deny Corentin Tolisso's point-blank header in the 71st minute. The victory meant that Juventus had managed to earn their first ever away victory against a French side in the Champions League, while Buffon sealed his third consecutive clean sheet of the season in the competition, and the 42nd Champions League clean sheet of his career. Following the match, Buffon commented [...] "I love it when they celebrate your funeral, and then you <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you're still alive." [...] Following his performances throughout the calendar year, Buffon was included in the 30-man shortlist for the 2016 Ballon d'Or; he placed ninth alongside Pepe in the final ranking. In Juventus' fourth Champions League group match of the season on 2 November, a 1–1 home draw against Lyon, Buffon made his 100th Champions League appearance (excluding appearances in qualifying rounds), becoming the 29th player to reach this landmark. On 4 November, he was included in the 23-player shortlist for The 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award. On 6 November, Buffon earned his 600th Serie A appearance in a 2–1 away win against Chievo, the fourth player to reach this milestone. His performances saw him earn the Juventus Player of the Month Award for October 2016. On 21 November, Buffon was nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year for the ninth time his career, making him goalkeeper with the most nominations ever, alongside Iker Casillas. On 1 December, Buffon was nominated for the 2016 FIFPro World XI, making him the only player, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, to have been included in the shortlist every year since its inception in 2005. On 23 December, Buffon made his 600th competitive appearance for Juventus in the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana; following a 1–1 draw after extra time, Juventus lost 4–3 to Milan in a penalty shoot-out, although Buffon saved Gianluca Lapadula's initial spot kick. Buffon capped off the year by placing second in the 2016 IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper Award, finishing behind Neuer once again.|$|E

Sacco was represented by Fred H. Moore and William J. Callahan. The choice of Moore, a former attorney for the Industrial Workers of the World, proved a key mistake for the defense. A notorious radical from California, Moore quickly enraged Judge Thayer with his courtroom demeanor, often doffing his jacket and once, his shoes. Reporters covering the case were amazed to hear Judge Thayer, during a lunch recess, proclaim, [...] "I'll <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> no long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!"

[...] Among Spreckels' many accomplishments was the formation of the San Diego Electric Railway in 1892, which radiated out from downtown to points north, south, and east and helped urbanize San Diego. Henry Huntington, the nephew of Central Pacific founder Collis P. Huntington, would develop his Pacific Electric Railway in Los Angeles and Orange Counties with much the same result. Spreckels' greatest challenge would be to provide San Diego with its own direct transcontinental rail link {{in the form of the}} San Diego and Arizona Railway (completed in November 1919), a feat that nearly cost the sugar heir his life. The Central Pacific Railroad, in effect, initiated the trend by offering settlement incentives in the form of low fares, and by placing sections of its government-granted lands up for sale to pioneers.|$|E
