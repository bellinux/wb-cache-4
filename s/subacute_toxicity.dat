The total daily dose ranged widely from 0.5 to 50g. The total cumulative dose ranged from 0.5 to 721g. In those patients who received intravenous taurolidine, the daily intravenous dose was usually 15 to 30 g but several patients received up to 40g/day. Total daily doses of up to 40g and total cumulative doses exceeding 300g were safe and well tolerated.|$|E
50|$|Pramocaine (INN and BAN, {{also known}} as pramoxine or pramoxine HCI) is a topical {{anesthetic}} discovered at Abbott Laboratories in 1953 and used as an antipruritic. During research and development, pramocaine hydrochloride stood out among a series of alkoxy aryl alkamine ethers as an especially good topical local anesthetic agent. Pharmacologic study revealed it to be potent and of low acute and <b>subacute</b> <b>toxicity,</b> well tolerated by most mucous membranes and of a low sensitizing index in humans. Like other local anesthetics, pramocaine decreases the permeability of neuronal membranes to sodium ions, blocking both initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. Depolarization and repolarization of excitable neural membranes is thus inhibited, leading to numbness.|$|E

These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of pathological change was tested.... All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and <b>subacute</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies. Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked. Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia have led researchers to suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.|$|E

It was found: (i) that the capacities of the isomers and the racemate to cure infections with Plasmodium cynomolgi in rhesus monkeys were essentially identical; (ii) that the <b>subacute</b> <b>toxicities</b> of the isomers and racemate for this monkey were qualitatively the same, but that l-primaquine was {{three to five times}} as toxic as d-primaquine and at least twice as toxic as primaquine; and (iii) that the acute single-dose toxicities of the isomers for mice were not only qualitatively different, but that the d isomer was at least four times as toxic as l-primaquine. Since previous appraisals of curative activity and tolerability of 8 -aminoquinolines in rhesus monkeys have correlated well with appraisals in human volunteers, attention was focused on results acquired with these test subjects. The relevant evaluations showed that d-primaquine had a therapeutic index at least twice that of primaquine. If this advantage carries over to man, problems that now complicate routine use of primaquine might be obviated.

METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six patients with localized prostate cancer were distributed as follows: 57 underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy, 35 underwent three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, 37 underwent I- 125 implant, and 27 underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The prescribed doses were 70 - 74 Gy/ 35 - 37 fractions, 70 Gy/ 35 fractions, 145 Gy, and 45. 5 Gy/ 7 fraction/ 4 days for intensity-modulated radiation therapy, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, I- 125 implant, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy, respectively. Toxicities (≤ 6 months) were retrospectively evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. 03. RESULTS: The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (33 / 35, 94 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (18 / 27, 67 %) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (37 / 57, 65 %) (P < 0. 05). The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using I- 125 implant was 31 / 37, 84 %. The frequency of grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal toxicities using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (17 / 35, 49 %) was significantly higher than that using I- 125 implant (4 / 37, 11 %) or high-dose-rate brachytherapy (0 / 27, 0 %) (P < 0. 05). Using intensity-modulated radiation therapy, the frequency of grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal toxicities was 18 / 57 (32 %), which was significantly higher than that using high-dose-rate brachytherapy (0 / 27, 0 %) (P < 0. 05).

30|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} [PFCs] {{have found}} a wide use in industrial products and processes and in {{a vast array of}} consumer products. PFCs are molecules made up of carbon chains to which fluorine atoms are bound. Due to the strength of the carbon/fluorine bond, the molecules are chemically very stable and are highly resistant to biological degradation; therefore, they belong to a class of compounds that tend to persist in the environment. These compounds can bioaccumulate and also undergo biomagnification. Within the class of PFC chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorosulphonic acid are generally considered reference substances. Meanwhile, PFCs can be detected almost ubiquitously, e.g., in water, plants, different kinds of foodstuffs, in animals such as fish, birds, in mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. PFCs are proposed as a new class of 'persistent organic pollutants'. Numerous publications allude to the negative effects of PFCs on human health. The following review describes both external and internal exposures to PFCs, the toxicokinetics (uptake, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and the toxicodynamics (acute <b>toxicity,</b> <b>subacute</b> and subchronic <b>toxicities,</b> chronic toxicity including carcinogenesis, genotoxicity and epigenetic effects, reproductive and developmental toxicities, neurotoxicity, effects on the endocrine system, immunotoxicity and potential modes of action, combinational effects, and epidemiological studies on perfluorinated compounds).|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE AND METHODS: Although a high {{prevalence}} of adjustment disorders and anticipatory nausea secondary to adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) has been reported, {{little has been}} done to develop strategies to prevent these problems. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was therefore designed to assess the usefulness of adding low-dose alprazolam (0. 5 mg to 2 mg per day) to a psychologic support program including progressive relaxation training designed to prevent the aforementioned conditions. Fifty-seven women undergoing adjuvant CT for stage II primary breast cancer {{agreed to participate in the}} assessment, which was conducted at four time points: before starting CT, 6 weeks after CT, before the fourth CT, and after the fourth CT. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS), Revised Symptom Checklist (SCL- 90 -R), Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis (MANE), and World Health Organization (WHO) grading of acute and <b>subacute</b> <b>toxicities</b> were used to compare the alprazolam (AA) and placebo (PA) arms of the study. RESULTS: At the second evaluation, the results showed a higher rate of anticipatory nausea (18 % v 0 %) in the PA compared with the AA arm (P =. 038). These differences were no more significant at each of the further assessments. Significant differences were found for the intake of hypnotics at each assessment visit, with the rate of hypnotic users being significantly higher in the PA (19 %) compared with the AA (0 %) arm at the fourth assessment (P <. 05). Anxiety and depression scores of self- and observer-report were similar in the two arms. A significant relationship was found between the development of anticipatory nausea and the self-report of anxiety and depression score measured by HADS at baseline. The average HADS total score at baseline was 15. 33 (SD = 6. 56) for patients who developed anticipatory nausea and 11. 23 (SD = 6. 67) for other patients. CONCLUSION: The adjunct of alprazolam to a psychologic support program delays the occurrence of anticipatory nausea and controls sleeping problems secondary to adjunct CT. Although studies are needed to improve the efficacy reported here, physicians may already consider the use of alprazolam for cancer patients undergoing CT.

Methods: Between September 1, 2008 to January 31, 2012, nine cervical cancer patients unsuitable for brachytherapy were enrolled. All of the patients received definitive whole pelvic radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, followed by SBRT via HT. Results: The actuarial locoregional control rate at 3 years was 78 %. The mean biological equivalent dose in 2 -Gy fractions of the tumor, rectum, bladder, and intestines was 76. 0 &plusmn; 7. 3, 73. 8 &plusmn; 13. 2, 70. 5 &plusmn; 10. 0, and 43. 1 &plusmn; 7. 1, respectively. Only two had residual tumors after treatment, and the others were tumor-free. Two patients experienced grade 3 acute toxicity: one had diarrhea; and another experienced thrombocytopenia. There were no grade 3 or 4 <b>subacute</b> <b>toxicities.</b> Three patients suffered from manageable rectal bleeding in months 11, 14, and 25, respectively. One stage IVA patient experienced fistula formation in month 3. Conclusion: SBRT via HT provides the possibility for treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer in patients who are unsuitable for brachytherapy. Long-term follow up and enrollment of more such patients to receive SBRT via the HT technique are warranted.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of taurine in rats exposed to <b>subacute</b> dichlorvos <b>toxicity.</b> Fifty rats were weighed and assigned into five groups of ten rats each. The groups received: distilled water, soya oil (1  ml/kg), taurine (50  mg/kg), dichlorvos (10  mg/kg) and the combination treatment group received taurine first and then dichlorvos 30  min later. The treatments were administered once daily by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The rats were euthanized and blood samples were collected after the termination of the study. Serum samples were analysed for malondialdehyde concentration and activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase). Dichlorvos increased malondialdehyde concentration and reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase. There was attenuation of malondialdehyde concentration and improvement of activities of superoxide dismutase (P =  0. 0273) and catalase (P <  0. 0001) in rats treated with taurine. It is postulated that taurine ameliorated dichlorvos-induced oxidative stress through the reduction of malondialdehyde concentration and the enhancement of activities of antioxidant enzymes.

40|$|Neural tissue {{engineering}} approaches show increasing promise {{for the treatment}} of neural diseases including spinal cord injury, for which an efficient therapy is still missing. Encouraged by both positive findings on the interaction of carbon nanomaterials such as graphene with neural components and the necessity of more efficient guidance structures for neural repair, we herein study the potential of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) microfibers as substrates for neural growth in the injured central neural tissue. Compact, bendable, and conductive fibers are obtained. When coated with neural adhesive molecules (poly-L-lysine and N-cadherin), these microfibers behave as supportive substrates of highly interconnected cultures composed of neurons and glial cells for up to 21 days. Synaptic contacts close to rGO are identified. Interestingly, the colonization by meningeal fibroblasts is dramatically hindered by N-cadherin coating. Finally, in vivo studies reveal the feasible implantation of these rGO microfibers as a guidance platform in the injured rat spinal cord, without evident signs of <b>subacute</b> local <b>toxicity.</b> These positive findings boost further investigation at longer implantation times to prove the utility of these substrates as components of advanced therapies for enhancing repair in the damaged central neural tissue including the injured spinal cord...|$|R
