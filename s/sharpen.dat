5|$|Unlike {{conventional}} classroom learning, {{in which}} a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and repeats the information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research, chavrusa learning challenges the student to analyze and verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and <b>sharpen</b> each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely {{new insights into the}} meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, <b>sharpen</b> his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} MSI band <b>sharpening</b> in four research areas. The first area explored the "Effective Ground Sample Distance [GSD) " and relative utility of multi-spectral imagery <b>sharpened</b> with panchromatic [pan) imagery. The second area examined interactions between data com-pression and the band <b>sharpening</b> process. The third area determined the effectiveness of band <b>sharpening</b> using a pair of high resolution <b>sharpening</b> bands covering {{different regions of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. The fourth area determined the effect of band <b>sharpening</b> on the accuracy of automated exploitation algorithms such as terrain categorization [TERCAT) and normalized difference vegetation index [NDVR. The results of this research show that the Effective GSD of the <b>sharpened</b> image can be predicted prior to fusion [an Effective GSD equation based on the GSDS of the multispectral and panchromatic input images is determined). The Effective GsD of the <b>sharpened</b> product i s shown to be close to the GSD of the panchromatic <b>sharpening</b> band (94 percent of the pos-sible GSD improvement i s achieved). The research also showed that <b>sharpened</b> products demonstrate increased utility com-pared to the original low resolution MSI and the degree of increased utility for <b>sharpened</b> products can be predicted prior to fusion. The optimal <b>sharpening</b> algorithms based on this and prior research are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was to <b>sharpen</b> the transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E

5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to <b>sharpen</b> their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E
5|$|Pattle joined No. 80 Squadron RAF. The {{squadron}} was in {{the midst}} of re-forming at RAF Kenley and he was able to fly the Gloster Gladiator fighter for the first time in May 1937. In June, the unit moved to RAF Debden. Here, they practised aerial combat against RAF Bomber Command squadrons which staged mock raids against London. During these exercises, he mastered deflection shooting. Pattle developed his own air tactics. He preferred attacking at higher altitudes than his quarry, meeting head-on, then waiting for the enemy to fly by before rolling over and diving to attack from the side and rear of the enemy. He usually held his fire until very close to the target to make sure of hitting his opponent. His qualities as an officer led to him being promoted to squadron adjutant. A gifted flyer and natural marksman, he took pains to improve both talents, doing exercises to improve his distance vision and <b>sharpen</b> his reflexes. He progressed in rank with the squadron and was duly promoted to pilot officer on 27 July 1937.|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{panchromatic imagery}} {{can be used}} to increase the spatial resolution of low resolution spectral imagery through spatial/spectral <b>sharpening</b> techniques. Recently, <b>sharpening</b> techniques have been presented that use a multiresolution analysis by manipulating the images at different resolution scales that use a Laplacian pyramid or wavelet transform. This paper presents a model for <b>sharpening</b> multispectral images (MRA/MTF) that uses multiresolution analysis (MRA) to extract the high frequency information from the panchromatic image and matches the spatial response between imagery using a modulation transfer function (MTF) correction. When carefully executed, the MRA/MTF model is shown to provide a <b>sharpened</b> image with minimum spectral distortion and visually pleasing results. Multispectral data was used to evaluate the algorithm for <b>sharpening</b> 30 meter Landsat data with 1 meter aerial photography with comparison to other <b>sharpening</b> algorithms available within ERDAS Imagine and with ERIM’s <b>sharpening</b> algorithm called Sparkle. The algorithms were tested for spectral distortion by comparing the covariance between bands before and after <b>sharpening...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{adaptive}} <b>sharpening</b> algorithm for restoration {{of an image}} which has been corrupted by mild blur, and strong noise. Most existing adaptive <b>sharpening</b> algorithms can not handle strong noise well due to the intrinsic contradiction between <b>sharpening</b> and denoising. To solve this problem we propose an algorithm {{that is capable of}} capturing local image structure and sharpness, and adjusting <b>sharpening</b> accordingly so that it effectively combines denoising and <b>sharpening</b> together without either noise magnification or over-sharpening artifacts. It also uses structure information from the luminance channel to remove artifacts in the chrominance channels. Experiments illustrate that compared with other <b>sharpening</b> approaches, our method can produce state of the art results under practical imaging conditions. 1...|$|R
5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and <b>sharpen</b> it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} spatial {{resolution}} enhancement, or <b>sharpening</b> of three bands of a Landsat thematic mapper (TM) multispectral image by a higher resolution SPOT panchromatic (pan) image, is described.

Application of neural network estimation technique is described to improve <b>sharpening</b> of near-infrared bands specifically {{when there are}} reverse contrast patterns at respective edge boundaries of the pan and TM images.
