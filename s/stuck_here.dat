500|$|The track's second verse portrays Madonna singing: [...] "Gonna {{watch the}} sun going down / I'm not gonna run from all this madness", where [...] "she surveys her present {{condition}} but vows to keep on moving". The singer further makes {{a reference to the}} Tower of Babylon and calls attention to changes in the music industry: [...] "In a world that's changing, I'm a stranger in a strange land / There's a contradiction and I'm <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> in between". She later concludes that: [...] "Life is like a desert, an oasis to confuse me".|$|E
2500|$|Wen Qin {{disagreed}} {{and told}} Zhuge Dan, [...] "Jiangdong forces {{are known for}} having scored victories; their enemies in the north can't stop them. Sir, you have led over 100,000 men to join Jiangdong. Quan Yi, myself and the others from Jiangdong are trapped here too with you. Our families are still in Jiangdong. Even if Sun Chen doesn't want to save us, do you think our Emperor and his relatives will abandon us? There were {{times in the past}} when our enemy unexpectedly suffered a plague. Now that we have been <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> for almost a year, if we stir up any feelings of divisiveness, a mutiny might happen. We should continue to hold out and maintain our hopes that help will arrive soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} in Vancouver wrapped, as planned, on 15 April, but the production was soon beset by further tragedy when producer William Vince died of cancer, {{just two days}} after model shooting back in London had wrapped. Fellow producer Amy Gilliam, Terry's daughter, remembered, [...] " [...] always said, 'If you get your film in the can, you'll be all right.' And I kind of believe that he stayed with us to know that happened." [...] Eventually, while on post-production, Gilliam himself was hit by a car, resulting in a cracked vertebra. Gilliam recalled: [...] "So I thought, it was third time lucky – they just didn't get me. They got the star, the producer, and they were going for the director, and the fuckers failed on the last one. Whoever they are..." [...] "They were going for the trinity [...] That would have been a tidy end to the whole thing. But they didn't kill me. I'm <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> to tell the tale." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Stephen Sondheim musical Sunday in the Park With George {{uses the}} word gavotte as a satirical device in the {{otherwise}} irregular, non-steadily rhythmical, song [...] "It's Hot Up Here" [...] to start the second Act, [...] "We're <b>stuck</b> up <b>here</b> in this gavotte." ...|$|R
50|$|The song {{features}} Hank {{attempting to}} give big city life a fair shot (New York City in particular) but ends up feeling more dissatisfied than ever with city life, but {{is unable to}} return home ("Lord I'm <b>stuck</b> up <b>here</b> but I've got Dixie on my mind").|$|R

40|$|Patrick Dunleavy reviews a fascinating, but flawed, {{history of}} {{democratic}} thinking from an American perspective. It throws often unexpected light on democratic innovations through the ages; {{and if the}} government’s project to slice the UK electorate up into equal constituencies is your bag, you can get <b>stuck</b> in <b>here...</b>|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY (offended). What do {{you mean}} by everything? You said that so strangely. You mean you don't believe---- (But she remains silent with her eyes shut.

6000|$|... "Speak with reverence, Doctor," [...] {{returned}} the sailor, {{with a quiet}} smile, [...] "it ain't a penny whistle, it's a flageolet. I <b>stuck</b> it <b>here</b> the last time I was amoosin' the crew o' the Eastern Star an' forgot I hadn't putt it away. Wait a bit, you shall hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom? Well, look here, Tom! D--n it all! Can't you {{see that}} when a man is <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> alone, as I am, {{he wants to know}} what's going on outside, and hear a little fresh talk?" ...|$|E
60|$|West {{went into}} the hack room, which was faintly illumined by candles <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> and there. The girls and Smith were all bending over the {{imposing}} stone, where the forms of the paper were being made up.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know; it's an {{interesting}} point," [...] Andrew replied thoughtfully, {{and moved toward}} a timber from which he scraped a patch of grease. [...] "It was <b>stuck</b> on <b>here</b> when it was used and {{that must have been}} after she took the sharp list. If she'd been upright, the flame would have scorched the knee and I see no sign of that." ...|$|R

I want to have a talk with Harry, but just at present I want a drink a blamed sight worse. If I had {{thought we were going to}} be <b>stuck</b> up <b>here</b> all day I would have brought my water-bottle with me." ...|$|R
60|$|Her infants {{were only}} {{remarkable}} for their ugliness and curious costumes. The little girl usually wore soiled silk gowns, {{and had her}} hair tied up with bits of twine. The boy appeared in a suit of yellow calico spotted with black, looking {{very much like a}} canary bird who had fallen into an inkstand. On festival occasions he wore white cloth raiment, with red ribbons <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> and there, and high red boots.|$|E
6000|$|Lize {{was touched}} by this action of her proud daughter, and smiled sadly. [...] "This {{is no place for}} you. It's nothin' but a measly little old cow-town gone to seed--and I'm gone to seed with it. I know it. But what is a feller to do? I'm <b>stuck</b> <b>here,</b> and I've got to make a living or quit. I can't quit. I ain't got the grit to eat a dose, and so I stagger along." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{may not be}} {{improper}} {{to remind}} the reader that in his publication of Sept. 6th General Adams said that the assignment charge was manufactured just before the election; and that in reply I proved that statement to be false by Keys, his own witness. Now, without attempting to explain, he furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by which {{the same thing is}} proved, to wit, that the assignment was not manufactured just before the election; but that it was some weeks before. Let it be borne in mind that Adams made this statement--has himself furnished two witnesses to prove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it. Before going farther, let a pin be <b>stuck</b> <b>here,</b> labeled [...] "One lie proved and confessed." [...] On the 6th of September he said he had before stated in the hand-bill that he held an assignment dated May 20th, 1828, which in reply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill for the truth of what I said. This week he forgets to make any explanation of this. Let another pin be <b>stuck</b> <b>here,</b> labelled as before. I mention these things because, if, when I convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted to shift his ground and pass it by in silence, there can be no end to this controversy.|$|E
60|$|And {{when the}} corn was all planted, how zealous {{we used to}} be about the crows! What benevolent but idiotic old scarecrows we used to construct, and how {{extremely}} anxious we were to be intrusted with guns, that we might disperse, at once and forever, these black marauders! For well we knew that a few dead crows, <b>stuck</b> up <b>here</b> and there on stakes, would frighten away {{all the rest of the}} flock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{the other}} replied, [...] "I don't {{care so much}} for myself, though I don't say {{that it would be}} lively to be <b>stuck</b> up <b>here</b> for four days and nights, but it would be awful for the women; and I should say that very few of them have got more than enough {{provisions}} for a day. Still, of course, if we are shunted at a station we shall be able to buy things." ...|$|R
60|$|Blindly ranging to and fro, they next {{saw a man}} ploughing. Advancing slowly, the {{wanderer}} met him by {{a little}} heap of ruinous burnt masonry, like a tumbled chimney, what seemed the jams of the fire-place, now aridly <b>stuck</b> over <b>here</b> and there, with thin, clinging, round, prohibitory mosses, like executors' wafers. Just as the oxen were bid stand, the stranger's plough was hitched over sideways, by sudden contact with some sunken stone at the ruin's base.|$|R
60|$|The second stair, also of wood, had {{not been}} quite so much charred; but so great was the {{quantity}} of water poured continuously into the house, that it formed a regular water-course of the staircase, down which heaps of plaster and bricks and burnt rubbish had been washed, and had <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> and there, forming obstructions on which the water broke and round which it roared {{in the form of}} what might have been a very respectable mountain-torrent, with this striking difference, that the water which rushed down it was hot, in consequence of its having passed through such glowing materials.|$|E
6000|$|My public-house? Not {{a bit of}} it, nor ever likely. I’m <b>stuck</b> <b>here,</b> I fancy. I don’t like {{to leave}} the kids, you see: and—there’s no use talking—they’re better here than what {{they would be in}} a white man’s country, though Ben took the eldest up to Auckland, where he’s being schooled with the best. But what bothers me is the girls. They’re only half-castes, of course; I know that as well as you do, and there’s nobody thinks less of half-castes than I do; but they’re mine, and about all I’ve got. I can’t {{reconcile}} my mind to their taking up with Kanakas, and I’d like to know where I’m to find the whites? ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{the purpose}} of showing that the {{assignment}} {{was not in the}} bundle when Talbott got it, is the story introduced into Lucian's affidavit that the deeds were counted. It is a remarkable fact, and one that should stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators, that in this short affidavit of Lucian's he only attempted to depart from the truth, so far as I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, in the opening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the deeds,--and in both of these he caught himself. About the counting, he caught himself thus--after saying the bundle contained five deeds and a lease, he proceeds, [...] "and I saw no other papers than the said deed and lease." [...] First he has six papers, and then he saw none but two; for [...] "my son Lucian's" [...] benefit, let a pin be <b>stuck</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been that news {{had come into the}} town of York during the {{afternoon}} concerning a threatened advance of the Americans, for even though it was night the Britishers were working at their fortifications, having torches of pine knots <b>stuck</b> up <b>here</b> and there, and it seemed as if every man of that army of seven thousand was using either the pick or the shovel, or directing the movements of those who worked with their hands.|$|R
6000|$|I {{picked up}} the metal covered memoranda book. Its pages were rotten and <b>stuck</b> together. Only <b>here</b> {{and there was a}} {{sentence}} or a part of a sentence legible. The first that I could read was near the middle of the little volume: ...|$|R
5000|$|They did {{not have}} a name for it at first. Spears thinks the name of the podcastitself came from one of their {{original}} sign-offs. He said goodbye by justsaying, [...] "we'll be <b>here,</b> <b>stuck</b> in the '80s" [...] and it seemed to fit.|$|R
60|$|If London, then, is not habitually grandiose, or monumental, or beautiful, what is it? I should say, {{with much}} fear of contradiction and scornful laughter, {{that it was}} pretty, that it was endearingly nooky, cornery, curvy, with the enchantment of trees and flowers {{everywhere}} mixed with its civic turmoil, and the song of birds heard through the staccato of cabs, and the muffled bellow of omnibuses. You may not like London, but you cannot help loving it. The monuments, if I may {{keep coming back to}} them, are plain things, often, with no attempt upon the beholder's emotions. In the process of time, I suspect that the Albert Memorial will not be the most despised among them, for it expresses, even if it over-expresses, a not ignoble idea, and if it somewhat stutters and stammers, it does at last get it out; it does not stand mum, like the different shy, bashful columns <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> and there, and not able to say what they would be at.|$|E
60|$|Arnus Beaton's studio {{looked at}} first glance like many other painters' studios. A gray wall quadrangularly vaulted to a large north light; casts of feet, hands, faces hung to nails about; prints, {{sketches}} in oil and water-color <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> and there lower down; a rickety table, with paint and palettes and bottles of varnish and siccative tossed comfortlessly on it; an easel, with a strip of some faded mediaeval silk trailing from it; a lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness, with its head on one side, and a stocking on one leg, and a Japanese dress dropped before it; dusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnished floor; canvases faced to the mop-board; an open trunk overflowing with costumes: these features one might notice anywhere. But, besides, there was a bookcase with an unusual number of books in it, {{and there was an}} open colonial writing-desk, claw-footed, brass-handled, and scutcheoned, with foreign periodicals--French and English--littering its leaf, and some pages of manuscript scattered among them. Above all, there was a sculptor's revolving stand, supporting a bust which Beaton was modelling, with an eye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clay and on the head of the old man who sat on the platform beside it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the things}} you make must take a deal of room and be very heavy." [...] At this Mr. Hamel only smiled. [...] "Don't you think {{if you were to}} call an auction you'd get {{something}} for them?" [...] At this suggestion the sculptor frowned but condescended to make no reply. Sir Thomas went on with his suggestion. [...] "If you and half-a-dozen other beginners made a sort of gallery among you, people would buy them as they do those things in the Marylebone Road and stick them up somewhere about their grounds. It would be better than keeping them and getting nothing." [...] Hamel had in his studio at home an allegorical figure of Italia United, and another of a Prostrate Roman Catholic Church, which in his mind's eye he saw for a moment <b>stuck</b> <b>here</b> or there about the gardens of some such place as Glenbogie! Into them had been infused all the poetry of his nature and all the conviction of his intelligence. He had never dreamed of selling them. He had never dared to think that any lover of Art would encourage him to put into marble those conceptions of his genius which now adorned his studio, standing there in plaster of Paris. But to him they were so valuable, they contained so much of his thoughts, so many of his aspirations, that even had the marble counterparts been ordered and paid for nothing would have induced him to part with the originals. Now he was advised to sell them by auction in order that he might rival those grotesque tradesmen whose business it is to populate the gardens of wealthy but tasteless Britons! It was thus that the idea represented itself to him. He simply smiled; but Sir Thomas did not fail to appreciate the smile.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, he {{directed}} {{a revival of}} the classic Annoyance show Co-Ed Prison Sluts: The Musical, the longest running musical in Chicago. Chicago Tribune theater critic Chris Jones expressed the cultural impact of the show stating, [...] "A lot of people, the very same people who now dominate comedy, television and even how many Americans get their politics, took comfort in how “Co-Ed Prison Sluts” attracted nightly lines that stretched for a full Chicago block. For 11 consecutive years (take that, “Wicked”). And so they <b>stuck</b> around <b>here,</b> and built a scene." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will," [...] {{answered}} Randy, {{but when}} the spot mentioned was reached poor Randy's heart leaped into his throat. The sheer wall before him was nearly {{as high as a}} house, and there was nothing to cling to but little lumps of ice which <b>stuck</b> out <b>here</b> and there. The lumps might crack off, and then--he did not dare to think further than that. He was strangely tempted to look below him, but his uncle's words of warning rang in his ears--"Don't look back!" [...] and he did not.|$|R
