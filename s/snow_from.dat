5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> settling.|$|E
5|$|In October filming {{moved to}} other Greek locations, {{including}} Metéora and the Achilleion. In November, the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, {{while the second}} unit shot underwater scenes in The Bahamas. On 1 January 1981, production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Since it was not snowing in Cortina d'Ampezzo {{by the time of}} filming, the producers had to pay for trucks to bring <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> nearby mountains, which was then dumped in the city's streets.|$|E
5|$|Rain is {{heaviest}} from July through September, when {{about half}} of the park's annual average precipitation falls during short, violent thunderstorms. August is generally the wettest month. At an elevation of more than , Petrified Forest National Park has a chance of light <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> October through March, although snow cover rarely persists. The average relative humidity of the area is well below 50percent and at times less than 15percent.|$|E

50|$|The Ashtabula area {{receives}} {{a considerable amount}} of snow throughout the winter, with the average snowfall being 68 inches. Much of the <b>snow</b> comes <b>from</b> lake-effect <b>snow</b> bands <b>from</b> the Great Lakes.|$|R
5|$|Winters {{are cold}} and snowy; Utica {{receives}} lake-effect <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Utica is colder on average than other Great Lakes cities {{because of its}} location in a valley and susceptibility to north winds; temperatures in the single digits or below zero Fahrenheit are not uncommon on winter nights. Annual precipitation (based on a 30-year average from 1981–2010) is , falling on an average of 171 days.|$|E
5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of freezing rain, ice, and <b>snow.</b> <b>From</b> 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, Al Snow, Bob Holly and Scorpio {{united and}} formed The J.O.B. Squad. During that same month on an edition of Raw, they helped Mankind defeat Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man in a triple threat match. In February 1999, Scorpio was {{released}} by the WWF while Gillberg was later phased out of storylines and The Blue Meanie allied with Goldust. After dwindling down to only two members, Snow wrestled against himself on an edition of Raw before Holly {{came down to the}} ring to prevent <b>Snow</b> <b>from</b> hurting himself, which led to the formal breakup of the J.O.B. Squad. Later that month at , Bob Holly, now renamed Hardcore Holly, defeated Snow for the WWF Hardcore Championship to permanently end the J.O.B. Squad.|$|E

5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these domes are bright in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> piling on the roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E

5|$|This {{cold weather}} {{exacerbated}} the fuel problem. Stockpiles of coal at the pits and depots froze solid {{and could not}} be moved. The snow also trapped 750,000 railway wagons of coal and made roads unusable, further hampering transport. A force of 100,000 British and Polish troops and German prisoners of war were put to work clearing <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> the railways by hand, while desperate attempts were made to get fuel to power stations by coal-carrying ships which risked storms, fog and ice to reach their destinations. Despite such expedients, lack of fuel forced many power stations to shut down or reduce their output. The Royal Navy launched Operation Blackcurrant, which used diesel generators aboard submarines to provide supplementary power to coastal towns and dockyards.|$|E
5|$|When the {{rebellion}} finally {{broke out in}} Batoche in March, Irvine advanced quickly through the <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> Regina to Prince Albert, which he garrisoned with 90 police. Superintendent Leif Crozier took a force of police, civilian volunteers and a 7-pounder (3kg) gun to Fort Carlton and attempted to seize a cache of supplies. In the process, Crozier confronted a larger force of rebels at Duck Lake, where his detachment came off much worse in the resulting fight. Emboldened, some of the Cree leaders, including Poundmaker and Big Bear, now joined the Métis in their revolt, although others continued to tacitly support the government, in part {{the result of the}} good relationship the police had built up with them. The police rapidly abandoned most of their posts along the valley, falling back to more easily defensible locations; Inspector Francis Dickens was forced to flee Fort Pitt with his men on a makeshift boat.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed {{ordered his}} general, Suleiman Pasha, {{to end the}} siege of Venetian-controlled Shkodër (now in Albania), to {{assemble}} his troops in Sofia, {{and from there to}} advance with additional troops towards Moldavia. For these already exhausted Ottoman troops, who had besieged the city from 17 May to 15 August, the transit from Shkodër to Moldavia was a month's journey through bad weather and difficult terrain. According to Długosz, Suleiman was also ordered that after inflicting defeat on Stephen, he was to advance towards Poland, set camp for the winter, then invade Hungary in spring, and unite his forces with the army of the Sultan. The Ottoman army consisted of Janissaries and heavy infantry, which were supported by the heavy cavalry sipahis and by the light cavalry (akinci), who would scout ahead. There were also Tatar cavalry and other troops (such as the Timariots) from vassal states. Twenty thousand Bulgarian peasants were also included in the army; their main tasks were to clear the way {{for the rest of the}} army by building bridges over waters and removing <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> the roads, and to drive supply wagons. In total, the Ottoman cavalry numbered 30,000. In September 1474, the Ottoman army gathered in Sofia, and from there, Suleiman marched towards Moldavia by crossing the frozen Danube on foot. His first stop was Wallachia, which he entered via Vidin and Nicopolis. His army rested in Wallachia for two weeks, and was later met by a Wallachian contingent of 17,000 under Basarab Laiotă, who had changed sides to join the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|While Carlito was {{recovering}} from an injury, {{he was involved in}} a comical angle with SmackDown!'s general manager, Theodore Long. The storyline consisted of Carlito being forced to do demeaning chores around the arena, such as selling hot dogs, removing <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> parking lots with a shovel and mopping floors. As a result of these actions, Carlito created a petition in support of Long’s destitution, but was unsuccessful. On March 26, 2005, Colón performed {{for the first time in}} six months as Carlito, in a match against his younger brother Eddie Colón during an event in Caguas, Puerto Rico arriving to the stadium in a helicopter and under a massive standing ovation of the thousands of fans gather that night. Carlito made his WrestleMania debut in a non-wrestling role at WrestleMania 21, in which he interrupted an edition of Rowdy Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest. This event led to an angle in the World Wrestling Council, where Piper and Carlito were booked to wrestle a match on Friday Madness, a special event presented by the company, which Piper won. Following WrestleMania, Carlito created an interview segment entitled Carlito’s Cabana. Carlito then entered a feud with The Big Show after a spot where Show refused an offer to work in an enforcer role for Carlito. This feud involved Carlito tricking Show into eating a poisoned apple, and Matt Morgan becoming Carlito's enforcer. This feud ended with Carlito defeating Show at Judgment Day.|$|E

25|$|Any wind {{stronger}} than a light breeze {{can contribute to}} a rapid accumulation of snow on sheltered slopes downwind. Wind slab forms quickly and, if present, weaker snow below the slab may {{not have time to}} adjust to the new load. Even on a clear day, wind can quickly load a slope with snow by blowing <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> one place to another. Top-loading occurs when wind deposits <b>snow</b> <b>from</b> the top of a slope; cross-loading occurs when wind deposits snow parallel to the slope. When a wind blows over the top of a mountain, the leeward, or downwind, side of the mountain experiences top-loading, from the top to the bottom of that lee slope. When the wind blows across a ridge that leads up the mountain, the leeward side of the ridge is subject to cross-loading. Cross-loaded wind-slabs are usually difficult to identify visually.|$|E
