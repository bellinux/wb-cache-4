The method is characterized by analysis of luminescence spectra in the red and near infrared ranges excited by a concentrated flux of blue radiation, and analysed with a spectrograph of considerable optical power. Spectrograms are enregistered on photographic material of high resolving power; they reveal multiplet structures and intensity-distributions of component lines.

These {{are complex and}} high technology devices due to their basic functions: vacuum and temperature separation form the environment to the cavity. One {{of the most critical}} components of high power couplers is the ceramic RF window that allows the power flux to be injected in the coaxial line. The presence of a dielectric window on a high power RF line has in fact a strong influence on the multipactor phenomena, a resonant electron discharge that is strongly limiting for the RF components performances. The most important method to reduce the multipactor is to decrease the secondary emission yield of the ceramic window. Due to its low secondary electron emission coefficient, TiN thin film is used as a multipactor suppressor coating on RF ceramic coupler windows.

To detect a change in the operation mode, it is preferable to use a non-active measurement. That is why the diagnosis by magnetic field seems more appropriate...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} {{method for}} measurement of {{nitric oxide synthase}} enzymatic activity in peritoneal biopsies. BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by NO synthase (NOS) isoforms that are expressed in the peritoneum. Thus far, NOS activity in the peritoneum has been assessed by nonspecific methods. We describe {{the application of a}} specific method for determination of NOS activity in rat and human peritoneal biopsies. METHODS: The L-citrulline assay is based on the <b>stoechiometric</b> production of NO and L-[3 H]-citrulline from L-[3 H]-arginine by NOS. The assay is technically difficult when applied on small samples with relatively low levels of NOS activity, which required specific procedures for extraction and samples processing. Reaction parameters ensuring assay linearity in the peritoneum were defined. Peritoneum lysates were also used for immunoblot analysis to identify the NOS isoforms involved. RESULTS: A significant NOS activity is detected in the normal peritoneum because of both Ca 2 +-dependent and Ca 2 +-independent NOS. The specificity of NOS activity has been demonstrated by various controls, including the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA. Competition experiments with L-valine and amino acid analyses have reasonably excluded the interference of endogenous arginase and L-arginine, which both might underestimate NOS activity. The procedure is sensitive; it detects a high range of NOS activities as well as the appropriate NOS isoforms in various tissues and conditions, as shown by correlations with immunoblot studies. CONCLUSIONS: We have adapted and characterized the L-citrulline assay to measure specific NOS activities within the peritoneum. The peritoneum lysate assayed for NOS activity can also be used for characterizing NOS isoform expression by immunoblot analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHydrogenated {{silicon nitride}} SiNx:H films are largely used as antireflective coating {{as well as}} {{passivation}} layer for industrial crystalline and multicrystalline silicon solar cells. This work {{is focused on the}} optical and photoluminescence (PL) properties of SiNx:H deposited by either Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) or UltraViolet photo-assisted CVD (UVCVD). Photoluminescence phenomena were investigated in SiNx:H having different stoechiometries. On the other hand, spectroscopic ellipsometry was carried out in order to obtain the optical properties of the films, from which the optical gap could be determined. The evolution of the photoluminescence with stoechiometry was correlated to the evolution of the optical properties, and especially the absorption within the SiNx:H layer. A good agreement was found considering the confinement of excitons in strongly absorbing silicon nanostructures (ns-Si) formed in the SiNx matrix, with different sizes according to the NH 3 / SiH 4 gas flow ratio and the deposition technique. The main PL peak showed an increase of the emission intensity along with a blueshift as silicon concentration decreases. These observations indicate a radiative recombination mechanism dominated by confined excitons within ns-Si rather than emission related to defects. Furthermore, these ns-Si are supposed to be responsible of the global higher absorption, and hence lower optical gap, of the near-stoechiometric SiNx:H films in comparison with the <b>stoechiometric</b> Si 3 N 4 ones. These assumptions were confirmed thanks to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images performed on one of the samples, showing crystalline silicon quantum dots (c-Si QDs) embedded in the SiNx matrix...|$|E
