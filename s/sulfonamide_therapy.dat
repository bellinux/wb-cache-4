5000|$|Miguel Pérez Carreño (Valencia, 1904- Caracas, 1966) was a physician, researcher, scientist, {{university}} professor and writer. [...] He {{graduated with a}} Bachelor's degree from the Central University of Venezuela with his thesis called Calor animal (Animal heat). In 1920 he re-entered the university to study medicine and before graduating {{he worked as a}} clinical monitor. He earned a Ph.D. in Medical Sciences in October 1926 with the presentation of the thesis Autoseroterapia de los derrames (Auto-serum therapy of effusions) and then devoted himself largely as a teacher. Between 1933 and 1934 he completed his academic training at hospitals of New York City, Paris and Vienna. He considered diagnosis an art that had to be accomplished not only through clinical history, but through long, sustained, conversation with the patient about their health problems and living conditions. Beginning in 1936, he worked on the study, analysis and evaluation of definitive treatment for surgical diseases. In Venezuela he did a series of interventions including pasacro nerve resection in the treatment of pelvic neuralgia, resection of the rectum with contra natura permanent anum, (1932), ovarian homografts (1936), the new technique of lymphatic blockade in infectious processes, carried out with electrosurgery linked with <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>therapy</b> (1938), the radical cure of rectal prolapse with fascia lata (aponeurosis of the thigh) ligation of the femoral artery by gangrene and embolectomy by phlebitis. He also contributed to improving the treatment of Banti syndrome (abnormal growth of the spleen) and portal hypertension (usually caused by liver cirrhosis). Active in the Caracas Polyclinic, the José María Vargas Hospital and the University Hospital, Perez-Carreño was head of descriptive practical anatomy procedures, Head of surgical medicine, Chief of Clinical Surgery and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, among other duties. He spent part of his last years on cancer research.The hospital belonging to the National Institute of Social Security, located to the west of Caracas, bears his name.|$|E

40|$|Local <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>therapy</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{markedly}} successful in gas gangrene wounds in experimental animals and man (see Reed and Orr, 1941, 1942; Bliss, Long and Smith, 1942). The only evidence of in vitro bacterio-static action of sulfonamides against the gas gangrene clostridia is an early report by Spray (1937). Spray found the growth of Clostridium tetani, C. novyi and C. septicum to be inhibited by sulfanilamide and disulfonamide in low concentrations but C. welchii, C. tertium, C. sporogenes and C. histolyticum to be inhibited only by high concentrations of disulfonamide. This work might be criticised on the ground that the medium used was likely to be rich in sulfon-amide-inhibitor substances and that the inoculum used was very large. On the other hand Broh-Kahn (1939) and Fox (1940) raise some doubt as to the bacteriostatic action of sulfonamides under anaerobic conditions and Warren, Street and Stokinger (1939) question Spray's results on these grounds. Clifton and Loewinger (1943), however, have shown that anaerobic growth of Esch-erichia coli is inhibited by sulfanilamide...|$|E
40|$|SULFONAMIDES {{have proved}} {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} many infections, and in only a few instances have there been reports of clinical signs of liver dysfunction. This, however, may occasionally occur. The evidence offered in the previous paper of liver disease at times associated with <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>therapy</b> in children led to an investigation of the possibility of the early de-tection of hepatic damage during treatment. Liver function tests based on alteration of plasma globulin appear to be exceedingly sensitive, and with the use of one of these tests it has been possible to detect changes in liver which occurred during treatment with sulfathiazole or sulfadiazine. There have been only a few reports in the literature in which liver func-tion has been followed before and during therapy. DeBonis * found a de-crease in hepatic function in five of 11 normal adults who received 0. 03 gr. of sulfanilamide per kilo for three days.

40|$|Rothenberg {{points out}} the threat arising from {{bacterial}} strains becoming resistant to antibiotics and sulfonamides, and those resistant to such therapy per se, {{both of which are}} becoming more prominent in mastitis, with extensive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics and <b>sulfonamides</b> for <b>therapy.</b> Thus a need is expressed for a mastitis treatment that (1) is not an antibiotic or sulfonamid; (2) has a wide antibacterial spectrum with little or no chance for development of resistance or compensation to the drug; (3) is nontoxic and (4) is restricted to use under professional supervision. This need indicates the importance of agents other than antibiotics and sulfonamides. It was thought that a brief review of the recent literature on some of these agents would prove to be interesting and valuable to the writer and reader. Agents used separately or in conjunction with antibiotics or sulfonamides are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{antibacterial}} {{action of}} sulfonamide compounds upon certain pathogenic microorganisms is now generally recognized, {{the effect of}} these drugs upon the immunological response of the animal or human host has not been completely elucidated. In view of the value of <b>sulfonamides</b> in the <b>therapy</b> of pneumonia and other diseases caused by pneumococci and because of the essential contribution of immunity to recovery from such infections, it seemed desirable to investigate further the action of sulfapyridine upon the immune processes. In response to the antigenic stimulus of pneumococcus the tissues of man and certain animals are capable of elaborating type specific antibodies which circulate in the blood and can be determined by the appropriate techniques. In experimental animals it is also possible to recognize the occurrence of active immunity as indicated by increased resistance to homologous infection which may be present before and may persist after the period when circulating antibodies are detectable. In the process of spontaneous recovery from pneumococca...|$|R
40|$|IN the {{selection}} and application of our available resources for the treat-ment of pneumonias, we should be guided by consideration of the interaction of pneumococci and patients {{and the effect of}} our remedies on both. Final judgment must be based on clinical experience with adequately sized similar groups of patients treated with various therapies. Patients who completely recover from pneumonia without benefit of specific therapies do so by reason of their immunity response which completely destroys the invading bacteria; and such patients as a rule exhibit acquired immunity to the invading organ-ism. Accordingly, the capacity to overcome infection, which is a cardinal characteristic of patients, must be considered when we compare the effect of different treatments. The Effects of <b>Therapies.</b> Chemotherapy with <b>sulfonamides,</b> specific serum <b>therapy,</b> or a combination of both, are current methods of successful treatment.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the great progress which {{the advent of the}} sulfonamides marked in the treatment of infections caused by various pathogenic cocci, the sulfona-mide therapy of anaerobic wound infections has until recently proved of only limited value. Reports from the present war (1) indicate that local sulfonamide treatment of wounds, even when preceded by surgical cleansing of the potentially infected area, cannot by itseLf be relied upon as a safe method for preventing the development and spread of gas gangrene. There are clinical reports (2, 3), however, which suggest that a combination of local <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>therapy</b> with the early administration of antitoxin may be more effective than the use of either drug or serum alone. First clinical trials of penicillin in the treatment of gas gangrene (4, 5) have given encouraging results, though there are indications that the simultaneous administration of antitoxin may be indispensable. In dealing with this problem one has to take into account that gas gangrene may be caused by several species of clostridia and that the frequent lack of an early differential diagnosis adds to the difficulties of comparing under war condi...|$|E
40|$|A {{feature of}} <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>therapy</b> for {{bacterial}} infections is that species of bacteria {{differ in their}} resistance to the antibacterial action of the compounds. It is also recognized that strains of microorganisms within the same species display variations in susceptibility. A disconcerting and confusing factor associated with chemo-therapy, {{which appears to be}} assuming increasing clinical significance, is the ease and frequency with which some species of bacteria may develop in vtro and in vivo resistance to the bacteriostatic action of the sulfonamides. In the literature, the term "sulfonamide-fast " has been applied to those strains which become resistant to the antibacterial action of the compounds. This is particularly applicable to studies involving species of bacteria whose progenitors were known {{to be sensitive to the}} sulfonamides. Because the development of resistance is a relative phenome-non, and because, under proper experimental conditions, the growth of even the most resistant strains of bacteria may be inhibited by the drugs, the term "sulfonamide-resistant " is believed to be a more accurate description. The purpose of this report is to review briefly the problem of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria in general, and to record the results of investiga-tions with several strains of staphylococcus isolated from patients. An attempt has been made to answer the following questions: If a standard in vitro test is used for quantitating the inhibitory effect of the sulfonamides upon the growth of staphylococci, do strains of this species vary in their susceptibility to the anti-staphylococcic action of the compounds? Is there any correlation between the isolation of sulfonamide-resistant strains of staphylococci IAided by grants from the Committee on Scientifi...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper the {{therapeutic}} effectiveness of sulfathiazole {{used during the}} acute stages of Sonne bacillary dysentery was demonstrated. 5 However, it was shown also that <b>sulfonamide</b> <b>therapy</b> did not curtail the period during which the Sonne organism could be recovered by rectal cultures. Actually, {{there appeared to be}} statistical evidence that this period was prolonged when compared with untreated controls. Another outbreak of Sonne bacillary dysentery occurring two years later afforded us the opportunity to test the value of sulfaguanidine, administered for varying periods during convalescence, for reducing the length of the carrier state. At the same time, the prophylactic value of the sulfonamide drugs in preventing the epidemic spread of bacillary dysentery, as recently suggested, 2 ' 4 was also investigated. Methods and procedures Material for culture was obtained by means of rectal swabs. The bacteriological and cultural technics were those previously described. 5 Every individual with acute dysentery was immediately transferred to the institution's hospital for treatment. The four cottages in which the disease appeared were quarantined. With few exceptions, the patients were returned to their respective cottages after about 7 days. At this time, the administration of sulfaguanidine was started and continued for the following 7 or 14 days. The dose of sulfaguanidine was approximately 0. 08 gm. per kilogram per day, divided inito two doses. The usual dose varied between 2 and 3 grams per day. Every patient was cultured on admission to the hospital, and was followed with weekly cultures until 2 consecutive cultures failed to show the dysentery bacillus. Although cultures obtained while sulfaguanidine was being administered were negative, not infrequently cultures became positive after the drug was stopped, consequently no patient was considered bacteriologically negative unless at least 2 negative cultures were obtained during the period when no drug was being given...|$|E
40|$|A given {{individual}} once {{infected with}} a Group A streptococcus of any serological type rarely is reinfected with an organism {{of the same}} type. Presumably the low incidence of reinfection is due to type-specific immunity correlated with the persistence of type-specific antibodies. The duration of this irnrnlxnity following a streptococcal infection has not been established. An approach for obtaining laboratory evidence {{for the duration of}} immunity is the study of the persistence of type-specific antibodies which are usually demonstrable in patients following streptococcal infections. It has been shown by others that typespecific antibodies in some individuals persist for as long as 3 years (1 - 6). There are few data available covering longer periods of time. In this study immunological and clinical data are reported on individuals who had streptococcal infections as long ago as 32 years. Many of the individuals had experienced their streptococcal infections before <b>sulfonamide</b> or penicillin <b>therapy</b> was available, which is of importance because of the possible effect of therapy on antibody response (5, 7).

40|$|Forty-eight {{clinical}} {{strains of}} Mycobacterium fortuitum and 15 clinical strains of Mycobacterium chelonei were evaluated for susceptibility to sulfonamides, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ).

Thirty-six per-cent of the isolates of M. jortuitum were inhibited by 8 ~g of sulfonamide/ml, and 98070 were inhibited by 32 ~g/ml. None of the isolates of M. chelonei were inhibited at these concentrations, but 73 % were inhibited by 128 ug/ml, and 87 % were inhibited by 256 ~g/ml. Both species were highly resistant to TMP, and the combination TMP-SMZ (1 : 20) was no more active than was SMZ alone. The growth of M. chelonei on Mueller-Hinton agar required the addition of 10 % OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dex-trose, and catalase), and exact MICs were difficult to determine by agar dilutions because growth of the organism tended to diminish gradually over several dilutions.
