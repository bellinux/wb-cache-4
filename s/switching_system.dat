25|$|As {{the system}} was being developed, a further {{improvement}} was introduced that allowed for continuous following as opposed to periodic re-setting. The <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> was modified such that the range {{was sent to the}} upper line for 2.5milliseconds (ms), and the range and radiogoniometer signals for 7.5ms. If the signal was properly nulled, the two upper signals would mix and produce a single bright blip on the upper trace, while the lower trace would be nulled, as before. If the signal was not nulled, a faint second blip would appear to smear out the upper trace, noticeable even before the blip on the lower trace became visible.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state <b>switching</b> <b>system.</b> Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of components. The components do not interact with one another. Rather, they all interact with the same environment, which switches one of them on at each moment in time. In standard concurrency, a component restricts {{the environment of the}} other components, thus the concurrent system has fewer behaviors than its components. On the other hand, in a <b>switched</b> <b>system,</b> a component suggests an alternative to the other components, thus the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has richer behaviors than its components. We study finite-state <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> where each of the underlying components is a finite-state transducer. While the main challenge, namely compositionality, is similar in standard concurrent <b>systems</b> and in <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> the problems and solutions are different. In the verification front, we suggest and study an assumeguarantee paradigm for <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> and study formalisms in which satisfaction of a specification in all components imply its satisfaction in the <b>switched</b> <b>system.</b> In the synthesis front, we show that while compositional synthesis and design are undecidable, the problem of synthesizing a switching rule with which a given <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> satisfies an LTL specification is decidable. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} discuss the method of {{computing}} the viability kernel conveniently, we present some important features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> are dynamical systems that consist of {{a finite number of}} subsystems and a logical rule that orchestrates switching between these subsystems. Therefore, one of the features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> is multi-subsystem. In addition, <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> could not be guaranteed to be stable even if all subsystems are stable. Switching rule may be designed to stabilize <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> even if all subsystems are unstable. According to the discussion above, the computation of the viability kernel is affected by the switching rules and subsystems.|$|R
25|$|The {{concepts}} of digital switching {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype digital switch was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first digital switch to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{operator}} {{would then}} turn the entire receiver hut using a gear set connected to bicycle pedals, {{looking for the}} point when the signal disappeared, indicating that the target was now perfectly aligned between the two antennas. This null-seeking system was often used as it more sharply indicates locations; maximum signals tend to be spread out. If the target was not aligned, {{the presence of the}} signal could not indicate which direction to turn. To address this, an electrical <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> on the antenna feeds allowed them to be connected together in different phases, and by studying the way the blip changed as the switch was turned, the operator could determine which antenna was closer to the target, a process known as bracketing. The phasing system had been introduced by E.C. Slow, and became known as the Slowcock.|$|E

30|$|A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{a hybrid}} {{dynamical}} system {{consisting of a}} finite number of subsystems and a logical rule that manages switching between these subsystems. <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> have drawn {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years; see [1 – 37] and references therein. The motivation for studying <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> comes partly from the fact that <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>switched</b> multicontroller <b>systems</b> have numerous applications in control of mechanical systems, process control, automotive industry, power systems, aircraft and traffic control, and many other fields. An important qualitative property of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is stability [1 – 3]. The challenge of analyzing the stability of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> lies partly in the fact that, even if the individual systems are stable, the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> might be unstable. Using a common quadratic Lyapunov function on all subsystems, the quadratic Lyapunov stability facilitates the analysis and synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the obtained results within this framework have been recognized to be conservative. In [10], various algorithms both for stability and performance analysis of discrete-time piece-wise affine systems were presented. Different classes of Lyapunov functions were considered, and how to compute them through linear matrix inequalities was also shown. Moreover, the tradeoff between the degree of conservativeness and computational requirements was discussed. The problem of stability analysis and control synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> in the discrete-time domain was addressed in [11]. The approach followed in [11] looked at the existence of a switched quadratic Lyapunov function to check asymptotic stability of the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> under consideration. Two different linear matrix inequality-based conditions allow to check the existence of such a Lyapunov function. These two conditions have been proved to be equivalent for stability analysis.|$|R
