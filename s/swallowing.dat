5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or <b>swallowing.</b> It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during <b>swallowing</b> events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during <b>swallowing,</b> and positions in which <b>swallowing</b> is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E

5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult <b>swallowing,</b> called dysphagia, or painful <b>swallowing,</b> called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to <b>swallowing</b> that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{members of}} the <b>swallow</b> family Hirundinidae breed in North America: the tree <b>swallow</b> (Tachycineta bicolor), violet-green <b>swallow</b> (Tachycineta thalassina), purple martin (Progne subis), bank <b>swallow</b> (Riparia riparia), {{northern}} rough-winged <b>swallow</b> (Stelgidopteryx serripennis), barn <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo rustica), cave <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo fulva), and the cliff <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo pyrrhonota). Cliff and barn <b>swallows</b> are found throughout most of North America. Four basic conditions are found near most cliff and barn <b>swallow</b> nest sites: (1) an open habitat for foraging, (2) a suitable surface for nest attachment beneath an overhang or ledge, (3) a supply of mud of the proper consistency for nest building, and (4) a body of fresh water for drinking. All <b>swallows</b> are insectivores, catching a variety of insects. Cliff and barn <b>swallows</b> winter in South America. <b>Swallows</b> have a homing tendency toward previous nesting sites. Cliff <b>swallow</b> nests are gourd-shaped, enclosed structures with an entrance tunnel that opens downward. Cliff <b>swallows</b> usually begin laying eggs before the entrance tunnel is completed. Renesting will occur if nests or eggs are destroyed...|$|R

5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for <b>swallowing.</b> By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect <b>swallowing</b> and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke <b>swallowing,</b> and nut and handkerchief <b>swallowing</b> followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the Chilean <b>swallow,</b> most {{likely due to}} the similarity in morphology and calls. It is occasionally placed in the genus Iridoprocne with the tree <b>swallow,</b> mangrove <b>swallow,</b> white-winged <b>swallow,</b> and Chilean <b>swallow.</b> A study of the mitochondrial DNA of Tachycineta supports the split, although studies do show that the white-rumped <b>swallow</b> forms a superspecies, leucorrhoa, with the Chilean <b>swallow.</b> This species is monotypic, with no known subspecies.|$|R

50|$|Hybridization {{has been}} known to occur among the <b>swallows,</b> with a few cases {{involving}} violet-green <b>swallows</b> being reported. Breeding between violet-green <b>swallows</b> and both tree and barn <b>swallows</b> has been recorded on separate occasions, but resulting offspring were not observed. In 2000, the strange plumage of a <b>swallow</b> seen in British Columbia, Canada suggested the possible successful hybridization of a violet-green and cliff <b>swallow.</b> Nonetheless, these observations are rare hence why minimal research has looked into <b>swallow</b> hybridization.|$|R
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and <b>swallowing.</b> Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls <b>swallowing</b> and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on <b>swallowing,</b> secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The pons {{lies in the}} {{brainstem}} {{directly above}} the medulla. Among other things, it contains nuclei that control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep, respiration, <b>swallowing,</b> bladder function, equilibrium, eye movement, facial expressions, and posture.|$|E
5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} upper part of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the <b>swallowing</b> reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.|$|E

5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and <b>swallowing</b> which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific <b>swallowing</b> techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty <b>swallowing,</b> muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} not to be {{confused}} with the very similar blue-and-white <b>swallow,</b> which can be differentiated by the pale-footed <b>swallows</b> blackish flanks, and its faster flight.

40|$|The cliff <b>swallow</b> (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) {{could play}} an {{important}} role in the transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) because of its breeding ecology, reservoir competence status, and potentially high natural exposure rates. Cliff <b>swallows</b> nest within colonies and their nests are occupied year-round by <b>swallow</b> bugs (Oeciacus vicarius), hematophagus ectoparasites that feed primarily on cliff <b>swallows.</b> These parasites are likely exposed to WNV while feeding on infectious blood of nesting cliff <b>swallow</b> adults and nestlings and thus, if competent vectors, could contribute to seasonal elevations in WNV transmission. In addition, <b>swallow</b> bugs remain within nests year-round and therefore could provide a potential overwintering mechanism for WNV if persistently infected. To test the hypotheses that <b>swallow</b> bugs are competent vectors and become persistently infected with WNV, we experimentally inoculated cliff <b>swallow</b> nestlings, allowed <b>swallow</b> bugs to feed on these birds during the acute phase of infection, and then exposed naive cliff <b>swallow</b> nestlings to the same <b>swallow</b> bugs. In addition, a subset of <b>swallow</b> bugs that fed on infectious <b>swallow</b> nestlings was maintained through a simulated overwintering period. Although <b>swallow</b> bugs ingested infectious blood (up to 106. 8 plaque-forming units of WNV/mL serum) and subsequently blood-fed on naive <b>swallows,</b> no WNV transmission was detected, and all bugs tested WNV negative after the simulated overwintering period. Although many ecologic scenarios exist beyond the present study, our results suggest that <b>swallow</b> bugs may be unlikely to serve as competent biological vectors for WNV during active transmission periods or to reinitiate seasonal transmission...|$|R

The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E
5|$|Like other mambas {{the eastern}} green mamba {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. The toxicity of individual specimens can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and <b>swallowing,</b> irregular heartbeat and convulsions progressing to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or <b>swallowing</b> (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression).

Old barn <b>swallow</b> nests are also utilized by cave <b>swallows,</b> which will modify them to suit their needs. Barn <b>swallows</b> and cave <b>swallows</b> are observed to co-exist at some nesting sites, making old barn <b>swallow</b> nests easily available to the cave <b>swallow.</b> Cave <b>swallows</b> are social and prefer to nest in variably sized colonies.
