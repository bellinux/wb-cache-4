40|$|Optical {{freeform}} {{surfaces are}} crucial {{to the development of}} complex and optical-electromechanical devices used in many photonics products. The fabrication of high-quality freeform lens is based on ultra-precision freeform machining technology which allows direct machining of freeform surfaces with submicrometric form accuracy and nanometric surface finish. In this paper, the application of ultra-precision freeform machining to the fabrication of an optical freeform surface is addressed. The methodology {{for the development of the}} tool path generator for a progressive lens is discussed. According to the model of the freeform surface, which is represented by a double cubic B-spline surface, the method of changing parameters is used to calculate the numerically controlled (NC) machining tool path. The formula for calculating cutter location data, which considers the compensation of both the tool nose radius and tool <b>swing</b> <b>radius</b> of the fly cutter, is deduced. The cutting experiment of machining a freeform progressive optics lens by a multiaxis ultra-precision machine tool shows that the developed tool path generator can perform its function successfully.

Exploring the action mode and characteristics {{from him to}} provide a reference for all tennis learners to improve their forehand stroke. The results show that: (1) At {{the end of the}} preparation, Karen Khachanov’s center of gravity was lower, and his body control was steady; (2) After the follow through, each joint of Karen Khachanov’s racquet arm were stretched, so the <b>swing</b> <b>radius</b> is larger. His right leg was like a support point for the next stage [...] -drive leg and rotate hip; (3) At the swing stage, the move of his driving leg and rotating hip was full, so the whole hitting action match the principle whipping technique movement. (4) The “wiper “ style follow through was natural, coordinated, and smooth. After hitting the ball, his body of control was steady, the shoulder movement was obvious, and the hitting was fast and powerful. Conclusion: The forehand stroke of Karen Khachanov was a high quality hitting action, and it’s worthy of tennis players to learn from...|$|E

In order to study the factors influencing on the forming process of fibers in melt electrospinning, dropping process of fibers is recorded and analyzed via high speed video camera in the article. Results showed that there was an optimal spinning temperature for melt electrospinning of the polymer; the greater the voltage was, the more obvious stretching action on jet was. However, the voltage did not exceed a certain value, because there was a spinnable voltage limit corresponding to every receiving distance. When the spinning distance was generally short, the jet <b>swinging</b> <b>radius</b> decreased with increasing spinning distance; when the spinning distance was long, the jet was subject to the influence of the environment temperature easily. The changes of viscosity had dominant influence on the motion of jet...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: OSHA is {{revising}} the Cranes and Derricks Standard and related {{sections of the}} Construction Standard to update and specify industry work practices necessary to protect employees during the use of cranes and derricks in construction. This final standard also addresses advances in the designs of cranes and derricks, related hazards, and the qualifications of employees needed to operate them safely. Under this final rule, employers must determine whether the ground is sufficient to support the anticipated weight of hoisting equipment and associated loads. The employer is then be required to assess hazards within the work zone that would affect the safe operation of hoisting equipment, {{such as those of}} power lines and objects or personnel that would be within the work zone or <b>swing</b> <b>radius</b> of the hoisting equipment. Finally, the employer is required to 1 ensure that the equipment is in safe operating condition via required inspections and employees in the work zone are trained to recognize hazards {{associated with the use of}} the equipment and any related duties that they are assigned to perform.

40|$|Ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) can {{directly}} {{achieve the}} fabrication of threedimensional non-axisymmetric freeform components with nanometeric surface finish and submicrometric form accuracy. During {{the past few}} years, {{a lot of research}} on computerized numerical control (CNC) machining technologies has been conducted; however, little of this research makes any contribution to UPRM. This paper studies the mechanism of scallop height generation for UPRM. Through analyzing the cutting edge locus and the scallop height generation mechanism, a model for feed-intervals and for raster-interval scallop height generation, are presented. Parameters such as selection of feed direction (vertical cutting and horizontal cutting), feed rate, spindle speed, tool nose <b>radius,</b> <b>swing</b> distance, feed length and raster distance have been taken into consideration in the scallop generation models.

40|$|A {{pendulum}} {{model of}} a child swinging is formed from a mass hanging on a string that passes over a pulley and {{is attached to a}} fixed point. If the pendulum is started into motion with a small amplitude, it can be "pumped up" to a large amplitude {{in much the same way}} that a child pumps a swing. When the swing is at the low point of its oscillation, the support rope is gently pulled, decreasing the length of the pendulum and raising the center of mass of the weight representing the swinging child. This raising of the center of mass is what a child does when "pumping" the <b>swing.</b> When the <b>radius</b> of the pendulum gets shorter, conservation of angular momentum results in an increase in the speed of the swinging mass, adding mechanical energy to the swing and thus allowing it to rise higher. A more complete and exacting description of pumping a swing suggests parametric instability as the principal concept...|$|R
2500|$|In 1935, {{to compete}} with Mercedes Benz and Auto Union, Enzo Ferrari (Race team manager) and Luigi Bazzi (Designer) built a racer with two 3.2 (3.165-litre) engines, one {{in the front and}} one in the rear, giving 6.3litres and [...] The {{drivetrain}} layout was unusual. The two engines were connected by separate driveshaft to a gearbox with two input shafts, and two angled output shafts, so each of the rear wheels had its own driveshaft. It could never quite succeed against the Mercedes W25 B of Rudolf Caracciola, and was hard on fuel and tyres. The gain in speed was offset by increased pit times. On May 12, 1935, two were entered in the Tripoli Grand Prix driven by Nuvolari and Chiron who finished fourth and fifth. Chiron managed a second at the following 1935 Avus race. On June 16, 1935 Nuvolari drove a specially prepared Bimotore from Florence to Livorno and set a new speed record [...] with an average speed of over [...] After that it was sidelined in favour of the Tipo C. It was the first racer to use the Dubonnet independent trailing arm front suspension. The V12 was under development, but was not race ready. It was noticed that the Bimotore had a traction advantage on rough ground, so a version of the Bimotore chassis with the independent Dubonnet front end, and a new independent rear with <b>swing</b> axles with <b>radius</b> rods and a transverse leaf spring was used for the Tipo C 3.8s.|$|R
