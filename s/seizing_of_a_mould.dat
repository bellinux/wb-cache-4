40|$|In this study, the {{procedure}} of conventional cost {{calculation of the}} plastic injection moulds are programmed via Delphi programming modules. In the calculation, the mass properties of the designed part are directly obtained from AutoCAD program and, the machining periods of the mould parts are interactively estimated by using MasterCAM package. Both the data from MasterCAM and the mass properties from AutoCAD are transferred to the Delphi programming domain to calculate the mould cost. Consequently, the design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plastic injection <b>mould,</b> the manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> cavity and the cost calculation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> are evaluated in one programming procedure.
