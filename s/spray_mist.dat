25|$|Acute {{toxicity}} is dose-related; skin {{exposure to}} ready-to-use glyphosate formulations can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. These effects are {{probably due to}} the preservative benzisothiazolin-3-one. Severe skin burns are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but <b>spray</b> <b>mist</b> may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate.|$|E
25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine <b>spray</b> <b>mist</b> when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head.|$|E

Wallenda further remarked that the turbulent waters below made it difficult for him to see the wire. Before the walk, Jay Cochrane, a veteran wire walker who had unsuccessfully petitioned to walk Horseshoe Falls for 30 years, said of the local weather [...] "Unpredictable is a mild word.

5000|$|Cleaning {{is common}} in {{softwood}} plantations, clearcuts, and overstory removals, where the desired conifers are overtopped by rapidly growing early-successional hardwood species. Herbicides are often used in these cleaning operations because the correct chemical at the correct dose (e.g. glyphosate or triclopyr) and time will kill only broadleaved species, leaving the conifers unharmed and free to grow. Chemical treatments may be applied by foliage <b>sprays,</b> <b>mists</b> or pellets. This can be from a vehicle or by aerial spraying. Where chemicals are impractical or unpalatable to the landowner, a brush cutter is used to cut competing trees close to the ground.|$|R

50|$|The leading {{proposed}} {{method for}} marine cloud brightening is {{to generate a}} fine mist of salt from seawater, and to deliver into targeted banks of marine stratocumulus clouds from ships traversing the ocean.

The resulting <b>spray</b> <b>mist</b> must then be delivered continuously into target clouds over the ocean.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{earliest}} published studies, John Latham and Stephen Salter proposed {{a fleet of}} around 1500 unmanned Rotor ships, or Flettner ships, that would <b>spray</b> <b>mist</b> created from seawater into the air.

50|$|Various cloud {{reflectivity}} {{methods have}} been suggested, such as that proposed by John Latham and Stephen Salter, which works by spraying seawater in the atmosphere to increase the reflectivity of clouds. The extra condensation nuclei created by the spray will change the size distribution of the drops in existing clouds to make them whiter. The sprayers would use fleets of unmanned rotor ships known as Flettner vessels to <b>spray</b> <b>mist</b> created from seawater into the air to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from the Earth. The whitening effect is created by using very small cloud condensation nuclei, which whiten the clouds due to the Twomey effect.|$|E

Hernandez used a Border Toss to throw Drago {{out of the ring}} onto some believers, then tried to dive onto Drago, only for Drago to <b>spray</b> <b>mist</b> into his face in mid-air.

This {{cleared the way for}} preparations using bonding technology. In the same year, the paradento spray was introduced. The spray provides dentists with a successful prophylaxis and treatment method against marginal periodontal diseases. 1966 saw the introduction of Orotol, the care and disinfectant product for suction units. In 1968, the first fully automated X-ray film developer was developed and produced on behalf of Siemens under the name of Procomat. The year 1969 saw the introduction of the Dürr central suction systems which paved the way for modern multiple room surgery suction solutions.|$|E

Consumption of over 85 ml of concentrated product are likely to cause serious symptoms in adults including burns due to corrosive effects as well as kidney and liver damage. More severe cases cause [...] "respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, infiltration on chest X-ray, shock, arrhythmias, renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalaemia" [...] and death is often preceded by bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias.|$|E
