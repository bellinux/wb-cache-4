40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the damping {{in pressure}} compensated closed centre mobile working hydraulic systems. Both rotational and linear loads are covered and the analysis applies to {{any type of}} pump controller. Only the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> in the directional valve will provide damping to a pressure compensated system. Design rules are proposed for how the system should be dimensioned {{in order to obtain}} a high damping. The volumes {{on each side of the}} load have a high impact on the damping. In case of a small volume on the inlet side, the damping becomes low. However, the most important thing is to design the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> area properly. There exists an optimal orifice dimension for maximized damping; both smaller and larger orifice areas give lower damping independently of the volumes.

40|$|Hamilton Sundstrand {{is under}} {{contract}} with the NASA Johnson Space Center to develop a scalable, evaporative heat rejection system called the Multi-Fluid Evaporator (MFE). It is being designed to support the Orion Crew Module and to support future Constellation missions. The MFE would be used from Earth sea level conditions to the vacuum of space. The current Shuttle configuration utilizes an ammonia boiler and flash evaporator system to achieve cooling at all altitudes. The MFE system combines both functions into a single compact package with significant weight reduction and improved freeze-up protection. The heat exchanger core is designed so that radial flow of the evaporant provides increasing surface area to keep the back pressure low. The multiple layer construction of the core allows for efficient scale up to the desired heat rejection rate. The full scale MFE prototype will be constructed with four core sections that, combined with a novel control scheme, manage the risk of freezing the heat exchanger cores. A sub-scale MFE engineering development unit (EDU) has been built, and is identical {{to one of the}} four sections of a full scale prototype. The EDU has completed testing at Hamilton Sundstrand.

40|$|AbstractHigh Thrust Cryogenic Rocket Stages entail {{the use of}} a Vent and Relief Valve {{which can}} cater to a higher {{discharge}} rate. The Vent function is called for during ground servicing operations like tank chilling and pressurant replenishment and during flight {{to take care of the}} decrease in ambient pressure and boil-off losses. The Relief function acts as a redundant feature to protect the tanks from catastrophic failure due to structural damage caused by over-pressurization. Nevertheless, this valve needs to be characterized for both these functions during ground tests. This paper describes the modelling of and experimentation on an Inverted Type Pilot Operated Vent and Safety Valve. A mathematical model for simulating the dynamic behavior of this tank-mounted valve is developed. For this, a set of non-linear, first order, coupled ordinary differential equations, based on laws of conservation of mass and energy, are derived using fixed control volume approach. The numerical solution of these equations is obtained using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The pressure, temperature, flow rate, seat stress and lift thus obtained are plotted to find the characteristic parameters such as cracking pressure, full flow pressure, reseal pressure, opening and closing response, tank pressure decay rate and full flow rate.

40|$|Project (M. S., Civil Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Detention Basins (EDBs), an {{established}} stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP), {{are used to}} treat polluted stormwater runoff from urban areas and highways. Treatment occurs primarily through the settling of particles in the EDB. Typically, the design volume {{is based on a}} 2 -year storm event and is large enough to capture about 85 percent of the annual runoff. Effluent is discharged through an <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> typically sized to drain the entire basin in 24 to 48 hours. Because a high percentage of storm events are smaller than the typical design storm, the 2 -year storm, the storm events pass through the EDB quickly because of the relatively large <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> and receive little treatment. This project expands on previous investigations of strategies to increase hydraulic detention time and improve treatment in these devices. The strategy of interest is dividing an EDB with a partition wall, thus creating primary and secondary cells in series. The primary cell, equipped with a correspondingly small <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice,</b> captures and holds the frequent, smaller storm events. Large storm events overflow into the secondary cell and are treated there. The anticipated outcome is a longer average detention time and better total suspended solids (TSS) removal. An ExcelTM Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) computer model was created to simulate EDBs with and without a partition wall. The software can model irregularly-shaped basins and internal cells with unequal volumes. Hourly rainfall is converted to runoff using the Rational Method and routed through hypothetical EDBs. Detention times for each storm event are calculated from the time difference between the centroids of the influent and effluent hydrographs. In this project, 50 years of historic hourly rainfall data from Orange County, California were passed through a one-cell (unpartitioned) EDB and three partitioned EDBs with primary cells sized for 75, 50, and 25 percent of the design volume. Model results showed that event mean hydraulic detention times were increased in the partitioned EDBs by 64 to 94 percent compared to the one-cell control EDB. The longest detention time was achieved in the EDB with the smallest primary cell. Partitioning also increased the volume-weighted mean hydraulic detention times by 36 to 60 percent, but the longest detention time in this case was achieved in the EDB with the largest primary cell. Compared to the one-cell EDB, the total volume of water that overflowed the EDB (i. e. exceeded the design volume) over the 50 -year hydrologic record decreased slightly for the basin with a 75 -percent design volume primary cell, but increased for the other two cases with smaller primary cells. Direct modeling of TSS was not attempted in this project. When the calculated detention times are applied to TSS removal curves from the literature, though, event mean TSS removal was estimated to increase by up to 6 percentage points due to adding an internal partition.

40|$|Spray profile {{measurements}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the underflow rate, and consequently, be related to hydrocyclone performance. The flow geometry of the spray discharge is found to arise from velocity patterns at the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice.</b> Through a videographic example of an industrial hydrocyclone, it is shown that underflow profiles are typically parabolic, a feature which is indicative of the velocity at which the fluid exits. The inclusion of gravity in this model clearly highlights deficiencies in currently used models. Moreover, an intimate knowledge of factors affecting the profiles of the underflow of a cyclone is essential for the correct interpretation of videographic images. Subsequently, image data are used to estimate outlet velocities, which give an excellent insight into various fluid mechanical phenomena that are not appreciated by analysing basic operational variables. The exit velocities are used to calculate underflow rates, which are related to mass recovery in the underflow. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a solution enabling lower losses in hydraulic actuator systems. A mobile fluid power system often contains several different actuators supplied {{with a single}} load sensing pump. One of the main advantages is the need of only one system pump. This makes the fluid power system compact and cost-effective. A hydraulic load often consists of two ports, e. g. motors and cylinders. Such loads have traditionally been controlled by a valve that controls these ports by one single control signal, namely {{the position of the}} spool in a control valve. In this kind of valve, the inlet (meter-in) and <b>outlet</b> (meter-out) <b>orifices</b> are mechanically connected. The mechanical connection makes the system robust and easy to control, {{at the same time as}} the system lacks flexibility. Some of the main drawbacks are The fixed relation between the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>orifices</b> in most applications produce too much throttling at the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> under most operating conditions. This makes the system inefficient. The flow directions are fixed for a given spool position; therefore, no energy recuperation and/or regeneration ability is available. In this thesis a novel system idea enabling, for example, recuperation and regeneration is presented. Recuperation is when flow is taken from a tank, pressurized by external loads, and then fed back into the pump line. Regeneration is when either cylinder chambers (or motor ports) are connected to the pump line. Only one system pump is needed. Pressure compensated (load independent), bidirectional, poppet valves are proposed and utilized. The novel system presented in this thesis needs only a position sensor on each compensator spool. This simple sensor is also suitable for identification of mode switches, e. g. between normal, differential and regenerative modes. Patent pending. The balance of where to put the functionality (hardware and/or software) makes it possible to manoeuvre the system with maintained speed control in the case of sensor failure. The main reason is that the novel system does not need pressure transducers for flow determination. Some features of the novel system: Mode switches The mode switches are accomplished without knowledge about the pressures in the system Throttle losses With the new system approach, choice of control and measure signals, the throttle losses at the control valves are reduced Smooth mode switches The system will switch to regenerative mode automatically in a smooth manner when possible Use energy stored in the loads The load, e. g. a cylinder, is able to be used as a motor when possible, enabling the system to recuperate overrun loads The system and its components are described together with the control algorithms that enable energy efficient operation.

Tests were carried out with three different orifice plates with area ratios (orifice area to swirler exit area ratio) between 1. 0 to 0. 7 using 280 mm inside diameter combustor of 1000 mm length. Tests were conducted using commercial diesel as fuel. Fuel was injected at the back plate of the 60 o vane angle swirler outlet using central fuel injector with single fuel nozzle pointing axially outwards. The aim of the insertion of orifice plates was to create the swirler pressure loss at the swirler outlet phase so that the swirler outlet shear layer turbulence was maximised to assist with fuel/air mixing. In the present work, orifice plate with smaller area ratios exhibited very low NOX emissions for the whole operating equivalence ratios. NOX reduction of more than 15 percent was achieved for orifice with 0. 7 area ratio compared to area ratio of 1. 0.

The aim was to show that small turbulent flames could achieve compact ultra-low NOx water heating. Low NOx was achieved using lean well mixed low flame temperature combustion with a 0. 7 equivalence ratio (Ø). Thermal NOx formation was also minimised by cooling the flame downstream of the swirler outlet. A water cooled heat transfer coil was traversed into the flame to determine how close to the swirler exit the heat transfer could occur, without a major increase in the combustion inefficiency. This was shown to be 70 mm from the radial swirler throat outlet. Rapid fuel and air mixing was achieved using fuel injection through {{the wall of the}} 76 mm swirler outlet throat, assisted by a 41 mm diameter <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> at the exit of the 76 mm internal diameter wall fuel injector.

Then, a simulation model of the fuel injector is built and verified. Sensitivity analyses are made for both the pilot injection and the full injection event, for the purpose of understanding which parameters affect the injector outputs. Finally, both the pilot injection and the full injection event are optimized in order to reach the emission and efficiency targets. The sensitivity analysis clearly shows that the most important parameters affecting the injector performance are the inlet, <b>outlet</b> and filling <b>orifices.</b> Naturally, also the number of nozzle holes and the hole diameters play a crucial role, a smaller flow area resulting in a faster pilot injection but less injected quantity in a full injection. The pressure step and the needle spring have a lesser impact. The geometry of the needle tip is also important but hard to model accurately. In the studied injector, the control valve was so fast that it did not restrict the pilot injection speed. After optimizing the model, {{it was clear that the}} size of the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> needs to be increased, and that the sizes of the inlet and filling orifice can be kept roughly the same...|$|R

The comparisons are done between various quantities like pressure of steam, mass flow rate, velocity of air, and temperature difference of inlet <b>steam</b> and <b>Outlet</b> <b>steam.</b> It is found that mass flow rate of condensed steam decreases with decrease in pressure of Steam. It also decreases with decrease in Temperature difference. So the capacity of Air cooled condenser is sometimes limited by ambient conditions, but due to other problems concerned with reduced availability of water as the cooling medium for the condensation of exhaust steam, combined with an increased emphasis on environmental considerations. {{it is still a}} better alternative than traditional steam surface condenser...|$|R
