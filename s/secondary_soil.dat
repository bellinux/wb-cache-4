The development of the composite risk index for <b>secondary</b> <b>soil</b> salinization was presented through a case study in the Yinchuan Plain of China. Fourteen risk factors were selected in terms of three PSR criteria: pressure, state, and response. The results showed that the salinity risk in the Yinchuan Plain was strongly influenced by the subsoil and groundwater salinity, land use, and depth to groundwater. To maintain agricultural sustainability in the Yinchuan Plain, a suite of remedial and preventative actions were proposed to manage soil salinity in the regions that are affected by salinity at different levels and by different salinization processes. The weight sensitivity analysis results also showed that the overall salinity risk of the Yinchuan Plain would increase o...|$|E

Excessive logging, mining and {{shifting}} cultivation contribute to deforestation in Sarawak. The objectives of this study were to: (i) Quantify soil Organic Matter (SOM), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and Humic Acids (HA) in rehabilitated and <b>secondary</b> forest <b>soils</b> and (ii) Compare SOM, SOC and HA sequestrations of both forests. Approach: Soil samples were collected from a 16 year old rehabilitated forest and a secondary forest at Universiti Putra Malaysia, Bintulu Campus. Fifteen samples were taken at random with a soil auger at 0 - 20 cm and 20 - 40 cm depths. The bulk densities at these depths were determined by the coring method. The bulk density method was used to quantify the total C (TC), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Organic Matter (OM), Humic Acids (HA) and total N at the stated sampling depths. Results: Regardless of forest soil type and depth, the amount of SOM of the two forests was similar. Except for 20 - 40 cm of the <b>secondary</b> forest <b>soil</b> whereby the quantity of total C sequestered was significantly lower than that of the rehabilitated forest soil, C sequestration was similar irrespective of forest type and depth. Nevertheless, stable C (organic carbon) sequestered in HA was generally higher in the rehabilitated forest soil compared with the <b>secondary</b> forest <b>soil.</b> This was attributed to higher yield of HA in the rehabilitated forest soil partly due to better humification at 20 - 40 cm in the rehabilitated forest soil. Conclusion: Hence, the findings suggest that organic C in HA realistically reflects C sequestration in the soils of the two forests investigated...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Salinisation {{is a major}} {{environmental}} hazard that reduces agricultural yields and degrades arable land. Two main categories of salinisation are: primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>soil</b> salinisation. While primary soil salinisation is caused by natural processes, <b>secondary</b> <b>soil</b> salinisation is caused by human factors. Incorrect irrigation practices are the major contributor to <b>secondary</b> <b>soil</b> salinisation. Because of low costs and less time {{that is associated with}} the use of remote sensing techniques, remote sensing data is used in this study to identify and map salinised irrigated land between Upington and Keimoes, Northern Cape Province, in South Africa. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of digital aerial imagery in identifying salinised cultivated land. Two methods were used to realize this aim. The first method involved visually identifying salinised areas on NIR, and NDVI images and then digitizing them onscreen. In the second method, digital RGB mosaicked, stacked, and NDVI images were subjected to unsupervised image classification to identify salinised land. Soil samples randomly selected and analyzed for salinity were used to validate the results obtained from the analysis of aerial photographs. Both techniques had difficulties in identifying salinised land because of their inability to differentiate salt induced stress from other forms of stress. Visual image analysis was relatively successful in identifying salinised land than unsupervised image classification. Visual image analysis correctly identified about 55 % of salinised land while only about 25 % was identified by unsupervised classification. The two techniques predict that an average of about 10 % of irrigated land is affected by salinisation in the study area. This study found that although visual analysis was time consuming and cannot differentiate salt induced stress from other forms; it is fairly possible to identify areas of crop stress using digital aerial imagery. Unsupervised classification was not successful in identifying areas of crop stress...|$|E

40|$|River water {{composition}} (major ion and Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratio) was monitored on {{a monthly}} basis over a period of three years from a mountainous river (Nethravati River) of southwestern India. The total dissolved solid (TDS) concentration is relatively low (46 mg L- 1) with silica being the dominant contributor. The basin is characterised by lower dissolved Sr concentration (avg. 150 nmol L- 1), with radiogenic Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 isotopic ratios (avg. 0. 72041 at outlet). The composition of Sr and Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 and their correlation with silicate derived cations in the river basin reveal that their dominant source is from the radiogenic silicate rock minerals. Their composition in the stream is controlled by a combination of physical and chemical weathering occurring in the basin. The molar ratio of SiO 2 /Ca and Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 isotopic ratio show strong seasonal variation in the river water, i. e., low SiO 2 /Ca ratio with radiogenic isotopes during non-monsoon and higher SiO 2 /Ca with less radiogenic isotopes during monsoon season. Whereas, the seasonal variation of Rb/Sr ratio in the stream water is not significant suggesting that change in the mineral phase being involved in the weathering reaction could be unlikely for the observed molar SiO 2 /Ca and Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 isotope variation in river water. Therefore, the shift in the stream water chemical composition could be attributed to contribution of ground water which is in contact with the bedrock (weathering front) during non-monsoon and weathering of <b>secondary</b> <b>soil</b> minerals in the regolith layer during monsoon. The <b>secondary</b> <b>soil</b> mineral weathering leads to limited silicate cation and enhanced silica fluxes in the Nethravati river basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Nitrate pollution in <b>secondary</b> salinization <b>soil</b> {{is regarded as}} having potential effects on soil microbial communities. Our {{study was conducted to}} evaluate effects of <b>secondary</b> salinization on <b>soil</b> microbial functional diversity with the BIOLOG method. The results showed that Average well-color development (AWCD) values declined with the rising of nitrate concentrations to some extent. The results also exhibited that the accumulation of nitrate in soil decreased the carbon sources utilization rates and the microbial species diversity indices. It indicated that nitrate has significantly negative effects on the sole-carbon-source metabolic ability of soil microbial communities. The cluster analysis intuitively demonstrated the distance and relationship between each sample: soil samples with high nitrate content were more close to each other, while soil samples with low were more similar in distances. The principal component analysis (PCA) result further validated that nitrate was inversely correlated to microbial carbon sources utilization intensity and microbial diversity. The four carbon substrates, Carbohydrates, Miscellaneous, Amino acids and Polymers, could reflect most of the information about carbon sources utilization.
