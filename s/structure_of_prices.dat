This separation is required to allow for neoclassical economics to base their theory on utility value and for Marxists to base the labour theory of value on quantified abstract labour.

40|$|The paper assesses {{inflation}} risks {{resulting from}} the convergence <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>prices</b> in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries toward the European Union (EU).

The authors find that the degree of differences in the <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>prices</b> in transition economies vis-Ã -vis EU economies has a strong negative relationship to price levels in the transition economies.

5000|$|Some critics {{conclude}} that because Marx fails to [...] "transform" [...] value magnitudes into price magnitudes {{in a way}} consistent with formal logic, he has not proved value exists, or that it influences prices; in turn, his theory of labour-exploitation must be false. But the validity of Marx's value theory or his exploitation theory may {{not depend on the}} validity of his specific transformation procedures, and Marxian scholars indeed often argue that critics mistake what he intended by them. In particular, since value relations - according to Marx - describe the proportionalities between average quantities of labour-time currently required to produce products, value proportions between products exist quite independently of prices (and irrespective of whether goods are currently priced or not). As the structure of product-values changes across time, the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> is likely to change as well, but product-prices will fluctuate above or below product-values and typically respond to changing value proportions only with a certain time lag.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the measurement of}} hedging efficiency. It is argued that conventional measures of the efficiency of risk management operations my be unreliable in commodities where the available hedge represents {{the value of the}} commodity for forward, rather than prompt, delivery. Considerable biases can arise when the time <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> is not considered, which tend to lead to overstatement of the efficiency of the hedging vehicle. As an alternative we propose the use of simulations of hedges. The use of simulations not only produces very different results to standard financial formulae, but also demonstrates the sensitivity of the effectiveness of hedging to the time <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices.</b> This produces some direct inferences for optimal hedging behaviour. Our simulations consider how effective crude oil futures are for the hedging of various streams of tradeable crude oil. The futures contracts, used alone in a hedging strategy, are shown to perform unpredictably in the hedging of dated Brent, which is the direct price index for some 16 million barrels per day of crude oil trade, and whose influence, particularly in the Far East, is still expanding. We contend that the reason for this poor hedging performance is the non-randomness of the basis risk between futures and prompt crude oil. This basis tends to trend, and we consider hedging effectiveness in three regimes, contangos and both narrowing and widening backwardations. We find that the hedging effectiveness is highly dependent on the time structure regime. Because of the potential size and volatility of the basis, under some conditions using futures as a hedging instrument can produce more risk than unhedged positions. This also has implications for market structure, with the development of informal markets to help hedge the risk that can not be hedged by the use of the futures. The implication of our analysis is that the potential gains are considerable for futures market users who are unable, or unwilling, to access the subsidiary informal markets, should a futures contract whose value more closely proxies that of dated Brent be available...|$|E

Because of the stochastic intensities of the cross-exciting point processes, the optimality condition cannot be formulated using classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJBQVI), so we extend the framework of constrained forward backward stochastic differential equation (CFBSDE) to solve our optimal control problem...|$|E
