5|$|The {{book had}} some very careful readers; the ornithologist Alfred Newton noticed that Rennie had used an {{identical}} paragraph to describe two birds, the beam bird (now called the <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher)</b> and the pied flycatcher, though their descriptions were separated by 300 pages.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>flycatchers</b> hunt from {{conspicuous}} perches, making sallies {{after passing}} flying insects, and often {{returning to the}} same perch. Their upright posture is characteristic.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{animal species}} in the wood include badgers, roe deer, kingfishers, <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> sparrowhawks, <b>spotted</b> and green woodpeckers, as well as Natterer's, noctule, pipistrelle, brown long-eared and Daubenton's bats.|$|R
25|$|Thousands {{of birds}} pass through {{each year on}} their way to their {{breeding}} or wintering grounds. Chiffchaffs, goldcrests and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, whitethroats and <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} similar to the common migrant, the <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> Muscicapa striata, but is smaller and darker, {{especially}} on the underparts, than that species. <b>Spotted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> also has a streaked forehead, a feature not shown by the African dusky flycatcher.|$|E
50|$|Birds on {{the reserve}} include nuthatch, green {{woodpecker}} and <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most summers {{the village}} {{supports}} {{a number of}} pairs of nesting <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|A path runs a long a canalised {{part of the}} River Gipping, and {{the site}} also has reedbeds, a ditch and {{grassland}} with tall herbs. There are uncommon wetland flora, and birds include <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> kingfishers and reed buntings.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, 16 million birds {{flew from}} Africa to Britain. Swifts have {{declined}} 40% between 1994 and 2007. Nightingales are down 60% since 1994, wood warblers 67% down, turtle doves 66% down, <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers</b> down 59%, and cuckoos down 37%.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{this site}} is a working farm which is managed by a tenant farmer, and it also has {{wildlife}} habitats and an education centre. Birds include little owls, <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers</b> and pied wagtails, and there are ponds with great crested newts.|$|R
5000|$|Muscicapa striata, the <b>Spotted</b> <b>Flycatcher,</b> a {{passerine}} {{bird species}} found in Europe and western Asia ...|$|E
50|$|Recorded for {{the site}} are <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> fieldfare, goldfinch, marsh tit, jay, green {{woodpecker}}, great spotted woodpecker and lesser spotted woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|The first formal {{description}} of the Mediterranean flycatcher was by Guido Schiebel in 1910 who considered it as a subspecies of the <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and gave it the trinomial name Muscicapa striata tyrrhenica. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2016 found that the subspecies M. s. tyrrhenica and M. s. balearica were genetically similar to each other but {{significantly different from the}} other <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> subspecies. The authors proposed that these insular subspecies should be considered as a separate species.|$|E
50|$|The bird-life of {{the formal}} areas is typical of parkland in {{southern}} England. Nuthatches like the old timber; <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers</b> the more open ground; and redwings and fieldfares the more open ground yet. Common and black-headed, and sometimes lesser black-backed and herring, gulls form loose flocks on the lower reaches towards the Gade.|$|R
50|$|Highnam Wood is {{a nature}} reserve located in Gloucestershire and {{established}} by the RSPB to protect bird species in the region. A two-kilometre nature trail passes through the park, giving tourists a view of Britain's rarest breeding woodpecker species, the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker. Marsh Tit, Nightingale, Song Thrush, and <b>Spotted</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> also frequent the park.|$|R
50|$|The {{park was}} {{previously}} {{the grounds of}} the eighteenth-century Morden Park House, which is now Grade II listed and used as Council offices. In 1945 the house and park were purchased by Merton and Morden Urban District Council. Some oaks are over 300 years old, and bird species include green and great spotted woodpeckers, coal tits and <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> Grassland areas have wildflowers and a range of butterflies.|$|R
50|$|Species seen: Dartford warbler, Cetti's warbler, Montagu's harrier, great spotted woodpecker, redstart, <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> stonechat, linnet, tree pipit, nightjar, mute swan, chaffinch, {{reed warbler}} and Sandwich tern.|$|E
50|$|Trees {{include the}} {{uncommon}} wild service tree, and breeding birds include <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> lesser whitethroat, reed bunting and skylark. Featherstone Hill is a partly wooded {{hill in the}} south west of the site.|$|E
50|$|Felton Common {{is a local}} {{nature reserve}} which {{consists}} of open calcareous grassland with scrub and bracken. There are birds including kestrel, sky lark, song thrush, willow warbler, <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and several species of invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Limestone weathers down {{quickly to}} produce {{nutrient}} rich alkaline soils on well drained rocks. Gouging by glacial meltwaters has left spectacular valleys along whose floors run attractive streams. The limestone streams with their nutrient rich waters support {{an abundance of}} aquatic invertebrates such as insect larvae and crustaceans. These in turn support such fish as trout and grayling. Insects which emerge from the water in summer are also {{a rich source of}} food for birds. Grey wagtails, swallows and <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are commonly seen. Dippers and kingfishers are also typical. The otter, after a period of decline, is starting to recolonise the rivers and streams.|$|R
60|$|Character? I {{know not}} how much variety of {{character}} {{there may be}} between birds {{of the same species}} but between species and species the variety is endless, and is shown--as I fondly believe--in the difference of their notes. Each has its own speech, inarticulate, expressing not thought but hereditary feeling; save a few birds who, like those little dumb darlings, the <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> seem to have absolutely nothing to say, and accordingly have the wit to hold their tongues; and devote the whole of their small intellect to sitting on the iron rails, flitting off them a yard or two to catch a butterfly in air, and flitting back with it to their nest.|$|R
25|$|Ulva {{is known}} for its wildlife, which is usual for many Scottish islands, {{includes}} many varieties of seabirds. A number of raptors breed on the island including buzzards, golden eagles and sea eagles. Game birds include snipe, grouse, pheasant, and woodcock. White-tailed eagles, which were reintroduced in the nearby Island of Rùm have migrated to Mull, where they now have a stronghold - they can occasionally be seen on Ulva, but are not known to nest there. Ravens also breed here. Puffin, black-legged kittiwakes, shag, common and Arctic tern, gannets, eider ducks, oystercatchers, curlews, redshanks, red-breasted mergansers and gulls nest on the island and the surrounding waters provide a livelihood for numerous seabirds. Occasional visitors (usually not breeding) include - house martins, Leach's storm petrel, corncrakes (which are rare in the British Isles), peregrine falcons and <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatchers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most passerines moult {{their primary}} flight {{feathers}} in sequence beginning near {{the body and}} proceeding outwards along the wing. The <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is unusual in replacing the outer flight feathers before those nearer the body.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the site}} is grassland, which has a rich variety of wildlife, {{including}} locally unusual plants such as grass vetchling, devil's-bit scabious, pepper-saxifrage. Birds which breed on the site include bullfinch, <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> lesser spotted woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|Bill visits {{farmland}} in Norfolk in late July. Species seen: stone curlew, grey partridge, sky lark, corn bunting, red-legged partridge, barn owl, little owl, tree sparrow, linnet, European goldfinch, yellowhammer, reed bunting, barn swallow, house martin, Eurasian reed warbler, <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the impressive numbers of breeding seabirds, {{it is a good}} UK site for passage migrants, including chiffchaff, willow warblers, whitethroat, redstart, and <b>spotted</b> and pied <b>flycatchers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bankpura Fort is {{home for}} not only for peafowl, but also {{a number of other}} birds like wood pecker, great-horned owl, babbler, magpie, robin, green bee eater, nightjar, <b>spotted</b> maina, paradise <b>flycatcher,</b> Indian robin, <b>spotted</b> dove, parakeets, kingfisher, grey hornbill, blue tailed bee eater, blacked winged kite, tailor bird etc.|$|R
50|$|Mammals that inhabit this {{national}} park are especially the cougar, black bear, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, snowshoe hare, weasel, mole, beaver, red fox, porcupine, skunk, marmot, deer, marten, shrew, pika, elk, and mountain goat. The common birds of this park including raptors are the thrush, chickadee, kinglet, northern goshawk, willow <b>flycatcher,</b> <b>spotted</b> owl, steller's jay, Clark's nutcracker, bald eagle, ptarmigan, harlequin duck, grouse, peregrine falcon, gray jay, golden eagle, grosbeak and finch.|$|R

50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Muscicapa striata) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the Old World flycatcher family. It breeds in most of Europe {{and western}} Asia, and is migratory, wintering in Africa and south western Asia. It is declining in parts of its range.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} typical {{unimproved}} London Clay grassland. Damp, herb rich areas have uncommon plants characteristic of old meadows such as great burnet, sneezewort and devil's bit scabious. The brook is lined by sedges and water-cress, while breeding birds include yellowhammer and <b>spotted</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The meadows {{are found}} {{on the western side}} of the park hidden behind the {{barbecue}} areas and Adventure playground to the east. Its southern boundary joins Coed Waunpiod west. The two meadows are divided and largely encapsulated by a mature hedgerow. “The meadows have considerable ecological value, both for low-growing plants and related insect such as butterflies. In addition, many woodland marginal species occur here along the hedgerows, including, whitethroat, <b>spotted</b> and pied <b>flycatcher</b> and redstarts" ...|$|R
40|$|This new {{checklist}} updates {{and replaces}} the Natural History Society of Newfoundland and Labrador publication Checklist (1999) of the Birds of Insular Newfoundland and its Continental Shelf Waters by B.
