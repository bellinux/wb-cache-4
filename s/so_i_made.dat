500|$|Cameron {{explained}} forfeiting {{his share}} as complex. [...] "...the short version {{is that the}} film cost proportionally much more than [...] and True Lies. Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. Titanic also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more," [...] he said. [...] "As the producer and director, I {{take responsibility for the}} studio that's writing the checks, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{whole time}} I {{definitely}} was thinking, 'Everyone knows, everyone can see.'...I {{just wanted to}} give everything I could... When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at the same time. I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> sure I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Rundgren {{contacted}} Moogy Klingman, {{who would}} appear on several tracks and later co-found Utopia with Rundgren. Rundgren instructed Klingman {{to find the}} best session players possible for the recording. Klingman recalled getting a phone call from Rundgren late on a Friday evening asking him to find a full band by Sunday morning: [...] "He wanted horns, singers, everything, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a ton of phone calls." [...] Klingman said that not everyone could make the entire session, so a variety of musicians, particularly guitarists and bassists, needed to be used. The performers, including Rundgren himself, only rehearsed the songs a few times before committing the performance to tape, in order to sound spontaneous, and some of the banter between takes appears on the finished album.|$|E

500|$|As a young man, {{despite his}} dance talent, Sims {{aspired to be}} not a {{professional}} dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively {{to the way he}} would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E
500|$|He remixed Kanye West's song, [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone", {{renaming}} the {{new version}} as [...] "Conflict Diamonds". With this remix, Fiasco wished {{to raise awareness of}} the conflict diamond business. This caught West's attention, and he asked Fiasco to perform on the song [...] "Touch the Sky" [...] for West's album Late Registration. The song, which sampled Curtis Mayfield's [...] "Move On Up", became a hit in the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number forty-two. After this success, Fiasco's first single [...] "Kick, Push" [...] was released earlier than expected. The song was a love story about two people sharing a passion for skateboarding, a topic generally not discussed in hip-hop. [...] Fiasco explained, [...] " [...] just as deep as hip-hop. I'm not the greatest skateboarder, but I'm a damn good rapper, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a damn good skateboarding song." [...] The single, and its accompanying music video, helped Fiasco get attention in the hip-hop community, and was later nominated for two 2007 Grammy Awards. During this time, he recorded guest performances on Tha' Rayne's [...] "Kiss Me" [...] and [...] "Didn't You Know" [...] singles, and also on K Foxx's 2004 [...] "This Life".|$|E
500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Sevigny became rebellious: [...] "I was very well-mannered, {{and my mother}} was very strict. But I did hang out at the Mobil station and smoke cigarettes." [...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> my own clothes." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the letters}} was from Bannon, asking for {{professional}} assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day I {{have no idea why}} she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E
500|$|Speculation over Hamnet's {{influence}} on Shakespeare's works {{is not limited}} to Hamlet. Richard Wheeler theorises that Hamnet's death influenced the writing of Twelfth Night, which centres on a girl who believes that her twin brother has died. In the end, she finds that her brother never died, but is alive and well. Wheeler also posits the idea that the women who disguise themselves as men in The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night are a representation of William Shakespeare's seeing his son's hope in his daughters after Hamnet's death. Bill Bryson argues that Constance's speech from the third act of King John (written mid-1590s) was inspired by Hamnet's death. In the speech she laments the loss of her son, Arthur. It is possible, though, that Hamnet was still alive when Constance's lament was written. Many other plays of Shakespeare's have theories surrounding Hamnet. These include questions as to whether a scene in Julius Caesar, in which Caesar adopts Mark Antony as a replacement for his dead son is related to Hamnet's death, or whether Romeo and Juliet is a tragic reflection of the loss of a son, or Alonso's guilt over his son's death in The Tempest is related. Sonnet 37 may have also been written in response to Hamnet's death. Shakespeare says in it, [...] "As a decrepit father takes delight / To see his active child do deeds of youth / <b>So</b> <b>I,</b> <b>made</b> lame by fortune's dearest spight / Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth." [...] Still, if this is an allusion to Hamnet, it is a vague one. The grief can echo also {{in one of the most}} painful passages Shakespeare ever wrote, in the end of King Lear where the ruined monarch recognizes his daughter is dead: [...] "No, no, no life! / Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, / And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more, / Never, never, never, never, never!" ...|$|E

Some critics have said that I turned my figures into puppets, as if my aim were to hint at the hard {{economic}} necessities that drove them. To say the truth, I was not thinking very much about the people. I did not care {{for them in the}} way a social reformer does. They are part of a private beauty that haunted me. I loved them and the houses in the same way: as part of a vision.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the long}} {{production}} of Ashes of Time, Wong faced a two-month break {{as he waited}} for equipment to re-record sound for some scenes. He was in a negative state, feeling heavy pressure from his backers and worrying about another failure, and so decided to start a new project: [...] "I thought I should do something to make myself feel comfortable about making films again. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> Chungking Express, which I made like a student film." [...] Conceived and completed within only six weeks, the new project ended up being released two months before Ashes of Time.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he wrote}} [...] "This Town Ain't Big Enough For Both of Us", Ron could only play {{it in that}} key. It was so much work to {{transpose}} the song and one of us had to budge, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain't a [...] "rock" [...] voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about [...] "guts". It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{backdrop}} of World War II, Diana frequently pontificated {{on the need to}} preserve the morally supreme ideals of democracy from the threat of Nazis, even in private to her sister. When doing so, she made no attempt to reconcile her democratic sentiments with their Amazonian system of hereditary monarchy, to which Diana herself was heiress apparent. [...] Likewise, in each of the first two one-hour episodes, Diana asserted that the Nazis had no regard for their women, ignoring the vastly lower value which her own people placed upon men. [...] So common were the Nazi and war events that Carter frequently complained about it, explaining: [...] "I yelled when the scripts were bad. Week after week, nothing...would change except the names of the villains. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> noise. Men don't like dealing with women who make demands." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{martial arts}} {{sequences}} were choreographed by Sammo Hung, who also {{worked on the}} choreography for the first film. Prior to principal photography, Hung had undergone a major cardiac surgery. When {{he returned to the}} set, his dramatic scenes in the film were filmed first, with his fight sequences being filmed last. Hung performed his own stunts in the film, which led to him receiving several injuries during filming. While filming a scene, Hung was struck in the face by co-star Darren Shahlavi. He insisted on completing the shoot before going to the hospital. Not wanting his injuries to hinder the production progress, Hung spent five hours trying to complete the scene before going to the hospital for four stitches. After the completion of filming, Hung expressed that he was dissatisfied with the fight sequences involving his character, presumably due to his heart condition. He also stated that he plans to challenge Yen in a future film: [...] "Although I'm the martial arts choreographer, our moves were all rather regulated, being confined by the script. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a pact with Donnie Yen to have a rematch next year if the opportunity arises." ...|$|E
