40|$|Many grapevine cultivars {{are grown}} in Croatia, {{most of which}} are {{considered}} to be autochthonous. Mass positive selection together with <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> of 15 economically important cultivars was initiated. To this aim, visual observations were made for the presence of virus-induced symptoms. Samples of dormant canes were collected from vines with positive agronomic traits and no visible symptoms of virus infection. Th e presence of four economically important viruses was evaluated using ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) : two nepoviruses, Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) and Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV) and two closteroviruses Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV- 1) and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV- 3). Th e Survey of virus diseases in commercial vineyards of diff erent vine-growing regions of Croatia disclosed a widespread presence of viruses and a low occurrence of non-infected vines. Th is is true especially for the coastal region where not a single healthy plant could be found for certain cultivars. Although no visible symptoms were observed, it was not rare to detect multiple infections by two or even three viruses. Th e most widespread virus in Dalmatia was GFLaV- 3 with approximately 80 % of vines infected. In the northern regions almost half of the analysed plants were negative in ELISA and the most represented virus was GLRaV- 1.

40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} first stage {{in the development of}} a new sanitary landfill* is the selection of the site to be used. The inappropriate selection of a site can contribute to the bad image and reputation affecting landfill operations. Landfill site selection is a step-by-step process, in which environmental, engineering and economic criteria are applied successively. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) constitutes the first and most crucial stage in this selection process, aiming to quantify the impacts according to the natural characteristics of the sites. A method is presented to facilitate the proper selection of a landfill site for municipal waste. The method follows specific principles, called "selection criteria", the aim of which are to compare the considered sites to a hypothetical "ideal one". As a result the more a site matches the ideal and fulfils the criteria requirements, the more suitable it is as a landfill site. A case study for Athens, Greece is presented in an Appendix.

40|$|A two-year {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the chemical characteristics of leachate derived from domestic refuse typical of that found for Honolulu, Hawaii, and to determine the removal characteristics of select Oahu soils with respect to the substances found in these leachates. Based on these findings, guidelines for <b>sanitary</b> landfill site <b>selections,</b> in relation to the prevention of groundwater pollution, were developed. Four Oxisol soils (Molokai, Wahiawa, Helemano, and Lahaina), one Mollisol soil (Mamala), and one Marsh soil, were subjected to both saturated and unsaturated flow conditions, using as the percolating liquid, leachate produced by saturating (domestic refuse) with water. The domestic refuse had a composition typical fop that of Honolulu, Hawaii. Leachate and percolate samples were analyzed for various chemical constituents including pH, hardness, alkalinity, nutrients, chemical oxygen demand, particulates, and a number of metallic cations and heavy metals. Ion exchange was responsible for altering the concentration of inorganic substances in the percolating liquid, while microbial degradation appeared to be the primary mechanism for removing organic substances. Under the test conditions, and using the leachate produced from typical Honolulu refuse, the soils examined were found to have relatively low exchange capacities, while at the same time, organic removals were not significant. Thus, migration of inorganic and organic substances to the groundwater table is possible, and these results suggest that a cautious approach to landfill site selection should be taken, although soil depth to water table and dilution characteristics of the underlying groundwater must also be considered. A procedure for evaluating the feasibility of landfill operations in relation to possible groundwater contamination has been suggested. This procedure utilizes the removal characteristics for the various soils as observed in this study.

40|$|Clone and <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> of {{the grapevine}} has a {{fundamental}} importance {{in improving the}} quality and the quantity of the grape production in Serbia. In order to preserve the varieties of the old vineyards, the clone and <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> has begun in 2006 in the South Eastern Serbia vineyard areas, 1048 grapevine plants have been examined in three distant vineyards and 60 grapevine plants have been separated that deserved attention based on their production characteristics. The selected plants have been tested serologically, with the ELISA method, {{to the presence of}} 4 grapevine viruses: Grapevine leaf roll-associated virus 1, Grapevine leaf roll-associated virus 2 and Grapevine leaf roll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV- 1, GLRaV- 2 and GLRaV- 3), and grapevine fun leaf virus- GFLV. The infection level of the selected plants was between 10. 5 % (vineyard III) and 22. 2 % (vineyard II). We eliminated the infected plants among the selected ones and analyzed only the healthy ones in the 2008. Various potential variety clones have been selected for Prokupac, Pamid, Dimyat, Sauvignon blanc, Rosaki, Chasselas, Semillon, Detier de Bayreuth and Riesling. In 2008 we have repeated the same procedure we did in 2006 but in a different region - the Eastern Serbia area on the autochthonous variety of Muscat des roses noir on 400 grapevine plants 40 potential clones have been selected. The goal of this paper was check out the health status to preserve the autochthonous and introduced varieties of the eastern and south eastern region and to renew the vineyards it’s grown in.

40|$|Background: A {{protocol}} for the micropropagation of the grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivar ‘Monastrell’ was developed. Initial plant material {{was obtained from}} the <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> of grapevine plants performed by real-time RT-PCR to confirm the absence of Grapevine fanleaf virus, Arabis mosaic virus, Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1, Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3, and Grapevine fleck virus. Results: The effects of the salt composition (comparing Lloyd and McCown woody plant medium and Murashige and Skoog medium 1 / 2 macronutrients) and the growth regulator benzylaminopurine (BAP), at 0 and 8. 9  μM, on plant propagation were evaluated using nodes as explants. The most efficient procedure consisted of bud induction in the medium with Lloyd and McCown woody plant salts and 8. 9  μM BAP for 30  d along with elongation in cytokinin-free medium for 60  d, which gave 22 nodes/explant (174 plants/initial plant). A second cycle of propagation in a medium without BAP for another 60  d could give approximately 10, 000 nodes, which can be obtained after an additional 2  months of culture. All plants acclimatized after the second cycle of multiplication were successfully transferred to soil. Conclusion: We developed an optimal {{protocol for}} V. vinifera cv. ‘Monastrell’ micropropagation, the first described for this cultivar...|$|E
40|$|Filter feeding bivalve {{shellfish}} can accumulate human pathogenic bacteria and viruses if grown in sewage-contaminated waters. Current consumer protection legislation relies on classification of harvesting areas {{based on their}} sanitary quality, using E coli {{as an indicator of}} sewage contamination. Advances in viral monitoring have shown that E coli can underestimate the extent of the contamination. The most common cause of gastroenteritis associated with shellfish is norovirus, commonly known as winter vomiting virus. The REDRISK project was undertaken to investigate the main environmental factors that cause viral contamination in shellfish. The REDRISK project is part of a EU research pillar with parallel research being undertaken in the UK, France and Spain. A recently developed technique to quantify norovirus in shellfish, real-time PCR, has been used in the REDRISK project. Clew Bay, in Co. Mayo was chosen as the study area in Ireland. The bay is generally considered to have good water quality but with certain areas subject to intermittent sewage contamination. The cooperation of local producers and organisations such as the Clew Bay Marine Forum and the Native Oyster Co-op greatly helped the project. The project was divided into a two-phased approach. Phase one involved the identification of contamination sources impacting the bay through a <b>sanitary</b> survey and <b>selection</b> of appropriate sites for further study. Results of the first phase of this study were presented previously at this forum (Keaveney, et al 2006) and the characteristics of the sites selected for study and locations within the bay are shown in table 1 and figure 1 respectively. The second phase of the project focused on monitoring environmental conditions and microbiological levels in shellfish to identify environmental conditions leading to viral contamination.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{grafting}} method adapting the usual “indexing by green grafting” technique (Walter et al., 1990) to in vitro culture conditions was tested. The local grapevine varieties Khamri Tozeur, Akhel Meguergueb, Jerbi Degueche, Asli and Jebbi, infected respectively with infectious degeneration, leafroll, vein mosaic, corky bark and vein necrosis diseases, were used. Virus expression was greater on media having {{a greater number}} of nutrients such as the Van Hoof (1974) medium containing 12 macronutrients. On the other hand, the addition of BAP (0. 25 mg l- 1) to the medium reduced external virus symptoms on newly sprouted axillary shoots. When these shoots were transferred to fresh culture medium supplemented with IBA (0. 1 mg l- 1), typical and specific symptoms of major virus diseases clearly developed. Re-grafting of axillary shoots on the fragment of an infested clone can be used to overcome difficulties related to corky bark and vein mosaic symptom expression. We also demonstrated that viruses occur in general in mixed infections. The symptoms of a given virus become evident only when favourable conditions to it arise. Our research is still working on reducing the time of detecting virus and virus-like diseases. This is essential for <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> of grapevine plants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> and {{certification}} of olive cultivars require sensitive diagnostic methods and effective sanitation protocols. Although much {{attention has been}} paid {{in the past few years}} to the development of diagnostic tools for reliable virus identification, the need to define a common and standardized diagnostic protocol led to the implementation of a ring test among nine Italian diagnostic laboratories. A one-step RT-PCR protocol and different primer sets, targeting the most common olive viruses covered by phytosanitary rules, were tested in each laboratory, using the same batch of positive and healthy controls as well as the same amplification conditions and reaction components. The one-step RT-PCR, performed using several specific primer sets, was able efficiently to detect the target viruses in all laboratories. Furthermore, a one-step RT-PCR protocol was used successfully for the first time for detection of Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) and Olive mild mosaic virus (OMMV). Results showed that all target viruses were not uniformly distributed in the canopy, and that at least two subsets of samples must be collected from each plant. This standardized protocol is now being used to produce nuclear stocks for 70 different Italian olive cultivars, in the framework of the national project OLVIVA, which involves 25 national research institution...|$|E
40|$|The {{wealth of}} {{information}} accumulated {{in the last few}} years on rugose wood-associated viruses seems to prove that studies on grapevine RW complex have entered a mature stage. After the finding and characterization of Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV), the list of viruses involved in the aetiology of specific RW syndromes did not change, but future increases can hardly be excluded. The inconsistency of classical indexing with woody indicators for detecting RW syndromes, Rupestris stem pitting in particular, has definitely been demonstrated (28). The increasing records of mild or latent strains of RW-associated viruses and the use of sensitive diagnostic tools, capable of picking up from symptomless vines virus sequences from what appear to be very small RNA pools, has revealed a contamination level much higher than expected, after years of <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> and sanitation. There is an impressive amount of studies on genome analysis and variability, improvement of serological and molecular detection tools, epidemiology, sanitation and induction of non-conventional resistance.

40|$|The high {{infection}} levels due to Olive latent virus 1 (OLV- 1), Olive {{mild mosaic}} virus (OMMV) (alphanecrovirus) and Tobacco necrosis virus D (TNV-D) (betanecrovirus) in Portuguese olive orchards prompted us {{to develop a}} rapid PCR-based assay for the simultaneous detection of these viruses aimed at the <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> and marketing of plant material in compliance with European Union regulations. A pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers, parRdRp 5 and parCoat 3 was designed based on conserved regions located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP) genes of these viruses and one other alphanecrovirus, Tobacco necrosis virus A. Its use in RT-PCR assays generated a product of ca. 2000 bp for the 4 viral species tested. These primers were compared with virus specific primers in multiplex RT-PCR, and identical results were obtained. Its application to dsRNA extracted from 54 olive field growing trees originated the expected ca. 2000 bp amplicon in 17 trees. The virus identity was determined by sequencing the cloned RT-PCR products. No TNV-A was found. The RT-PCR assay using the degenerate primers described {{in this study were}} shown to be reliable in detecting any of the above-mentioned alpha- and betanecroviruses, and it is as sensitive as that which uses virus specific primers in multiplex assays. Therefore, this assay is well suited for the rapid screen of virus-free plant material in selection and improvement crop programmes. Additionally, {{it has the potential to}} reveal virus diversity and the presence of new viruses, provided the RT-PCR generated amplicon is further sequenced...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> and {{molecular}} characterization programs are being implemented in Apulia (Southern Italy) to identify true-to-type and sanitarily improved (virus-tested and virus-free) olive stocks, complying with {{national and international}} quality requirements. The following activities are in progress: (i) selection of individual trees in pre-selected groves; (ii) assessment of the sanitary status of field-selected accessions by laboratory tests; (iii) identification of AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) and SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats) markers suitable for the molecular characterization of selected genotypes; (iv) setting up efficient protocols for virus elimination; (v) obtention of "primary sources" (nuclear stocks) liable to enter certification programs. Due to the widespread occurrence of latent virus infections, visual inspections are unreliable, thus field observations need to be complemented by laboratory tests. Doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) analysis, RT-PCR, {{and molecular}} hybridisation were successfully used to test {{a large number of}} samples collected in commercial orchards. In order to characterize genotypes and establish their genetic relationships, olive accessions were screened with three AFLP primer combinations and twenty-seven SSR primer pairs. A comparison was done between AFLP and SSR marker variability, their efficiency and usefulness for establishing genetic relationships and cultivar identification. The data obtained were worked out with the Jaccard genetic similarity coefficient, applying the SAHN clustering method. The resulting dendrograms showed that all genotypes could be unequivocally distinguished. Because the sanitary status of very few of the selected plants conformed to legislative health requirements, most of the selected accessions underwent sanitation by in vitro meristem tip culture, in vivo and in vitro heat therapy, and rapid in vitro subculturing of shoots tips. The preliminary results have shown that some local varieties can be readily grown and multiplied in vitro while heat therapy and shoot tip culture are useful for eliminating some of the olive infecting viruses...|$|E
40|$|Viticulture is an emblematic {{and high}} value crop in France, {{producing}} worldwide reputed wines. Even though grapevine production covers less than 3 % of usable farmland, {{it accounts for}} over € 6 billion of exported wine. French viticulture {{is characterized by a}} wide regional diversity of climates, soil, typicity, cultivars and traditions. Many grapevine diseases and pests are present in France. Grapevine protection against these agressors involves the participation of a panel of institutional and professional stakeholders, whose missions range from regulation and research to advice and field application. A crucial phytosanitary problem of viticulture is posed by fungal diseases, and among these downy and powdery mildews, which are controlled by a massive use of fungicides. Breeding is underway, in order to obtain future resistant varieties. Trunk diseases represent another worrying problem, whose etiology is still poorly understood and against which control measures are lacking, since the ban of sodium arsenite. Grapevine can also be affected by numerous diseases caused by viruses (fanleaf, leafroll, etc.) and by phytoplasmas ('Flavescence dorée', 'Bois noir'). Control measures rely on <b>sanitary</b> <b>selection</b> and use of insecticides directed against vectors. A certification scheme is operated in France that aims at providing growers with planting material free of the most important pathogens. Genetically modified rootstocks have been tested against fanleaf disease; however, this approach raises societal issues and controversy. Harmful mites and insects are usually controlled by the use of acaricides and insecticides. Biotechnical methods are increasingly implemented, such as mating disruption and biocontrol, and efforts are made to better understand the ecology of these agressors and to integrate the various possibilities to reduce their impact to grapevine. Future prospects are discussed, within the context of an evolving situation (climate, regulation at the European scale, etc.) and of the increasing importance devoted to the reduction of pesticide use in a high value crop such as grapevine.
