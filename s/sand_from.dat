5|$|In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an {{interest}} in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping to increase trade through the harbour at Padstow. The plan was to create a breakwater on the bar, which would stop the build-up of sand, and the railway would transport <b>sand</b> <b>from</b> the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E

5|$|The medical {{problems}} of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and <b>sand</b> <b>from</b> stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E

5|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, <b>sand</b> <b>from</b> Arizona {{was used as the}} model for the CG sand. In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the glass}} was melted using local raw materials, {{including}} <b>sand</b> <b>from</b> neighbouring villages, sodium carbonate (from the Dead Sea), and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide.

Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city. The products made include glass jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained glass windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, glass production has suffered a decline.|$|E

5|$|Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, {{which he}} entered {{before he was}} six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his {{occasional}} long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George <b>Sand,</b> <b>from</b> 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually {{all of which are}} for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op.35) and all the minor keys (Op.39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, {{hundreds}} of residents were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} Isabel Inlet. People who were not residents {{were not allowed to}} be on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured to see the new inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6-km) walk from the nearest road. Initially, long term solutions to the Isabel Inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating the evolution of the Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, about a month after the hurricane struck. The United States Geological Survey used <b>sand</b> <b>from</b> the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane. On November 22, about two months after the hurricane struck, North Carolina Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} {{their names on}} the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised {{the sanctity of the}} Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the <b>sand</b> <b>from</b> between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.|$|E

5|$|On Falalop Island, the seawall erected during World War II {{was entirely}} {{destroyed}} and allowed storm surge to inundate the island; however, {{at no point}} was the entire island under water. Initially, Falalop was left under 1.2m (4ft) of water, though {{by the time the}} eye moved over this had decreased to 0.6m (2ft). Along the south shore, waves reached 1.8m (6ft) and caused moderate beach erosion. <b>Sand</b> <b>from</b> the coastline was found up to 215m (700ft) inland, filling many taro pits in the island's interior. Along the south shore, two children were killed when their home collapsed, pinning them underneath debris, and water later inundated the area and drowned them. Elsewhere on the island, three people sustained minor injuries. Asor Island experienced most of its flooding as the backside of Ophelia moved through. The island was shortened by 45m (150ft) to the north and southern beaches experienced varying degrees of erosion. Mogmog Island, located at the northern end of the atoll's lagoon, saw the deposition of large boulders and cobblestone along its north shore which covered an area 30 to 45m (100 to 150ft) wide. Flying debris resulted in one injury on both Asor and Mogmog. To the west, Potangeras Island saw an increase in land area by 60m (200ft) as sand was pushed from other areas.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of <b>sand</b> <b>from</b> beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated {{with the exception of one}} lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E
