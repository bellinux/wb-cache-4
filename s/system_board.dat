5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{had a short}} {{lifespan}} {{and limited}} third-party support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative, including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio and Shenmue, as well as high-quality ports from Sega's NAOMI arcade <b>system</b> <b>board.</b> The Dreamcast {{was also the first}} console to include a built-in modem for Internet support and online play.|$|E

5|$|On May 22, 2008, Capcom {{announced}} the game, titled Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes, for release in Japanese arcades. The arcade cabinets' <b>system</b> <b>board</b> was proprietary hardware {{based on the}} Wii. Beta units were sent to test locations in Tokyo (July 10–13) and Osaka (July 25–27). By September, the game was 70% complete, and a Wii version was announced for Japanese release. Capcom gradually revealed the game's cast until release. It was released in Japan on the Wii on December 11, 2008, and an arcade version followed in mid-December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Sega also {{experienced}} success with arcade games. In 1992 and 1993, the company's new Sega Model 1 arcade <b>system</b> <b>board</b> showcased Sega AM2's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter (the first 3D fighting game), which {{played a crucial}} role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. In particular, Virtua Fighter garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with the game's strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. Despite its crude visuals—with characters composed of fewer than 1,200 polygons—Virtua Fighters fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites. The Model 1 was an expensive <b>system</b> <b>board,</b> and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required more than its hardware could handle. Several alternatives helped to bring Sega's newest arcade games to the console, such as the Sega Virtua Processor chip used for Virtua Racing, and eventually the Sega 32X add-on.|$|E
5|$|As with X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter was {{initially}} {{developed for the}} CP System II arcade <b>system</b> <b>board.</b> The game debuted in Japanese and North American arcades in 1997. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn, exclusive to Japan, on October 22, 1998. The Sega Saturn port supported the 4MB RAM expansion peripheral, allowing the developers to create a conversion which retained the original frame rates and tag team system. The game was then ported to the PlayStation in February 1999. Due to the console's limited RAM capacity, the tag team format was switched to the more traditional round format used in other fighting game series, such as Street Fighter. To compensate {{for the removal of}} tag team gameplay, several new game modes, such as Hero Battle and Cross Over, were implemented.|$|E

5|$|At JAMMA's 1992 Amusement Machine Show in Japan, {{held during}} 27–19 August 1992, Namco debuted a racing game called Sim Drive for the Namco System 22 arcade <b>system</b> <b>board.</b> It was {{a sequel to}} Eunos Roadster Driving Simulator, a Mazda MX-5 driving {{simulation}} arcade game that Namco developed with Mazda and released in 1990. Its 3D polygon graphics stood out for its use of Gouraud shading and texture mapping. After a location test at the show, where it was previewed by the November 1992 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Sim Drive had a limited Japanese release in December 1992, but {{did not get a}} mass-market release. It served as a prototype for Ridge Racer.|$|E
5|$|The School of Dental Medicine is a {{professional}} school at the university. The school graduates one degree, Doctor of Dental Medicine. It will also have two residencies in Advanced Education in General Dentistry and Dental General Practice. The school also will offer a specialty program in Pedodontics. It was founded on February 24, 2006 at the East Carolina Board of Trustees meeting. The dental school was unanimously approved by the UNC <b>System</b> <b>Board</b> of Governors as well. The facilities are located on the Health Sciences Campus and will house {{the first three years}} of education. Dental students will complete their final year at ECU Community Service Learning Centers to be located throughout the state. The School of Dental Medicine is one of two dental schools in the state.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} CP System II arcade <b>system</b> <b>board.</b> A direct Dreamcast port was revealed by the Computer Entertainment Software Association at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show. The Dreamcast version added the new game mode, Cross Fever, which permitted four-player gameplay. The game later received a PlayStation port. However, the console's RAM limitations required the developer to remove certain features, most notably the game's tag team element; thus, most game modes were restricted to two-character battles, instead of four. This reduced the player's secondary character to an assist role, similar to guest characters. To overcome the limitations, the PlayStation version had to implement a new gameplay mode called Cross Over. Cross Over Mode allows tag team play by forcing the players to fight with identical teams. For example, if Player 1 chooses Spider-Man and Player 2 chooses Ryu, then Ryu and Spider-Man would automatically be selected as Player 1 and Player 2's secondary characters, respectively. The game also added an art gallery, where players could view game art and ending animations. Many frames of animation were also omitted {{as a result of}} insufficient RAM, particularly in larger character sprites.|$|E
