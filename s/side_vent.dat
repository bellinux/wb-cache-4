2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. <b>Side</b> <b>vent</b> windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, anti-theft alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with chrome-plated ignition shielding covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the water}} vapour balance method {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the ventilation rate to calibrate and validate the ventilation sub-model of the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) in a naturally ventilated three span Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Two ventilation strategies were considered to investigate their effects on the microclimate and transpiration of the rose crop: the configuration with roof vents only (while the <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> were closed) and the configuration with both roof <b>vents</b> and <b>side</b> <b>vents.</b> Crop transpiration was evaluated using the Penman-Monteith method. This allowed continuous and automatic determination of the ventilation rate and leakage rate using the water vapour balance method. The model was fitted to experimental data for ventilation rates, and the parameters for the model, the discharge and wind effect coefficient were determined using statistical analysis. The results showed that there was a good fit between measured and predicted values (R 2 = 0. 702 and 0. 729 for the model of ventilation for the greenhouse operating respectively with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> and with roof vents only for the summer period considered), although there was a general overestimation of the air renewal rates, particularly during the night. The air renewal rate was found to be influenced by the ventilation regime in practice. The greenhouse was found to have higher air renewal rates for the configuration with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents.</b> On a typical hot day, the maximum simulated air renewal rate was 15. 6 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> at 1600 hrs, while it was only 6. 5 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof vents at the same time. The difference between the air renewal rates for the different regimes resulted in different microclimates, since the ventilation affects both the energy balance and mass balance of a greenhouse. The greenhouse inside air temperature was reduced significantly for the configuration with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> as it had lower simulated air temperatures than the configuration with roof vents only. On a typical hot day the maximum simulated air temperature for the configuration with roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> was 29. 7 ÂºC, while it was 31. 5 ÂºC for roof vents configuration at 1400 hrs. On typical selected days the maximum differences between the inside air temperature and the external air temperature were 3. 7 ÂºC and 4. 6 ÂºC for the configuration with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> and the configuration with roof vents only, respectively. Thus during summer periods it is necessary to have a greenhouse with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> so that plants will have a better physiological and morphological development, as the air renewal rates influence crop behaviour largely through their effects on gas exchanges, particularly transpiration and photosynthesis. The transpiration of the rose crop was found to be influenced by the ventilation strategy. The simulated maximum canopy transpiration flux density was 166. 5 W m- 2 for the configuration with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents,</b> while it was 152. 9 Wm- 2 for the roof vents only on a selected hot day. The simulated night-time relative humidities were higher for the configuration with roof vents only. The simulated relative humidity was above 90 % for the configuration with roof vents only, while it was 84 % for the configuration with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents.</b> To prevent excessive humidity build up, the ventilation strategy with both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> needs to be employed in order to prevent condensation in the greenhouse...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimen-tally investigate the influence of vent type and of insect proof screens on ventilation rate of a round arch plastic covered greenhouse. The greenhouse was equipped with side roll-up win-dows and a flap roof window and {{is located at the}} University of Thessaly near Volos in the coastal area of Eastern Greece. Microclimate variables as well as the greenhouse ventilation rate (G) were measured. Two measuring meth-ods were used for the determination of G: (a) the decay rate tracer gas method, using N 2 O as tracer gas, and (b) the greenhouse energy bal-ance method. In order to study the effect of vent type on G, in a greenhouse with an insect proof screen in the vent openings, the G was deter-mined during periods were the ventilation was performed by (i) roof, (ii) side and (iii) both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents.</b> Furthermore, in order to study the effect of insect proof screens on G, measurements were carried out also during pe-riods were the ventilation was performed by <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> without a screen in the openings. The two measuring methods gave similar results, but the tracer gas method provided a better fit to the experimental data. Concerning the ventilation performance, the results showed that the most effective vent configuration was the combina-tion of roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents,</b> followed by <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> only.

40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} is {{the most}} important method of climate control in Mediterranean greenhouses. In this study, the microclimate and air flow inside a Mediterranean greenhouse were evaluated by means of sonic anemometry. Experiments were carried out in conditions of moderate wind (&# 8776; 4. 0 m s- 1), and at low wind speed (&# 8776; 1. 8 m s- 1) the natural ventilation of the greenhouse was supplemented by two horizontal air flow fans. The greenhouse is equipped with a single roof vent opening to the windward side and two <b>side</b> <b>vents,</b> the windward one being blocked by another greenhouse close to it, while the leeward one is free of obstacles. When no fans are used, air enters through the roof vent and exits through both <b>side</b> <b>vents,</b> thus flowing contrary to the thermal effect which causes hot air to rise and impairing the natural ventilation of the greenhouse. Using fans inside the greenhouse helps the air to circulate and mix, giving rise to a more homogeneous inside temperature and increasing the average value of normalized air velocity by 365 %. These fans also increase the average values of kinetic turbulence energy inside the greenhouse by 550 % compared to conditions of natural ventilation. As the fans are placed 4 m away from the <b>side</b> <b>vents,</b> their effect on the entrance of outside air is insufficient and they do not help to reduce the inside temperature on hot days with little wind. It is therefore recommended to place the fans closer to the <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> to allow an additional increase of the air exchange rate of greenhouses...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of <b>vent</b> type (<b>side,</b> roof or both) and of an anti-aphid insect screen used to prevent insect intrusion on the ventilation rate of a round arch with vertical side walls, polyethylene covered greenhouse. The greenhouse was equipped with two <b>side</b> roll-up <b>vents</b> and a flap roof vent located at the University of Thessaly near Velestino in the continental area of Eastern Greece. Microclimate variables {{as well as the}} airflow rate were measured during summer. Two measuring methods were used for the determination of ventilation rate: (a) the decay rate 'tracer gas' method, using nitrous oxide N 2 O as tracer gas, and (b) the greenhouse 'energy balance' method. In order to study the effect of vent type on ventilation rate, in a greenhouse with an anti-aphid insect screen in the vent openings, airflow was determined during periods with ventilation being performed by: (i) roof, (ii) side or (iii) both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents.</b> Furthermore, in order to study the effect of insect proof screen on airflow, measurements were also carried out during periods that ventilation was performed by <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> without a screen in the openings. A good correlation was found between the air exchange rate values calculated using the two methods, with the values obtained by the tracer gas method being slightly lower than those obtained by the energy balance method. Furthermore, the data of ventilation rate obtained by the tracer gas method fitted better to the model used for the prediction of ventilation rate. In addition, the use of anti-aphid screen in vent openings caused a 33 % reduction in greenhouse ventilation rate. From greenhouse ventilation performance point of view, {{it was found that the}} most effective vent configuration was the combination of roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents,</b> followed by <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> only (46 % reduction in ventilation), while the least effective was roof vent (71 % reduction ventilation). © 2006 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} {{basis of}} natural ventilation is reviewed and the ventilation performance examined of six different greenhouse and tunnel types equipped with either roof or side, or both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents.</b> Altogether, sixteen different ventilation configurations are analysed. Neural networks of ventilation rate were first developed to select relevant parameters influencing performance and these {{confirmed that the}} surface area of the vent-opening and wind speed together explain the largest part of the variance of air exchange rate measurements. Ventilation performance is then analysed using physical models derived from Bernoulli's theorem. The effects of vent-opening, their position and type, {{and the influence of}} a crop are all considered, together with different models combining the two major driving forces for natural ventilation, namely, wind and stack forces. Combining both wind and stack effects did not improve the predictive power of the model for the greenhouses equipped with only roof or <b>side</b> <b>vents,</b> but when both roof and <b>side</b> <b>vents</b> are open together, model performance is improved by combination of the two driving forces. It is shown too that the presence of a crop decreases the ventilation efficiency and that the linear dependence of the air exchange rate on wind velocity, when the chimney effect can be neglected, is only partially supported by the experimental data.
