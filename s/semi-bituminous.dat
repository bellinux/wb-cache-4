25|$|This {{invention}} {{was only}} primarily used with steam locomotives that had booster valves or superchargers {{to heat the}} fire even hotter to produce extra power. The coal used was <b>semi-bituminous</b> and bituminous coal only inside the steam locomotives. Sadly, this invention lasted until 1960 when Diesel's fully replaced American railroads.|$|E
25|$|The NP's {{desire to}} burn low grade <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal from company-owned mines at Rosebud, Montana, {{played a part}} in the {{development}} of the 4-8-4 wheel arrangement for steam locomotives. With a BTU fifty percent lower than anthracite coal, the NP's locomotive design called for a much larger firebox, and thus an additional axle on the trailing truck. This led locomotive designers from the 4-8-2 Mountain to the 4-8-4 Northern, first produced by Alco for the NP in 1926 and designated the Class A by the railway.|$|E

50|$|The mine, Orenda Mine #1, {{extracted}} high quality, <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal. A {{steam engine}} hoisted the coal to the surface. The hoist pulled the coal cars up a coal tipple that was 1080 ft long, 92 ft high, and 60 ft wide. In 1920, {{this was the}} largest coal tipple in the world. At its prime, 900 men were employed and over 3,000 tons of coal were mined daily. The company was eventually renamed to the United Coal Company and in 1918 it became the Davis Coal Company.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{railroad}} was to haul <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal from the mines {{on the east side of}} the remote Broad Top Mountain plateau to the Pennsylvania Railroad in Mount Union. The railroad also carried substantial amounts of ganister rock, lumber and passengers with some agricultural goods, concrete, road tar and general freight. In its first three decades the railroad supplied much of its coal to the Rockhill Iron Furnace, operated by the railroad's sister company, the Rockhill Iron and Coal Company, and in turn hauled the pig iron from the furnace.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal bed at Jerome, {{part of the}} Upper Kittanning formation, was {{approximately}} six feet thick, capped by shale and limestone, with a smooth, hard sandstone floor. In 1911, the mine had a capacity of 1,700 tons a day, with an average daily output of 1,020 tons. [...] The tipple had four loading tracks with a capacity of 80 cars. Within the tipple, coal was cleaned first by machine through shaker screens, then by hand, along a conveyor and at loading. [...] Refuse coal and rock was dumped in a hillside {{to the south of}} the tipple.|$|E
50|$|Vast beds of coal {{are found}} {{extending}} {{for hundreds of}} miles, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the plains. The coal belongs to the Cretaceous beds, and while not so heavy as that of the Coal Measures in England is of excellent quality. In the valley of the Bow River, alongside the Canadian Pacific Railway, valuable beds of anthracite coal are still worked. The usual coal deposits of the area of bituminous or <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal. These are largely worked at Lethbridge in southern Alberta and Edmonton in the centre of the province. Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.|$|E
50|$|The Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad and Coal Company was {{chartered}} on May 6, 1852, {{and organized}} on January 10, 1853. The {{purpose of the}} line {{was to provide a}} rail link from Huntingdon to Bedford, and to provide a competitive alternate route to local coal producers to break the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's monopoly on coal that was being shipped from the Cumberland, Maryland, area. The existence of high quality <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal in the Broad Top Mountain region was known since colonial times. Before the railroad, wagon or pole barge was the only practical method of bringing the coal from the remote region to market.|$|E
5000|$|The Dan River Coalfield is a {{coalfield}} in Stokes and Rockingham Counties, North Carolina about which, in 1914, USGS geologist Mr. R.W. Stone wrote, [...] "after {{a thorough}} and careful {{examination of the}} Triassic beds in the Dan River Field the conclusion is reached {{that there is no}} reason to expect to find commercially valuable coal beds in this district." [...] This correlated with the information that the North Carolina Geological and Economic Survey had about the Dan River Field, and thus it has remained an unimportant coalfield to this day. Yet a slope portal was once driven into the 4 ft <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal at Leaksville, NC, and Ebenezer Emmons wrote, [...] "The coal is less pure than that of Deep River, but it will probably prove a valuable fuel for warming apartments by means of stoves and grates." [...] Actually about 30 miles of this coal deposit exist in North Carolina and another 10 project into neighboring Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike many seminal advances, the contributors, {{place and}} date of this epoch are well {{recorded}} within specific moments in the late 1830s. The first repeatable and reliably successful furnaces and smelts were managed by the same person in both the United Kingdom and the United States, in the principal control and supervision of Ironmaster David Thomas who had begun experimenting with attempts to use locally available Wales anthracite deposits as early as 1820 soon after he became in charge at Yniscedewin Iron Works in Wales. About this 1837-38 timeframe experiments were also being made in Pennsylvania near Port Carbon, and in Mauch Chunk, but with overall better success than in Wales. White, Hazard and the LC&N Co. had begun systematic experiments to smelt using anthracite in two furnaces in Mauch Chunk in 1832-1837 with intermittent but sporadically improved successes using cold blast processes with two differently designed furnaces. [...] While this preliminary work was being done {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, another brain Scotland was at work, which furnished the key that unlocked the secret to success, by Mr. Neilson of Glasgow, the inventor of the hot-blast, who in 1828 obtained a patent for his valuable invention, the importance of which was not realized for a long time. The pamphlet on the hot-blast, issued by Neilson, was eagerly read by Mr. Thomas, who was at once convinced of the value of the discovery. One evening, while sitting with Mr. Crane in his library, talking the matter over, he took the bellows and began to blow the anthracite fire in the grate. [...] "You had better not, David," [...] said Mr. Crane; [...] "you will blow it out." [...] And Thomas replied, [...] "If we only had Neilsons hot-blast here, the anthracite would burn like pine." [...] Mr. Crane said, [...] "David, that is the idea precisely," [...] and this idea both recognized as one which would bear working out; and through Mr. Thomass indomitable pluck and perseverance it succeeded. In fact, this was the origin of the successful application of the hot-blast in making iron with anthracite. In the meantime the Clyde iron-works, in Scotland, had put a furnace in operation, using the hot-blast with <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal in the furnace. Mr. Thomas urged upon Mr. Crane the immediate adoption of the new discovery, and he was sent to Scotland to see how the process worked. After the most careful examination, Mr. Thomas determined that the hot-blast was just what was wanted for an anthracite furnace. He returned to Yniscedwin with a license from Mr. Neilson, and an expert mechanic who understood the construction of heating ovens, and at once proceeded to construct hot-blast ovens, and erected them at the furnace which was known as the Cupola furnace, 11 feet bosh by 45 feet high. The furnace was blown in, February 5, 1837; the success was complete; and anthracite-iron continued to be profitably made from said furnace without intermission thereafter. Anthracite-iron was a new-born commodity in the commerce of the world, and David Thomas was its godfather. The news of his success spread over the United Kingdom; the London Mining Journal gave it great prominence and an account of the discovery appeared in the press of the United States. Samuel Thomas [...] The first American smelt of Anthracite Pig Iron was performed July 4, 1840 by principal-partners David Thomas, Josiah White and Erskine Hazard at their Lehigh Crane Iron Works in their first hot blast furnace along Catasauqua Creek aided by Samuel Thomas and the employees of the LCIW, in what became Catasauqua in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The technology enabled industries the chance to produce cast iron sufficient to demand and eventually adapt production to also feed the demand to generate wrought iron and steel. These useful materials are achieved by adding additional processing [...] - [...] by taking pig iron as an ingredient into a reverberatory furnace (and in later years, a Bessemer converter).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the leaching of selected trace elements (Cs, Li, Be, Sr, and Ba) from plant growth media made of two coal fly ashes (one from <b>semi-bituminous</b> coal and one from lignite), and from these ashes combined with the soil and with the soil and sphagnum peat moss. Leachate fractions will be collected at each pore volume {{for a total of}} five pore volumes. Concentrations of mentioned above trace elements in plant growth media and in leachate has been determined using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrophotometry. The presence of sphagnum peat moss and soil in coal ash based plant growth media expressed ameliorative role reducing the presence of trace elements in the leachate. Elevated concentrations of Li, Sr and Ba in the leachate may cause some en environmental health concerns and require further investigations...|$|E
40|$|Carbonaceous Organic Aromatic Lump (COAL) is a {{heterogeneous}} and stratified Organic rock, formed from decay of vegetable matters or sub-merging forest due to tectonic movement with carbon content varies from 60 to 100 %. According to carbon content, Coals are classified in different stages like Peat (50. 9 %), Lignite (61. 8 %), Sub-Bituminous (64. 5 %), <b>Semi-Bituminous</b> (69. 5 %), Bituminous (78. 5 %), Anthracite (91 %), keeping in view that Graphite (100 %) {{will be the}} last stage of formation. As the major elemental constituents of coal are Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen and Sulphur so when these coals are exposed to open-air, it absorbs Oxygen from atmospheric air, liberating heat and ultimately leading to fire. As this liberation of heat is due to the characteristics of Coal, so it is known Spontaneous Heating or Auto-oxidation of Coal or Endogenous Fires which extends during mining. The propensity of this fire is so large noxious gases like CO, CO 2, SO 2, Nitrous fumes and ultimately, mining activity stops, by blocking up the huge amount of capital and sterilization of reserve [18]. This project deals with the assessment of propensity of different coal samples towards spontaneous heating by assessment of various constraints determined by experimental procedures. The intrinsic properties as well as susceptibility indices of the coal samples have factually been reflected to predict self-heating liability of coal. Four coal samples were collected from MCL (Mahanadi Coalfields Limited) and five from SECL (South Eastern Coalfields Limited), covering some coal fields of India. Liability of collected coal samples were determined using Crossing point temperature and Olpinski index apparatus and the intrinsic properties were determined using proximate analysis method following Indian standards. Based on the results correlation analysis was done among the parameters of proximate analysis and CPT and Sza, also found out the best correlation among them...|$|E
