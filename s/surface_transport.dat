There are also private bus companies. The railway system is a nationalised service without any private investment. Hired forms of transport include metered taxis and auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes in cities. In most of the state, cycle rickshaws, and in Kolkata, hand-pulled rickshaws and electric rickshaws, are used for short-distance travel.|$|E

Nearly pure <b>surface</b> electronic <b>transport</b> has been observed at low temperatures in Bi nanowires with diameter around the critical diameter, 50 nm, for the semimetal-to semiconductor transition.

We show that <b>surface</b> electronic <b>transport</b> together with boundary phonon scattering leads to enhanced thermoelectric performance at low temperatures of Bi nanowire arrays. We compare with bulk n-BiSb alloys, optimized CsBi(4) Te(6) and optimized Bi(2) Te(3). <b>Surface</b> dominated electronic <b>transport</b> can be expected in nanomaterials of the other traditional thermoelectrics.

25|$|The Viastra was envisaged as a one or three-engined {{commercial}} aircraft {{capable of carrying}} ten passengers and designed {{with an eye to}} operations in countries with poor <b>surface</b> <b>transport</b> facilities. Vickers built several variants, largely similar apart from the engines: ultimately, there were Viastras with one, two and three engines. They were high-wing monoplanes, the wings having constant chord, square tips and a thick Raf 24 section. The wings, {{like the rest of the}} aircraft were covered with the corrugated skin and carried balanced ailerons and outboard slots. There was a biplane tail unit with a pair of narrow chord planes, the lower attached to the fuselage underside and the upper mounted clear above. The outboard vertical tail surfaces were again very narrow and served as the main rudders; the single-engined and tri-motor variants also had a small triangular central fin, carrying an auxiliary rudder and supporting the upper horizontal plane. With one exception, the twin-engined Viastras had the central fin and rudder replaced by tubular bracing.|$|E
25|$|It is {{operated}} by the Indian Maritime University and Directorate General of Shipping of the Government of India's Ministry of <b>Surface</b> <b>Transport.</b> It offers various training programs but the most respected is its flagship degree course i.e. the three-year degree program. The intake is through merit list of Joint Entrance Exams conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT JEE) conducted every year across India and widely considered {{as one of the}} toughest competitive exams to clear in world. Graduates from T.S. Chanakya receive a B.Sc. (Nautical Sciences) degree from the Indian Maritime University, and are eligible to seek employment on Indian or Foreign going ships. Currently it is also called as Mumbai campus of Indian Maritime University, Chennai. T.S. Chanakya (1993 - till Date) is a progeny of T.S. Rajendra (1972–1993) and T.S. Dufferin (1927–1972). The earlier two were actual ships floating at Ferry Wharf, Mumbai while T.S. Chanakya is a shore based academy in Navi Mumbai. The entire Indian Shipping and Logistics Fraternity and Indo-origin seafaring community across world is majorly thronged by ex-cadets of this community also called as DRACEA (Dufferin Rajendra And Chanakya Ex-Cadets Association).The members of DRACEA are at very high posts in maritime sector. Recently, T.S. Chanakya is also hitting limelight in non-shipping industries because of the ex-cadets who leave merchant navy career after significant experience at sea and go on to clear next level of competitive exams like CAT, GMAT, IAS and go for further studies or change in their job profile. Institutions like Harvard, Emory, CASS, LBS, Lancaster, Yale, Texas A, IIM's, ISB, XLRI, IIFT, FMS, Great Lakes, S.P.Jain, MDI etc. welcome these ex-naval officers in their admits willingly since they bring along a wide and diverse experience and add stupendous value to their future occupations and even entrepreneurship by their fresh and mature perspectives.|$|E
