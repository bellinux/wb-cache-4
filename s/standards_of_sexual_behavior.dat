40|$|Scottish {{teenagers}} (N = 690) {{participated in}} a survey concerning the relationship between religiosity, gender, and social judgments of sexual activity. Respondents estimated the {{number of sexual partners}} of 20 -year-old men and women and made evaluative judgments of sexually active men and women on positive and negative dimensions. On both tasks, evidence was obtained for the operation of a double standard. Women were expected to have fewer sexual partners than men, and their sexual activity was judged more negatively on evaluatively negative dimensions. Contrary to findings of previous studies in this area, gender differences in endorsement of the double standard were not found. Only moderate support was found for the view that religiosity contributes to different <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> for men and women, although religiosity had significantly greater influence on judgments made by women than on judgments made by men...|$|E
40|$|The Royal Commissions on the Laws of Marriage and Divorce, 1850 - 1853 and 1909 - 1912, are the {{foundation}} of this survey of changing public and parliamentary attitudes toward marriage and divorce in England. Religious opinion carried great authority in the 1853 Commission and the parliamentary debates which produced the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. This Act formalized the traditional Parliamentary procedure for divorce, and also legitimized the double <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> After 1857, religious objectors to reform steadily lost ground, so that in 1912 they carried no weight with the Commissioners and did not, in the end, prevent further extension {{of the laws of}} divorce. The public was always divided over the issue, but the evidence shows a growing majority in support of equal grounds for women as well as extended grounds for both sexes as the century progressed. Changes in other areas of law, especially property law, made the double standard ever more contradictory to the advancing status of women in English society...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship among measures of anticipatory and consummatory <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> displayed by male rats in the bilevel chambers designed by Mendelson and Gorzalka (1987). Normative data from a <b>standard</b> test <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> were gathered from 80 intact, sexually experienced male Long-Evans rats and subjected to multiple correlational and factor analyses. The correlational analysis confirmed that several consummuatory measures of copulation were related significantly, whereas the anticipatory me-asure, level changing, was statistically independent of consummatory measures. Factor analysis using orthogonal rotations revealed five factors that accounted for 95 % of the intersubject variance for all measures: Copulatory Rate, Initiation, Hfit Rate, Mount Count, and Anticipation. These results indicate that at least five conceptual mechanisms are required in any theoretical description <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in the bilevel chamber. In particular, the extraction of separate anticipation and initiation factors indicates that these aspects <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> are distinct. The use of bilevel chambers thus may facilitate the identification of potential neurochernical or endocrine mechanisms associated with different aspects <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> motivation. In addition, several statistical techniques are discussed {{with the aim of}} reducing the elevated experiment-wise error that can occur when related measures <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> are analyzed independently...|$|R

40|$|This seminar {{will explore}} the {{neurobiology}} <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and {{will focus on}} systems-level understanding of the neural regulation of both pre-copulatory and copulatory behavior.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the effects of need for cognition on stereotypes <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> and STD infection rates. After reviewing the literature on <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> STD infection rates, stereotypes, and need for cognition, two hypotheses were proposed. The first hypothesis was that participants would engage in stereotyping. That is, participants would perceive the frequency <b>of</b> various <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> the acceptability <b>of</b> various <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and STD infection rates differently depending on the sex and <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>of</b> targets. The second hypothesis was that participants low in need for cognition should be more likely then participants high in need for cognition to use stereotypes when perceiving the frequency <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> and STD infection rates. Participants were randomly assigned to answer questionnaires about one of four targets: heterosexual female, heterosexual male, homosexual female, or homosexual male. The first hypothesis received substantial support, and the second hypothesis received very limited support. Plausible alternative explanations and future directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{structure}} and intensity of relation-ships between dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and personal characteristics in the context <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism. The sample included 233 participants (both genders, mean age 29, 34). Dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> were measured using the <b>Sexual</b> <b>Behavior</b> Questionnaire, and personal characteristics were measured using the Big Five Inventory and short form of Delta 10 questionnaire. The results suggested that the importance of personality for the understanding <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> is not far from the relevance <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism. It was found that personality was signifi-cant predictor of almost all dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> independent from gender, and in case of tendency to have casual sex a strong interaction effect of gender and Conscientiousness was found. The nature of relationships between dimensions <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and personality were very similar withih the subsamples of males and females. Namely, adaptive personality functioning was related to richness <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> experience following by low sexual fantasies and low tendency to paraphilias. Small, but important difference in the structure of canonical factors extracted in the domain <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> was the following: in male sample adaptive personality structure correlated with high tendency to casual sex, while in female sample the opposite was obtained. In female sample there was one more significant relation suggesting that psychopatic personal structure has sexual style which include ric-hness and casual sexual experience without tendency to non-coital sexual play. The results are discussed in the context of the evolutionary theories of behavior...|$|R

40|$|By {{appointment}} Most readings {{are available}} from UWO libraries on-line. Readings not available online will be posted on the course website. Course Synopsis Social psychologists {{are committed to the}} scientific study <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> for both theoretical and practical reasons. From a theoretical perspective, generalizable social psychological theory may be developed and tested in research concerning <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> From a practical perspective, social psychological knowledge may be applied to ameliorate problematic aspects <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and accentuate positive aspects of such behaviour. In accord with these theoretical and practical concerns, social psychologists have worked to develop conceptual models of factors that influence human <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and to apply social psychological knowledge to reduce sex-related problems and increase sex-related positive outcomes. This seminar on the social psychology <b>of</b> human <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> will involve lectures, readings, class discussions, and student presentations focusing on history, ethics, methodology, theory, and selected content areas that are significant in this field of study. Acquisition of foundational knowledge in selected areas of the social psychology <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> is a primary objective of this course. Evaluation is based on clas...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. <b>Sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in {{children}} can cause {{uncertainty in the}} clinician because {{of the relationship between}} sexual abuse and <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Consequently, {{it is important to understand}} normative childhood <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior.</b> Design. <b>Sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> in 1114 2 - to 12 -year-old chil-dren was rated by primary female caregivers. These chil-dren were screened for the absence <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse. A 38 -item scale assessing a broad range <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> (Child <b>Sexual</b> <b>Behavior</b> Inventory, Third Version) was administered along with the Child Behavior Checklist and a questionnaire assessing family stress, family sex-uality, social maturity of the child, maternal attitudes regarding child sexuality, and hours in day care. Results. <b>Sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> was related to the child’s age, maternal education, family sexuality, family stress, family violence, and hours/week in day care. Frequencies <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> for 2 - to 5 -, 6 - to 9 -, and 10 - to 12 -year-old boys and girls are presented. Conclusions. A broad range <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> are exhibited by children who there is no reason to believe have been sexually abused. Their relative frequency is similar to two earlier studies, and this reinforces the validity of these results. Pediatrics 1998; 101 (4). URL...|$|R
