40|$|The {{coordination}} of <b>street</b> <b>works</b> activities in urban networks has been {{highlighted by the}} Government {{as one of the}} most important aspects of <b>street</b> <b>works</b> practice, benefiting <b>street</b> authorities, undertakers and road users alike (Department for Transport, 2012 c). The present research aims to develop an optimisation model for minimising the overall costs and disruptions incurred by all stakeholders as a result of implementing a number of <b>street</b> <b>works</b> schemes in an urban traffic network. The output of the optimisation model consists of optimum values for the underlying decision variables of the model such as start time of each <b>street</b> <b>works</b> scheme, type of traffic management strategy for each link, sequence of link closures and the level of resources allocated to undertake each scheme. The following two distinct objective functions, which are subject to minimisation by the optimisation model, have been developed: A primary objective function which captures the monetised effects of <b>street</b> <b>works</b> schemes such as cost of delays to road users, and cost of undertaking <b>street</b> <b>works</b> schemes. A secondary objective function (developed as a fuzzy inference system) to capture the non-monetised disruptive effects of <b>street</b> <b>works</b> schemes. The fuzzy variables of this inference system correspond to the level of ‘accessibility degradation’ of the network links, ‘connectivity degradation’ of the origin-destinations of the network, and ‘time sensitivity’ of the disruptive events (i. e. <b>street</b> <b>works</b> schemes). Next the <b>street</b> <b>works</b> optimisation problem was mathematically formulated as a bi-level optimisation programming problem, where the higher level problem is associated with minimising the aforementioned objective functions, and the lower level problem deals with predicting traffic flows, and thus the amount of delays incurred by the road users. Subsequently this study developed a genetic algorithm solution method to solve the resulting non-convex and NP-hard optimisation problem with integer or mixed type variables. Finally the performance of the optimisation algorithm was verified by a number of experimental tests on a small hypothetical network for three <b>street</b> <b>works</b> schemes...|$|R

5000|$|Section 228 of the Highways Act 1980 {{is mainly}} {{used by the}} <b>street</b> <b>works</b> {{authority}} (county council or unitary authority) to declare a street to be a highway maintainable at public expense. The <b>street</b> <b>works</b> authority has to perform works on the route. Such <b>street</b> <b>works</b> need only be appropriate {{to the type of}} highway to which the notice relates. So for a potential bridleway, if the grass is cut, or a hedge cut back, this could constitute <b>street</b> <b>works</b> {{for the purpose of this}} section, so enabling it to be used. The authority then places s.228 [...] "Adoption of Streets" [...] notices at each end of the route. Only the owner of a street (or if more than one, the majority of the owners) has the power to object. If there is an objection, the <b>street</b> <b>works</b> authority can either discontinue, or it can go to the magistrates' court. A path created by this method will be maintainable at the public expense. Hampshire County Council has used this method for footpaths, and Essex County Council often uses it for new bridleways.|$|R

2500|$|Pope later immortalised Grub Street in his 1728 poem The Dunciad, a satire of [...] "the Grub-street Race" [...] of {{commercial}} writers. [...] Such infighting was not unusual, but a particularly notable episode occurred from 17521753, when Henry Fielding started a [...] "paper war" [...] against hack writers on Grub Street. [...] Fielding {{had worked in}} Grub Street during the late 1730s. [...] His career as a dramatist was curtailed by the Theatrical Licensing Act (provoked by Fielding's anti-Walpole satire such as Tom Thumb and Covent Garden Tragedy) {{and he turned to}} law, supporting his income with normal Grub <b>Street</b> <b>work.</b> [...] He also launched The Champion, and over the following years edited several newspapers, including from 17521754 The Covent-Garden Journal. [...] The [...] "war" [...] spanned many of London's publications, and resulted in countless essays, poems, and even a series of mock epic poems starting with Christopher Smart's The Hilliad (a pun on Pope's Dunciad). [...] Although {{it is not clear what}} started the dispute, it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported Fielding or Hill, and few in between.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1960s, {{work began}} on a limited-access highway {{paralleling}} US15 from Presho to the Southern Tier Expressway at Painted Post. The highway was completed and opened to traffic [...] as a realignment of US15. The interchange between US15 and NY17 (now concurrent with I-86) in Painted Post has been redesigned twice. The original {{configuration of the}} interchange featured a loop centered around the point where US15 met NY17, with ramps providing access {{to and from the}} loop from US15, NY17, and North Hamilton Street. The second design, in place until 2003, was a semi-diamond interchange, with US15 intersecting ramps from I-86 and NY17 at-grade. One connection, I-86/ NY17 east to North Hamilton Street, was lost in this version due to the ramp setup of the southern half of the interchange. North of the ramps leading to and from I-86/ NY17 westbound, the right of way of US15 continued north into Painted Post as North Hamilton Street. The current setup is a directional T interchange, which creates a freeway-to-freeway connection between US15 and I-86/ NY17. Separate ramps for North Hamilton Street from I-86/ NY17 were retained; however, for the first time, there was no direct connection between US15 and North Hamilton <b>Street.</b> <b>Work</b> on the interchange began in late 2003 and was completed in mid-2008.|$|E

60|$|I got {{together}} and placed on one file all my notes; and the net result was not cheering. I read them a second time. There was nothing {{that might not have}} been compiled at second-hand from other people's books--except, perhaps, the story of the fight in the harbor. The adventures of a Viking bad been written many times before; the history of a Greek galley-slave was no new thing, and though I wrote both, who could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my details? I might as well tell a tale of two thousand years hence. The Lords of Life and Death were as cunning as Grish Chunder had hinted. They would allow nothing to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men. Though I was convinced of this, yet I could not leave the tale alone. Exaltation followed reaction, not once, but twenty times in the next few weeks. My moods varied with the March sunlight and flying clouds. By night or in the beauty of a spring morning I perceived that I could write that tale and shift continents thereby. In the wet, windy afternoons, I saw that the tale might indeed be written, but would be nothing more than a faked, false-varnished, sham-rusted piece of Wardour <b>Street</b> <b>work</b> at the end. Then I blessed Charlie in many ways-- though it was no fault of his. He seemed to be busy with prize competitions, and I saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and grew ripe to spring, and the buds swelled in their sheaths. He did not care to read or talk of what he had read, and there was a new ring of self-assertion in his voice. I hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met; but Charlie alluded to it on every occasion, always as a story from which money was to be made.|$|E
