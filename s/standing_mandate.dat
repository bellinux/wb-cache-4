These standing orders {{must be approved by}} the government and duly certified. These orders aim to remove flexibility from the employer in terms of job, hours, timing, leave grant, productivity measures and other matters. The <b>standing</b> orders <b>mandate</b> that the employer classify its employees, state the shifts, payment of wages, rules for vacation, rules for sick leave, holidays, rules for termination amongst others.|$|R

40|$|One of the World Health Organization's longest <b>standing</b> <b>mandates</b> is the {{collection}} and routine reporting of information on population health. In addition to estimates of mortality and disease, assessment of health status from population based surveys contribute to estimates of population health. The first section of the paper briefly introduces the conceptual and operational basis to measure health, where health is measured through six domains (affect, cognition, pain, mobility, self-care and usual activities). The second section briefly notes that the main objective {{of this paper is}} to report on the average levels of health by age and sex groups for each domain of health across 66 population based surveys. The third section of this paper describes how we have applied the hierarchical ordered probit (HOPIT) model using vignettes to calibrate responses across survey populations, to self-reported levels of health on six domains. The data comes from the WHO Health Survey Study 2000 - 2001, from 66 population based surveys in 57 countries, representative of individuals 18 years and older. The fourth section provides results on comparable levels of health for each domain across populations, by age groups and sex. In order to further facilitate comparisons across countries, age-standardized aggregated results across all age groups, by sex, are also presented and compared to external data, such as GDP per capita (PPP) and life expectancy. The fifth section discusses the information content of the surveys, the added-value of the multi-dimensional approach and the comparability of responses across countries. The final section recommends additional analyses to be conducted. Comments on this discussion paper are most welcome and should be forwarded to...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{and even}} {{contradictory}} expressions of educational equity and justice coexist in public policies and discourses. Situated within these competing visions {{is the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s fragmented plan for school desegregation, initiated almost fifty years ago {{under the authority of}} the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. Even as long <b>standing</b> judicial <b>mandates</b> for school desegregation are overturned, many schools across the country maintain their practice of desegregation (Orfield 2 ̆ 6 Eaton, 1996). Moreover, while criticism is leveled against school desegregation policy from divergent fronts, there are also public calls for its continuation, adaptation, and even expansion (Bell, 1980; Kahlenberg, 2001; Ladson-Billings, 1998; Orfield, 2001; Wells and Crain, 1999). In the midst of these many claims and critiques, {{what does it mean to}} be a desegregated school, especially in an era of post-desegregation? This ethnographic study investigated this research question in the context of a small urban desegregated middle school. Sources of data included fieldnotes from participant observation, transcripts of interviews and focus groups, and written documents collected during the two school years that spanned 2001 – 2002. ^ This study conceptualizes desegregation as an interplay between the school 2 ̆ 7 s institutional contexts, its social relationships, and its community discourses. Through this interplay, administrators, teachers, and students negotiated the work of school desegregation reform, their roles as individuals and as members of overlapping groups, and their understandings about race and racism. In many ways, the reform of desegregation seemed disconnected from the school 2 ̆ 7 s institutional context, yet its participation in the local school district 2 ̆ 7 s voluntary desegregation program ensured a relatively diverse population and thus, shaped the ways in which adults and youth enacted social relationships and employed community discourses within the school. Analysis of this interplay is particularly important as educators and policymakers make decisions about the future of school desegregation, and continue to reinvent and transform schooling for a pluralistic democracy. ...|$|R
5000|$|Serious labor {{troubles}} also beset {{the organization}} during the tumultuous political {{events of the}} late 1980s in Mexico, culminating {{in a series of}} strikes and the bankruptcy of SOSA Texcoco in December 1986. The company and facilities were sold at a bargain rate to a collective of investors called Sociedad Anónima de Capital Variable in 1991, who stated their intent to try and make the facility profitable again. However, the primary issue remained that El Caracol was never successfully automated and relied almost entirely on manual labor to harvest either salt or algae; the company's primary efforts were thus to renegotiate the unsustainably generous collective bargaining contracts for manual laborers (exclusively reserved for Institutional Revolutionary Party members in good <b>standing)</b> that were <b>mandated</b> upon SOSA Texcoco by the Madrid administration during the last years of the socialist PRI's 70-year monopoly on Mexican politics ("la dictadura perfecta" [...] ). After the Mexican Supreme Court (which was still entirely composed of PRI loyalists) ruled in 1991 that the old contracts must be honored if any profit-seeking business was to resume operations on the site, the new company promptly admitted defeat and folded. Now basically prohibited by law from generating a profit on the site, the government liquidated the original deed, voided the worker contracts and seized the inactive facility as a public asset.|$|R

The strategy did not go well with the new Carlist leader Manuel Fal, who nevertheless in 1934 appointed Comín to Council of Culture, a congregation of Carlist pundits. The same year he grew to regional Aragón jefe, presided over dynamic growth of the provincial organization and emerged among most active party propagandists, attending Traditionalists feasts from Poblet in Catalonia to Quintillo in Andalusia. He also founded a local El Lunes weekly and collaborated with a number of others Carlist periodicals.|$|R
