5|$|Like most of Saturn's larger satellites, Enceladus rotates {{synchronously}} {{with its}} orbital period, keeping one face pointed toward Saturn. Unlike Earth's Moon, Enceladus {{does not appear}} to librate more than 1.5° about its <b>spin</b> <b>axis.</b> However, analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1:4 forced secondary spin–orbit libration. This libration could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.|$|E
5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E
30|$|A 1 -in. {{cylindrical}} specimen, {{which is}} {{fixed to the}} quartz glass tube holder by using quartz fiber, can be heated up {{to a maximum of}} 700 ^∘C. The cylindrical axis of the specimen is set parallel to that of the glass tube, which is also fixed along the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> by using a collet. Thus, the cylindrical specimen’s axis aligns parallel to the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> of TSpin. After adjusting the angle of the glass tube so as to make the specimen’s orientation marker line vertical using a laser level (Fig.  2), the collet is tightened to fix the specimen to the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis.</b> The specimen’s marker can be adjusted within a few degrees from the vertical. Fixing the glass tube with the collet reduces wobbling during spinning and enables precise orientation of the specimen.|$|R
40|$|The {{deuterium}} NMR {{spectra of}} molecules oriented in mixtures of nematic liquid crystalline phases {{for which the}} macroscopic diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropy (Δχ) is nearly zero reveal {{the dynamics of the}} director for different angles the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> makes with the magnetic field and for different spinning speeds. It is observed that a switch over of the director orientation occurs {{as a function of the}} spinning speed and the angle the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> makes with the magnetic field. The farther the angle between the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> and the magnetic field from the magic angle, the higher the spinning speed required to effect such a switch over of the director orientation. The switch over takes place gradually as indicated by the appearance of the ‘powder pattern’ in the 2 H NMR spectra...|$|R
50|$|The aim of upeet is to {{transport}} a spinning top {{from the ground}} to the player's open palm. Further, the top is supposed to continue spinning for a while on the palm, with the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> in the vertical position.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, a {{spinning}} superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely {{aligned with the}} <b>spin</b> <b>axis.</b> The effect, the London moment, was {{put to good use}} in Gravity ProbeB. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes. This was critical to the experiment since {{it is one of the}} few ways to accurately determine the <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> of an otherwise featureless sphere.|$|E
40|$|A {{solid-state}} NMR analogue of the solution-state residual dipolar coupling {{effect is}} demonstrated.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the liquid crystal director in “near magic angle ” sample spinning has been investigated in mesophases with positive and negative diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropies and their mixtures with near-zero macroscopic diamagnetic anisot-ropy. To this end the deuteron quadrupolar splitting of deuterochloroform dissolved in liquid crystals has been monitored. In systems with weakly positive diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropy (Ax), the director has been observed to switch from an ori-entation parallel to the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> at low rotational speeds to one perpendicular to the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> at high rotational speeds when the angle (6) the axis of rotation makes with the magnetic field is smaller than the magic angle (0,). For systems with a small negative Ax similar director behaviour has been observed for 13 greater than B,,,. 1...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> {{representation}} is introduced.

25|$|The axle of the {{spinning}} wheel defines the <b>spin</b> <b>axis.</b> The rotor is constrained to spin about an axis, {{which is always}} perpendicular to the axis of the inner gimbal. So the rotor possesses three degrees of rotational freedom and its axis possesses two.|$|E
25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.|$|R
30|$|Making the {{standard}} specimen’s magnetization parallel or {{perpendicular to the}} <b>spinning</b> <b>axis,</b> we can calibrate the axial or in-plane components, respectively. Measurements were repeated by rotating the specimen 180 ° in order to cancel out undesirable voltage offsets. When measuring the axial component, the specimen is translated against the fluxgate sensor. The output voltage should vary {{as a function of}} the position along the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> (Kono et al. 1991). Least square fitting based on the dipole curve can provide m_z expressed in V that is related to the magnetic moment of {{the standard}} specimen in Am^ 2. For the in-plane component, the moment direction is precisely assigned to be vertical using a laser level (Fig.  3), and then, spinning was repeated at several different positions. The amplitude of the output voltage is calculated by applying FFT to each set of spinning data, and the relationship between the voltage amplitude and the axial position gives m_h, which is related to the reference magnetic moment.|$|R

25|$|This {{average torque}} is {{perpendicular}} to {{the direction in which}} the rotation axis is tilted away from the ecliptic pole, so that it does not change the axial tilt itself. The magnitude of the torque from the Sun (or the Moon) varies with the gravitational object's alignment with the Earth's <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> and approaches zero when it is orthogonal.|$|E
25|$|CMGs {{differ from}} {{reaction}} wheels. The latter apply torque simply by changing rotor spin speed, but the former tilt the rotor's <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> without necessarily changing its spin speed. CMGs are also far more power efficient. For {{a few hundred}} watts and about 100kg of mass, large CMGs have produced thousands of newton meters of torque. A reaction wheel of similar capability would require megawatts of power.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to control}} {{systematic}} error in the measurement of the CMB anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate. The <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> is also tilted back from the orbital velocity vector as a precaution against possible deposits of residual atmospheric gas on the optics as well against the infrared glow that would result from fast neutral particles hitting its surfaces at extremely high speed.|$|E

30|$|Thirty-two slits on a {{rotating}} disk {{fixed to the}} <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> are used to monitor the spinning angle with a photo-interrupter, {{and one of the}} slits is marked as the zero angle, which is used to orient the specimen’s marker line. Heating and cooling positions are identified with another photo-interrupter according to the translation. When measuring the magnetization, spinning is repeated at ten or more axial positions that are adjusted with 1 -mm-spaced slits and a photo-interrupter. A specimen is translated over a 15 -cm interval parallel to the axis near the fluxgate sensor.|$|R
30|$|A single {{fluxgate}} sensor is fixed approximately 5  cm {{away from the}} <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> to measure the radial component of the magnetic field produced by a specimen. Translation of the specimen along the axis allows both the axial and in-plane components of magnetization to produce signals for the radial {{fluxgate sensor}}, by decomposition of the signal as described by Kono et al. (1991). Amplification of the output voltage from the fluxgate sensor can be selected from 1 ×, 10 ×, 100 ×, and 1000 ×, depending on a specimen’s magnetization intensity.|$|R
25|$|When an {{external}} torque {{is applied to}} a spinning gyroscope along an axis that is {{at right angles to}} the <b>spin</b> <b>axis,</b> the rim velocity that is associated with the spin becomes radially directed in relation to the external torque axis. This causes a Coriolis force to act on the rim {{in such a way as}} to tilt the gyroscope at right angles to the direction that the external torque would have tilted it. This tendency has the effect of keeping spinning bodies stably aligned in space.|$|E
25|$|Gun {{fire control}} systems require {{corrections}} to gun-order angles (bearing and elevation) {{to compensate for}} deck tilt (pitch and roll). In traditional systems, a stabilizing gyroscope with a vertical <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> corrects for deck tilt, and stabilizes the optical sights and radar antenna. However, gun barrels point in a direction different from the line of sight to the target, to anticipate target movement {{and fall of the}} projectile due to gravity, among other factors. Gun mounts roll and pitch with the deck plane, but also require stabilization. Gun orders include angles computed from the vertical gyro data, and those computations involve Euler angles.|$|E
25|$|Some {{accretion}} discs produce jets of twin, highly collimated, {{and fast}} outflows that emerge {{in opposite directions}} from close to the disc. The direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the <b>spin</b> <b>axis</b> of the black hole. The jet production mechanism and indeed the jet composition on very small scales are not understood at present due to the resolution of astronomical instruments being too low. The jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband, where very-long-baseline interferometry {{can be used to}} study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-parsec scales. However, they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the inverse-Compton scattering process, and so AGN jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation.|$|E
40|$|NMR {{spectra of}} liquid {{crystalline}} phases and the molecules dissolved therein, spinning at {{and near the}} magic angle provide information on the director dynamics and the order parameter. The studies on {{the dynamics of the}} liquid crystal director for sample spinning near magic angle in mesophases with positive and negative diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropies (Delta chi) and their mixtures with near-zero macroscopic diamagnetic susceptibility anisotropies have been reported. In systems with weakly positive Delta chi, the director has been observed to switch from an orientation parallel to the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> at low rotational speeds to one perpendicular to the <b>spinning</b> <b>axis</b> at high rotational speeds, when the angle theta, the axis of rotation makes with the magnetic field is smaller than the magic angle theta(m). For systems with a small negative Delta chi, similar director behaviour has been observed for theta greater than theta(m). At magic angle, the spectra under slow spinning speeds exhibit a centre band and side bands at integral values of the spinning speeds. The intensities of the spinning side bands have been shown to contain information on the sign and the magnitude of the order parameter(s). The results are discussed with illustrative examples. Results on the orientation of the chemical shielding tensor obtained from a combination of the NMR studies in the solid and the liquid crystalline states, have been described...|$|R

25|$|Conservation is {{not always}} a full {{explanation}} for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its <b>spinning</b> <b>axis,</b> and another about its precession axis. Also, in any planetary system, the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.|$|R
25|$|Changes in {{the orbital}} {{eccentricity}} of Earth occur on {{a cycle of}} about 100,000 years. The inclination, or tilt, of Earth's axis varies periodically between 22° and 24.5°. (The tilt of Earth's axis {{is responsible for the}} seasons; the greater the tilt, the greater the contrast between summer and winter temperatures.) Changes in the tilt occur in a cycle 41,000 years long. Precession of the equinoxes, or wobbles on Earth's <b>spin</b> <b>axis,</b> complete every 26,000 years. According to the Milankovitch theory, these factors cause a periodic cooling of Earth, with the coldest part in the cycle occurring about every 40,000 years. The main effect of the Milankovitch cycles is to change the contrast between the seasons, not the amount of solar heat Earth receives. These cycles within cycles predict that during maximum glacial advances, winter and summer temperatures are lower. The result is less ice melting than accumulating, and glaciers build up.|$|E
25|$|Tests of the Lense–Thirring precession, {{consisting}} of small secular precessions of {{the orbit of}} a test particle in motion around a central rotating mass, for example, a planet or a star, have been performed with the LAGEOS satellites, but many aspects of them remain controversial. The same effect may have been detected in the data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, a former probe in orbit around Mars; also such a test raised a debate. First attempts to detect the Sun's Lense–Thirring effect on the perihelia of the inner planets have been recently reported as well. Frame dragging would cause the orbital plane of stars orbiting near a supermassive black hole to precess about the black hole <b>spin</b> <b>axis.</b> This effect should be detectable {{within the next few}} years via astrometric monitoring of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the no-hair theorems of general relativity.|$|E
