Thorough statistical analysis is performed for spectral reflectances from various races and different face parts. A spectral imaging system has been designed and calibrated for human portraits. The calibrated imaging system {{has the ability to}} represent not only the facial skin but also the spectra of lips, eyes and hair from various races as well. The generated <b>spectral</b> <b>images</b> can be applied to color-imaging system design and analysis. To evaluate the <b>image</b> quality of <b>spectral</b> imaging systems, a visual psychophysical image quality experiment has been performed in this dissertation. The <b>spectral</b> <b>images</b> were simulated based on real spectral imaging system. Meaningful image quality results have been obtained for <b>spectral</b> <b>images</b> generated from different spectral imaging systems. To bridge the gap between the physical measures and subjective visual perceptions of image quality, four image distortion factors were defined. Image quality metrics were obtained and evaluated based statistical analysis and multiple analysis. The image quality metrics have high correlation with subjective assessment for image quality. The image quality contribution of the distortion factors were evaluated.
