40|$|Secrecy {{to protect}} {{intelligence}} <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> methods appears {{often in the}} nation 2 ̆ 7 s discourse about controversial national security matters. Often it is asked whether such secrecy {{is consistent with the}} nation 2 ̆ 7 s democratic principles and processes. This article argues such principles and processes provide a framework through which we try to answer questions about secrecy and indeed legitimate them, but are often too broad to provide definitive guidance in specific cases. At the same time, the <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> methods argument itself is overbroad {{because of the nature of}} the <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> methods themselves; the tentative nature of intelligence assessments derived from those <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> methods; the often modest role intelligence plays in policymaking; the sometimes flawed logic of the <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> methods argument; and the costs incurred by information asymmetries.

Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power <b>source</b> <b>and</b> capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
