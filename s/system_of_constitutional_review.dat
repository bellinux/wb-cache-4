Conventional wisdom in the current constitutional discourse in the postcommunist countries of Eastern and Central Europe has it that constitutional rights, {{in order to be}} meaningful, require a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> of political branches performed by non-elected branches of the government, and in particular, by the judiciary.

40|$|Most of the European {{countries}} {{have chosen the}} centralized <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review,</b> performed by a unique authority empowered with the competence of removing from the normative ensemble those legal provisions that do not comply with the principles and rules comprised in the Basic Law. This „European model” {{has proved to be}} more appropriate than the so-called „American model” in what concerns the compatibility with the European jurisdictional mechanism. Romania has adopted the same European trend and the Constitutional Court has become a very important actor in the Romanian legal landscape. From the very beginning of its activity, it has influenced in a great measure the national normative system. It has been sometimes criticized and accused that it interferes in an excessive way in the legislative process. Due to its competence to regulate the juridical conflicts between the public authorities and its possibility to repeal laws before their promulgation, it has been many times in the centre of heavy attacks, mostly from different political forces, often driven through mass media. Nevertheless, despite of its detractors, the Constitutional Court has proven, over the years, its ability to develop the Romanian normative system. The present paper intends to display the most significant contribution of the Romanian Constitutional Court in improving various legal regulations. In the same time and much more important, using concrete examples from the Court’s case-law, the paper also intends to demonstrate that the Constitutional Court of Romania has been a major factor of improving peoples’ life, removing unconstitutional obstacles set in front of the unimpeded exercise of their fundamental rights and freedoms...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} define the {{normative}} nature {{and content of the}} prohibition of retrogression under the rules of international law, as applicable in Finland. Further, this thesis seeks to examine the effectiveness of the implementation and protection of social rights in Finland; in particular, the operation of the prohibition of retrogression in the Finnish <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> and human rights impact assessment. Under article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 12 (3) of the European Social Charter, state parties are under an obligation to progressively realise a higher level of social rights. The mirror principle of this requirement is the prohibition of retrogression, according to which a state cannot take any unnecessarily regressive steps in the realisation of social rights. Since the start of the European economic crisis in 2009, several European states have resorted to measures that have had a negative impact on the level of social rights in those states. Consequently, various supranational and national judicial organs have been required to examine the justifiability of those measures, thus clarifying the content of the prohibition of retrogression. From these decisions and statements it is possible to derive certain criteria for assessing compliance with the prohibition of retrogression: the regressive measure has to be temporary, it has to be necessary and proportionate, it cannot be discriminatory and the minimum core content of each respective rights has to be protected. The effectiveness of social rights {{can be seen as a}} tool for promoting equality, justice and democracy in society, as the effective enjoyment of social rights increases the participation of vulnerable groups within it. Therefore, compliance with the prohibition of retrogression is particularly crucial at times of economic recession in order to protect the rights of these most vulnerable groups. The effectiveness of social rights can be argued to consist of an effective monitoring system within a particular state, effective remedies for an individual, and the commitment of all public authorities to conduct a systematic human rights impact assessment on different levels of decision-making. It is argued that through these mechanisms, compliance with the prohibition of retrogression could be sufficiently guaranteed. In Finland, the monitoring of the realisation of social rights is based on the competence of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Chancellor of Justice of the Government and various administrative authorities. Additionally, the supranational supervisory mechanisms, in particular the collective complaint procedure under the Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter, complement the domestic system of monitoring. Reviewing the constitutionality of new legislation has, however, traditionally fallen under the competence of the Constitutional Law Committee of the Parliament. The prohibition of retrogression is mainly of relevance in the ex ante constitutional review by the Constitutional Law Committee of the Parliament. In certain individual cases the prohibition can also be of relevance within the courts. This kind of ex post review by courts could, however, take place mainly through a human rights friendly interpretation or through the enforcement of subjective social rights. Due to the nature of the prohibition of retrogression, the norm should primarily be taken into account by the legislature before any decisions on potentially regressive measures have been made. The operation of the prohibition of retrogression in the Finnish <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> and human rights impact assessment can be seen as partly ineffective due to the fact that the budgetary decision-making is not subject to systematic human rights impact assessment. This means that while resource allocations in budget decisions may have a regressive impact on social rights, the requirements of the prohibition of retrogression are not being reviewed in this context. This cannot be seen as justifiable, considering that the prohibition of retrogression requires a state to conduct a sufficient analysis on the potential impacts on social rights and to explore alternative options in order to avoid negative impacts on the rights of the most vulnerable groups in the society...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in support <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> judicial <b>review</b> {{points to the need}} to curtail the legal and political power of majority rule instantiated by democratic legislative institutions. This article aims to challenge the counter majoritarian argument for judicial review by showing that there is very little difference, at least morally speaking, between the current structure <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> judicial <b>review</b> in the US, and a system that would impose limits on majoritarian decisions procedures by an entirely randomized mechanism. The argument is based on a hypothetical model <b>of</b> a randomized <b>system</b> <b>of</b> judicial review, and proceeds to show that between the actual practices of judicial review in the US, and the hypothetical randomized model, there is not much to recommend the former.

40|$|Even {{many years}} after Marbury v. Madison, {{and even in the}} face of the spread <b>of</b> {{aggressive}} <b>constitutional</b> court <b>review</b> in democracies around the world, the ability of courts to assert their authority against the political branches continues to demand explanation. Especially in newly minted democracies, and most so in countries emerging from authoritarian rule, how courts can engage the misuse of state power remains a bit of a mystery. This Article examines the hitherto under-studied phenomenon of judicial deferral as providing some insight into how courts acquire the institutional capacity to engage in robust judicial review and, in particular, how the deferral of implementation avoids direct political confrontations for the judiciary. Unlike in the US, constitutional court decisions around the world frequently delay the practical effect of their decisions. The Article explores various modes of judicial deferral, including suspended declarations of invalidity, doctrines of prospective overruling and progressive implementation, and more implicit or forms of delay involving narrow rulings paired with broad dicta. It also considers different functions served by judicial deferral, including practical concerns about smooth transition from one legal regime to another, democratic legitimacy and dialogue, and more political concerns about ensuring the legal and political preconditions necessary for effective judicial review; and the connections between these various 2 ̆ 7 first 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 second 2 ̆ 7 order modes and functions of deferral. Once examined in this light, it turns out that various deferral-based strategies have been by courts in some of the most successful <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> in recent years, including in Germany, India, Colombia and Indonesia. Finally, the Article turns to both the preconditions necessary for successful deferral and the corresponding risks when delay simply postpones an inevitable conflict...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis enquires {{into the}} establishment, {{justification}} and scope <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> in Hong Kong against the unique <b>constitutional</b> order <b>of</b> "One Country, Two Systems" established in Hong Kong after its return to China in 1997. <b>Constitutional</b> <b>review</b> had emerged in Hong Kong in the pre-handover judicial {{enforcement of the}} Bill of Rights. But its establishment was in the CFA's decision in Ng Ka Ling. The central question concerning <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> in Hong Kong is that {{the text of the}} Basic Law does not expressly provide for this authority. In light of the theories on the law <b>of</b> constitution and <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> advocated by Kelsen, Dworkin and Cappelletti, this thesis argues that the higher law status of the Basic Law, understood in both positive and normative senses, makes <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> not only scientifically necessary but morally desirable. Further, it is argued that given the common law legal system and the checks and balances in the political structure of present Hong Kong, it is most appropriate for the courts to exercise the power <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review.</b> However, <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> under the Basic Law is an intra-jurisdictional issue, involving not only the operation of the Hong Kong legal system, but also the legal system in mainland China. The Hong Kong courts' jurisdiction <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> is therefore a limited one. In that sense and to that extent, there is {{what might be called the}} 'counter-Beijing difficulty' in the Hong Kong courts' exercise of the power <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review.</b> Nonetheless, the power <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> has made the CFA a powerful court. It is the unwritten Basic Law formulated by the courts that is shaping OCTS. It is argued that to maintain the workability of the OCTS framework, due judicial restraint seems sensible and desirable. ...|$|R

40|$|Judicial {{review is}} the core {{competence}} <b>of</b> the <b>constitutional</b> judicature in Europe, which is largely shaped by the Austrian and German models <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> justice. In that context, the issue <b>of</b> initiating the <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> legislation is extremely important. Depending on the subject who is authorized to initiate this proceeding, the <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> may be twofold: the abstract control and the incidental control. The former type <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> is generally initiated by political bodies of authority {{at the national level}} and regional authorities, as well as the parliamentary minority. On the other hand, the latter type <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> is exclusively initiated by regular courts in the form of judicial motions.

40|$|Traditional {{characteristics}} of Nordic constitutionalism have been challenged increasingly, {{since the late}} 1980 s, by tendencies toward rights-based constitutionalism. Reminiscent of several other theaters within the global constitutional arena, northern constitutionalism has also witnessed a clear shift from the legislative sovereignty paradigm to one in which legislative acts are increasingly subordinated to rights-based judicial review. However, it is doubtful whether the Nordic variants of new constitutionalism {{will lead to a}} juristocracy or adoption of full-fledged judicial review typical for Continental constitutional courts and their counterpart in the United States. Instead, various weaker and pluralistic forms <b>of</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>review</b> mechanisms and doctrines, which rely on both legislative and judicial institutions and purport to provide effective protection both to rights and to democratic values, are not just more likely but, in fact, already have begun to emerge since the early 1990 s.
