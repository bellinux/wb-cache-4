The principle of the capacitive <b>spark</b> circuit of ASTM is studied to charge an appropriate capacitance connected across the <b>spark</b> gap through a large resistor by a high voltage from the source of power supply until the initiation of <b>spark.</b> Different <b>spark</b> energies could be obtained mainly by varying {{the value of the}} capacitance and the supply current.

50|$|In pyrotechnics, {{iron filings}} and metal alloys such as {{magnalium}} {{may be used}} to create <b>sparks.</b> The quantity and style of <b>sparks</b> produced depends on the composition and pyrophoricity of the metal and can be used to identify the type of metal by <b>spark</b> testing. In the case of iron, the presence of carbon is required, as in carbon steel — about 0.7% is best for large <b>sparks.</b> The carbon burns explosively in the hot iron and this produces pretty, branching <b>sparks.</b> The color of <b>sparks</b> used in pyrotechnics is determined by the material that the <b>sparks</b> are made from, with the possibility of adding different chemical compounds to certain materials to further influence the color of the <b>sparks.</b> The duration a <b>spark’s</b> existence is determined by the initial size of the particle, with a larger size leading to a longer-lasting <b>spark.</b>|$|R
