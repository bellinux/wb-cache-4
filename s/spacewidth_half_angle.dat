The flow {{is assumed to be}} isothermal, laminar and incompressible with constant thermo-physical properties. The velocity field, mass flow rate, and entropy generation are investigated for several <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> in combination with several values of pressure drops. The effect of diffuser <b>half</b> <b>angle</b> on the entropy generation is investigated and discussed. Furthermore, the effect of the <b>half</b> <b>angle</b> of diffuser on the diffuser efficiency and the effect on the rectification efficiency are explained. It is shown that there is an optimum operation <b>half</b> <b>angle</b> for which the diffuser efficiency has a maximum value. In the case of a micro-diffuser 1 mm long with an inlet diameter of 100 μm, the optimum <b>half</b> <b>angle</b> was found to be 2. 5 °.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the impact of optimization of magnification on performance parameters of the variable resolution X-ray (VRX) CT scanner. MethodsA realistic model based on an actual VRX CT scanner was implemented in the GATE Monte Carlo simulation platform. To evaluate the influence of system magnification, spatial resolution, field-of-view (FOV) and scatter-to-primary ratio of the scanner were estimated for both fixed and optimum object magnification at each detector rotation angle. Comparison and inference between these performance parameters were performed angle by angle to determine appropriate object position at each opening <b>half</b> <b>angle.</b> Results: Optimization of magnification resulted in a trade-off between spatial resolution and FOV of the scanner at opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> of 90 degrees- 12 degrees, where the spatial resolution increased up to 50 % and the scatter-to-primary ratio decreased from 4. 8 % to 3. 8 % at a detector angle of about 90 degrees for the same FOV and X-ray energy spectrum. The disadvantage of magnification optimization at these angles is the significant reduction of the FOV (up to 50 %). Moreover, magnification optimization was definitely beneficial for opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> below 12 degrees improving the spatial resolution from 7. 5 cy/mm to 20 cy/mm. Meanwhile, the FOV {{increased by more than}} 50 % at these angles. Conclusion: It can be concluded that optimization of magnification is essential for opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> below 12 degrees. For opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> between 90 degrees and 12 degrees, the VRX CT scanner magnification should be set according to the desired spatial resolution and FOV.

40|$|Abstract. Choked {{converging}} nozzle {{flow and}} heat transfer characteristics are numerically investigated {{by means of}} a recent computational model that integrates the axisymmetric continuity, state, momentum and energy equations. To predict the combined effects of nozzle geometry, friction and heat transfer rates, analyses are conducted with sufficiently wide ranges of covergence <b>half</b> <b>angle,</b> surface rough-ness and heat flux conditions. Numerical findings show that inlet Mach and Nusselt numbers decrease up to 23. 1 % and 15. 8 % with surface heat flux and by 15. 13 % and 4. 8 % due to surface roughness. Considering each convergence <b>half</b> <b>angle</b> case individually results in a linear relation between nozzle discharge coefficients and exit Reynolds numbers with similar slopes. Heat flux implementation, by decreas-ing the shear stress values, lowers the risks due to wear hazards at upstream sections of flow walls; however the final 10 % downstream nozzle portion is determined to be quite critical, where shear stress attains the highest magnitudes. Heat transfer rates are seen to increase in the streamwise direction up to 2. 7 times; however high convergence <b>half</b> <b>angles,</b> heat flux and surface roughness conditions lower inlet Nusselt numbers by 70 %, 15. 8 % and 4. 8 % respectively...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of a three dimensional diamond jet interaction flowfield at various diamond injector <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> into a supersonic crossflow {{were presented in}} this thesis. The numerical study was performed to improve {{the understanding of the}} flame holding potential by extending the numerical database envelop to include different injector <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> and examine the flow at Mach 2 and Mach 5. The configuration of a diamond injector shape was found to reduce the flow separation upstream, and produce an attached shock at the initial freestream interaction and the injection fluid has an increased field penetration as compared to circular injectors. The CFD studies were also aimed at providing additional information on the uses of multiple injectors for flow control. The numerical runs were performed with diamond injectors at <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> of 10 ???? and 20 ???? at a freestream Mach number of 5. The transverse counter-rotating pair of vortices found in the 15 ???? does not form within the 10 ???? and 20 ???? cases at freestream Mach number 5. The 10 ???? case had a barrel shock that became streamlined in the lateral direction. The 20 ???? barrel shock had a very large spanwise expansion and became streamlined in the transverse direction. In both cases the trailing edge of their barrel shocks did not form the flat ??????V?????? shape, as found in the baseline case. At Mach 2 the 10 ???? and 15 ???? cases both formed the flat ??????V?????? shape at the trailing edge of the barrel shocks, and formed the transverse counter rotating vortex pairs. The 10 ???? multiple injector case successfully showed the interaction shocks forming into a larger planer shock downstream of the injectors. The swept 15 ???? case produced interaction shocks that were too weak to properly form a planar shock downstream. This planar shock has potential for flow control. Depending on the angle of incidence of the injector fluid with the freestream flow and the <b>half</b> <b>angle</b> of the diamond injector, the planar shocks will form further upstream or downstream of the injector...|$|R
