40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the number}} of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee must increase in the future because of the increase of the aged. The pathogenic mechanisms of OA haven't been elucidated yet, but it is supposed that mediate pannus may cause the factors for irreversible cartilage damage in the inflammatory process. Therefore {{it is very important to}} find and predict OA at the early stage. Now there were many indices to determine joint damage with OA, for example, cytokines including IL, TNF, TGF, matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMPs), proteoglycan (PG), hyaluronate (HA), super oxide, adhesion molecules including, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and PECAM. In this study, we measured that the soluble VCAM- 1 (sVCAM- 1), soluble collagen (<b>sCOLL),</b> heparansulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), uronic acis and CRP in synovial fluids (SF) with OA. A positive correlation between the level of sVCAM- 1 and <b>sCOLL</b> (ρ = 0. 652) was noted. However there was no factor showing a correlation with CRP. It was suggested that the levels of sVCAM- 1 and <b>sCOLL</b> in the synovia fluid were active inflammation indices of knee damage, as the different aspects from CRP. The level of HSPG also showed a unique trend because HSPG on the cell surface was quickly digested endocytosis, so that it was not suitable for the inflammatory index in synovial fluid with OA. 変形性膝関節炎(OA) 患者は,高齢化社会の到来とともに今後ますます増加するものと考えられる｡OAの発症メカニズムについては,関節軟骨の破壊･修復やパンヌス形成に関わる多くの関連因子(サイトカイン,マトリックス分解酵素,分解酵素抑制因子,プロテオグリカン,活性酸素,細胞接着因子など) について,多面的に研究が進んでいる｡しかし,膝関節の炎症初期の病態のメカニズムについては,なお詳細に解明されておらず,関節炎初期の炎症指標の検索が今後さらに必要と考えられる｡本研究で私たちは, OA患者膝関節液中の細胞外マトリックス構成成分であるコラーゲン,へパラン硫酸プロテオグリカン,ウロン酸および炎症の最も初期に血管内皮細胞に出現するVCAM- 1 等の可溶化成分濃度を測定した｡患者膝関節液(SF) 中の可溶性コラーゲン量と可溶性VCAM- 1 (sVCAM- 1) 量とは有意な正の相関関係が(ρ= 0. 652) 観察された｡しかし,ヘパラン硫酸プロテオグリカン(HSPG) と可溶性コラーゲン(sCOLL) 値間には有意な相関関係は確認されなかった｡また,一般に炎症の指標として用いられるCRP値とも比戟検討したが,CRP値と他の測定項目値とは一定の相関関係は存在しなかった。以上の結果より,OA患者のSF中の炎症マーカ-として,急性炎症時には従来の炎症指標蛋白質であるCRP値が有力であるというSipe JDの報告から推測するとsCOLLとsVCAM- 1 はCRP値と一定の相関を示さないことより,CRPの動態とは異なった炎症指標としての有用性が考えられる｡しかし,HSPGはエンドサイトシスにより速やかに代謝されるためSF中への解離が少なく,炎症指標としての可能性は低いと考えられる...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{practicing}} secure programming, it {{is important}} to understand the restrictive influence programmed entities have on the propagation of authority in a program. To precisely model authority propagation in patterns of interacting entities, we have generalized an earlier formalism [SV 05 b] into “Knowledge behaviour Models ” (KBM). To describe such patterns, we present a new domain specific declarative language <b>SCOLL</b> (Safe Collaboration Language), which operational semantics are expressed by means of KBMs. To interpret <b>SCOLL</b> patterns we have built SCOLLAR: a model checker and generator based on constraint logic programming. SCOLLAR not only indicates whether the safety requirements are guaranteed by the restricted behaviour of partially trusted subjects, but also lists the different ways in which the behaviour of a trusted entity can be restricted to guarantee the safety properties without restricting its required functionality and (re-) usability. The tool helps programmers to build correct trusted components that can safely interact with partially trusted and untrusted components. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of chondroitin sulfate (CS) on the serum levels of Coll 2 - 1 in patients with knee OA. METHODS: Seventy two patients with unilateral symptomatic knee OA were involved in a post-authorization open-label study evaluating CS (800 mg/day). The primary outcome was the % relative change in serum Coll 2 - 1 (<b>sColl</b> 2 - 1). The secondary outcomes were the evaluation of pain (VAS) and function (Lequesne's Index). Responders and non-responders were classified according to OMERACT-OARSI recommendations. Finally, an original cut-off method was applied to categorize patients and interpret individual variations in serum levels of Coll 2 - 1. RESULTS: Patients showed no difference in the <b>sColl</b> 2 - 1 levels at baseline. When considering responders and non-responders from the ITT population, a significant difference was found for Coll 2 - 1 at 3 months (p = 0. 030) and 6 months (p = 0. 038). A decrease in pain (VAS) and an improvement in function (LI) were recorded throughout the visits (p < 0. 01). Considering an intra-batch cut-off of 21 %, CS decreased Coll 2 - 1 serum levels between baseline and 1 -month visit compared to the value of Coll 2 - 1 before treatment (screening visit) which can be interpreted as a drastic reduction of the proportion of patients with an increase of Coll 2 - 1 over 21 % (reduction from 13 to 3 %). It also consisted in a more important proportion of patients with a decrease in Coll 2 - 1 (from 5 to 10 %). CONCLUSION: This study proposes a new approach for the analysis and the interpretation of the individual variation in biomarker levels and introduces the notion of metabolic responders.

40|$|Transport of {{sea spray}} aerosol in coastal areas (“sea spray” effect) {{can have a}} marked {{influence}} on isotopic ratios of terrestrial ecosystems shifting terrestrial isotopic ratios towards unusual high values masking the original terrestrial signature. It is unclear so far if and to what extend sea spray influences other stable isotopes besides sulphur. In this study, we examined if the effect was also detectable in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen stable isotopes of bone collagen and carbonate, respectively. Multi-isotope data of mammals sampled from the Viking Haithabu and medieval Schleswig sites in Northern Germany were analysed according to a previously developed approximation procedure and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering in order to quantify the sea spray effect in the isotopes under study. While {{we were able to}} approximate an influence of the sea spray effect of at least 32. 8 % and 62. 8 % in δ 13 Ccarb and δ 18 Ocarb, respectively, {{it was not possible to}} validate or approximate this effect in δ 13 Ccoll and δ 15 Ncoll. Indeed, detection of the sea spray effect not only in δ 34 <b>Scoll,</b> but also in δ 13 Ccarb and δ 18 Ocarb is of particular importance for studies on both prehistoric and recent material. GMM clustering on terrestrial herbivorous and marine piscivorous mammals was used to confirm the existing influence and to validate the approximated correction for the sea spray effect in the respective isotopic ratios (δ 13 Ccarb, δ 18 Ocarb, δ 34 <b>Scoll)</b> and the correction for the limnic influence on δ 15 Ncoll approximated in a previous study. After correction, the clustering results markedly changed corresponding to the actual diet and habitat preference of the examined species. Although our study focused on palaeoecology, we suggest that GMM clustering also constitutes a very useful tool for modern landscape ecology based on stable isotope analyses...|$|E
40|$|In Decentralized Trust Management (DTM) {{authorization}} {{decisions are}} made by multiple principals who can also delegate decisions to each other. Therefore, a policy change of one principal will often affect who gets authorized by another principal. In such a system of influenceable authorization a number of principals may want to coordinate their policies to achieve long time guarantees {{on a set of}} safety goals. The problem we tackle in this paper is to find minimal restrictions to the policies of a set of principals that achieve their safety goals. This will enable building useful DTM systems that are safe by design, simply by relying on the policy restrictions of the collaborating principals. To this end we will model DTM safety problems in <b>Scoll</b> [1], an approach that proved useful to model confinement in object capability systems [2]...|$|E
40|$|In {{capability}} secure systems it {{is important}} to understand the restrictive influence programmed entities (e. g. procedures, objects, modules, components) have on the propagation of influence in a program. We explain why Take-Grant systems are not sufficiently expressive for this task, and we provide a new formalism – Authority Reduction systems (AR-systems) – to model collaborative propagation. AR-systems provide safe and tractable approximations of adequate precision for the confinement properties in configurations of collaborating entities. We propose a domain specific declarative language – <b>SCOLL</b> (Safe COLlaboration Language) – to express the collaborative behavior of subjects, the initial conditions in a configuration, and the requirements about confinement and liveness that are to be ensured. We provide the syntactic structure and an operational and denotational semantics for the language. From experiments with a first implementation, we provide a preliminary result and show how patterns for capability based collaboration can be analyzed and generated...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the relative frequency and nature of personal display of cigarette packs by smokers in two Australian cities where 30 % front-of-pack and 90 % back-of-pack health warnings have been used since 2006 and comprehensive tobacco marketing restrictions apply. METHODS An observational study counted patrons, active smokers and tobacco packs at cafés, restaurants and bars with outdoor seating. Pack orientation and use of cigarette cases were also noted. RESULTS Overall, 18   954 patrons, 1576 active smokers and 2153 packs were observed, meaning {{that one out of}} every 12. 0 patrons was actively smoking, and one of every 8. 8 patrons displayed a pack. Packs were more frequently observed in lower socio-economic neighbourhoods, reflecting the higher prevalence of smoking in those regions. Packs were displayed less often in venues where children were present, suggesting a greater tendency not to smoke around children. Most packs (81. 4 %) were oriented face-up, permitting prominent brand display. Only 1. 5 % of observed packs were cigarette cases, and 4. 2 % of packs were concealed by another item, such as a phone or wallet. CONCLUSIONS Tobacco packs are frequently seen on table-tops in café strips, providing many opportunities for other patrons and passers-by to be incidentally exposed to cigarette brand names and imagery. Use of cigarette cases is rare, suggesting that smokers eventually habituate to pictorial warnings on branded packs and/or find repeated decanting of each newly purchased branded pack into a case to be inconvenient.
