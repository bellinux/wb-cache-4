40|$|Tort reform advocates {{hoped to}} use a recent case, Norfolk 2 ̆ 6 Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 (2003), {{as a vehicle for}} obtaining a Supreme Court opinion {{critical}} of the traditional doctrine of joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability.</b> Under this doctrine, each of the multiple responsible causes of an injury is potentially fully liable for that injury. The specific issue in Ayers was the availability of joint-and-several liability under the Federal Employers 2 ̆ 7 Liability Act (FELA), which employs common-law tort doctrines while excluding some of the traditional defenses. The defendant claimed that the traditional common law used fractional apportionment of <b>liability</b> (proportionate <b>several</b> <b>liability),</b> rather than full (joint and <b>several</b> or <b>several)</b> <b>liability,</b> for all cases other than those involving tortfeasors acting in concert; that this was the state of the law when FELA was enacted in 1908; that FELA incorporates the common law 2 ̆ 7 s supposed preference for proportionate several liability; that joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> for independent tortfeasors existed only for a brief period {{during the middle of the}} twentieth century; that joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> results in a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s being liable for more damages than she caused or for which she is responsible; and that the evolving common law, the Restatements, and just principles of <b>liability</b> all support proportionate <b>several</b> <b>liability.</b> As this paper argues, and the Supreme Court recently unanimously concluded, all of these assertions are clearly incorrect. Under both the common law and federal admiralty law at the time of FELA 2 ̆ 7 s enactment, and long before, each defendant who tortiously contributed to a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury was severally fully liable for that injury, regardless of whether other tortious causes of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury could be joined in the same lawsuit. Full liability was intended and has been consistently employed by federal and state courts under FELA from the time of FELA 2 ̆ 7 s enactment. Joint-and-several liability is the universal rule in other countries, and all but a handful of the courts in the United States have consistently stated, even after the adoption of comparative responsibility, that joint-and-several liability is the fairest method of allocating liability among the multiple responsible causes of an injury. The courts note that, under joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability,</b> a defendant generally is only liable for injuries for which it is fully responsible as a tortious, actual, and proximate cause. The Restatement Third, while not adopting any single allocation method, states that the fairest method for allocating liability among multiple responsible causes of an injury is joint-and-several liability with re-allocation of uncollectible shares among the responsible parties, and it strongly criticizes proportionate <b>several</b> <b>liability.</b> Moreover, despite the misleading arguments of the tort reformers, which have resulted in many legislative inroads on the joint-and-several liability doctrine, the doctrine has nowhere been completely eliminated, and it continues to be the primary allocation rule in a majority of the states, especially for environmental, hazardous material, and product-liability claims...|$|R
40|$|Two related trends {{have created}} novel {{challenges}} for managing risks in the United States. The first trend {{is a series}} of dramatic changes in liability law. Tort law has expanded to assign liability to defendants for reasons other than negligence. Recent doctrines include joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability,</b> retroactive liability, probabilistic causation, and unlimited duration of liability. Many of these legal changes have added unpredictability about future damage claims (and about further changes in the law), making it difficult for firms to assess risks and for risks to be shifted effectively from firms to insurers (Committee for Economic Development, 1989) ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} a framework for such interpretation {{and implementation of the}} new innocent spouse laws. The author presents an overview of the current tax law treatment of married joint filers under which joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> is imposed unless relief is available under the new innocent spouse laws. The article then examines the tax rationales that have traditionally been offered for imposing joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability.</b> The author concludes that because the fiction of marital unity is deeply embedded in our tax system, joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> for married joint filers is likely to remain the law. While it can sometimes promote legitimate goals of fairness and efficiency, as an examination of joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> in tort, agency and fraudulent conveyance law reveals, it can also produce unjust or irrational results. The author’s interpretive framework is necessary to alleviate these injustices and irrationalities...|$|R
50|$|The {{absolute}} effect {{means that}} one juristic act affects all joint several debtors {{in the same}} way. For example, the creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party. The performance from one <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> debtor affects also the others and the creditor cannot refuse it without being in default. In this case the creditor will be in default towards all joint <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> debtors.The autonomy of the different obligations undertaken by the joint <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> debtors {{is the reason for}} one juristic act that affects some of the obligations not have any effect on the others. This hypothesis is described by the term “relative effect of the joint several liability”. The obligations of the joint several debtors might have different due dates. As a rule the default of the debtor worsens his financial situation. That is why the default of one of the joint <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> debtors does not have any harmful consequences for the others. Another rule that can describe the relative effect of the joint <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> is that when the performance becomes impossible and only one of the debtors is responsible for that, the creditor may claim from the latter full damages. The limitation period also have a relative effect.If one of the joint <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> debtors to have performed in full amount to the creditor for him to have a regress claim against his co-debtors but only for him to have paid more than his share.|$|R

40|$|Major {{accounting}} {{firms in the}} United States have singled out elimination of joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> {{as one of the}} most needed legal reforms in the country. The recent legislation of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 replaced joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> with proportionate liability. This paper develops a simple model to analyze the economic consequences of such a change in the legal environment facing public accountants. In particular, we examine the incentive effects induced by the proportionate liability rule on the auditor's effort and financial statement users' litigation decisions. Our analysis demonstrates that replacing joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> with proportionate liability can decrease the equilibrium audit effort, lawsuit probability, market price of the firm, and audit fee. More important, even though the proportionate liability rule reduces the equilibrium audit effort, we show that it can actually increase social welfare. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Recent theoretical research by Kornhauser and Revesz finds that joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> may either encourage or discourage settlement, depending on the correlation of outcomes at trial across defendants. We extend their two-defendant model to a richer framework with N defendants. This extension allows us to test the theoretical model empirically using data on Superfund litigation. We find that joint and <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> does not discourage settlements and may even encourage them. Our results support the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions {{about the effects of}} several variables, such as the degree of correlation in trial outcomes...|$|R
