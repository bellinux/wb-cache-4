40|$|This unique book is {{the first}} to bring {{together}} the world of health psychology with that of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The authors draw on their wealth of experience as health psychologists to explore the relationship between health psychology and CAM and look at how an understanding of one can be used to inform the other. Through an open-minded but rigorous approach to CAM, the authors identify where psychology can help to answer some crucial questions, such as why CAM sometimes appears to work, why sometimes it does not, and why some people are drawn to it and others not. Key topics covered include: models of the person, health beliefs and experimental psychology, placebo, research methods in CAM, <b>stress,</b> coping <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> <b>management,</b> pain <b>and</b> chronic illness, communications and interactions between client and therapist. While CAM has often been dismissed out of hand by scientists, the authors maintain that it deserves attention as a psychological phenomenon alone, regardless of the actual efficacy as understood by existing research.

40|$|Stress {{is defined}} as "an {{imbalance}} between a perceived demand (stressor) and a person's perceived ability to cope with, or to meet, that demand". It {{is well known that}} dentists are subject to a variety of stress-related physical and emotional problems. In dental practice it may include the difficulties in managing anxious children, or dealing with "neurotic", difficult or uncompliant adults. Stress may also take the form of personal insult if dentists are regarded as incompetent when compared with their peers, or are seen as insensitive, inconsiderate and inferior to doctors. Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practice is a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health!

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present the current status of the {{literature}} related to stress in clinical psychology trainees (CPTs), and to offer research directions for investigating stress in this population and ways to enhance self-care in these individuals. The following conclusions emerge from the review: (1) CPTs are vulnerable to elevated stress; (2) undue stress can negatively impact CPTs’ personal and professional functioning and, in turn, result in less than optimal standards of care for clients; (3) there is a dearth of studies on stress in this population and no published intervention studies; (4) incorporating self-care strategies into clinical psychology training is recommended; and (5) “third-wave” cognitive behaviour therapy stress management interventions have been efficacious in comparable populations.

The questionnaire classified stress factors into professional, patient-related, dental procedure-related, and office management factors. Sign <b>and</b> symptoms of <b>stress</b> manifestations <b>and</b> <b>management</b> were also evaluated. The sample included 80 females and 75 males, with 47 % of them below the age of 30 years. RESULTS: Out of the total sample, the largest percentage (60. 6 %) were general practitioners, 47. 7 % had experience of less than 5 years and 32. 2 % had 11 years of experience. The highest mean scores of stress were related to professional factors and dental procedure-related factors.

This study aimed to assess ED nurses' burnout level during an outbreak of MERS-CoV and to identify influencing factors {{in order to provide}} basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burnout. MethodsStudy participants were ED nurses working in eight hospitals designated for treating MERS-CoV-infected patients in Korea. We performed multiple regression analysis to explore the factors influencing burnout. ResultsThe ED nurses' burnout was affected by job stress (β= 0. 59, p<. 001), poor hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV (β = − 0. 19, p<. 001) and poor support from family and friends (β = − 0. 14, p<. 05). These three variables explained 47. 3 % of the variance in burnout. ConclusionsED nurses taking care of MERS-CoV-infected patients should be aware that burnout is higher for nurses in their divisions than nurses in other hospital departments <b>and</b> that job <b>stress</b> is the biggest influential factor of burnout.

40|$|The {{connection}} between stress and health {{has been documented}} extensively. Studies exemplify that stress is often a barrier for health-related behaviour change (i. e. smoking cessation) (Ali, 2010; Heslop et al., 2001; Louis et al., 2009; Marway, 2012). A review of health improvement initiatives highlighted {{that most of these}} services fail to adequately address <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> <b>management</b> (Marway, 2012). Thus health care professionals’ (HCPs’) are not necessarily trained or equipped to deal with patient-reported stress, despite the increasing prevalence (Goodrick et al., 2005). A qualitative methodology was employed to explore HCPs’ experiences of patient-reported stress within public health. A series of mini focus groups and one to one interviews were conducted with 10 HCPs (e. g. GPs, pharmacists, and health improvement practitioners). The thematic phenomenological analysis (Guimond-Plourde, 2009) revealed that patient-reported stress was a common feature in all the HCPs patient consultations (Goodrick et al., 2005; Verhaak et al., 2005); often eliciting feelings of anxiety and uncertainty as they felt ill-equipped in: (a) talking about stress; (b) assessing stress levels; (c) making the distinction between depression and stress; and (d) and advising patients about stress management. Issues surrounding professional remit and management of stress disclosure were also identified. The inclusion of various HCP groups exemplified variances in the patient-reported stress experiences. There is a need for greater stress management services and the provision of HCP training on patient-reported stress.

This study sought to determine to what extent dispositional coping, exposure to and knowledge of CAM, and sociodemographic variables affect young adults 2 ̆ 7 use of CAM modalities for stress management. This study also sought to answer whether there is a difference in the perceived stress of participants who use CAM modalities and those who do not. A quantitative cross-sectional correlational study was employed, using a survey methodology, to identify whether the factors identified in the study influence young adults 2 ̆ 7 use of CAM modalities. Results showed that knowledge of CAM and dispositional coping style significantly influence the use of CAM modalities; sociodemographic variables do not influence the use of these modalities. Furthermore, the use of CAM modalities was found to have a significant relationship to stress level. The findings of the current study suggest the CAM techniques can be adapted and introduced into college settings so that students can better manage their stress level...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry is noted for {{high levels of}} occupational stress, particularly among professional workers. Using data from 676 architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers responding to an on-line survey in South Africa, an integrated conceptual model of occupational stress is proposed. Structural equation modeling is {{used to test the}} model iteratively. The results of the final model indicate that: psychological, physiological and sociological strain effects are the terminal consequences of occupational stress; organizational climate is largely determined by gender and job demand, control and support; age, gender, control and organizational climate are predictors of discrimination; psychological distress is predicted by age, job demand and control factors, <b>and</b> organizational climate; sociological <b>stress</b> is determined by age, job demands, discrimination and psychological distress; and age, <b>and</b> sociological <b>and</b> psychological <b>stress</b> effects manifest themselves as predictors of physiological stress effects. Construction employers should regularly review workload allocations, empower employees, foster a supportive work environment, conduct <b>stress</b> appraisals, <b>and</b> hold <b>stress</b> <b>management</b> workshops...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundStaff {{well-being}} including <b>stress</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> <b>management</b> {{skills is}} usually not a priority in (mental) health policies. In Kosovo, the level of stress amongst primary health care (PHC) professionals is high because health professionals {{are part of the}} population seriously affected by conflict. The need to support staff and look after their well-being was recognised by the Director of the Centre for Development of Family Medicine, Head of Primary Care. In response, the Antares Foundation and the Kosovo Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims (KRCT), in close cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, implemented an integrated psycho-social capacity building programme for PHC professionals. Case-descriptionThis case-study describes how staff well-being was integrated into the PHC system in Kosovo. This was accomplished through raising awareness on staff well-being <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> <b>management</b> as well as strengthening knowledge of <b>and</b> skills in <b>stress</b> <b>management.</b> Eighteen national PHC staff were trained and more than a thousand family doctors <b>and</b> nurses attended <b>stress</b> <b>management</b> workshops. A steering committee consisting of key stakeholders was responsible for overseeing the execution of the programme. This steering committee successfully advocated for integration of staff well-being <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> <b>management</b> in the revised mental health strategy 201422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2020. The curriculum developed for the training was integrated in the professional staff development programme for family doctors and nurses. The effectiveness of the programme was assessed through an evaluation (including a survey among PHC professionals trained under the programme). ConclusionsEvaluation findings showed that offering structured support, entailing the opportunity to discuss work related problems and providing tools to deal with stress related to work or personal life, helps staff to continue their professional tasks under challenging conditions. Evaluation findings suggest that results can be sustained through an integrated approach and involvement of key stakeholders. The case study may be of interest to policy makers involved in health reform processes and for managers implementing changes in complicated post conflict contexts. For both groups, acknowledgment of staff well-being could be a key ingredient in the motivation of staff and the quality of services. 2015 - 07 - 13 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26199642 PMC 450876...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the stress level among Yemeni dentists <b>and</b> to evaluate their <b>stress</b> manifestations <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> <b>management.</b> Materials <b>and</b> methods: Nearly 368 dentists were given a self-administered questionnaire and 119 returned the filled questionnaire form. A questionnaire was composed of four sections including, demographic information, professional practice characteristics, work <b>stress</b> factors <b>and</b> response of dentist to stress as well as methods to deal with <b>stress.</b> 56 females <b>and</b> 63 males were incorporated, 83. 2 % of them were general dental practitioners. The descriptive data were analyzed and Chi-square, t-test and F tests were used for statistical significance (P< 0. 05). Results: The response rate was 32. 3 %. Of the whole, 71. 4 % of them were aged less than 30 years, 73. 1 % have experience less than 5 years. Among stressors, those related to dental procedure have highest mean scores (SD) of stress 2. 93 (1. 46). The most prevalent factors that contribute to stress were uncooperative patients (72. 3 %), amount of work (too much, too little) (60. 5 %) and constant drive for technical perfection (54. 6 %). Stress was reflected in dentists by many signs among them are musculoskeletal fatigue in 63 % and nervousness in 57. 1 %. Praying and reading the Quran was reported by over two thirds (70. 6 %) of the participants to manage stress. Conclusions: Dentistry is a stressful profession in Yemen. Lack of experience, low income, uncooperative patients, and dental procedure-related factors were the main significant factors that caused stress. Political instability in the country and the lack of laws governing the dental profession in addition to conservative nature of the community may be considered as sources of stress...|$|R
