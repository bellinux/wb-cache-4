As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the moving jaw plate at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle jaw crusher. Jaw plate wear has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws. This wear is predominantly serious in the fixed plate and hence the liners of the fixed jaw should be properly chosen. In addition to this the toggle bar which acts as a safety lever has to be precisely designed. The design aspects of flywheel, spring of tension bar and toggle bar are discussed in this paper. ...|$|R

In the current research the organic fraction of municipal solid waste was processed using a combination of a shear shredder, rotary cutter and wet macerator to produce streams with different particle size distributions. The pre-processed waste was used in trials in semi-continuous ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ digesters at organic loading rate (OLR) up to 6 kg volatile solids (VS) m? 3 day? 1. The results indicated that while difference in the particle size distribution did not change the specific biogas yield, the digester performance was affected. In the ‘dry’ digesters the finer particle size led to acidification and ultimately to process failure at the highest OLR. In ‘wet’ digestion a fine particle size led to severe foaming and the process could not be operated above 5 kg VS m? 3 day? 1.

40|$|It {{has been}} 10 {{years since the}} JK size-dependent {{breakage}} model was developed (Shi and Kojovic, 2007). This series of papers present 20 applications of {{the model for the}} mineral and coal industries. Part 3 of this series reviews its application to modelling comminution equipment. It is demonstrated that the JK size-dependent breakage model not only can be used for modelling particle breakage, but also can be employed as a basic structure for modelling comminution equipment. This is different to the traditional equipment modelling approaches, in which the population balance models are dominant. In this energy-size reduction modelling approach, the JK size-dependent breakage model provides a key mathematical template to rationally link the <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> as the <b>equipment</b> model output with ore breakage property and specific energy as the two model inputs. Five case studies are reviewed, which includes modelling of a hammer mill for coke feed preparation, a vertical spindle mill for coal pulverised fuel grinding, a ball mill for batch grinding and continuous operation, HPGR simulations based on piston press testing data, and high voltage pulse disintegration of ores. A common feature of these models is that they all incorporate the measured material breakage characteristic parameters and machine operational conditions that are represented by the size-specific energy relation.

40|$|Aqueous {{chloride}} {{operations at}} the Los Alamos Plutonium Facility cannot directly dispose of acidic waste solutions because of compatibility problems with existing disposal lines. Consequently, all hydrochloric acid must be neutralized and filtered prior to exiting the facility. From a waste minimization standpoint, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles as the acid neutralization agent is attractive since this process would take a stream destined for transuranic waste {{and use it as}} a reagent in routine plutonium residue processing. Since Los Alamos National Laboratory has several years of experience using magnesium hydroxide as a neutralizing agent for waste acid from plutonium processing activities, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles appeared to be an attractive extension of this activity. In order to be competitive with magnesium hydroxide, however, size reduction of crucible shards had to be performed effectively within the constraints of glovebox operations, and acid neutralization time using crucible shards had to be comparable to neutralization times observed when using reagent-grade magnesium hydroxide. The study utilized non-plutonium-contaminated crucibles for equipment evaluation and selection and used nonradioactive acid solutions for completing the neutralization experiments.

40|$|Issue: In {{addition}} to contaminant removal and screening, size reduction {{is one of}} the key processes in preparing recovered wood waste for a variety of commodity feedstock and specialty product markets. There are several types of equipment that processors can use to size reduce. Each type of equipment varies with respect to the forms of wood waste it can effectively handle and production quality.

40|$|Dirt {{and grit}} are common {{contaminants}} in recovered wood waste that resist removal by mechanical screening. The persistence {{of dirt and}} grit in wood-waste derived feedstocks tends to cause significant problems for the high value end use markets. For example, the presence of dirt and grit in composite panel board feedstocks causes excessive equipment wear in the manufacturing plant {{as well as for}} the end users of panel board products. For the manufacturing plant, dirt and grit causes refiner plates in the <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>equipment</b> to wear down at a faster rate than normal. For the end-user, dirt and grit embedded in the panel board causes saw blades to dull more rapidly. Dirt and grit can also reduce the brightness of a panel board which may be a problem for end users who overlay the board with thin melamines or other coatings. Best Practice: This best practice recommends the use of chip washing equipment to remove persistent dirt and grit contaminants from recovered wood waste feedstocks for users of exceptionally clean supplies of wood waste. Mechanical screening for dirt and grit removal is adequate. Chip Washer. A chip washer operates by mixing wood waste feedstocks with water.

40|$|For {{successful}} mechanistic modelling of any <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{an understanding}} of the fundamentals of the breakage mechanisms is essential. This understanding will allow the comparison of breakage events and the quantification of the effect of key factors such as applied strain rate, particle size, and particle shape while they are isolated. This paper uses the concept of analysing breakage of a single particle as a multi-stage process to compare different breakage mechanisms and to quantify the effect of factors such as applied strain rate. This approach regards a single breakage event as a process affected by three sub-processes; first (or primary) fracture, capture and spatial distribution of fragments. The first fracture is assumed to be independent of breakage mechanism and to be a characteristic of the ore type. On the other hand, capture and spatial distribution are influenced by the characteristics of breakage environment, the kinetic energy of fragments and their brittleness. The focus {{of this paper is to}} examine how each sub-process of a breakage event is influenced by applied strain rate and its impact on the size distribution of progeny. In this work, three rock types of widely different strength and brittle behaviour, i. e. LKAB magnetite ore, Beaudesert silicate and Bundaberg quartz, were tested at various energy levels using the impact and compression breakage mechanisms. To isolate the effect of spatial distribution of fragments, particles were forced to remain in the breakage zone. In this condition, similar progeny size distributions were generated from compression and impact mechanisms at similar energy levels. However, allowing natural distribution of fragments produced coarser progeny from the compression of silicate...|$|E
