40|$|In our {{previous}} study, the evaluation {{system for the}} finger–jointed laminae was constructed. This system was composed of three parts. The first part is the motive power part for the hydraulic pomp and cylinder. The second part is the AE measurement part. The third part is the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. In this study, the optimum condition needed in the evaluating test with this evaluation system was examined. In addition, {{the effects of the}} temperature and the open assembly time in finger jointing on the strength properties of the finger–jointed laminae with this evaluate system were examined. The main results are summarized as follows: The peak in the waveform of AE signals obtained by the evaluation system was recognized in the laminae with <b>starved</b> <b>joint.</b> The peak and the <b>starved</b> <b>joint</b> part were corresponded. In evaluation test of the finger–jointed laminae with this system, the necessary conditions set in this test were the deflection and the feed speed, and these optimum conditions were 3 mm and high speed (480 mm/s), respectively. The strength properties of the finger–jointed laminae with the open assembly time showed the tendency to decrease with higher the temperature in jointing. Therefore, {{it became clear that the}} high temperature in jointing was the condition that the <b>starved</b> <b>joint</b> part was caused. The MOE and MOR of the finger–jointed laminae showed the tendency to decrease with increasing the maximum value of the AE accumulated signal. Thus, it was clear that there was a high correlation between the maximum value and the strength properties. Therefore, this evaluation system was promising for the detection of the difference of the bonding performance caused by the influence of bonding conditions such as the temperature and the open assembly time in jointing...|$|E
40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of glulam timbers, the laminae that have knots near the finger-joint and starved part in the finger-joint are often found, and it will greatly influence the decrease in strength of products. Therefore, the detection of knots and <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> is important for preparation of laminae, and the method is hoped to be simple and non. destructive. In this study, sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) finger-jointed laminae with an intergrown knot near the finger-joint and <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> in the finger-joint were prepared, and the evaluation of finger-joint performance was conducted by acoustic emission (AE) as the non-destructive method. That is, bending tests for these laminae were performed, and AE generated during bending test was measured along with load. Then, the correspondence between AE characteristics and the strength properties was examined. The main results are summarized as follows: for the laminae with a knot parallel to the finger-joint and <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> in the finger-joints, AE signals were measured at the early stage of the bending test and the accumulated AE count was large {{as compared with the}} laminae without knots and starved joints/controls. Therefore, the AE technique is promising for the monitoring of knots and <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> during bending test. In this experiment, for the laminae with a knot, the difference of the bending strength was not admitted. From this result, the bending strength was almost unaffected by the difference of the knot position near finger-joint. For the laminae with starved-joints, the MOE was almost unaffected by the presence of the <b>starved</b> <b>joints,</b> while the MOR decreased slightly as compared with the controls. It follows from the above results that the AE technique is promising for the detection of knot parallel to the finger-joint and <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> in the finger-joint at the early stage of the bending test, even if the knot and <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> do not cause much reduction in the bending strength...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, we {{paid attention to}} acoustic emission (AE) as a non-destructive method, and bending test for finger-jointed laminae with <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> was performed. In addition, for installing the AE monitoring method into the production line of the finger-jointed laminae, a special attachment (jig) for the AE sensor installed into the production line was developed. However, this method with the jig was not efficient for the following two reasons; first, {{it is difficult to}} set the position of the jig. Secondly, it is necessary to stop the production line for the bending process. In this study, the new type jig which installed the AE sensor for the detection of the laminae with <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> regardless of both the position and the number of finger-joint parts is designed, and the evaluation tests of finger-jointed laminae were conducted by using this jig. That is, the evaluation system which installed the jig was constructed, and hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtua) finger-jointed laminae with <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> were prepared, and the evaluation tests of finger-joint properties were conducted by using this system. The main results are summarized as follows: The evaluation system for the finger-jointed laminae was constructed. This system was composed of the motive power part, the AE measurement part, and the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. For the laminae with <b>starved</b> <b>joints,</b> the peak of AE signals which were measured by this system corresponded to the position of <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> in the finger-jointed laminae. In addition, for the laminae with defects such as knots and loosed grain, the peak of AE signals which were measured besides the finger-joint part corresponded to the position of defects. From these results, this evaluation system which installed the jig with AE sensor was promising for detecting of the <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> and the presence of defects in the finger-jointed laminae. It was found that modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the lamine during the evaluation test with this system could be measured in the grasp of the section size of the laminae beforehand. Therefore, it was suggested that the grading for the laminae after finger-jointing based on MOE could be possible by this system...|$|R
40|$|In end-jointing of laminae for the glulam timber, finger-joint is {{generally}} used. However, the strength {{properties of the}} glulam timber greatly decrease by slippage-off and destruction in <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> of finger-jointed part when the laminae with <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> in the finger-joint are located on the external layer of the glulam timber. Therefore, for the glulam timber with good strength properties, the evaluation of finger-joint properties after finger-jointing is important, and the method is hoped to be simple and non-destructive. In this study, hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtua) finger-jointed laminae with <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> (NH-laminae) and without <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> (C-laminae) were prepared, respectively. The evaluation of finger-joint properties with a special attachment (jig) for installing the acoustic emission (AE) monitoring method into the production line of the laminae was conducted. That is, bending tests for these laminae with the jig were performed, and AE generated during the bending test was measured along with the load. Then, AE characteristics and bending strength properties of these laminae were examined. In addition, the verification test with the jig was performed. The main results are summarized as follows: AE signals of NH-laminae in the threshold of 20 mV were measured at the early stage in bending test as compared with C-laminae. The AE generation load of NH-laminae showed a small value and showed the smallest value in 20 mV. From these results, {{it became clear that}} AE technique with the jig in the threshold of 20 mV will be promising for the detection of the difference between C- and NH-laminae at the early stage during bending test. From the obtained result of the verification test with the jig under the conditions of the load: 4 kN and the threshold: 20 mV for the detection of the <b>starved</b> <b>joints,</b> it became clear that NH-laminae could be detected at the probability of about 70 % under these conditions. Therefore, in the case of loading to the finger-jointed part of laminae in 4 kN as the detection load with the jig, the possibility of the detection of the <b>starved</b> <b>joints</b> by AE as a non-destructive method was suggested...|$|R

In this study, to examine the optimum adhesive condition in finger–joint part which influences strength properties of the large–scale sugi finger–jointed laminae, the block shear tests with sugi block specimens which assumed finger–joint part and glued under various adhesive conditions was performed. The main results are summarized as follows: In {{the case of the}} specimen of W–O (With curing agent, One side spreading) under 40 – 20 (open assembly temperature and time set to 40 ℃ and 20 min) with resorcinol phenol resin type adhesive, the tendency to decrease of the shear strength was shown. From the fracture morphology, the reason was considered that the adhesive did not transfer on none–spreading side because the surface of the adhesive has stiffened by setting the open assembly temperature and time. In other conditions, an enough glued performance was considered because the shear strength showed a comparatively large value. Moreover, in the case of None–specimen (Without curing agent), the shear strength shows a small value and the tendency to decrease was shown by setting the open assembly temperature and time. In three conditions of W–O, None–B (Without curing agent, Both sides spreading), and None–O (Without curing agent, One side spreading) under 40 – 20 with aqueous polymer solution–isocyanate adhesive, the shear strength had decreased remarkably. In other conditions, the difference was not admitted and the tendency to decrease of the shear strength was shown by setting the open assembly temperature and time...|$|R
3000|$|Adhesion {{problems}} sometimes {{occur during}} {{the production of}} laminated wood products. To minimize such quality problems, {{there is a need}} for a nondestructive test that can provide continuous control of the process and the product. This study presents results from measurements performed to evaluate the potential of pulse thermography as a method to detect glue deficiency in laminated wood. Defect depth, defect size, and degree of glue deficiency have been varied. The surface layer was made of merbau (Intsia bijuga) and the substrate of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris). The results showed that pulse thermography is a promising tool for detecting glue deficiency underneath the thin laminated wood surface layers, mainly because of the short inspection time. Lack of glue with a minimum thermal defect size of 3 was detectable (thermal defect size is defined as the quotient of defect size and defect depth). The penetration depth was 1.0 [*]mm and the highest contrast, 0.62 °C, was achieved for one of the largest defects (24 [*]mm) below the thinnest (0.5 [*]mm) surface layer after 1 second. <b>Starved</b> glue <b>joints</b> showed about half the contrast compared to areas with total lack of glue.|$|R
