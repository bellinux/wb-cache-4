40|$|Camelina (Camelina sativa), {{a member}} of the mustard family, is a summer annual oilseed plant. Winter hardy types also exist. False flax and Gold of Pleasure are the popular common names for the crop. The crop was widely grown in Eastern Europe and Russia up to the early 1940 ’s but was {{replaced}} with the introduction and widespread use of oilseed rape. The revival of interest in camelina oil is due to its high linolenic acid (38 %) content. Linolenic acid is one of the OMEGA- 3 fatty acids which are generally found in substantial quantities only in linseed and fish oils. Camelina offers an opportunity to supply the growing demand for high quality edible oils rich in OMEGA- 3 fatty acids. A three year study established that camelina is a very suitable crop to grow in Ireland, producing 2. 5 t/ha of high quality seed (42 - 47 %) with no agrochemical inputs required.

40|$|The {{influence}} of duodenal and ileal infusion of nutrients on small intestinal transit of digesta, {{measured by the}} passage of phenol red marker, was studied in twelve pigs fitted with duodenal and ileal catheters, and a terminal ileal cannula. Changes in gastrointestinal motility were observed by electromyography and by use of an X-ray image intensifier {{in four of the}} pigs fitted additionally with nichrome wire electrodes in the gut wall and in seven pigs fitted only with a gastric catheter. Small intestinal transit time was unaffected by intestinal catheterization per se, or by duodenal or ileal infusion of glucose or peptone. It was reduced by duodenal infusion of fat or of some of the products of fat digestion including oleic acid and a monoglyceride containing unsaturated fatty acids (monoglyceride LS) but was not affected by infusion of glycerol, stearic acid or a monoglyceride containing saturated fatty acids (monoglyceride P). Ileal transit time was greatly reduced by ileal infusion of <b>soya</b> bean <b>oil</b> mixed with bile salts and lipase and by monoglyceride LS but not by <b>soya</b> bean <b>oil</b> alone. Total small intestinal transit time was reduced to a lesser degree by ileal infusion of <b>soya</b> bean <b>oil</b> mixed with bile salts and lipase and by monoglyceride LS and was unaffected by <b>soya</b> bean <b>oil</b> alone. The level of irregular spiking activity of the small intestine was greatly reduced by both duodenal and ileal infusion of fat, but rapidly propagated spike bursts were initiated from the point of infusion (identified radiologically as peristaltic rushes) many of which travelled right through to the ileo-caecal junction. It is concluded that intestinal infusion of fat accelerates small intestinal transit in pigs by induction of peristaltic rushes; that since the ileal transit times were more severely reduced than total small intestinal transit times by ileal infusion of fat the response is probably only seen over those areas of intestine in direct contract with the fat; and that the effect depends upon the presence of fat digestion products, i. e. the fatty acid and the monoglyceride, although probably only those containing unsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
