40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been an {{increasing}} tendency to carry voice on IP networks as opposed to the PSTN and other <b>switched</b> <b>circuit</b> networks. Initially this trend was favoured due to reduced costs but occurred at the expense of sacrificing the quality of the voice communications. <b>Switched</b> <b>circuit</b> networks have therefore remained the preferred carrier-grade voice communication network, but this is again changing. The advancement in improved quality of service (QoS) of real-time traffic on the IP network is a contributing factor to the anticipated future of the IP network supplying carrier-grade voice communications. Another contributing factor is the possibility of creating a new range of innovative, state-of-the-art telephony and communications services that acquire leverage through the intelligence and flexibility of the IP network. The latter has yet to be fully explored. Various protocols exist that facilitate the transport of voice and other media on IP networks. The most well known and widely supported of these is H. 323. This work presents and discusses H. 323 version 4 service creation. The work also categorises the various H. 323 services and presents the mechanisms provided by H. 323 version 4 that have facilitated the development of the three services I have developed, EmailReader, Telgo 323 and CANS...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear <b>switched</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are usually}} {{analyzed}} {{in the time}} domain. The use of frequency-domain methods to analyze the steady-state of <b>switched</b> <b>circuits</b> is usually restricted to linear circuits and, although Volterra series approaches are applied to the distortion of nonlinear <b>switched</b> <b>circuits,</b> the use of harmonic balance (HB) methods in nonlinear <b>switched</b> <b>circuits</b> seems to be marginal if not discarded. In this paper, we analyze the nonlinear class-E amplifier with an ideal switch {{by means of the}} HB method. We show how the switching function may be carefully chosen to improve the accuracy of the solution. When the circuit achieves actual class-E operation, the method converges better and is more accurate than classical timedomain methods. We conclude that the HB method is an alternative to time-domain methods {{that can be used to}} analyze the class-E amplifier in its expected operation mode. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} interoperability of IP Telephony and <b>Switched</b> <b>Circuit</b> Networks {{in the area of}} routing information. We describe and analyze a solution for directory-based routing. We will present an architecture based on a distributed database on the <b>switched</b> <b>circuit</b> network and the IP network. The aim of the solution is to provide efficient service management, close to optimal routing for all calls including calls to 800 - and cellular numbers and personal number portability between both network technologies. The solution is based on similar but differing in detail approaches for each network. In the IP network we use the Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) protocol developed by IETF. Additionally, the described architecture is open for inclusion of the Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) protocol that is under development. For the circuit switched network, we suggest a new protocol called Circuit Telephony Routing Information Protocol (CTRIP). The protocol provides a distributed method for synchronizing routing information between databases. Furthermore, we propose numbering gateways for transferring number information between the two network types. We utilize the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) as the common element for data synchronization and replication among distributed entities. We also discuss briefly the design of a test implementation of the proposed infrastructure functions and protocols under development in our Laboratory. In conclusion, we propose to design a common interoperable routing information infrastructure for the emerging hybrid SCN/IP Telephony network...|$|E
