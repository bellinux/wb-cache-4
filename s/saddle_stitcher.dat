50|$|Switzerland started {{manufacturing}} bookbinding {{equipment in}} 1946 {{under the name}} Grapha Maschinenfabrik. The first machine produced was a hand-fed <b>saddle</b> <b>stitcher,</b> later modernized by the “Swiss Girl” automatic feeder, which could be disengaged and tilted back when not in use. Grapha exhibited its first fully automatic <b>saddle</b> <b>stitcher</b> with in-line trimmer at Drupa in 1954. During the same time, the company {{was working on the}} development of an adhesive binder.|$|E

It is the biggest multicolour offset printing unit in Government Sector with a Harris M-300 High Speed Multicolor Web offset printing machine, four Web Offset colour Printing Machines, four Sheet fed Offset Printing Machines, three HMT Letterpress machines and a Label Printing Machine. It also has a Muller Martini <b>Saddle</b> <b>stitcher</b> imported from Switzerland.|$|E
40|$|Meeting {{the demand}} for faster turnrounds and shorter print runs goes beyond making the {{printing}} press easier {{to set up and}} change. There is little point in producing plates and then sheets from a press if the post press area does not change to keep abreast of developments in prepress and the print room. The greatest impact is going to come from JDF, the end to end production data format which is finding wide spread acceptance in print areas. To date finishing equipment manufacturers are not as well represented within the CIP 4 organisation as prepress and press vendors, but the major manufacturers are members. All are working to the goal of complete connectivity. The idea of JDF is that if the format of a print product like a magazine is known during the creation phases, the information can be used to preset machinery {{that is going to be}} used to produce it, so avoiding input errors and saving manufacturing time. A second aspect to JDF is that information about performance and progress is gathered and can be retrieved from a central point or made available to a customer. Production scheduling and costing becomes more accurate and customer relationships are deepened. However JDF to its fullest extent is not yet in use in connecting the finishing area to the rest of the printing plant. Around the world different companies are testing the idea of JDF to connect <b>saddle</b> <b>stitchers,</b> guillotines and binders with frantic work underway to be able to show results soon. </p...|$|R
