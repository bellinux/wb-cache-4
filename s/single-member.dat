5|$|Alberta's first {{election}} was fought in 25 <b>single-member</b> first past the post districts, and like other Canadian jurisdictions at the time, introduced double-member constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1909 to accommodate their population. These were both broken up into three <b>single-member</b> districts by 1917, as {{the overall number of}} districts increased rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} form {{of government}} was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission {{form of government}} in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from <b>single-member</b> districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from <b>single-member</b> districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to <b>single-member</b> districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E
5|$|The Liberal {{government}} introduced five-member block voting constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1921, {{and briefly}} made Medicine Hat a double-member district. Because each voter {{in the cities}} was given five votes, the Liberal party was defeated despite winning a higher total number of votes than the United Farmers, who had much higher support in the rural <b>single-member</b> districts.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland Senate, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Maryland State Senate, is the upper house of the General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland. Composed of 47 senators elected from an equal number of constituent <b>single-member</b> districts, the Senate is responsible, along with the Maryland House of Delegates, for passage of laws in Maryland, and for confirming executive appointments made by the Governor of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The common council {{consists}} of 10 members, six {{of whom are}} elected from <b>single-member</b> districts. The other four, including its president, are elected at-large. The council has eight standing committees for issues including transportation, education, finance and public safety. There is a relative balance between the Democratic and Republican parties, a change from the predominantly single-party politics of the 20thcentury. Throughout the 1950s, Democrats ran the city council and mayoralty.|$|E
5|$|The town council, {{which is}} the parish council, first convened on 1 April 2009, and its chair is the Mayor of Shrewsbury. For the interim period before the first elections, the {{existing}} county councillors who represented electoral divisions covering Shrewsbury were the town councillors. On 4 June 2009, the first election was held to the town council, with councillors elected from 17 <b>single-member</b> wards coterminous with Shropshire Council electoral divisions.|$|E
5|$|These {{parallel}} systems, STV in {{the cities}} and AV {{in the rest of}} the province, lasted until Ernest Manning's Social Credit government abolished both for the 1959 election, without public consultations or a referendum. This broke the urban constituencies into <b>single-member</b> districts and reintroduced first past the post across the province, which remains the system used in Alberta and throughout Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 {{the city}} adopted a {{commission}} form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, {{as it would}} reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile {{was one of the}} last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored <b>single-member</b> districts in order to elect candidates of their choice.|$|E
5|$|Legislative {{power is}} divided between {{federal and state}} legislatures. The {{bicameral}} federal parliament consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives and the upper house, the Senate. The 222-member House of Representatives is elected for a maximum term of five years from <b>single-member</b> constituencies. All 70 senators sit for three-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, and the remaining 44 are appointed by the King upon the Prime Minister's recommendation. The parliament follows a multi-party system {{and the government is}} elected through a first-past-the-post system. Since independence Malaysia has been governed by a 13-party coalition known as the Barisan Nasional.|$|E
5|$|The upper tier is Somerset County Council. Also {{based in}} Taunton, {{the council has}} 58 councillors, each elected for a <b>single-member</b> electoral division. Most of the town {{comprises}} the Wellington electoral division, with part falling in the mainly rural division of Blackdown & Wellington East. They are represented by one Labour and one Liberal Democrat councillor. Somerset County Council is responsible for running {{the largest and most}} expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from <b>single-member</b> constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state {{assembly}} members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E
5|$|Since 1985 the {{government}} of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council members are elected {{from each of the}} seven city council <b>single-member</b> districts (SMDs). A supermajority of five votes is required to conduct council business. This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which used three city commissioners who were elected at-large, was ruled to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the Voting Rights Act in the 1975 case Bolden v. City of Mobile. Due to appeals, the case took time to reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system. Municipal elections are held every four years.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives of Japan (衆議院) is the Lower house, {{with the}} members of the house being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a {{four-year}} term. As of December 24, 2014, it has 475 members. Of these, 180 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 295 are elected from <b>single-member</b> constituencies. 238 seats are required for majority. The House of Representatives is the more powerful house out of the two, it is able to override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority. It can, however, be dissolved by the Prime Minister at will. Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 25 years and older may run for office in the lower house.|$|E
5|$|The electoral {{district}} of Perth was created {{as one of}} the initial 30 <b>single-member</b> districts, and one of only six in the Perth–Fremantle area. Its first member, who was elected on 10 December 1890, was Dr Edward Scott, a doctor by training who had been elected as Mayor of Perth the previous year. He resigned in December 1891, and was replaced at the resulting by-election on 12 January 1892 by Thomas Molloy. Molloy became embroiled in a controversy regarding provision of state aid to private schools, which he and fellow Catholic MLAs Timothy Quinlan and Alfred Canning supported. The Catholic Vicar General, Father Anselm Bourke, established the Education Defence League with their assistance. However, the issue became a major one in the 1894 election amongst the voting public, and all three MLAs lost their seats, Molloy losing to George Randell, a prominent Congregationalist who had led the cause against state aid. Randell became the Opposition Leader to Premier John Forrest, but stepped down from that role a year later in July 1895, and did not contest the 1897 election, which was won by a supporter of Forrest.|$|E
5|$|Around Playford, much {{activity}} was occurring. Legislation {{provided for the}} tools {{that he was to}} inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation. The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times, and as an agriculture-dominant state, had been at the mercy of commodity prices, so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians, public servants and industrialists. The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 <b>single-member</b> districts—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Over the next three decades, Adelaide's population grew until it had triple the population of the country, but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six. The desired long-term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the 1938 election. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the electoral system gerrymander was later christened the 'Playmander', {{as a result of its}} benefit to Playford, and his failure to take action towards reforming it.|$|E

25|$|Antrim, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Antrim Borough to {{distinguish it from}} the former constituency of the same name, was a <b>single-member</b> county constituency of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Circa 1950 {{the state}} {{legislature}} approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members from <b>single-member</b> districts, rather than at-large voting. This change was supported because at-large voting diluted the minority population's political power in the city. They could seldom gain {{a majority of the}} population to support a candidate of their choice. Apportionment under the <b>single-member</b> districts meant that some districts had black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African-American attorneys Z. Alexander Looby and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.|$|E
25|$|The simple {{majority}} (or First Past the Post) voting system {{is used in}} Ghana's parliamentary elections. The country since 2012, is divided into 275 <b>single-member</b> constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.|$|E

25|$|Georgia {{county and}} city {{public school systems}} are {{administered}} by school boards with members elected at the local level. , all but 19 of 181 boards are elected from <b>single-member</b> districts. Residents and activist groups in Fayette County, Georgia sued the board of commissioners and school board for maintaining an election system based on at-large voting, which tended to increase {{the power of the}} majority and effectively prevented minority participation on elected local boards for nearly 200 years. A change to <b>single-member</b> districts has resulted in the African-American minority being able to elect representatives of its choice.|$|E
25|$|The {{constituency}} {{was divided}} into two <b>single-member</b> constituencies for the provincial election of 1917: Edmonton East and Edmonton West. The adjacent constituency of Edmonton South had been renamed from the old constituency of Strathcona.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} seats had been fixed at 658 in the 1832 and 1867/8 legislation, but two two-member boroughs (Beverley and Bridgwater) and two <b>single-member</b> boroughs (Cashel and Sligo) had been disenfranchised for corruption.|$|E
25|$|PMR has a {{multi-party system}} and a unicameral {{parliament}} named the Supreme Council. Its legislature has 43 members elected by <b>single-member</b> district plurality. The president is elected to a five-year term by popular vote.|$|E
25|$|The 1995 {{election}} {{created a}} council of 72 members, each elected from a <b>single-member</b> ward {{by the first}} past the post system of election. Ward boundaries were redrawn for the 1999 election, to create 80 <b>single-member</b> wards and, again, election was by the first past the post system. The same wards and the same system of election {{were used for the}} 2003 election. For the 2007 election, ward boundaries were redrawn again, under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, to create the current 22 multi-member wards, each electing three or four councillors by the single transferable vote system, but still electing a total of 80 councillors.|$|E
25|$|The City of Pearl {{is led by}} {{an elected}} Mayor and Board of Aldermen. Each serves a {{four-year}} term. All {{but one of the}} six aldermen is elected from <b>single-member</b> districts; the sixth is elected at-large.|$|E
