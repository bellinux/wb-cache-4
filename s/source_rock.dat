40|$|The main {{factors of}} the {{developmental}} environment of marine <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in continental margin basins have their specificality. This realization, in return, {{has led to the}} recognition that the developmental environment and pattern of marine <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> especially for the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in continental margin basins, are still controversial or poorly understood. Through the analysis of the trace elements and maceral data, the developmental environment of Miocene marine <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Qiongdongnan Basin is reconstructed, and the developmental patterns of the Miocene marine <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are established. This paper attempts to reveal the hydrocarbon potential of the Miocene marine <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in different environment and speculate the quality of <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in bathyal region of the continental slope without exploratory well.

30|$|The {{theory of}} “source rock control” {{has evolved from}} source-rock-control {{hydrocarbon}} accumulation, to effective source-rock-control hydrocarbon accumulation, and to high-quality source-rock-control hydrocarbon accumulation. However, there are problems, such as whether high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> exist or not? What high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are, and how to identify them, are yet to be agreed upon. Aimed at this issue of concern to explorationists, and taking the Beier Sag in the Hailaer Basin as an example, this paper defines the high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and the lower limit for evaluation of high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> by using the inflection point on the relationship curve of hydrocarbon (oil) expulsion, which is calculated by the material balance principle, versus total organic carbon (TOC). The results show that when TOC is low, all <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> have limited hydrocarbon expulsion and slow growth rate, thus they cannot be high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> However, when TOC rises to some threshold, hydrocarbon expulsion increases significantly with TOC. This inflection point should be the lower limit of high-quality source rocks: those with TOC greater than the inflection-point value are high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> In addition, the lower limit of high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> is also related to the type and maturity of organic matters in the <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{as well as the}} mineral components of the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> affecting the residual hydrocarbons. Theoretically, the lower limit of high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> depends on geological conditions rather than being a constant value. However, for the sake of simplicity and practicability, in this paper TOC= 2.0 % is regarded as the lower limit of high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> The examination of such standard in the work area indicates that the high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in members K 1 n 2 and K 1 n 1 of the Nantun formation contribute 76 % and 82 % to oil generation, and 96 % and 91 % to oil expulsion, respectively. The distribution of high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> is also closely related to the distribution of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the region, demonstrating that high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> control hydrocarbon accumulation.|$|R
30|$|LCG {{tight oil}} is mainly {{distributed}} in {{the upper and lower}} sweet spot, where in upper sweet spot <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> TOC is mainly {{distributed in the}} range of 2 – 8 %, lower sweet spot <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> TOC is mainly distributed in the range of 0.5 – 6 %, and non-sweet spot hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> TOC is mainly distributed in the 0.5 – 4 %. Hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> abundance is significantly lower than the sweet spot, indicating that Lucaogou Formation tight oil is mainly distributed in the high organic abundance of <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> symbiotic tight reservoirs, and high quality mature hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> inside or adjacent to tight reservoir is mainly tight oil distributed layer system.|$|R
25|$|Above the {{transgressive}} sequence are Late Cretaceous shales with tight, micritic carbonate, {{marking the}} top of the Mesozoic. These shales thicken into troughs, providing the field's sole <b>source</b> <b>rock.</b> The youngest fauna are Maastrichtian, with an apparent disconformity between the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene, marked by high levels of gamma radiation on logs.|$|E
25|$|The Lower Cretaceous {{series is}} {{followed}} by the deposition of the regional main <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> of northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela, La Luna. The world class <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> contains high levels of Total Organic Carbon, comparable to the Kimmeridge Clay Formation of the basins of the North Sea. The ammonite-rich shales and biomicrites of La Luna were deposited during the global anoxic event of the Cenomanian-Turonian (around 90 Ma) characterised by a maximum flooding surface sequence. The highly organic formation is time-equivalent with the Querecual Formation of eastern Venezuela, the Chipaque and Gachetá Formations of the Colombian Eastern Ranges and Llanos Basin respectively and the Celendín Formation of northeastern Peru. The Late Cretaceous Molino Formation, laterally equivalent with the Colón and Mito Juan Formations of the Maracaibo and Catatumbo Basins, and the Umir Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley, consists of calcareous shales intercalated by sandstones. The widespread correlation of this unit with the neighbouring formations indicates an open marine environment all across northwestern South America.|$|E
25|$|During the Cretaceous, the basins of {{northern}} South America were connected in a back-arc basin setting. The {{first phase of}} the Andean orogeny uplifted the Western Ranges and was characterised by magmatism in the Sierra de San Lucas in the northern Central Ranges, dated to the Albian to Cenomanian epochs. Sedimentation on the northern South American platform was of siliciclastic and carbonate character, the latter more dominant in the northern areas. In the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, this led to the deposition of the main <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> formations of the basin, most notably La Luna.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} {{simulation}} {{of the evolution}} of major <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in study area showed that in the early sedimentary period of the second section of the Shahejie group (Es 2), all <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> were at an immature stage and no hydrocarbon was expelled. From the Es 1 period to the early Dongying period, <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> were in the low mature stage and there was some hydrocarbon generated but only a little expelled. In the middle and late period of Dongying group (about 31 – 27  Ma), most of the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> were at the mature to highly mature stage, at the peak hydrocarbon generating and expulsion period. Some hydrocarbon was expelled at the early uplift stage (27 – 23  Ma). Then, the evolution of <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> stagnated until the early Minghuazhen period in the Neogene. From the late Minghuazhen period until now (about 5 – 0  Ma), the burial depth and maturity of <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> reached and exceeded that before the uplift, and the evolution of <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> continued. This was the second stage of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion, in which the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> were at the high maturity stage in the upper layers and the over mature stage in the lower layers. However, the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> which entered into the second stage were relatively limited, mainly distributed in the deep hydrocarbon generation sags.|$|R

There are {{many types of}} <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> characterized by high organic material content, all {{the three types of}} hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> can form tight oil reservoirs with a maximum TOC value of 15 % (Li et al. 2007).

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{we apply}} geochemical and {{statistical}} analyses for evaluating <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in Ras Gharib oilfield. The geochemical analysis includes pyrolysis data as {{total organic carbon}} (TOC%), generating source potential (S 2), production index (PI), oxygen and hydrogen indices (OI, HI) and (Tmax). The {{results show that the}} Cretaceous <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are poor to good <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> with kerogen of type III and have the capability of generating gas while, the Miocene <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are good to excellent <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> with kerogen of type III–II and type II and have the capability of generating oil and gas. The analyzed data were treated statistically to find some factors, clusters, and relations concerning the evaluation of <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> These factors can be classified into organic richness and type of organic matter, hydrocarbon potentiality and thermal maturity. In addition, cluster analysis separated the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the study area into two major groups. (1) <b>Source</b> <b>rocks</b> characterized by HI > 300 (mg/g), TOC from 0. 76 to 11. 63 wt%, S 1 from 0. 44 to 9. 49 (mg/g) and S 2 from 2. 59 to 79. 61 (mg/g) indicating good to excellent <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> with kerogen of type III–II and type II and are capable of generating oil and gas. (2) <b>Source</b> <b>rocks</b> characterized by HI < 300 (mg/g), TOC from 0. 31 to 2. 07 wt%, S 1 from 0. 17 to 1. 29 (mg/g) and S 2 from 0. 31 to 3. 34 (mg/g) indicating poor to good <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> with kerogen of type III and are capable of generating gas. Moreover, Pearson’s correlation coefficient shows a strong positive correlation between TOC and S 1, S 2 and HI and no correlation between TOC and Tmax, highly negative correlation between TOC and OI and no correlation between Tmax and HI...|$|R
25|$|The {{sedimentary}} sequence {{drilled in}} the basin starts with the La Quinta Formation, that is found in a widespread area across northern Colombia and Venezuela. The formation of sandstones, basalts, conglomerates and volcanic ash was deposited in a lacustrine depositional environment in a rift basin setting related to the break-up of Pangea and has been dated to the Late Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous, 160 to 140 Ma. The formation is time-equivalent with the Girón Formation of the Eastern Ranges. The Early Cretaceous Río Negro Formation, a unit composed of sandstones, conglomerates and siltstones, is very variable in thickness {{in the basin}} and associated with continental sedimentation on rift shoulders to a post-rift setting. The formation is time-equivalent with the Tibasosa Formation of the Eastern Ranges and the Tambor Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley. The fossiliferous limestones and shales of the Lagunitas Formation, lower member of the Cogollo Group, contain beds of dolomite and are indicative of a shallow, saline environment. The formation is correlated with the Rosablanca Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley and western Eastern Ranges and the Tibú Formation of the Maracaibo Basin. The unit is the deepest <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> for the oils in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin. The upper member of the Cogollo Group, the Aguas Blancas Formation, presents a large lateral variability in lithologies. Black biomicrites and fossiliferous limestones are indicative of a middle to outer platform environment, while sandy shales and glauconitic sandstones indicate a shallow marine environment. The variation in lithologies and organic content of this <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> formation is associated with basinal relative sea level changes and the organic-rich strata to the Aptian anoxic event, dated to approximately 120 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Three {{conditions}} must {{be present}} for oil reservoirs to form: a <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> rich in hydrocarbon material buried deep enough for subterranean heat {{to cook it}} into oil, a porous and permeable reservoir rock for it to accumulate in, and a cap rock (seal) or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake {{with a layer of}} water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as reservoirs) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{approach}} to study the alteration of D/H ratios of kerogen during catagenesis: 1)laboratory incubation of organic matter that enables mechanistic study with controlled experiments. 2)natural sample measurement that provides information of combined effects over geological timescales. The complex composition and chemistry of kerogen complicates the results. Nevertheless, most research on hydrogen isotopes of kerogen show D enrichment with increasing maturity. Type II kerogen(marine derived) from New Albany Shale is reported to have δD rise from -120‰ to -70‰ as vitrinite reflectance increase from 0.3% to 1.5%. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for enrichment. One of them is kinetic fractionation during hydrocarbon generation while the other is isotopic exchange with surrounding water. Anhydrous incubation experiments have shown that the products are generally more depleted in D than their precursors, causing enrichment in residual kerogen. Schimmelmann et al. studied the relationship between terrestrially-derived oil and their <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> kerogens from four Australian Basins. They found that on average the oil is depleted to corresponding kerogen by 23‰. Hydrous incubation experiments suggest that 36-79% of bulk organic hydrogen may come from water at moderate maturity. While still under debate, it appears likely that incorporation of water hydrogen isotopes is the more dominant process for kerogen D- enrichment during catagenesis.|$|E
30|$|Tight oil mainly accumulates {{in or near}} <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> {{under the}} control of one or more sets of {{high-quality}} <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> without trap boundaries. Therefore, according to the spatial relationships between tight oil reservoirs and high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> tight oil plays can be classified into eight types, above-source play, below-source play, beside-source play, in-source play, between-source play, in-source mud-dominated play, in-source mud-subordinated play, and interbedded-source play (Table  1). For above-source, below-source, and beside-source plays which generally have conventional hydrocarbon features, high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and reservoirs are completely separated, and hydrocarbons migrate from <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> to and accumulate in reservoirs; obvious segmentations with low gamma high resistivity of reservoirs and high gamma low resistivity of <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are found in well-logging curves. For in-source plays, reservoir rocks are not developed but <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> serve as reservoirs; the reservoir space mainly consists of organic pores with high gamma in the whole section. For between-source play, hydrocarbon can be supplied from both the upper and lower <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> of reservoirs, and the monolayer of reservoir rocks is generally very thick (usually greater than 2  m); in the well logging, reservoir rocks are often characterized by low gamma and high resistivity, which can be easily identified and can be developed as a separate reservoir.|$|R
30|$|The Cretaceous {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} stratigraphic intervals for hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> This article summarizes the distribution, formation, and development characteristics of Cretaceous <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and associated oil and gas resources in the world and China, aiming at improving the understanding of this hydrocarbon enrichment and at broadening domestic exploration. Outside China, these rocks are generally formed in marine or transgressive environments during both the Upper and Lower Cretaceous. The majority of Cretaceous <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are located in the Persian Gulf, Mediterranean, and Gulf Coast of the USA. Kerogen types within these <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> have distinct spatial distribution characteristics, with high-latitude Boreal Realm, Tethyan Realm and South Gondwana Realm <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> containing type III, II, II–III kerogens, respectively. Cretaceous <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in China can be mainly divided into four zones: Eastern, Central, Northwest, and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau zones. The majority of Chinese <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> formed in the Early Cretaceous, whereas the most productive <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are developed in the Upper Cretaceous, such as those within the Songliao Basin. Most of these basins are formed in lacustrine environments, although some may have been influenced by transgressive events. Cretaceous <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are formed in four distinctive ways: 1) during Oceanic Anoxic Events and associated global sea-level rises, 2) in Black Sea-type retention basins, 3) during transgression and 4) during periods of significant terrestrial input. Formation of these <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> is controlled by four factors: paleoclimate, paleotopography, transgression, and Oceanic Anoxic Events. These four major controlling factors indicate that China’s hydrocarbon exploration within the Cretaceous should focus on two key areas with extremely low exploration levels, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the southeastern coast of China.|$|R
30|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} expulsion {{efficiency is}} very {{closely related to}} the single-layer thickness of the hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> Many experts and scholars have thoroughly investigated this relationship. Tissot and Welte (1984) found that hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> have higher contents of hydrocarbons, colloids and asphaltenes, which are from the farthest reservoir, indicating that these hydrocarbons can only be expelled from the reservoirs and hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> within a certain distance. Magara (1978) and Dieckmann et al. (2002) reported similar observations, finding that hydrocarbons cannot be entirely expelled due to large sedimentary thicknesses, low permeability and brief windows of hydrocarbon expulsion power. The hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> can be entirely expelled within the effective thickness of hydrocarbon expulsion. Zhao et al. (2006) found that thin-layer <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and the rocks within several meters of the edge of thick-layer <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> have high hydrocarbon expulsion efficiency, whereas thick-layer hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> do not favor hydrocarbon expulsion. Moreover, the hydrocarbon expulsion efficiency {{in the middle of a}} thick layer of hydrocarbon <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> is low. Wilhelms et al. (1990), Jarvie et al. (2007) and Li et al. (2015 a) observed that the hydrocarbon expulsion efficiency is not high overall and that considerable quantities of hydrocarbons remain stranded in shales. Because of the complex mechanisms of hydrocarbon expulsion, no appropriate model or formula exists to explain the hydrocarbon expulsion process. In this paper, we examine the type II 1 <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Dongying Sag as an example and subject them to pyrolysis experiments to investigate the influence of the thicknesses of single-layer <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> Additionally, we establish a geological model of the oil expulsion efficiency to more accurately reflect the geological conditions affecting the oil discharge efficiency.|$|R

During the early of Caledonian movement after Upper Ordovician deposited, the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> of Lower Ordovician quickly went into gate of Hydrocarbon-generation and generated oil & gas. Because the time was so short and buried depth was so deep, the generated oil is not able to be expulsed from <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and they had been cracked to generated gas along with <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> which Hydrocarbon-generation didn’t stop until the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> arrived at the dead line of natural gas generated.

In this paper, a series of analysis was made on cores and cutting samples taken from recent newly-drilled wells in the Ordovician reservoirs in the central–eastern areas of the Ordos Basin. Accordingly, the organic abundance features of different types of <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Majiagou Fm were presented, and for the first time, it was discovered and verified that there are effective scale <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> with high organic abundance. Based on these analysis and studies, the following results were achieved. First, the effective <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> of Majiagou Fm are composed of thin–thick layered dark dolomite-bearing mudstones, dolomitic mudstones and argillaceous dolomites, and their enrichment and distribution are obviously controlled by sedimentary facies. During the sedimentation of Majiagou Fm, the effective scale <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> developed better at the regressive stage than at the transgressive stage. The effective <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are primarily distributed in the upper part of Ma 5 Member (especially concentrated in the third and fourth sub-members) and secondly in Ma 3 Member, Ma 1 Member and the middle–lower part of Ma 5 Member. Second, the effective <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are areally distributed in a dual-girdle form around the Mizhi Salt Depression, and those in the secondary depressions are medium–thick layered, with a large total thickness and high organic abundance. Third, the effective <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the center of Mizhi Depression and the secondary uplifts are thin-layered, with a small total thickness and low organic abundance. And fourth, the organic abundance of the effective <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> varies from 0. 30 % to 8. 45 %. Phytoplankton and Acritarchs are the main parent materials of hydrocarbon, and organic matters are of sapropel or sapropel prone type. To sum up, the Ordovician effective <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Ordos Basin are generally at an over-mature stage and they contribute greatly to the natural gas in the Majiagou Fm.

In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin.

We studied the combination and superimposition of hydrocarbon source kitchens, using as an example the hinterland of the Junggar Basin (including the Yongjin, Zhengshacun, Moxizhuang and Luliang uplift areas). The study was based on geochemical analyses of crude oil and fluid inclusions, and the histories of tectonic evolution and hydrocarbon generation. The results indicated that before the Paleogene there were two hydrocarbon-generating depressions: the Western Well Pen 1 depression and the Changji depression on the south and north sides of the Che-Mo palaeohigh, respectively. The Permian source kitchen had been generating hydrocarbon continuously since Triassic and reached high maturity stage in the Cretaceous period. After Paleogene, the adjustment of the Che-Mo palaeohigh led to the subsidence of the Changji depression and the Jurassic <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> reached mature stage and became the main source kitchens. However, the Jurassic <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Western Well Pen 1 depression were still in a low maturity stage and did not generate oil because of the adjustment of tectonic movements. As a result, in the central and southern parts of the Junggar Basin, Jurassic <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> generated oil, but in the Luliang uplift, the crude oil was from the Permian <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Western Well Pen 1 depression and the Jurassic <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> did not contribute. The crude oil in the central Zhengshacun-Moxizhuang belt was from the Permian <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in two depressions, and partially from the Jurassic <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> The crude oil in the Luliang uplift was from the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> of the lower Permian Fengcheng Formation and middle Permian Wuerhe Formation, which is characterized by superimposition of two sets of source kitchens and three accumulation stages. The crude oil in the Yongjin tectonic belt was from the lower Permian, middle Permian and Jurassic <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> which is characterized by superimposition of three sets of source kitchens and two accumulation stages. The crude oil in the Zhengshacun tectonic belt was {{from a combination of}} source kitchens of lower Permian and middle Permian in the Western Well Pen 1 depression in the early stage and from the superimposition of Jurassic <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Changji depression in the late stage.|$|R
