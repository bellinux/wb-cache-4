Located {{in the front of}} the original library, this addition encompassed 124000 sq ft with five new levels added (four above ground). The Charles C. Wise, Jr. Library and the new addition are connected by an atrium. A large <b>skylight</b> <b>filters</b> sunlight into the room onto the original facade of the library. The library was completed in the spring of 2002. The building is now considered two separate libraries - Charles C. Wise, Jr. Library and Downtown Library. Since the origin of the Downtown/Wise Library, the complex has gained four floors of study rooms and computer workstations, rare collections housed in the Wise section of the library, and a coffee shop.|$|R
