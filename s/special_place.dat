40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Social Science: Environment and Community, 2009 This thesis {{explores the}} role of special places???forts, dens, and hideouts??? during middle {{childhood}} (ages 6 - 12). Natural settings have traditionally been children???s <b>special</b> <b>places.</b> Research has demonstrated the importance of outdoor <b>special</b> <b>places</b> in children???s lives including: helping children to develop and form bonds with the earth, and as locations for both privacy and socialization. The landscape of today???s childhood is undergoing dramatic shifts and researchers posit that children???s <b>special</b> <b>places</b> are shifting toward indoor settings. This thesis seeks to understand children???s experience {{of place in the}} Humboldt Bay region of Northern California. ???Children-centered,??? qualitative research methods include interviews and an analysis of participants??? drawings and photographs. This thesis primarily examines how children???s <b>special</b> <b>places</b> contribute to child development, place attachment, and environmental stewardship values. More generally, this thesis asks children to reveal what places they consider to be ???special. ??? Results build on previous research and suggest several findings concerning the significance of children???s <b>special</b> <b>places.</b> First, children still prefer outdoor <b>places</b> as their <b>special</b> <b>places.</b> Second, outdoor <b>special</b> <b>places</b> are important for holistic physical, cognitive, and social development. Third, both indoor and outdoor <b>special</b> <b>places</b> are vital to children???s emotional development because these places act as refuges and sites for emotional regulation. Fourth, children care deeply about their outdoor <b>special</b> <b>places</b> and express environmental stewardship values concerning these <b>places.</b> And last, <b>special</b> <b>places</b> facilitate healthy place attachments. This thesis recommends that people who are involved in the processes and structures that shape children???s lives recognize the value of outdoor <b>special</b> <b>places</b> and provide children with time, freedom, and access to natural landscapes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>places</b> {{are places}} {{that people feel}} strongly. These places hold {{significance}} for them based on experiences that they had there that changed their lives.

5|$|Karnataka {{also has}} a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> {{in the world of}} Indian {{classical}} music, with both Karnataka (Carnatic) and Hindustani styles finding place in the state, and Karnataka has produced a number of stalwarts in both styles. The Haridasa movement of the sixteenth century contributed significantly to the development of Karnataka (Carnatic) music as a performing art form. Purandara Dasa, one of the most revered Haridasas, is known as the Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ('Father of Karnataka a.k.a. Carnatic music'). Celebrated Hindustani musicians like Gangubai Hangal, Mallikarjun Mansur, Bhimsen Joshi, Basavaraja Rajaguru, Sawai Gandharva and several others hail from Karnataka, and some of them have been recipients of the Kalidas Samman, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awards. Noted Carnatic musicians include Violin T. Chowdiah, Veena Sheshanna, Mysore Vasudevachar, Doreswamy Iyengar and Thitte Krishna Iyengar.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twelfth}} century, {{education}} within the Byzantine Greek population was {{more advanced than}} in the West, particularly at primary school level, resulting in comparatively high literacy rates. Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants, who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade. Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants, they held their own throughout {{the latter half of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence. The clergy also held a <b>special</b> <b>place,</b> not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts, but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope. This position of strength had built up over time, for at the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), only a small part, about 10%, of the population was Christian.|$|E

5|$|Karnataka {{occupies}} a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> {{in the history}} of Indian radio. In 1935, Aakashvani, the first private radio station in India, was started by Prof. M.V. Gopalaswamy in Mysore. The popular radio station was taken over by the local municipality and later by All India Radio (AIR) and moved to Bangalore in 1955. Later in 1957, AIR adopted the original name of the radio station, Aakashavani as its own. Some of the popular programs aired by AIR Bangalore included Nisarga Sampada and Sasya Sanjeevini which were programs that taught science through songs, plays and stories. These two programs became so popular that they were translated and broadcast in 18 different languages and the entire series was recorded on cassettes by the Government of Karnataka and distributed to thousands of schools across the state. Karnataka has witnessed a growth in FM radio channels, mainly in the cities of Bangalore, Mangalore and Mysore, which has become hugely popular.|$|E
5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a joyful demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E

A public demonstration of the connotation of special needs with segregation went viral a few years ago. At a family restaurant in Houston, one family asked to be re-seated farther away from another family which included a five-year-old son with Down syndrome. The father of the family who asked to be re-seated explained his motivation with the statement, “special needs kids should be kept in special places” (Broderick, 2013). <b>Special</b> <b>places,</b> <b>special</b> programs, special schools, and special needs connote segregation; in contrast, accessible <b>places</b> (rather than <b>special</b> <b>places)</b> and inclusive programs (rather than special programs) connote integration (Kailes, 2010).|$|R
