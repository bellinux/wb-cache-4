5|$|On {{behalf of}} Bryan, Legal Services {{attorney}} Patrick Moriarty then sued {{the state and}} Itasca County in the District Court of Itasca County, seeking declaratory relief and an injunction which would prevent the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>county</b> from collecting taxes from Indians on tribal land. This was filed as a class action suit. There was no dispute as to {{the facts of the}} case, so the matter was submitted as a question of law to Judge James F. Murphy. In 1973, the district court held that the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>county</b> were authorized to collect such taxes under Public Law 280. Murphy noted that while the Chippewa had at one time been a sovereign Indian nation, their members were now citizens of Minnesota and received benefits from the state such as county services, the court system, and other like services.|$|E

On February 15, 2014, Route 358 was retired, and replaced with the RapidRide E Line.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s {{corruption}} in Texas at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>county</b> level was in decline, while pressure against vice {{across the state}} and across the nation was on the rise. Even San Antonio's famed Sporting District, {{once one of the}} nation's largest red-light districts, was shut down in 1941. As state investigations of the Maceos' activities became more serious, Sam and Rose began plans to move their empire to Nevada. The Maceos became major investors in the Desert Inn, which was the largest and most elaborate casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip when it opened in 1950. Moe Dalitz (who opened the Desert Inn) and Sam Maceo had long been allies and business partners. The Las Vegas project's financing was largely facilitated by the Maceos and Moodys through ANICO (which loaned millions to known mob figures). Soon ANICO was one of the largest lenders to Las Vegas casinos. Sam and Rose Maceo transferred controlling interest of most of their Galveston empire to a new group dominated by the Fertitta family, with investments coming from business interests around the island. The Fertitta group never wielded the influence that the Maceos had (though a generation later Tilman and Frank Fertitta came to be major entertainment magnates themselves). Sam Maceo died in 1951 and Rose in 1954.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, {{just days}} after the storm moved through, President George W. Bush {{declared}} New Castle County, Delaware as a disaster area following the effects of Henri and later Hurricane Isabel. The declaration designated the affected citizens eligible for grants to pay for temporary housing, house repairs, and serious disaster-related expenses. The declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75% of the repair cost for replacing public facilities. By two months after the storm, 659residents had applied for disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), totaling to just over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD). 141small businesses applied for loans, totaling to around $2.5million (2003USD, $2.75million 2006USD). In addition, FEMA received 183applications for public assistance, which would be used for rebuilding public roads and buildings. Over twentyvolunteer organizations met to establish a long-term committee to find resources for disaster recovery needs. One goal sought by the committee was to find a permanent housing solution for every one who was displaced from their houses from the storms. Volunteers also helped remove ruined appliances and furniture to local landfills, totaling to more than 300tons. <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>county</b> governments in Delaware purchased 171homes following the damage in the Glenville area, the highest number of houses purchased in the state due to storm damage. The house purchasing was done to mitigate the flood damage by restoring the area as a wetland.|$|E
