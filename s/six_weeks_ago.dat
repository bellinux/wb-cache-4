25|$|On 19 October 2008, {{the news}} media began to {{broadcast}} the news of Pakistan Army troops, led by an army lieutenant, being locked in a fierce battle with foreign militants to keep open the line routes to NATO forces in Afghanistan. For several months, the foreign militants {{had been trying to}} either attack or seal off the supply routes. The army battle reports indicated that the local commander, Mohammad Tariq al-Fridi, had seized terrain around the mile-long Kohat Tunnel. The military intelligence reports had held al-Fridi responsible for coordinated suicide bomb attacks and rocket strikes against convoys emerging from it. The TTP spokesman, Maulvi Omar, claimed that his foreign fighters would lay down their arms if the Pakistan Army ceased intense fighting. The military refused his offers and a tactical military operation was launched to secure the tunnel routes after TTP seized five trucks carrying weapons and ammunition. They held the tunnel for a week before they were driven out in fierce fighting with the military. Since then, Tariq and his men have returned several times to attack convoys, in a response, the army launched its latest onslaught after a suicide bomb attack at one of its bases near the tunnel <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> In a massive manhunt operation, Tariq was killed along with hundreds of militants while trying to flee the battle in a combat air operation. The operation ended with five civilians were killed and 45 were injured, including 35 soldiers, when a pickup truck packed with explosives was driven into a checkpoint.|$|E
2500|$|Controversy arose {{over the}} Coalition's climate change policy, with The Financial Review citing [...] "government sources" [...] who claimed Turnbull told Cabinet <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> it should sign the Kyoto Protocol. Neither Howard nor Turnbull denied the story. The story said that [...] "internal critics" [...] are {{claiming}} Turnbull is [...] "selfishly positioning {{himself for a}} Coalition defeat" [...] and a [...] "possible post-poll leadership battle with Treasurer Peter Costello". The story led to claims of major splits in Cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|This story echoes Mildred's [...] "Seashell ear-thimbles" [...] (i.e., a {{brand of}} in-ear headphones) that act as an {{emotional}} barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that Fahrenheit 451 is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature. Regarding minorities, {{he wrote in his}} 1979 Coda:There is {{more than one way to}} burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, Mattachine/Four Square Gospel feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse. Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel Fahrenheit 451, described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever. Only <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. Judy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.|$|E

60|$|There {{has lately}} been much {{suffering}} here from heat; {{we have had}} it upon us now eleven days. I go around with an umbrella and a fan. I saw two cases of sun-stroke yesterday, one in Pennsylvania avenue, and another in Seventh street. The City railroad company loses some horses every day. Yet Washington is having a livelier August, and is probably putting in a more energetic and satisfactory summer, than ever before during its existence. There is probably more human electricity, more population to make it, more business, more light-heartedness, than ever before. The armies that swiftly circumambiated from Fredericksburgh--march'd, struggled, fought, had out their mighty clinch and hurl at Gettysburg--wheel'd, circumambiated again, return'd to their ways, touching us not, either at their going or coming. And Washington feels that she has pass'd the worst; perhaps feels that she is henceforth mistress. So here she sits with her surrounding hills spotted with guns, and is conscious of a character and identity different {{from what it was}} five or <b>six</b> short <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> and very considerably pleasanter and prouder.|$|R

2500|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Linda Drane Burdick in {{the prosecution}} rebuttal told the jurors {{that she and her}} colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. [...] "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case," [...] she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. [...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." [...] She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a [...] "decoy" [...] put there to keep people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot. [...] "Whose life was better without Caylee?" [...] she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. [...] "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left {{on the side of the}} road dead." [...] Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the [...] "Bella Vita" [...] (meaning [...] "Beautiful Life") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other.|$|E
