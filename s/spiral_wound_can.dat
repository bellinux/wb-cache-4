40|$|Cheese {{is one of}} {{the most}} well known food {{products}} in the world dating back to the 8 th century B. C. There are more than 2000 varieties of cheese that are manufactured all over the world. Feta cheese is a soft white cheese with a salty and slightly acidic taste, which has originated from Greece. Most of the feta cheese manufactured in Greece is consumed locally, the migration of greeks to other parts of the world led to a demand for feta cheese outside of Greece. The spreading of the popularity of feta cheese to other ethnic groups in different parts of the world resulted in the high demand for feta cheese worldwide. The modern and most efficient method of feta cheese production involves a membrane filtration method, known as ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration process utilises pressure as a driving force to concentrate milk by removal of water and small dissolved molecules. Hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> ultrafiltration membranes are the two types of membranes that are commonly used for cheese production. An extensive amount of research exists on the implementation of ultrafiltration to improve the efficiency of the cheese making process and the performance of the membranes. However, limited research has been conducted on the comparison of the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane performance in the cheese making process. The objective of the research was to determine if the hollow fibre membranes used at Puhoi Valley Cheese can be replaced with <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes without compromising the quality of cheese produced. In order to achieve the objective, feta cheese was produced using hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> ultrafiltration pilot plants. The operating performances of the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane units were compared. To ensure that the quality of cheese is maintained, the cheese manufactured on the pilot plant units was analysed in terms of composition, microbiology, texture and sensory properties. The cheese made using the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant was compared with the reference sample from Puhoi Valley Cheese as they use hollow fibre membranes to produce feta cheese. The cheese made from the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane unit was also compared to that made by the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant unit. The operating parameters such as the inlet and outlet pressure, pressure difference along the membrane, transmembrane pressure, flow rate, recycle rate (bleed off rate), temperature and the run time were recorded. The operating parameters of the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> runs were compared with the data from Puhoi Valley Cheese. The quality of cheese made on the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant units were evaluated in terms of composition, texture, microbiology and sensory properties. The composition was defined by the fat, protein, total solids and salt contents. The fat content was determined by utilising the modified Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff method, protein by the Kjeldahl method, total solids by using the air drying oven and salt percentage by the volhard method. The texture of the cheese was determined by the fracturability and hardness from the compression curve generated using the single bite compression test. The microbiological testing was performed according to New Zealand testing methods for E. Coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and yeast and mould. The difference from the control method was utilised for sensory evaluation. The acid degree value method was used to determine the lipase activity in feta cheese. It was found from the composition, texture and sensory analysis that the cheese from the hollow fibre pilot plant was different from the cheese manufactured at Puhoi Valley Cheeses (PVC). The <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> cheeses were also found to be different to PVC cheese, however the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> cheeses and the pilot plant hollow fibre cheese were the same. The differences between both the pilot plant cheeses and PVC cheese were in terms of the fat, salt, moisture contents and the lipase activity in the cheeses. The fat content in the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant cheeses are lower in comparison to the PVC cheese. This difference in fat content is considered to be due to the difference in the fat to protein ratio of the milk concentrated on the pilot plant and the PVC ultrafiltration system. The lower fat content resulted in firmer cheese than PVC due to more cross linking between the protein strands in cheese. The salt content in the cheeses made using the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plants was lower than Puhoi Valley Cheese. This is considered to be due to the low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume used for salting the cheese. The salt content of brine decreases during brining; hence a low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume causes a significant decrease in brine concentration. The decrease in brine concentration decreases the salt intake of the cheese. As salt diffuses in the moisture diffuses out, lower salt content results in higher moisture content in the cheese. As mentioned, the moisture content of the hollow fibre pilot plant cheese was higher than the PVC cheese. The moisture content is inversely proportional to the total solids, hence higher moisture in pilot plant cheeses implies lower total solids than the PVC cheese. The lipase activity results showed that the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant cheeses had higher lipase activity than the Puhoi valley cheese. The differences in lipase activity of the pilot plant cheeses and Puhoi Valley cheese were considered to be due to the incomplete inactivation of lipase present in milk during pasteurisation. The results from texture and sensory evaluation support the above mentioned differences. The microbiology results for all pilot plant cheeses were within the trigger limits set by Puhoi valley cheeses. The results from monitoring the operating parameters of both the pilot plant data show that the permeate flux decreases while the total solids in milk increase with time, which was also observed from the Puhoi Valley Cheese data. However, the rate of decrease of the permeate flux and the increase of the total solids in milk are dependent on the membrane area, feed volume, transmembrane pressure, pressure drop across the membrane and the flow characteristics. The rate of decrease in permeate flux and the rate of increase in the total solids of the hollow fibre runs and <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> runs are slightly different. The difference is due to the availability of larger membrane surface area and processing of larger feed volume of milk in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> runs. The transmembrane pressure and the pressure drop across the membrane were maintained as close as possible to Puhoi Valley Cheese. In conclusion, <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes <b>can</b> be used to achieve the desired total solids concentration and successfully make the same feta cheese as the hollow fibre pilot plant. In order to make the same quality of feta cheese as Puhoi Valley Cheese using the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane pilot plant, the same composition of milk used for concentration at Puhoi Valley Cheese needs to be used on the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> pilot plant unit. It is recommended that Puhoi Valley Cheeses should be replaced with <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes if they are more economical in terms of cost than the hollow fibre membranes...|$|R

The work evaluated {{the effect of}} transmembrane pressure and the cross-flow velocity with a 3 ² experimental design using classical Hermia's models and the resistance-in-series model. The resistance-in-series analysis identified external fouling {{on the surface of}} both membranes, but the tubular membrane showed higher reversible fouling, while the reversible and irreversible resistances of the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane averaged 41 % and 45 %, respectively. Cake formation is the model that best represents ultrafiltration in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane at all transmembrane pressures and cross-flow velocities. In the tubular membrane, at the lowest cross-flow velocity (0. 79 m. s- 1), the cake formation model fitted the experimental data best. However, at higher cross-flow velocities (1. 42 and 2. 23 m. s- 1), the best fit of flux data was obtained with the complete pore blocking model.

In this work, we demonstrate {{the design of a}} hollow ﬁber nanoﬁltration membrane with excellent rejection properties by alternatively coating a porous ultraﬁltration membrane with a polycation, a polyzwitterion, and a polyanion. On model surfaces, we show, for the ﬁrst time, that the polyzwitterion poly N-(3 -sulfopropyl) -N-(methacryloxyethyl) -N,N-dimethylam-monium betaine (PSBMA) can be incorporated into traditional polyelectrolyte multilayers based on poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC). Furthermore, work on model surfaces allows a good characterization of, and insight into, the layer build-up and helps to establish the ptimal membrane coating conditions. Membranes coated with these multilayers have high salt rejection of up to 42 % NaCl, 72 % CaCl 2, and 98 % Na 2 SO 4 with permeabilities of 3. 7 − 4. 5 l·m− 2 ·h− 1 ·bar− 1. In addition to the salt rejections, the rejection of six distinctively diﬀerent micropollutants, with molecular weights between 215 and 362 g·mol− 1, was investigated. Depending on the terminating layer, the incorporation of the polyzwitterion in the multilayer results in nanoﬁltration membranes that show excellent retentions for both positively and negatively charged micropollutants, a behavior that is attributed to dielectric exclusion of the solutes. Our approach of combining model surfaces with membrane performance measurements provides unique insights into the properties of polyzwitterion-containing multilayers and their applications...|$|R

The morphology of grand-design spirals can be further divided by the openness of the arms: tightly wound ones with winding angle of around 3 π radian and open spirals with winding angle of around π radian. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we have investigated the mechanism responsible for the openness of nuclear spirals.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{objective}} laws investigation of mass transfer during removal of cake layer formed because of concentration polarization phenomenon from working surface of membrane and to the designing of effective process of regeneration of <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane modules. The theoretical principle of process of precipitate removal from membrane surface in <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane module was substantiated. The proposed method of regeneration allows recovering membrane flux without loss of selectivity and mechanical properties. The physical and mathematical models of fouled <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane modules regeneration using of temperature cavitation phenomenon under subatmospheric pressure were developed. The equations of mass transfer kinetics in system liquid ? solid were expanded to marrow conditions in membrane channel. The objective laws of mass transfer during cake layer removal in channel of <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane modules were defined experimentally. The results were generalized in a form of dimensionless equation for mass transportation equations coefficient determination. The proposed equation is reliable in a range of Reynolds from 0, 4 to 60. The proposed mathematical model was solved using numerical methods. The calculations using mathematical model were carried out and influence of hydrodynamic conditions, process temperature and cleaning solutions volume is determinated. The most rational flow regime is corresponding to Reynolds number values in a range from 15 to 25. The impact of process temperature and cleaning solution volume is negligible. It was experimentally defined that using of temperature cavitation phenomenon promote of increasing of intensity of cake layer removal process from membrane surface in <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module. The regeneration can be carried out using environmentally acceptable cleaning solutions such as desalinated water and solutions of citric acid and sodium hydrocarbonate. The experimental examination of regeneration process effectiveness was carried out. The possibility of membrane flux recover for 90 ? 95 % was proved. It was shown by the experimental determination of total resistance to flux through the membrane of clean membrane module, fouled membrane module and regenerated membrane module that increase membrane flux after regeneration has occurred due to decreasing of cake layer resistance. Those results prove the principles of proposed physical model. The influence of technological parameters on mass transfer effectiveness during cake layer removal using temperature cavitation phenomenon was determinated. The methods of process intensification using periodical operating pressure increasing were substantiated. The effectiveness of periodical operating pressure increasing as an intensification technique which allows increase regeneration coefficient in 1, 5 times was proved. The factors which influence on regeneration process effectiveness were determinated using experiment planning method. The regression equations were obtained. The recommendations for using of proposed technique of fouled <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membrane modules regeneration under absolute pressure of 0, 005 - 0, 009 MPa and operating temperature of 45 ?C were developed.

40|$|Scale {{formation}} of sparingly soluble salts {{has a significant}} effect on flux decline in nanofiltration (NF) system. This study focuses on the elucidation of the different mechanisms of scale formation according to membrane modules in NF system. In unstirred batch NF, flux decline was mainly due to surface (heterogeneous) crystallization, while in crossflow NF, fouling was attributed to both surface and bulk crystallization. However, the extent of contribution of each crystallization to the fouling depended on the NF modules. The bulk (homogeneous) crystallization followed by crystal deposition {{on the surface of the}} nanofilter played a major role in flux decline in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module whereas surface blockage due to the surface crystallization does in the tubular module. When an on-line microfiler was introduced to prevent crystal deposition during the concentration run, flux improvement was pronounced only in case of the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module, whereas it was negligible in case of the tubular module. This was because the microfilter could only remove crystals formed in the retentate through the bulk crystallization which is the dominant fouling mechanism in the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> module.

In this study, ODR images of multiple repetitive spacer areas in a membrane fouling simulator were averaged to produce high resolution, low noise ODR images. Averaging 40 individual spacer areas improved the ODR distribution image significantly and allowed comparison of biofilm patterning over a spacer structure at different positions in an RO filter. This method clearly showed that most active biofilm accumulated on and in direct vicinity of the spacer. The averaging method was also used to calculate the deviation of ODR patterning from individual spacer areas to the average ODR pattern, proposing a new approach to determine biofilm spatial heterogeneity.

In addition, this last filter was able to completely eliminate TC and FC. Rejection of all received bacteria by RO was complete. The removal evaluation of inoculated specific types of bacteria showed that the UF hollow membrane removed 2 logs (99 %) of inoculated E. coli (107 – 108 cfu/mL inoculum), 2 - 3 logs (99 - 99. 9 %) of Enterococus spp. (107 – 1010 cfu/mL inoculum), 1 - 2 logs (90 - 99 %) of Salmonella (108 – 1010 cfu/mL inoculum) and 1 - 2 logs (90 - 99 %) of Shigella (105 – 106 cfu/mL inoculum). The <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> was significantly efficient in rejecting 3 logs of E. coli, 5 logs of Enterococus spp., 4 logs of Salmonella, and 1 - 3 logs of Shigella that were received from the UF hollow fibre membrane. The results indicate that gram positive bacteria were removed much more efficiently compared to the gram negative ones and the rationale behind of such a behaviour is based on cell walls elasticit...|$|R
30|$|Physical inspection: RO {{systems such}} as the <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> {{membrane}} module may show signs of biofouling in smell and color which can be physically inspected. Routine visual inspection of various plant components such as pretreatment piping, cartridge and media filters {{should be done to}} detect accumulation of biological matter. All of these inspections must be performed in wet conditions since microorganisms thrive in it (Al-Ahmad et al. 2000).|$|R
25|$|Biofouling is {{also found}} in almost all {{circumstances}} where water-based liquids are in contact with other materials. Industrially important impacts are on the maintenance of mariculture, membrane systems (e.g., membrane bioreactors and reverse osmosis <b>spiral</b> <b>wound</b> membranes) and cooling water cycles of large industrial equipment and power stations. Biofouling can occur in oil pipelines carrying oils with entrained water, especially those carrying used oils, cutting oils, oils rendered water-soluble through emulsification, and hydraulic oils.|$|R

The seal {{consists of a}} strip of gasket material wound into a groove machined {{into one of the}} surfaces. The gasket strip is wider than the groove is deep so that a portion of the gasket material protrudes from the groove. The seal is effected by clamping the second surface onto the first surface and compressing the protruding gasket material...|$|R

The experiments with AMCS demonstrated effective air-drying under a high ratio-feed gas flux/liquid carrier flux (102 - 103).
