Stator windings are {{the main component of}} generators in which Electrical, magnetically and thermal stresses remain major failures for insulation degradation accelerated aging. A large number of generators failed due to stator winding problems, mainly insulation deterioration. Insulation degradation assessment plays vital role in the asset life management. Mostly the stator failure is catastrophic causing significant damage to the plant. Other than generation loss, stator failure involves heavy repair or replacement cost. Electro thermal analysis is the main characteristic for improvement design of stator slot’s insulation.

40|$|Abstract: To {{model the}} regular spacing of the thrust faults in duplexes we subject {{a single layer}} {{embedded}} in an overlying viscous fluid, and an underlying rigid medium, to combined layer-parallel shortening and shear. The layer is a rigid-plastic solid at yield. A cusp introduced as a small perturbation on the upper layer interface perturbs the flow. The lower layer interface is weak and remains fiat throughout the deformation, whereas the upper interface is deformable and can assimilate both weak and strong conditions. If the upper interface is strong it folds into a broad open fold. If the interface is weak the flow localizes into narrow shear bands that cut into the layer from the cusp, and reflect from the layer interfaces at a constant <b>spacing.</b> <b>Material</b> is displaced across the shear bands in a fault-like manner. If the layer is subjected solely to layer-parallel shortening these shear bands arc symmetric. Superposing a shear component on the layer interface reorients the shear bands. The shear band dipping opposite {{to the sense of}} shear is more strongly developed and intersects he interface at a lower angle than the other. This is in agreement with the observations of duplex configurations. In a duplex (Boyer & Elliott 1982; Mitra 1986) ...|$|E

Investigating the dynamism of the birth spacing, identify factors and their effects on the time interval among pregnancies and determination of optimal spacing is the utmost importance for health planners and families. The purpose was to study the abortion and stillbirth due to short inter-birth spacing, factors affecting inter-births and optimal birth <b>spacing.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: In 2005, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a population of 1064 women of childbearing age in Fars province by multistage random sampling. Information on reproductive history was collected by resident health workers. Variables affecting inter-births were checked by the frailty recurrent events model using S-plus 2000 and SPSS 13 software. Results: The rate of abortion or stillbirth was 1. 7 %, which fell with increasing interval between births and reached their lowest (1. 9 %) at 36 - 48 months. Mother's level of education, duration of breastfeeding of previous infant, maternal age at birth and father's job showed positive correlation with inter-birth. Mother's age at marriage, having a job other than household, socioeconomic status was negatively correlated with the the time interval to the next delivery. With increasing birth order, inter-birth of each delivery with regard to previous delivery increased on average by one to two months.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a novel gamma-ray imaging system concept and presents results from Monte Carlo simulations of the new design. Current designs for large field-of-view gamma cameras suitable for homeland security applications implement either a coded aperture or a Compton scattering geometry to image a gamma-ray source. Both of these systems require large, expensive position-sensitive detectors in order to work effectively. By combining characteristics of both of these systems, a new design can be implemented that does not require such expensive detectors and that can be scaled down to a portable size. This new system has significant promise in homeland security, astronomy, botany and other fields, while future iterations may prove useful in medical imaging, other biological sciences and other areas, such as non-destructive testing. A proof-of-principle study of the new gamma-ray imaging system has been performed by Monte Carlo simulation. Various reconstruction methods have been explored and compared. General-Purpose Graphics-Processor-Unit (GPGPU) computation has also been incorporated. The resulting code is a primary design tool for exploring variables such as detector <b>spacing,</b> <b>material</b> selection and thickness and pixel geometry.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringLarge {{composite}} structures have been increasingly {{used in the}} aviation industry. In order to achieve higher fuel efficiency, the use of light-weight, high-strength composite materials, such as carbon/epoxy, needs to be fully explored. New applications of composite materials include primary structures such as aircraft fuselages. This study dealt with thermal stresses induced in a composite aircraft fuselage, in which the fuselage skin was made of carbon/epoxy composite and was fastened to aluminum beams. These stresses resulted from the large {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) difference and also the large temperature difference between the time of assembly, which was 75 ºF and the actual flight condition, which was - 65 ºF). This temperature difference of around 140 ºF induced high thermal stresses, not only in the fasteners but also in the aluminum beams and composite panels. The two main objectives of the study are as follows: To investigate the thermally induced stresses in the aluminum beams. To investigate the feasibility of thermally isolating the aluminum beams from the composite fuselage skins. An experimental program was conducted to measure the strains on the top surface of an aluminum beam, which was fastened to the composite panel from thermal loads due to temperature difference and CTE mismatch. An approach was also designed to study the effects of the length of the aluminum beam on stresses. An analytical model was developed to evaluate the fastener load transfer and the thermally induced stress within the fastened aluminum/composite assemblies. Five parameters were used to develop an analytical model to calculate the load transfer between the aluminum/composite hybrid structures: equivalent area of the aluminum beam and composite panel, equivalent temperatures of the aluminum beam and composite panel, and equivalent fastener stiffness were determined using three-dimensional finite element analysis. An attempt has been made to study the effect of fastener diameter, fastener <b>spacing,</b> <b>material</b> of the metallic beam, size of the metallic beam, thickness of the composite panel on the five parameters required to find the load transfer so that a relation could be established for a working engineer to determine these parameters without doing any finite element work.
