For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E

The theoretical part outlines historical consequences of the creation of a <b>single</b> european <b>currency</b> and the roles of France and Germany in the European integration. The practical section contains an analysis of impacts of introducing the <b>single</b> european <b>currency.</b> Particular impacts of the adoption of common currency are assessed on inflation, on inhabitants, on international business with France and Germany and on economic growth...|$|R

5|$|In 2007, Rwanda {{joined the}} East African Community, an {{intergovernmental}} organisation for the East Africa region comprising Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The country's accession required {{the signing of}} various agreements with the other members, including a defence intelligence sharing pact, a customs union, and measures to combat drug trafficking. The countries of the Community established a common market in 2011, and plan further integration, including moves toward political federation and a possible <b>single</b> <b>currency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Milošević's {{trial at}} the ICTY {{revealed}} numerous declassified documents of Belgrade's {{involvement in the}} wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Evidence introduced at trial showed exactly how Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia financed the war, that they provided weapons and material support to Bosnian and Croatian Serbs, and demonstrated the administrative and personnel structures set up to support the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb armies. It was established that Belgrade, through the federal government, financed more than 90 percent of the Krajina budget in 1993; that the Supreme Defense Council decided to hide aid to Republika Srpska and Krajina from the public; that the National Bank of Krajina operated as a branch office of the National Bank of Yugoslavia; and that by March 1994 FR Yugoslavia, Krajina, and Republika Srpska used a <b>single</b> <b>currency.</b> Numerous documents demonstrated that branches of the Krajina Public Accountancy Service were incorporated into Serbia's accountancy system in May 1991, and that the financing of Krajina and Republika Srpska caused hyperinflation in FR Yugoslavia. The trial revealed that the JNA, the Serbian Ministry of Interior, and other entities (including Serb civilian groups and police) armed Serb civilians and local territorial defense groups in the RSK before the conflict escalated.|$|E
25|$|One {{concrete}} {{economic policy}} {{of recent years}} has been opposition to the European <b>single</b> <b>currency.</b> Anticipating the growing Euroscepticism within his party, John Major negotiated a British opt-out from the <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, although several members of Major's cabinet, such as Kenneth Clarke, were personally supportive of EMU participation. Following Major's resignation after the 1997 defeat, each of the four subsequent Conservative leaders, including David Cameron, have positioned the party firmly against the adoption of the euro. This policy is broadly popular with the British electorate.|$|E

40|$|Britain’s {{decision}} to reject membership of a <b>Single</b> European <b>Currency</b> – the Euro – remains {{a focal point}} of contemporary political and economic debate. Both the Danish vote to reject the Euro and the latter’s slide in value have resulted in some anxious moments for those politicians and commentators who previously confidently predicted a rosy future for European monetary integration and stronger trade patterns. At a time when Britain still ponders over the decision {{of whether or not}} to join “Euro land” some serious questions need to be asked about the <b>Single</b> <b>Currency’s</b> impact on future economic prosperity, growth patterns and employment. This paper concentrates on monetary adjustment mechanisms in the absence ofa flexible exchange rate regime. It addresses the potential implications of productivity differentials and labour market imperfections, particularly by reference to a lack of European labour market mobility and the impact of European productivity differentials. Using particular aspects of the Scottish labour market, the paper concludes with an assessment of the <b>Single</b> European <b>Currency’s</b> impact on the Scottish economy and highlights the importance of “tradable skills” rather than mobile workers...|$|R

25|$|The {{final stage}} of {{completely}} free movement of capital was thought to require a <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> and monetary policy, eliminating the transaction costs and fluctuations of currency exchange. Following a Report of the Delors Commission in 1988, the Treaty of Maastricht made economic and monetary union an objective, first by completing the internal market, second by creating a European System of Central Banks to coordinate common monetary policy, and third by locking exchange rates and introducing a <b>single</b> <b>currency,</b> the euro. Today, 19 member states have adopted the euro, while 9 member states have either determined to opt-out or their accession has been delayed, particularly since the Eurozone crisis. According to TFEU articles 119 and 127, {{the objective of the}} European Central Bank and other central banks ought to be price stability. This has been criticised for apparently being superior to the objective of full employment in the Treaty on European Union article 3.|$|E

This is only possible provided uniformity can be brought in the terms and conditions across the globe for raising international loans.

Consequently, not only does the existence of different currencies act as a barrier to such integration, but it disproportionately benefits the developed countries. This problem can only be eliminated provided a <b>single</b> worldwide <b>currency</b> is introduced.
