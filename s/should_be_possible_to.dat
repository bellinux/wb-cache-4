5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E

25|$|Introduction of {{too much}} siRNA can result in nonspecific events due to {{activation}} of innate immune responses. Most evidence to date suggests that this is probably due to activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR, although retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) may also be involved. The induction of cytokines via toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) has also been described. One promising method of reducing the nonspecific effects is to convert the siRNA into a microRNA. MicroRNAs occur naturally, and by harnessing this endogenous pathway it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> achieve similar gene knockdown at comparatively low concentrations of resulting siRNAs. This should minimize nonspecific effects.|$|E
25|$|When {{measurable}} quantities involve cross products, the handedness of the coordinate systems used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> make an arbitrary {{choice of the}} coordinate system (including handedness). To avoid problems, one should be careful to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations {{that need to be}} considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must take into account that when the handedness of the coordinate system is not fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a pseudovector. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.|$|E

25|$|The {{asymptotic}} computational {{complexity of}} these algorithms may be misleading, {{because they can}} only be run on inputs of very small size. In a 1991 comparison, Hoon Hong estimated that Collins' doubly exponential procedure {{would be able to}} solve a problem whose size is described by setting all the above parameters to 2, in less than a second, whereas the algorithms of Grigoriev, Vorbjov, and Renegar would instead take more than a million years.

500|$|Fauré was not greatly {{interested}} in orchestration, and on occasion asked his former {{students such as}} Jean Roger-Ducasse and Charles Koechlin to orchestrate his concert and theatre works. In Nectoux's words, Fauré's generally sober orchestral style reflects [...] "a definite aesthetic attitude... The idea of timbre was not a determining one in Fauré's musical thinking". He was not attracted by flamboyant combinations of tone-colours, which he thought either self-indulgent or a disguise for lack of real musical invention. He told his students that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> produce an orchestration without resorting to glockenspiels, celestas, xylophones, bells or electrical instruments. Debussy admired the spareness of Fauré's orchestration, finding in it the transparency he strove for in his own 1913 ballet Jeux; Poulenc, by contrast, described Fauré's orchestration as [...] "a leaden overcoat... instrumental mud". Fauré's best-known orchestral works are the suites Masques et bergamasques (based on music for a dramatic entertainment, or divertissement comique), which he orchestrated himself, Dolly, orchestrated by Henri Rabaud, and Pelléas et Mélisande which draws on incidental music for Maeterlinck's play; the stage version was orchestrated by Koechlin, but Fauré himself reworked the orchestration for the published suite.|$|E

More precisely: the user <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able {{to know what it}} is that the interactive theorem prover is proving. To make these issues concrete we introduce the notion of Pollack-consistency. This property is related to a system being able to correctly parse formulas that it printed itself. In current systems it happens regularly that this fails. We argue that a good interactive theorem prover <b>should</b> <b>be</b> Pollack-consistent. We show with examples that many interactive theorem provers currently are not Pollack-consistent. Finally we describe a simple approach for making a system Pollack-consistent, which only consists of a small modification to the printing code of the system...|$|R
