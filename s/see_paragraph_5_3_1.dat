40|$|New product {{development}} forms part of PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) which {{starts with the}} idea generation phase. This first step exerts {{an enormous impact on}} the reduction of costs and could subsequently produce a high return on investment. That is the underlying motivation for this research, the goal of which is to formulate a methodology, which might be used during the idea generation phase for innovative concepts. To ensure market competitiveness companies are pushing for more efficient and innovative {{product development}}. PLM allows for a better understanding of intellectual capital and the integration of different tools and methods to lead to new opportunities. CAD (Computer Aided Design) {{plays a key role in}} PLM and NPD (New Product Development). CAD initiates with sketches developed by using geometry. The aim of this research is to create a new methodology for concept generation, which can be used in CAD environments. The methodology therefore focuses on the space field; taking inspiration from biological systems, to maximize efficiency, and from technical systems, to use innovative principles. One aim is to overcome psychological inertia, intended as an indisposition to change inscribed in the human brain. This might be achieved by abstracting the area of solutions, which enhances the capacity of forming new mental associations, overcoming habits, shortcuts and preconceived solutions. Classes of biological geometrical features have been selected, described and related to the eco-efficiency effects. In order to carry out a validity test on the chosen key-features which described as bio-inspired geometrical features, a One Tail Hypothesis Test has been formulated (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>3.</b> <b>5).</b> The experiment involves using the filters of eco-efficient parameters as established by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The first 210 patents were selected to establish whether there exists a level of correspondence which might lead to acknowledging the key features as being related with efficiency. This step has been devised as fundamental to proceed with the subsequent selection of patents (see Chapter 4). 10 couples of analogies for every feature have been selected, taking samples from the biological and technical populations (international patents) as described in Chapter 4. A reading system for each resulting pair has then been constructed. The differences of language used when comparing the functions, the similarities given by the geometrical variables, the inventive spatial principles of TRIZ and the eco-parameters of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development have all been taken into account in the design of the reading system. The current number of 70 couples serves only as a starting point and the number could be extended with representative examples, with the consequent reduction in uncertainty. The information obtained through the couples of analogies has been used to build a semantic mapping. This allows for enhanced integration with CAD and therefore in the complex product lifecycle management systems. In this way the information becomes more accessible, it can be modified, shared and used by all those involved in the diverse stages of the design process. The process involves a series of choices to be executed at every stage and in every area to create specific ontology. It is dependent on a set of concepts and the relationship which operate between concepts and domains. The resultant system of relations has been reproduced in a semantic map using Protég...|$|R

There is a need for a descriptive research to provide an {{answer to the question of}} whether rhinos as an investment are profitable or if they are a liability (Child, 2012; Ferreira, Pfab, & Knight, 2014). It is of importance for different stakeholders in rhino conservation to know if rhino conservation is a valid investment for a private game reserve in South Africa. Different income and cost factors have been researched and linked to a small rhino population. Cash flows are forecasted for five years. Scenarios of various discount rates are used to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the rhino project. The NPV, as expressed in Table 25 to Table 30 in <b>paragraph</b> <b>5.</b> <b>3,</b> clearly show that the rhino is a lost investment. The rhino is a liability for any private game reserve in South Africa. Figure 2 and Figure <b>3</b> in <b>paragraph</b> <b>5.</b> 4. 1. clearly shows the major impact the rhino horn trade can have on the NPV.

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1987 The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is firstly to determine whether factors other than study habits and attitudes influence academic achievement and secondly whether there exists a relationship between study habits and attitudes and academic achievement, {{as well as between}} the components of study habits and attitudes and academic achievement. To reach this aim a literature study was undertaken which was followed by an empirical investigation. It emerged from the literature that various factors influence academic achievement (sec chapter two) and that most writers agreed that there existed a relationship between study habits and attitudes and academic achievement as well as between the various components of study habits and attitudes and academic achievement (see chapter three). The empirical investigation made use of the information gathered in 1980 in the Orange Free State (see chapter four). All the Afrikaans speaking pupils in the Orange Free State during 1980 were included in the research program. Different measuring instruments, of which the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes, Form H, was the most important for this project, were used (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> 4. <b>5)</b> to identify a Large variety or independent variables (respectively the experimental and control variables - <b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> 4. 6) that influence academic achievement. The dependent variable for {{this research}} was the standard ten average marks as well as marks in the !allowing subjects: Afrikaans, English, Mathematics and Science (<b>see</b> <b>paragraph</b> 4. 6. 3). The BMDP-computer program (Dixon and Brown, 1979; revised 1983) was used to process the results. The different statistical techniques are described in paragraph 4. 7. A factor analysis was carried out to group the different variables according to their correlation coefficients with the standard ten average marks (sec table 5. 1). The 67 independent variables (respectively the experimental and control variables) were grouped into different factors. The 18 factors were then used as independent variables to determine their contribution R 2 (see tables 5. 2 and <b>5.</b> <b>3).</b> Next the separate and collective contribution or the components or study habits and attitudes (respectively the experimental variables) to R 2 in each or the dependent variables (respectively standard ten average, Afrikaans, English, Mathematics and Science) was determined (see tables 5. 4 and 5. 5). The results or this study can be submitted up as follows: (1) Apart from study habits and attitudes other factors influence academic achievement. (2) Study habits and attitudes contribute a statistical significant proportion or the variance in academic achievement. (3) With a few exceptions the components or study habits and attitudes do not contribute a statistical significant proportion or the variance in academic achievement. Master...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. This {{research}} project {{was conducted to}} investigate the construct of classroom culture. The fundamental {{aim of this study}} was a differential analysis on the perceptions of learners concerning classroom culture and their academic achievement. The biographical data that was investigated for this study included: gender, age, mother tongue, tuition medium, taking care of learners and course being studied. It seems necessary since the social and cultural factors are seen as important influences on the perception of learners, concerning their learning success and academic achievement, even before the enter the classroom (<b>See</b> <b>paragraphs</b> 2. 7. 1 and 2. 7. 2). Find different dimensions of classroom culture were identified for this study as to research the different perceptions of the learners. The dimensions that were utilised for this study include the following: Dimension A — Classroom Environment Dimension B — Social Relationships Dimension C — Academic Achievement Dimension D — The role of the educator or lecturer Dimension E — The role of the learner The results of the empirical research indicated that positive perceptions by learners, concerning classroom culture and their academic achievement, is a valuable attribution to the learning experiences of learners in a classroom. Some findings that may be of value to educators and education are the following: Concerning the biographical data, most learners indicated overall positive responses. The following findings are significant to this study: It is evident that older learners and female learners were more task oriented, responsible and consider time management as important (age; gender). Most learners prefer a tuition medium in which they can understand fully. They prefer to communicate well in this medium. Furthermore, they want to follow the tuition medium, especially when the lecturers explain difficult work. Learners in the Business Studies Department perceived themselves to enjoy attending their classes. It may be as a result of classrooms being fully equipped with modern technology such as computers and air-conditioning (<b>See</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>5.</b> 2. 1). It is furthermore indicated that, mother tongue and the "taking care of learners", have no statistical significant impact on the perception of learners concerning classroom culture and their academic achievement. It is significant to this study that all five dimensions concerning classroom culture indicated statistical significant differences among the groups of learners. The following findings may be of value: It is evident that a friendly, comfortable classroom environment (Dimension A) as well as co-operative classmates, who assists other learners with their learning experiences (Dimension B) contributes to positive classroom cultures. It is furthermore indicated that the role of the educator, being open, positive, approachable and supportive, enhance the academic achievement of learners (Dimension C and Dimension D). Learners perceive themselves as to be a fundamental part of classroom culture. Most learners perceive themselves as responsible learners whose academic achievement is in accordance with their potential and capabilities (Dimension C and Dimension E). Learners identify more easily with educators whose classes they enjoy. They often work hard, not to disappoint their educators. It is indicated, through this research that the perception and experiences of the life world of learners, initiate their reaction to classroom environment. It furthermore implies the intention of learners to actively assess their learning world, thus classroom culture...|$|R

Recommended features, general requirements, and how they can be implemented are treated in this section. <b>Paragraph</b> <b>5.</b> <b>3</b> describes ways of improving or extending the range of trolley carrier phone systems and pager phone systems already installed in the mine. 5. 2 New Phone System Design The task of designing an adequate communication, control, and monitoring system for an underground mine must be addressed on a system basis. In addition to insuring that effective voice communication is established, any new system should take into account present and future requirements of remote control and monitoring functions. Chapter 4 illustrated the drastic savings in response time that can be realized when remote control and monitoring are integrated into the overall communication system. The importance of including control and monitoring in the overall design plan for any system cannot be overemphasized. Because each mine is unique, and thus usually has its own special operating characteristics and communication requirements, there is no such thing as "the one best system" to meet the requirements of all mines. The optimum communication, control, and monitoring system for a mine must be one that has been tailored to meet the special requirements of that particular mine. Factors that must be considered during system design include- a. Type of mine and mining methods (low- or high-seam coal, deep hardrock mine, stope caving, longwall, room and pillar, etc.). b. Maximum number of working sections. c. Expected mine growth rate and eventual maximum size. d. Haulage methods (tracked trolley, diesel, belt, etc.). e. Underground power distribution system (dc, ac, or both). f. Features desired (two-way radio paging, private line capability for emergency use, etc.). g. Redundant or backup systems for use during outages of the normal system. Although no two mines are alike, the following items have been established as the main characteristics desired for any underground communication system: 1. Multiple Communication Paths to Outside [...] the objective here is to give all telephones a second method of communicating with the surface. 2. Audible Emergency Signaling [...] the communication system provides the main means of alerting miners during emergencies. The system should include means to broadcast distinct audible signals for emergency signaling. Initiation of these signals should probably be controlled from. a central outside point, such as a surface control room. 3. Emergency Override [...] provisions should be included to permit any conversation to be overridden with emergency communication. 4.
