40|$|This article {{studies the}} inverse {{kinematics}} {{problem of the}} variable geometry truss manipulator. The problem is cast as an optimization process which {{can be divided into}} two steps. Firstly, according to the information about the location of the end effector and fixed base, an optimal center curve and the corresponding distribution of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> along this center line are generated. This procedure is implemented by solving a non-convex optimization problem that has a quadratic objective function subject to quadratic constraints. Then, in accordance with the distribution of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> along the optimal center curve, all lengths of the actuators are calculated via the inverse kinematics of each variable geometry truss module. Hence, the approach that we present is an optimization procedure that attempts to generate the optimal <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> distribution along the optimal central curve, while the performance index and kinematic constraints are satisfied. By using the Lagrangian duality theory, a closed-form optimal solution of the original optimization is given. The numerical simulation substantiates the effectiveness of the introduced approach...|$|R
40|$|Discussed {{here are}} {{problems}} {{with the use of}} cowlings with radial air cooled engines. An XF 7 C- 1 airplane, equipped with <b>service</b> <b>cowling</b> and with narrow ring, wide ring, and exhaust collector ring cowlings over the <b>service</b> <b>cowling,</b> was used. For these four cowling conditions, the rate of climb and high speed performance were determined, the cylinder conditions were measured, and pictures to show visibility were taken. The level flight performance obtained with an engine speed of 1900 r. p. m. for the service type, the narrow ring, the wide ring, and the exhaust collector ring was 144. 4, 146. 6, 152. 8, and 155 mph, respectively. The rate of climb was practically the same for each type tested. The visibility was not materially impaired by the use of the wide or the narrow cowlings. With the narrow ring and exhaust collector ring cowlings there was an increase in cylinder temperature. However, this increase was not enough to affect the performance of the engine. The use of an exhaust collector ring incorporated into the cowling is practical where the problem of visibility does not enter...|$|R

This deliverable describes the intermediate evaluation of the COBACORE platform. This evaluation was held on the 11 th and 12 th of June 2014 in Rotterdam. Thirty-seven individuals participated in this evaluation. Representatives from the Safety Region of Rotterdam Rijnmond, the Municipality of Rotterdam and the Netherlands and German Red Cross participated as professional users of the COBACORE platform. Students of the Hague University of Applied Sciences, UNESCO – IHE and Tilburg University participated as both affected and responding community members. This deliverable provides an introduction to the evaluation of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> with the research questions and hypotheses in Chapter 1, an extensive description of the method and simulation environment that was used in Chapter 2, followed by a chapter on the outcome of the experiment, conclusions and recommendations in chapter 3.

50|$|The line commences at the Illawarra Junction {{south of}} Redfern station, the {{junction}} {{point of the}} Illawarra railway line. The line consists of three pairs of electrified tracks, six in total, which head west through the Inner Western suburbs of Sydney to Strathfield. The tracks are named 'Up' and 'Down' Main', 'Up' and 'Down' Suburban, and 'Up' and 'Down' Local. The 'Main' lines are express lines which have no <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> between Redfern and Strathfield, and usually carry Intercity, Interstate, Heritage, or express suburban trains. The inner 'Suburban' pair of tracks have some <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> and generally carry express or limited stops suburban train services (usually North Shore, Northern & Western Line suburban services). The southernmost 'Local' pair of tracks have <b>platforms</b> at all <b>intermediate</b> stations and carry all-stations and some limited stops services (usually Airport, Inner West & South Line suburban services).|$|R

50|$|Between 2004 and 2005 the {{platforms}} at {{the station}} underwent extensive modernisation.

These intermediate-sized cars used the same basic chassis as the original Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet compacts, but were stretched with longer wheelbases. The previous generation Comet shared its platform with the all-new Ford Mustang in 1964, and when the Comet graduated to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform,</b> the Mercury Cougar became the platform shared with the Mustang.|$|R

50|$|For the 1979 model year, {{the success}} found by GM and the {{upcoming}} introduction of smaller full-size cars by Ford necessitated {{a response from}} Chrysler.

Unable {{to develop a new}} design from the ground up, Chrysler was relegated to reworking its existing 1962-1978 <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform.</b> The R-series wore comparable dimensions as its Ford and General Motors competition. By the end of the 1981 model year, poor sales of all four R-body cars (Newport/New Yorker/Gran Fury/St. Regis) outside of fleet markets forced its discontinuation.|$|R

2500|$|The new intermediate-based 1969 Grand Prix {{began to}} take shape in April 1967, with a few {{prototype}} models built on the full-sized Pontiac platform before the G-Body was ready. To save both development costs and time in much the same manner Ford created the original 1964 Mustang using the basic chassis and drivetrain from the compact Falcon, the revised Grand Prix would have a unique bodyshell but share the A-body <b>intermediate</b> <b>platform</b> and mechanicals with the Tempest, Le Mans and GTO. This reduced development time from the usual 36months required for a new model to less than 18, allowing Pontiac to concentrate upgrading styling and interior appointments.|$|R
50|$|No {{information}} can be given on the station’s original tracks and platforms. After the expansion around 1909, the station had two <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms.</b> The passengers {{had access to the}} island platforms via an underpass. The baggage was carried in a luggage transfer tunnel under the main tracks. There was access to the underpass and the luggage lift at the entrance building. The remains of the entrances to the island platforms can still to be seen on the railway side of the station building. The station originally did not have a platform next to the station building and the tracks next the station building were used for bank engines and for access to the goods shed.|$|R

There was a run-round loop, 450 feet in length, and a dead-end dock siding at the terminal end. The brickwork of the dock is still visible near the large quarry, from which the stone for the many fine buildings in the town was taken. A siding turned away towards the river bank rising on an embankment thence to trestling crossing over the extension of Steamer Street and terminating in coal staiths at the Queen's Wharf.|$|R

30|$|In general, {{hierarchical}} {{structures are}} more prevalent among the providers than <b>intermediate</b> <b>platforms</b> [37]. This {{could possibly be}} linked to the reach/ scope hypothesis touched upon in Sect.  3.3. A possible explanation may be, considering that the data market is mainly a B 2 B market, that hierarchical relationships are easier to implement which is a favorable feature in a B 2 B market. Also, private customers tend to have a lower willingness to pay for data [25]. The observations hint that the data market is developing towards a mainstream market also targeting non-technical companies and users: a high number of providers offer several access possibilities but limit the number of data formats. The restriction to mostly standard formats such as reports or CSV files probably aims to reduce the presuppositions for data usage.|$|R
