25|$|The {{decision}} to make the game online-only was {{based in part on}} the success of Age of Empires II and the popularity of its online integration with MSN Gaming Zone. Since online player interaction through the game was made a priority by the studio, two iterations of the game had to be created; a <b>server</b> <b>version</b> and a client version. This resulted in a heavily modified version of the BANG engine used in previous games of the series, along with requiring large amounts of additional server code and infrastructure to be implemented. Excluding the tools, Age of Empires Online contains over 1.2 million lines of code.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft Windows {{was first}} {{released}} in 1985, as an operating environment running {{on top of}} MS-DOS, which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time. In 1995, Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstrap. For backwards compatibility, Win9x could run real-mode MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows 3.x drivers. Windows ME, released in 2000, was the last version in the Win9x family. Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel. Current client versions of Windows run on IA-32, x86-64 and 32-bit ARM microprocessors. In addition Itanium is still supported in older <b>server</b> <b>version</b> Windows Server 2008 R2. In the past, Windows NT supported additional architectures.|$|E

Support for Internet Explorer 8 is bound to the lifecycle of the Windows version it is installed on as it is considered an OS component, thus it is unsupported on Windows XP due {{to the end of}} extended support for the latter in April 2014. Effective January 12, 2016, Internet Explorer 8 is no longer supported on any client or <b>server</b> <b>version</b> of Windows, due to new policies specifying that only the newest version of IE available for a supported version of Windows will be supported.

2500|$|A stack-based buffer {{overflow}} exploit was discovered and a patch is available as of December 19, 2014. This includes all NTP Version 4 releases before version 4.2.8.

In the case of version 10.6.8 there are manual fixes for the <b>server</b> <b>version,</b> and normal [...] "client" [...] users can just turn off automatic time updating in System Preferences for Date & Time. Researchers believe that the protocol design is excellent and that the flaws are appearing in implementations of the protocol. [...] Some errors are basic, such as a missing return statement in a routine, {{that can lead to}} unlimited access to systems that are running some versions of NTP in the root daemon. [...] Systems that do not use the root daemon, such as BSD, are not subject to this flaw.|$|E
