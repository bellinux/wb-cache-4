25|$|Coupling {{nucleic acids}} with {{proteins}} in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of hypercycle with translation demanded the proper {{model for the}} origin of translation code as {{a necessary condition for}} the origin of hypercycle organization. At the time of hypercycle theory formulation, two models for the origin of translation code were proposed by Crick and his collaborators. These were models stating that the first codons were constructed according to either an RRY or an RNY scheme, in which R stands for the purine base, Y for pyrimidine, and N for any base, with the latter assumed to be more reliable. Nowadays, it is assumed that the hypercycle model could be realized by utilization of ribozymes without the need for a hypercycle with translation, and there are many more theories about the origin of the genetic code.|$|E
25|$|When an {{individual}} tries to suppress thoughts under a high cognitive load, {{the frequency of}} those thoughts increases and becomes more accessible than before. Evidence shows that people can prevent their thoughts from being translated into behavior when self-monitoring is high; this {{does not apply to}} automatic behaviors though, and may result in latent, unconscious actions. This phenomenon is made paradoxically worse by increasing the amount of distractions a person has, although the experiments in this area can be criticized for using impersonal concurrent tasks, {{which may or may not}} properly reflect natural processes or individual differences. Ironic process theory is one cognitive model that can explain the paradoxical effect seen above. However, given the mixed evidence and commensurate with the latest research, it is suggested that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> needs to account for individual differences.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{analysis}} of coastal hazards, the features of extreme waves are determining information to question the impact of storms to the coast. The spatial behaviour of extreme waves is even more valuable especially since it is sparsely provided. Regarding recent applications in other contexts, a kind of statistical models called max-stable processes is relevant for modelling spatial extreme events. Max-stable processes are extensions of the well-known Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Unlike univariate approaches, max-stable processes consider spatial dependence of <b>a</b> phenomenon. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>modelling</b> also overtakes <b>a</b> standard multivariate approach by providing information continuously over the area studied, even where no observation is available.

25|$|This {{approach}} requires building {{a model of}} the underlying index, i.e. the one upon which the derivative value is determined (for example monthly/seasonal cumulative heating degree days). The simplest way to model the index is just to model the distribution of historical index outcomes. We can adopt parametric or non-parametric distributions. For monthly cooling and heating degree days, assuming a normal distribution is usually warranted. The predictive power of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> is rather limited. A better result can be obtained by modelling the index generating process on a finer scale. In the case of temperature contracts, {{a model of the}} daily average (or min and max) temperature time series can be built. The daily temperature (or rain, snow, wind, etc.) model can be built using common statistical time series models (i.e. ARMA or Fourier transform in the frequency domain) purely based only on the features displayed in the historical time series of the index. A more sophisticated approach is to incorporate some physical intuition/relationships into our statistical models based on spatial and temporal correlation between weather occurring {{in various parts of the}} ocean-atmosphere system around the world (for example, we can incorporate the effects of El Niño on temperatures and rainfall).|$|E
