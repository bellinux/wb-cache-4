5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} <b>sexual</b> <b>transmission</b> of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|HIV can infect {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, {{but another}} route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN {{can also be}} used. DCs {{are one of the}} first cells encountered by the virus during <b>sexual</b> <b>transmission.</b> They are currently thought {{to play an important role}} by transmitting HIV to T-cells when the virus is captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.|$|E

In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E

40|$|America has {{a serious}} sexual problem. The sexual {{practices}} of {{a small percentage of}} Americans has created an unprecedented disease rate that is costing the American public about $ 20 billion per year. Lawsuits seeking damages for <b>sexual</b> disease <b>transmission</b> are on the rise, yet current sex tort law is mired with anti-heartbalm sentiment, is unpredictable, and is failing as a tool of deterrence, compensation, and education. This Article discusses the gravity of the sexual disease crisis, part of which is the public’s incredible ignorance about the rate of sexual disease, and tort law’s failure to do its part to help educate the public and deter irresponsible sexual behavior. This Article concludes that, based on the high degree of risk involved in irresponsible sex, and the problems created by the current negligence-based analytical paradigm, strict liability for <b>sexual</b> disease <b>transmission</b> should be adopted. Strict liability would deter <b>sexual</b> disease <b>transmission,</b> and educate the public about the sexual disease epidemic, more effectively than negligence...|$|R

25|$|First, {{there is}} an extreme {{bottleneck}} in viral diversity {{at the time of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>transmission.</b> Second, transmission tends to occur early in infection before immune selection has had a chance to operate. Finally, the replicative fitness of a viral strain (measured in transmissions per host) is largely extrinsic to virological factors, depending more heavily on behaviors in the host population. These include heterogeneous sexual and drug-use behaviors.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} way to prevent <b>sexual</b> <b>transmission</b> of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: cybersex, phonesex or masturbation from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom.|$|E

25|$|Although most HIV-infected {{individuals}} in China are drug users, patients infected through <b>sexual</b> <b>transmission</b> are {{the fastest growing}} group, accounting for close to 50% of new infections in 2005. Overall, they represent 43.6% of total HIV/AIDS cases, including commercial sex workers or their clients (19.6%), partners of HIV-infected individuals (16.7%), and {{men who have sex}} with men (7.3%). As with drug use, sexuality is not openly discussed in Chinese society and is therefore neither easily targeted by health promotion campaigns, nor has it traditionally been taught in schools. Even among university students, levels of AIDS knowledge and risk perception are alarmingly low. On the other hand, attitudes towards sex are becoming increasingly more liberal and, as a result, premarital and extramarital sex are more commonly practiced. Although they are widely available, condoms are rarely used.|$|E
25|$|Regular active surveillance, {{involving}} {{detection and}} prompt treatment of new infections, and tsetse fly control is {{the backbone of}} the strategy used to control sleeping sickness. Systematic screening of at-risk communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant patients with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis. Systematic screening allows early-stage disease to be detected and treated before the disease progresses, and removes the potential human reservoir. A single case of <b>sexual</b> <b>transmission</b> of West African sleeping sickness has been reported.|$|E

40|$|The Demographic and Health Surveys from Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Malawi {{reveal that}} a {{significant}} proportion of HIV infections in adolescent women occurred in women who claim to be virgin. Two possible conclusions arise from this observation: adolescent women misreport sexual status or non-sexual risk is more relevant than previously asserted. This paper uses a nonparametric model to estimate the proportion of HIV infections associated with sexual activity under different assumptions on data accuracy. It shows that there is an inverse relation between data accuracy and importance of <b>sexual</b> HIV <b>transmission.</b> If all adolescent women in the considered sub-sample correctly report sexual activity, 70 % of HIV infections cannot be attributed to <b>sexual</b> HIV <b>transmission.</b> The model predicts that more than 95 % of HIV infections are due to sexual HIV infections, if a substantial proportion of self-reported virgins (between 40 and 90 %) misreport sexual status.

25|$|China's first AIDS {{case was}} {{identified}} in 1985 in a dying tourist. In 1989, the first indigenous cases {{were reported as}} an outbreak in 146 infected heroin users in Yunnan province, near China's southwest border. Between 1989 and the mid-1990s, HIV spread steadily from Yunnan into neighboring areas and along the major drug trafficking routes, then from injecting drug users (IDUs) to their sexual partners and children. In the mid-1990s, the occurrence of a second major outbreak in commercial plasma donors in the east-central provinces became apparent. Plasma donors were paid to donate blood, the plasma removed, then the red blood cells reinfused to prevent anaemia. Reuse of tubing and mixing during collection and reinfusion led to thousands of new infections. At the same time, HIV was also spreading through <b>sexual</b> <b>transmission.</b> By 1998, HIV had reached all 31 provinces and was in a phase of exponential growth, which, by 2005, had culminated in an estimated 650,000 infections.|$|E

The rate of transmission in the 3 studies confirming virologic suppression was 0 per 100 person-years (95 % CI =  0 - 0. 05), with low heterogeneity (I(2)  =  0 %). When we included the 3 studies that did not confirm virologic suppression, the rate of transmission was 0. 14 per 100 person-years (95 %CI =  0. 04 - 0. 31) (I(2)  =  0 %). In a sensitivity analysis including all 6 studies, the rate of transmission was 0 per 100 person-years (95 %CI =  0 - 0. 01) after omitting all transmissions with known detectable or unconfirmed viral loads, as full suppression in these cases was unlikely.
