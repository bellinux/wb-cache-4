40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to detect the morphological, histological and molecular diff erences in the second generation of the PVS 2 cryopreserved Dendrobium Bobby Messina [DBM] (18 months old culture) plantlets. Morphological analyses indicated that similarities and diff erences in cryopreserved DBM plantlets comparing to control <b>stock</b> <b>culture</b> based on selected morphological criteria. Morphological criteria, such as root length, number of shoot per explant and shoot length displayed diff erences, while the other three criteria, leaf diameter, leaf length and PLBs size were similar in cryopreserved compared to the control <b>stock</b> <b>culture</b> plant. Higher amount of homogenous cell population and denser cytoplasm were observed in cryopreserved PLBs compared to control <b>stock</b> <b>culture</b> PLBs based on histological analysis. This suggests the existance of somatic embryogenesis development mechanism taking place during the recovery and regeneration of the cryopreserved PLBs.

40|$|The heat resistance, {{fermentation}} reactions, nutritional requirements, and phage {{sensitivity of}} 18 selected morphological variants of Bacillus stearothermophilus NCA 1518 were studied.

Maintenance of bacteria at - 80 °C gave statistically higher recovery rates compared to preservation at - 20 °C with the values of 8. 55, 8. 24, 8. 59, 8. 66, 8. 01 and 0. 0 log CFU/ml for these above mentioned <b>stock</b> <b>cultures.</b> The <b>stock</b> <b>cultures</b> supplemented with glycerol+sucrose and glycerol showed the highest recovery rates, 7. 99 and 7. 93 for - 20 °C vs. 8. 66 and 8. 59 for - 80 °C respectively, which were statistically different from the others.

However, S 1 did not support he replication of the RNA- 2 from lucerne transient streak virus (LTSV). The possible interaction of the RNA- 2 species from LTSV and SNMV with the genomes of other plant viruses was tested by mixing the RNA- 2 species with nucleic acid from 11 other viruses.

Beetles were fed Eucalyptus nitens (H.
