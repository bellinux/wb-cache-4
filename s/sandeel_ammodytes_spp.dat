A 2007 {{study showed}} that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.),</b> Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while sandeel's importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.|$|E

Food {{shortage}} and predation {{are the main}} factors limiting the breeding success of many colonial seabirds. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether they influence breeding success of Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea in a colony of 99 breeding pairs at Kaldbaksbotnur on the island of Streymoy, Faroe Islands. In 2003, we investigated clutch size, hatching success, food provisioning to chicks, kleptoparasitism, and predation, and the number of fledged chicks. Clutch size was on average 1. 65 (± 0. 48) eggs/clutch with a hatching success of 100 %. Food provisioning rates were low with 0. 47 (± 0. 18) feeds per nest per hour. Most prey items were small (c. 32 mm long), and terns showed high rates of intraspecific kleptoparasitism. Attacks by avian predators were occasionally observed, mainly by Herring Gulls Larus argentatus, but were unsuccessful in all observed cases. Counts of fledged chicks indicated average breeding productivity of 0. 22 chicks per pair. Our results suggest that breeding success in this colony was mainly affected by food shortage, possibly limited <b>sandeel</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.</b> availability. Predation appears to be less important, but could occur at a low rate. The results are consistent with recent evidence showing that seabirds that feed on sandeels currently have limited breeding success in the orth Atlantic region...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystem-based fishery {{management}} (EBFM) requires taking account of indirect effects (such as habitat destruction, incidental mortality, and {{competition between the}} fishery and marine mammals or birds) and dealing with non-commensurate values (such as yield from the fishery and production of offspring by the birds or mammals competing for the same resource). The perspective of EBFM requires {{that the rate of}} fishing mortality is less than the value that provides maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but the question is how far below this level should the fishery operate[glottal stop] For this problem in multiobjective programming, simple method of solution was developed and illustrated with the fishery for <b>sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> in the Shetland Islands. The yield from the fishery at a given fishing mortality F is scaled by MSY (so that this quantity increases as fishing mortality increases from 0 to that giving MSY) and the breeding success of predators (black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla and Arctic terns Sterna paradisaea) at a given fishing mortality is scaled by that in the absence of fishing. The result is two non-dimensional quantities that can be combined into a single value function, which can then be explored or optimized. It is shown that a reduction of only about 20 percent in yield can nearly double the breeding performance of the more sensitive predator. Extensions of the method are discussed; these include the use of maximum economic yield (MEY) and state dependent life history, as implemented by stochastic dynamic programming.

40|$|Life history theory {{predicts that}} seabirds {{will respond to}} {{reduction}} in food abundance by changes in behaviour or breeding effort, buffering adult survival. Empirical data show some support for this but also sometimes indicate a trade-off in which survival of breeding seabirds may be reduced by food shortage. The sensitivity of seabird adult survival rates may be {{a feature of the}} detailed ecology of particular species and may be affected by ecological conditions such as the possibilities for prey switching. Fishery managers may set a lower limit biomass to protect fish stock recruitment, often at about 20 % of predicted unfished stock biomass. It is unclear whether this threshold would also protect the needs of seabirds dependent on the fish stock. Time series of seabird breeding success and fish stock biomass may indicate minimum densities of food required. These are orders of magnitude more than the consumption by seabird populations. The critical prey density may also vary tremendously among seabird species and is clearly a function of the detailed ecology of each species. It is possible to predict which species will be most sensitive to reduced food supply. Sensitive species may be sentinels of the "health'' of the marine ecosystem. For example, in Shetland and elsewhere in the North Sea, breeding success of kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla is particularly sensitive to abundance and quality of <b>sandeels</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.</b> However, seabird communities may be affected by a variety of interactions prompted by changes in fisheries; maintaining food fish levels may not alone be sufficient where communities have altered in composition over decades of fishing, as in the North Sea, and where predator-prey impacts induced by changes in fishery management may disrupt seabird communitie...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{abstract}} Marine {{ecosystems are}} changing rapidly {{in response to}} anthropogenic and environmental stresses, and seabird populations that depend on marine resources are in decline {{in many areas of}} the world. Iceland supports internationally important populations of many seabird species and, although fishing pressures in Icelandic waters are relatively low, the impacts of current climatic and oceanic changes are predicted to be particularly severe at high latitudes, including Iceland. However, little is known about the current status and demography of Icelandic seabird populations. In this thesis, I explore the breeding demography of Arctic Terns, Sterna paradisaea, at colonies throughout the W and NE of Iceland, between 2008 and 2011. Although Arctic Tern productivity varied among colonies, it was generally low in both regions, primarily because of very low chick survival rates. Low chick survival was primarily a consequence of low growth rates throughout the pre-fledging period, and the application of forensic ecology techniques showed that chick mortality occurred throughout each breeding season and at all ages. Prey composition and prey delivery rates varied regionally and among colonies. The main high quality marine prey are <b>sandeels,</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.,</b> In W-Iceland and capelin, Mallotus villosus, in NE-Iceland, but non-marine prey of low nutritive value comprised a large proportion of chick diet in both regions. While productivity in W-Iceland increased with prey delivery rates, in NE-Iceland prey delivery was either inconsistent or low in quality, and productivity was always low. A suite of changes in marine prey communities appears to be impacting Icelandic Arctic Terns. These may include fishing impacts on capelin abundance and/or oceanic and climatic influences on the abundance and availability of sandeels, which are not fished in Iceland. These changes may also be impacting other seabird species in Iceland, for which there is also some evidence of recent low productivity...|$|R
40|$|Effective species {{conservation}} and management requires information on species distribution patterns, which is challenging for highly mobile and cryptic species that {{may be subject to}} multiple anthropogenic stressors across international boundaries. Understanding species-habitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005 - 2013) by means of dedicated line-transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156, 630 km of on-effort survey data with 14, 356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for "season," allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-scale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea. </p...|$|E

40|$|The tilt angle, i. e., {{the angle}} from {{horizontal}} {{made by the}} fish body as its head dives down or up, affects the readings on fish echo soundings. We measured the tilt angle of Japanese <b>sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> personatus Girard) in a water tank, and calculated the acoustic target strength (TS) using a theoretical scattering model. This study examined the TS of sandeels from the northern coast of Hokkaido, which have a larger body size than those in other regions in Japan. TS values for sandeels, a swimbladderless fish, were estimated using a distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) model at two frequencies: 38 and 120 kHz. The mean tilt angle was 20. 4 ?? (S.

The regression equations of the average TS values were TS 38 kHz = 8. 2 log 10 SL ??? 74. 2 and TS 120 kHz = 20. 9 log 10 SL ??? 92. 6, respectively. At 120 kHz, the slope was close to 20, suggesting that the acoustic backscattering strength was proportional to the square of the body length. This value was smaller at 38 kHz, suggesting that the acoustic backscattering strength was stable to differences in body length. We obtained a small discrepancy for both frequencies (??TS = TS 120 kHz???TS 38 kHz) were TS 120 kHz < TS 38 kHz.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a decline in both size and the {{geographical}} distribution of the sandeel stock. The decline has been particularly profound in the Norwegian economic zone where the sandeel play an important part {{not only in terms of}} economic interests, but also in transferring energy from the planktonic society to the higher trophic levels. If there are not enough copepods to feed on, the sandeel along with several other animals would lose its basis of existence. As a part of the IMR SMASSC (Survey methods for abundance estimation of <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> marinus) stocks) project it was decided to develop methods for acoustic identification and abundance estimation of copepods. This was done by comparing biological samples to acoustic abundance estimates using multi frequency methods with the operating frequencies 18, 38, 120 and 200 kHz collected in 2010. These data were to be compared with data collected in 2009 with six operating frequencies 18, 38, 70, 120, 200 and 333 kHz. Results from these studies indicate that 333 kHz is required in most cases to identify copepods, and that the copepod distribution is far too heterogeneous for biological net samples alone to be reliable. Acoustic methods are better suited for mapping geographical distribution of copepods and may also be better suited for abundance estimation of copepods than the time consuming net sampling methods. In addition, <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodyte</b> marinus) digestion rate and gastric evacuation rate were monitored in a tankt.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{a common}} problem in {{ecosystem}} studies that information about predation on fish larvae is extremely sparse. There is little information about agents of mortality. This {{is likely to be}} because fish larvae are digested very rap-idly in a predator’s stomach. This study describes controlled experiments designed to evaluate the potential role of small low-trophic level fishes as predators on pelagic fish larvae. The study shows that <b>sandeels,</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> marinus, prefer herring larvae to copepods, their normal food items. When herring larvae are available the sandeels change behavior, their swimming speed increases drastically, and copepods are almost totally excluded from the diet. Once eaten, the herring larvae are only identifiable in the sandeel guts for 15 - 30 minutes using morphological criteria. It is concluded that abun-dant low-trophic level fishes potentially may have considerable impact on other fish species, even those that are normally not assumed to be predators on the low-trophic level fishes themselves...|$|R

40|$|The current {{assessment}} of lesser <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> marinus) in the North Sea assumes a single stock and a knife-edge maturity ogive.

Surveys in 1999 indicated pronounced regional differences in length- and weight-at-age, implying a disparity in growth rate across the North Sea. Logistic regression revealed that the onset of maturity was significantly related to regional distribution, in addition to length and age, with a tendency for fish off the UK’s northeast coast to mature later and smaller than elsewhere. No significant effect of year on either growth or length-at-maturity was revealed from a comparison with other data collected in 2004.

The findings {{of the present study}} supported both hypotheses and resulted in a multiple linear recruitment model with pronounced predictive capabilities. The model includes interactions between age- 1 abundance and spawning stock biomass, plus the effect of C. finmarchicus abundance, and it explained around 65 % of the inter-annual variation in recruitment in contrast to only 12 % by a traditional Ricker curve. We argue that early egg production in C. finmarchicus supports the survival of larvae, and that climate-generated shifts in the Calanus species composition lead to a mismatch in timing between food availability and the early life history of lesser sandeels...|$|R

Breeding success of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a species that has declined in recent decades, was related to abundance of both 1 + group (the age class targeted by the fishery) and 0 group sandeels. The proportion of 0 group consumed by kittiwakes and proportion of the kittiwake population foraging in the area were linked to 0 group abundance. None of these parameters in the other seabird species were associated with sandeel abundance. Our results suggest that fishery closure can have a beneficial impact on top predators sensitive to variation in abundance of the target species, although environmental conditions before and after closure {{are also likely to}} be critically important...|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} that {{discards}} from commercial fisheries are a key food resource for many seabird species around the world(1 - 8). But predicting the response of seabird communities to changes in discard rates is problematic and requires historical data to elucidate the confounding effects of other, more 'natural' ecological processes. In the North Sea, declining stocks, changes in technical measures, changes in population structure(9) {{and the establishment of}} a recovery programme for cod (Gadus morhua(10)) will alter the amount of fish discarded. This region also supports internationally important populations of seabirds(11), some of which feed extensively, but facultatively, on discards, in particular on undersized haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) (1 - 3). Here we use long-term data sets from the northern North Sea to show that there is a direct link between discard availability and discard use by a generalist predator and scavenger-the great skua (Stercorarius skua). Reduced rates of discarding, particularly when coupled with reduced availability of small shoaling pelagic fish such as <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> marinus), result in an increase in predation by great skuas on other birds. This switching of prey by a facultative scavenger presents a potentially serious threat to some seabird communities...|$|R
40|$|Life-history theory {{predicts a}} {{tradeoff}} in resource allocation between early maturation and growth in species which exhibit indeterminate growth. However, since life-history models {{assume that the}} fitness payoff of each developmental strategy at completion is known, {{they are unable to}} encapsulate the mechanics by which maturation is controlled under natural conditions. To determine the proximate conditions which influence variation in reproductive investment, we recorded somatic growth, sexual maturation and fecundity in individually marked first-time maturing lesser <b>sandeels</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> marinus. Cytological investigation revealed that the transition in gonad development from primary to secondary stages occurred between June and August in both sexes. Using logistical regression, variation in maturation could be attributed to both initial weight and observed differences in resource accrual during this period, suggesting that if growth prior to this period is inadequate in smaller fish then maturation remains inhibited. For those females that did mature, potential fecundity positively correlated with final body size. Our findings indicate that small changes in the timing of the availability of their zooplankton prey could explain the large regional variability in maturity at age exhibited by sandeels in the fiel...|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian {{population}} of the Common Guillemot Uria aalge has declined by > 95 % since the 1960 s, and is classified as critically endangered in the Norwegian Red List. Much of the recent decline {{has been attributed to}} reduced food availability, but without extensive documentation of adult diet. Instead, chick diet has been considered a proxy of adult diet during the breeding season in many Norwegian studies. Central place foraging theory, especially for single-prey loaders, however, predicts that this may not be so and this study compares directly the diet of adult and chick Common Guillemots during the breeding season at a colony in NE Norway. Whereas chicks were fed mainly capelin (Mallotus villosus) and <b>sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> sp.), most of the adult diet consisted of the two youngest year classes of Gadidae, probably cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). A successful ecosystem management of seabirds is dependent on a full understanding of how prey quality, abundance and availability influence seabird populations and their viability such that knowing the true diet of adult Common Guillemots has important implications in the modelling and management of the Norwegian populations...|$|R
40|$|Sandeel display strong site-fidelity, {{and spend}} most of their life buried in the seabed. This {{strategy}} carries important ecological implications. Sandeels save energy when they are not foraging but in return are unable to move substantially and therefore possibly are sensitive to local depletion of prey. Here we studied zooplankton consumption and energy conversion efficiency of lesser <b>sandeel</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> marinus) in the central North Sea, using stomach data, length and weight-at-age data, bioenergetics, and hydrodynamic modeling. The results suggested: (i) lesser sandeel in the Dogger area depend largely on relatively large copepods in early spring. (ii) lesser sandeel is an efficient converter making secondary production into fish tissue available for higher trophic levels. Hence, changes in species composition towards a more herring dominated system, as seen in recent times, may lead to a decrease in system transfer efficiency. (iii) sandeels leave footprints in the standing copepod biomass as far as 100 km from the edge of their habitat, but smaller and more isolated sandeel habitat patches have a much lower impact than larger patches, suggesting that smaller habitats can sustain higher sandeel densities and growth rates per area than larger habitats...|$|R
40|$|Most {{mortality}} of Atlantic Puffins occurs outside the breeding season but {{little is known}} about the species’ diet at that time. The stomach contents of 176 Puffins shot legally for food around the Faroe Islands between October and January in three winters were examined. The remains of 20 species of fish, six species of crustacea and single species of polychaete, chaetognathid and squid were identified. The most frequently recorded prey in terms of frequency of occurrence were 0 group (< 1 year old) Lesser <b>Sandeel</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> marinus (82 % of stomachs), followed by mesopelagic fish (52 %), nereid worms (41 %), Silver Rockling Gaidropsarus argentatus (36 %), crustacea (35 %), large sandeel (32 %) and other large fish (32 %). In terms of calculated biomass, nereids (41 %), large sandeel (23 %) and other large fish (17 %) made up the bulk of the diet but the latter two prey types were most important in energetic terms (46 % despite accounting for only 9 % of items). Stomach contents collected on the same day and location were significantly more similar than those collected on different dates and locations, suggesting that during the winter, Puffins are generalists, taking any prey they encounter...|$|R
40|$|Intense fishing of a {{stock of}} <b>sandeels</b> (<b>Ammodytes</b> marinus) on the sand banks off the Firth of Forth, {{northeast}} Scotland, during the 1990 s led {{to a decline in}} catch per unit effort to uneconomic levels and collateral failures of piscivorous seabird breeding success at nearby colonies. A prohibition on fishing in 1999 was followed by a short-term recovery of stock biomass, but then a sustained decline to very low levels of abundance. Demographic survey data show that despite the decline in stock, recruit abundance was maintained implying an increasing larval survival rate, and that the stock decline was not due to recruitment failure. To verify this hypothesis we analysed a 10 -year long data set of weekly catches of sandeel larvae at a nearby plankton monitoring site to determine the patterns of larval mortality and dispersal. We found that the loss rate of larvae up to 20 d age decreased over time, corresponding with the trend in survival rate implied by the stock demography data. The pattern of loss rate in relation to hatchling abundance implied that mortality may have been density dependent. Our study rules out increased larval mortality as the primary cause of decline in the sandeel stock...|$|R
40|$|Sound-speed {{and density}} {{contrasts}} (h and g, respectively), important acoustic material properties, of Japanese <b>sandeel</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> personatus were measured to estimate theoretical target strength (TS). The measured sound-speed contrast of adult fish varied between 1. 016 and 1. 023 (mean, 1. 020), which showed temperature dependence. The measured density contrast differed significantly between juvenile and adult. The density contrast of juvenile varied between 1. 017 and 1. 024 (1. 021), {{and that of}} adult varied between 1. 026 and 1. 038 (1. 032). Using these results, TS at 38 and 120 kHz in the fishing season were estimated by an empirical sound scattering model. TS of an individual fish varied significantly with change of tilt angle. TS of near-dorsal aspect (TSmax) and tilt-averaged TS (TSave) differed up to 7 dB. At both frequencies, two different TSave-length relationships (TSave = a log L + b) were obtained for adult and juvenile. The coefficients of log L of adult were close to 20, suggesting that backscattering strength was proportional to the square of body length. These values were larger in juvenile (34. 0 at 120 kHz, 56. 5 at 38 kHz), suggesting that backscattering strength varied drastically with the cube or fifth power of body length...|$|R
40|$|Lesser <b>sandeels</b> <b>Ammodytes</b> marinus are {{eaten by}} {{a range of}} predatory fishes {{including}} commercially fished species, but are also exploited at large scale by industrial fisheries. Is availability of sandeels, as key prey source, linked to the body condition of predatory fishes? In the North Sea, the largest sandeel biomass is concentrated in the Dogger Bank region. Here we studied predator-sandeel interactions at two sites differing widely in sandeel abundance and local sandeel fishing effort. Surveys took place in 2004, 2005, and 2006, years when local sandeel densities observed at these sites were low, intermediate, and high, respectively. Five predator species [...] whiting, lesser weever, grey gurnard, plaice, and haddock [...] showed better body condition indices in either the years or study area (or both) characterised by higher local sandeel densities, when compared to sandeel-poorer conditions. Moreover, whiting, weever, and gurnard condition was better for those individuals actually observed to have eaten sandeels (based on stomach contents) than for those that had not. As body condition relates to growth, reproduction, and survival, predators in sandeel-rich conditions may be inferred {{to have a higher}} fitness. These links between sandeel availability, sandeel consumption, and predator condition hint that, if large-scale localised depletions of sandeels were to occur, negative indirect effects on predatory fish might become apparent, underlining the importance of considering the sandeel fishery in an ecosystem context. © 2012 Crown Copyright...|$|R
