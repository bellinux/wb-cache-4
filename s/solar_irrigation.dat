Solar pump offers a clean and simple alternative to the conventional fuel fired engine or grid electricity driven pump in this regard to resolve the issue. In this paper, the techno-economic analyses of <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> plants installed in Bangladesh are evaluated.   It was observed that systems were running around 70 % to 80 % of the rated power which was quite acceptable. A 10 hp pump was able to pump 600 liter of water per minute which was also satisfactory to irrigate the land. Average operating time {{was found to be}} 8 hour/day. It was found that the overall efficiency of the systems were in between 11. 39 % to 16. 52 % whereas the typical average value of lit/Wp/year was 9200. On the other hand, the cost of irrigation to cultivate paddy in 0. 161 hectares’ land for one season was 1, 750 BDT by <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> which was found to be lower than that of other available modes. This charge for grid electricity based irrigation was about 3, 000 to 3500 BDT per 0. 161 hectares’ and 2, 300 to 2, 600 BDT per 0. 161 hectares’ for diesel engine based irrigation. According to the current financial scheme (15 % equity investment, 35 % credit support and remaining 50 % from government through IDCOL) the average value of payback period was 5. 43 years, NPV in the range from 7 to 15 % and IRR was 18 %. By considering 100 % equity investment, however, these projects were not economically attractive. The payback period for this case was about 18 years. Study also revealed that each <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> plant reduces 42. 8 kg of CO 2 emission per day compare to diesel engine operated pump and 2566. 24 kg/day compared to grid electricity operated pump.

Aggressive promotion of solar pumps in groundwater abundant Eastern India has the potential to catalyze an ever-green revolution there. The same strategy in Western and Southern India, however, can increase the stress on depleted groundwater resources because solar pump owners face near-zero marginal cost of groundwater.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> pump is {{this type}} of device which uses solar energy for water pumping. Water pumping is an energy {{intensive}} activity and consumes a large amount man power, diesel and electricity. Smallholder farmers in low income countries can benefit from affordable irrigation pump systems as they enable cultivation of high value crops during dry season. Currently the majority of small irrigation pumps are manually operated which is time consuming and requires {{a high level of}} physical exertion. There is a potential market for a low cost solar thermal pump that produces a high volume of water as well as reducing the labour burden. This will allow more crops to be grown and free up time for other productive tasks. Compared to the existing manual systems, many hours could be saved each day through reduced labour input...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture is a {{significant}} measure of an economy {{for a number of}} countries in the world. Currently, the agriculture sector relies heavily on conventional sources of energy for irrigation and other purposes. When, considering factors such as increasing costs of fossil fuels and extending new power lines, especially to remote locations where grid electricity is either inaccessible or expensive, a solar PV (photovoltaic) irrigation system can be an effective choice for irrigating farmland. Solar power eliminates the need to run electrical power lines to remote agriculture locations, which quickly turns the monetary equation in favor of <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> over grid-powered irrigation. In addition, the cost of delivering fossil fuels to remote locations can be expensive. Solar power is ideal for agricultural irrigation, as most irrigation is required when the sun is shining brightly. Consequently, a PV powered irrigation system is a promising technology that could help meet the irrigation needs of remote agricultural. The two major goals of this research are to get an existing solar PV irrigation system working and to acquire experimental data using this system under various operating conditions. This research work is built upon a series of three senior design projects. These three senior design projects were to design and construct a <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> system, an instrumentation system for this <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> system, and a single axis solar translator. Specifically this thesis work entailed getting the instrumentation system to work properly, writing a LabVIEW program to automatically acquire data from installed sensors, integrating all three of these senior design projects into one PV irrigation system, getting the PV irrigation system installed {{on the roof of the}} Russ Engineering Building, and collecting a large amount of data on the system. All have been accomplished successfully. The PV irrigation system work presented in this thesis use two 224 watt PV modules that are connected in parallel and mounted on a vertical axis solar tracker that follows the sun from east to west to enhance the amount of solar energy collected during the day. Energy developed by these panels is stored in two 100 amp-hour batteries wired in a series arrangement. Energy stored in the batteries is supplied to a direct current water pump that requires 50 watts of power at 24 volts. To harvest maximum energy from the PV modules and to protect the batteries, a MPPT-charge controller (maximum power point tracker with charge controller) is installed inline between the PV array and batteries. The instrumentation or DAQ (data acquisition) system employed on the PV irrigation system consists of four current sensors, four voltage transducers, four thermocouples, a pyranometer and a flowrate sensor to record associated parameters at various points throughout the PV irrigation system. The DAQ system is structured in such a way that each component 2 ̆ 7 s output can be monitored and assessed throughout the system via a LabVIEW program developed as part of this thesis work. This PV irrigation system has been investigated under four operating configurations. Three of the operating configurations vary the orientation of the PV panels and one operating configuration varies the load on the system. 1. 	azimuthal solar tracking at an inclination angle of 40 o with both the water pump and power dissipating resistors being used to consume the power generated by the PV array, 2. 	azimuthal solar tracking at an inclination angle of 30 o with both the water pump and power dissipating resistors being used to consume the power generated by the PV array, 3. 	a fixed solar array pointing due south at an inclination angle of 40 o with both the water pump and power dissipating resistors being used to consume the power generated by the PV array, and 4. 	azimuthal solar track [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater pumping for {{irrigation}} has exploded across India since the 1970 ’s {{largely due to}} a proliferation of cheap pump sets and highly subsidized energy. In much of Western and peninsular India, aquifers have been overexploited with substantial decreases in water tables leading to even higher amounts of energy used for pumping. As <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> pumps become more effective and affordable, the prospect of uncontrolled solar pumping further exacerbating the unsustainable use of groundwater has led to calls by some {{for the government to}} buy back excess electricity generated on farms. Under such a scheme, the buy-back price would have to be high enough to make selling the power more profitable than using it for further irrigation, yet not as high as the price that is charged for electricity from the grid lest an opportunity for arbitrage be created. The correct value for the buy-back price will thus depend on the marginal profitability of water use on the farm with the possibility that the value of water to the farmer may be too high to make the scheme feasible. In this paper, estimates of water and electricity demand are derived for Punjab state and used to inform what an effective buyback scheme might entail. Results indicate that a buy-back price differentiated by season and location might be an affordable way to promote groundwater conservation...|$|E

This thesis studies the application of design for value to distributed solar energy systems by considering how the energy system will enable new income generating activities. The work here couples business and energy models to optimize with value as an objective function. The interaction between energy production and value creation is complex, so multi-objective optimization is used as a tool to explore the design space and analyze the feasibility of such projects. This methodology is practiced in two case studies. One case study considers the design of a <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> pump that is specifically designed for marginal-holding farmers in east India. The other case study analyzes the feasibility of small-scale concentrated solar powered (p-CSP) food processing with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). In both cases, preliminary economic feasibility is established with the use of analysis by optimization and design for value. It was found that a solar pump could be produced which costs less than 500 USD cap-ex and meets 99 % of a marginal-holding farmer's water demand. The solar food processing analysis showed that a system could be produced which costs 29, 000 USD with a 15 -year NPV of 33, 400 USD at a discount rate of 18 %. The programmatic tools that are used to explore this design space include genetic algorithms, pattern search, adaptive weighted sums, and Pareto fronts. by Kevin Patrick Simon. Thesis: S.

40|$|Emerging {{financial}} and environmental challenges associated with conventional power sources have increased global interest in consuming unpolluted, {{renewable energy sources}} for irrigation sector. Solar energy may be an attractive choice in this regard due to its strong influence on crop water use and related energy requirement. However, a comprehensive approach for a reliable and economically viable photovoltaic (PV) system design to produce energy from solar source is required to accurately explore its potential. This thesis describes the development and application of a reliability assessment model, identifies a suitable <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> management scheme, and provides guidelines for evaluating economic viability of a solar-powered center pivot irrigation system. The reliability model, written in MATLAB, was developed based on the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) technique in which various sub-models for estimating energy production, energy requirement and energy storage were combined. The model was validated with actual data acquired from the study site located at Outlook, Saskatchewan, Canada and an excellent agreement was found. For example, normalized {{root mean square error}} (NRMSE) for the battery current was found to be 0. 027. Irrigation management strategies (irrigation depth, frequency and timing) were investigated by comparing the PV system sizing requirement for a conventional (25 - 35 mm per application) and for a frequent light irrigation management strategy (5 - 8 mm per application). The results suggest that the PV sizing can be reduced significantly by adopting frequent light irrigations which utilize the power as it is produced during daylight hours, rather than relying on stored energy. The potential of a solar-powered center pivot irrigation system was revealed for three different crops (canola, soybean and table potato) at the site by conducting a detailed economic analysis for the designed PV system. High value crops with moderate water requirements such as table potatoes appeared to be the most feasible choice for the study site. However, the potential may greatly vary for different crops in altered locations due to management, agronomic, climate, social, and economic variations. It can be concluded that a holistic approach described here {{can be used as a}} tool for designing an appropriate PV powered center pivot irrigation system under variable operating and meteorological conditions. Furthermore, its potential can be accurately explored by conducting a detailed economic analysis for a given location, considering different available crop choices...|$|E
40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>Irrigation</b> Pumps (SIPs) {{are used}} to pump (ground and surface) water to irrigate farm lands. In {{a country with a}} {{historical}} mismatch of energy supply and demand, and almost 120 million families dependent on earnings from agriculture (Prachi Salve, 2014), SIPs offer great prospects. Unlike electric and diesel pumps – dominating the market till today – SIPs have almost zero marginal costs. This leads to extra crop production at negligible costs and also generation of electricity when not being used for pumping. Due to almost zero emissions, it simultaneously addresses the issue of climate change hence bringing prosperity to the population at all levels. SIPs are a new phenomenon in India and due to the comparatively 1 high capital costs, SIPs require subsidies to make them affordable for a farmer. Support in the form of subsidies has been given to around 15, 000 farms in the whole country. By introducing solar pumps on a subsidy scheme in 2009 - 2010, Rajasthan has become the pioneer state of India. Since then numerous solar pumps have been deployed and farmers have gained experience with their usage. These farmers appear to be happy with the functioning of the pumps; 95 % of the farmers, who gained enough knowledge to answer the question, say that the pump works better than their diesel or electric pump. A surprising finding is that the project cost per pump is getting higher while the pumps are getting cheaper. This means that the government is using more money to run the project. To find the reasons for the rising project costs and {{to find a way to}} decrease them, further research is needed. If the project cost could be decreased more pumps could be supplied with the same amount of subsidy. It was also found that the SIPs were not successful in replacing the electric and diesel pumps. The diesel and electric pumps had more horse power (hp) so were able to pump more water resulting in irrigation of more land in the same amount of time. Farmers expressed they could fully switch to SIPs when more powerful pumps were supplied. Because the present SIPs are off grid systems, it is not possible to sell the excess electricity that is not needed for pumping water. Because there are no marginal costs, there is no incentive for switching off the machines either. The consequence is excessive pumping of water leading to groundwater depletion. An important improvement would be to connect these pumps to the electricity grid. The possibility to earn some money with delivering energy would probably be a good reason to stop needless pumping. The subsidy program that was in place in Rajasthan had an 86 % capital subsidy (the farmer had to pay only 14 % of the price of SIP). With the available money only 10, 000 pumps per year could be supplied (Dr. Dinesh Kumar Goyal, 2013). When the subsidy per pump is decreased more pumps could be deployed and it was shown that even with a lower subsidy getting a SIP will still be attractive. One of the points of improvement for a quick roll out of SIPs might be found in the way these pumps are financed. Pumps have a high capital cost and are currently financed by 70 - 90 % capital subsidies of the government. The amount of total subsidy is limited and so with a high percentage of subsidy a small amount of pumps are deployed by this subsidy. These subsidies could be dramatically reduced when a loan/lease product would be put in place. Without a bank loan farmers are unable to pay the major part of the capital cost of the pump. Offering a bank loan is a win-win situation for the farmers and the people of India, represented by the government. With these pumps farmers are able to sell electricity to the grid and earn extra income or they can sell water to other farmers for a price below the price of current diesel pumping. With this income they could pay off the loan in 7 years and earn a reasonable income. The people of India will not only benefit by having to pay less for subsidies, they will also benefit from less greenhouse gas emissions as solar has almost zero emissions compared to mainly coal based electricity pumps and diesel pumps. SIPs supplying electricity can have a big effect on grid stability. Hence, in chapter 6 the question of grid stability was raised. Under what conditions can the Indian grid deal with a large amount of electricity injected from SIPs. India currently has 70 % of the electricity produced from coal power plants while 3 % comes from Nuclear power plants (Trading Economics, 2011 a). These sources have a response time of several hours which is not quick enough to respond to fluctuations in the demand of energy by for example households, or a change in production by other sources, for example solar. The present sources should be partly replaced by quick response sources like the renewable sources and gas turbines. Currently 6 % of the installed capacity is a gas power plant (Central Electricity Authority, 2015) but this percentage should be increased. Also other solutions should be implemented, such as developing storage of energy and more interconnections between grids of states and other countries. Since the idea is that SIPs would not use electricity from the grid anymore unlike electric pumps, 25 % of electricity currently used from the grid by agriculture will be less. The current electric pumps only get electricity for certain hours a day and {{are used to}} balance the grid, only at times of low electricity use of other users, farmers will get electricity. When the electric pumps are replaced by SIPs that do not use electricity from the grid the balancing function that the electric pumps currently fulfil will no longer be present. Having no experience with SIPs connected to the grid so far, it will be difficult for the state load dispatch centres, which manage the grid, to schedule the expected load. Hence, pilots should be set up to find out how these pumps are used throughout the day so that in the future these loads can be predicted. In Gujarat the solar installed capacity could easily be a fivefold without having to invest in extra capacity of quick responsive sources, since enough installed capacity of gas turbines is already in place but currently not used. Extra investment would be needed in the grid in order to be able to transmit so much electricity over the grid from the (distributed) solar plants. <b>Solar</b> <b>irrigation</b> pumps, when implemented correctly, can not only lead to much cheaper irrigation for farmers but also less groundwater depletion and a source of extra income. Solar pumps can lead the way to more prosperity for the Indian people, but new guidelines and plans have to be made by the government to realise this potential. Without policy changes as described in this thesis SIPs benefit a small number of lucky farmers at the expense of the larger whole (wasting public money and groundwater) ...|$|E

40|$|South Asia {{comes across}} as amongst the most {{vulnerable}} regions to climate change in the Inter-government Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ’s Fifth Assessment Report released a year ago, and in other similar reports. Climate change {{in the region is}} manifested by depleting glaciers, increasing coastal erosion, frequent heat waves, rising sea level, frequent floods and droughts and varying rainfall patterns. It is now evident that South Asia’s climate is already changing and the impacts are already being felt. As a largely agrarian economy, this vulnerability is {{compounded by the fact that}} more than 700 million people’s livelihoods depend on agriculture directly influenced by changes in climate. Although South Asia has seen robust economic growth, with the GDP averaging about 6 percent over the past 20 years, the region is still home to 1 / 4 th of the world’s hungry and 40 % of the world’s malnourished children and women. As populations continue to rise and the demand for food grows, the question is: how will this increase in demand be met and where will all this food be grown? With stiff competition for land from the non-farm sector, expanding farmlands is not an option. Climate change will further exacerbate the existing pressures on land and water resources. If the second Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty, achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture is to be realised, climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies, practices, services and policies will need to be implemented in earnest. Many recent studies show a probability of 10 - 40 percent loss in crop production by 2070 - 2100 on account of rising temperatures and decrease in irrigation water, unless steps are initiated now to increase our adaptive capacity. For example, even with the benefits of carbon fertilization (which could anyway be negatively affected by increase in surface ozone concentration) India stands to lose nearly 4 - 5 tonnes of wheat with every rise in temperature of 1 degree Celsius. This estimate could be even higher when decrease in irrigation is factored in. Wheat losses could be significant even in the short term, while losses for other crops are uncertain and estimated to be relatively smaller, particularly so for monsoon crops. Similarly, there are studies to show that livestock and fish productivity could also decline. Climate change does offer some opportunities as well. One adaptive measure is to identify regions that would become conducive for certain crops in the changed climate. For example, farmers in the upper regions of Himachal Pradesh in India have taken to growing apples because temperatures in the lower regions became too warm for its growth. The shift in cultivation brought new opportunities and high incomes for these farmers while their counterparts in the south switched to cultivating vegetables. It is clear that per hectare cultivation of food needs to drastically increase to meet growing food demands. While this is a challenge, the existing large crop yield gaps in the region suggest there is potential to increase crop production per hectare even in the face of increasing climatic risks. For this to happen, investments in land and water management, infrastructure, and research accompanied by enabling policies, sustained regional cooperation and robust institutions is crucial. Increased production variability could perhaps be the most significant impact of global impact change in Asian countries. Short-term changes in weather extremes, which are still not very predictable in most countries of the region, pose huge challenges. Some recent examples are the drought in 2014, the floods in Pakistan in 2010, floods in India, Nepal and Bangladesh in 2007 and the heat-stress experiences in India in 2004 which resulted in fluctuating yields, food price volatility and threatened food security and incomes. Such volatility is despite the vast irrigation network in the region, especially in the Indo-Gangetic plains. During last few decades, excessive groundwater extraction has resulted in widespread decline in water table and water quality degradation. To ensure future food security in climate change scenarios, investment in managing and stabilizing the existing irrigated potential while exploring options to expand this potential is the need of the hour. Several technological, institutional and policy interventions have been proposed that can help us adapt to climate change as well as to current and future weather variability. These include simple adaptation practices such as changes in planting dates and crop varieties. Additional strategies that have been proposed include: the deployment of adverse climate tolerant genotypes and diversified land use systems, the use of <b>solar</b> <b>irrigation,</b> assisting farmers in coping with current climatic risks through providing weather linked value-added advisory services and crop/weather insurance, and improved land and water use management and policies. Agriculture in South Asia contributes between 15 - 20 percent to total greenhouse gas emissions. These are primarily from enteric fermentation in ruminant animals, rice paddy cultivation, and nitrous oxide from manures and fertilizers application to soils. What is interesting to note is that most of the proposed adaptation options, if implemented scientifically, come with large mitigation co-benefits. CCAFS is scaling out the Climate-Smart Villages (CSVs) model in several countries, including in South Asia, to promote climate-smart agriculture (CSA). Climate Smart Villages are sites where a portfolio of the most appropriate technological and institutional interventions, determined by the local community, are implemented to increase food production, enhance adaptive capacity and reduce emissions. Interventions are bespoke to each village but the concept lends itself to be applied in any region under the right circumstances. Initial results suggest a large potential to maximise synergies among different interventions in order to scale out CSA. Much work needs to be done to expand the evidence base of CSVs with regard to targeting the approach in different agro-climates, the costs: benefit analysis in terms of investment and returns, and the institutional and policy changes that are needed to promote CSA. In the South Asia region, problems of widespread poverty, poor governance, weak institutions, and human capital limit agricultural growth today. These problems can also reduce the potential of adaptation strategies. It is critical to simultaneously address these political and socio-economic constraints if the full potential of CSA is to be realised for farmers and the region as a whole...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a small variation to current approaches broadly called Taguchi Robust Design Methods. In these methods, {{there are two}} broad categories of problems associated with simultaneously minimizing performance variations and bringing the mean on target, namely, Type I - minimizing variations in performance caused by variations in noise factors (uncontrollable parameters). Type II - minimizing variations in performance caused by variations in control factor (design variables). In this paper, we {{introduce a}} variation to the existing approaches to solve both types of problems. This variation embodies {{the integration of the}} Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with the compromise Decision Support Problem (DSP). Our approach is especially useful for design problems where there are no closed-form solutions and system performance is computationally expensive to evaluate.

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{technique}} using <b>solar</b> {{power to}} <b>irrigation</b> was proposed. In {{order to obtain}} better sensitivity, small dense probe, single strand copper probe, bifilar winding type probe and rectangular cross section type probe were designed. Through the experiments, the electrical resistance of four kinds of probe structure was determined. Test results show that conductivity of small dense probe is the worst, conductivity of single strand copper probe is better. Graphite content has great influence to probe resistance value, resistance and graphite content in the relationship is not linear...|$|R
40|$|Optimization is {{becoming}} a crucial element in industrial applications involving sustainable alternative energy systems. During the design of such systems, the engineer/decision maker would often encounter noise factors (e. g. solar insolation and ambient temperature fluctuations) when their system interacts with the environment. In this chapter, the sizing and design optimization of the <b>solar</b> powered <b>irrigation</b> system was considered. This problem is multivariate, noisy, nonlinear and multiobjective. This design problem was tackled by first using the Fuzzy Type II approach to model the noise factors. Consequently, the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) (in {{the context of a}} weighted sum framework) was employed to solve this multiobjective fuzzy design problem. This method was then used to construct the approximate Pareto frontier as well as to identify the best solution option in a fuzzy setting. Comprehensive analyses and discussions were performed on the generated numerical results with respect to the implemented solution methods. Comment: 27 pages, 12 Figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the technical and}} economic suitability of <b>solar</b> pump <b>irrigations</b> of rice and no-rice crops. Four submersible solar pumps (1050 Wp) were installed in different locations of Bangladesh for irrigating rice, wheat and vegetables. The solar pump was used for drip irrigation and furrow irrigation for cultivation of brinjal and tomato during 2010 - 13. Water savings by drip irrigation over furrow irrigation for brinjal and tomato were 53. 25 % and 56. 16 %, respectively. For cultivation of wheat about 430 mm water was required and the yield was 3. 00 t/ha. Water required for boro rice cultivation in Magura was 1024 mm and in Barisal it was 1481 mm. Cultivations of solar irrigated wheat (BCR 2. 31), tomato (BCR 2. 22) and brinjal (BCR 2. 34) were economically profitable but boro rice was not economically profitable (BCR 0. 31). Diesel engine operated irrigation pump emits carbon dioxide but solar pump is an environment friendly irrigation technology...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the use of design {{capability}} indices for use in robust design. These indices allow the design requirements to vary within a certain range. Design capability indices are based on process capability indices from statistical process control and provide an alternate approach {{to the use of}} Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratio which is often used for robust design. Successful implementation of design capability indices ensures that a range of design solutions, representing a family of designs, conforms to a given ranged set of design requirements. The essence of using a design capability index is to predict the spread of the design performance so that the capability of a family of designs to satisfy a range of design requirements can be assessed. The design of a <b>solar</b> powered <b>irrigation</b> system is presented to demonstrate the usefulness of design capability indices. 1 Assistant Professor, Design Methodology Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a comprehensive and rigorous robust design procedure to overcome some {{limitations of the}} current approaches. A comprehensive approach is general enough to model the two major types of robust design applications, namely, robust design associated with the minimization of the deviation of performance caused by the deviation of noise factors (uncontrollable parameters), and robust design due to the minimization of the deviation of performance caused by the deviation of control factors (design variables). We achieve mathematical rigor by using, as a foundation, principles from the design of experiments and optimization. Specifically, we integrate the Response Surface Method (RSM) with the compromise Decision Support Problem (DSP). Our approach is especially useful for design problems {{where there are no}} closed-form solutions and system performance is computationally expensive to evaluate. The design of a <b>solar</b> powered <b>irrigation</b> system is used as an example. Our focus in this paper is on illustrating our approach rather than on the results per se...|$|R

40|$|Solar-powered {{agricultural}} irrigation is {{an attractive}} application of renewable energy. However, to be practical it must be both technically and economically feasible. Here, a method is presented for calculating the feasibility of photovoltaic-powered (PVP) irrigation. The feasibility is expressed {{as a function of}} location, which includes climate data, aquifer depth and cost, including local political policies such as carbon taxes. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to compare the lifecycle costs of photovoltaic-, diesel engine- and electrical grid-powered irrigation systems. Five examples illustrate the method's application. These results suggest that PVP irrigation is technically and economically feasible, provided that there is enough land available for the <b>solar</b> array.

40|$|For robust design it is {{desirable}} to allow the design requirements to vary within a certain range rather than setting point targets. This is particularly important {{during the early stages}} of design when {{little is known about the}} system and its requirements. Toward this end, design capability indices are developed in this paper to assess the capability of a family of designs, represented by a range of top-level design specifications, to satisfy a ranged set of design requirements. Design capability indices are based on process capability indices from statistical process control and provide a single objective, alternate approach to the use of Taguchi's signal-to- noise ratio which is often used for robust design. Successful implementation of design capability indices ensures that a family of designs conforms to a given ranged set of design requirements. To demonstrate an application and the usefulness of design capability indices, the design of a <b>solar</b> powered <b>irrigation</b> system is presented. Our focus in this paper is on the development and implementation of design capability indices as an alternate approach to the use of the signal-to-noise ratio and not on the results of the example problem, per se...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solar</b> powered <b>irrigation</b> pumps (SPIPs) are {{a proven}} technology, and can {{potentially}} be a game changer in Nepal’s irrigation sector by providing clean irrigation {{to millions of}} farmers. However, the relatively high capital cost of SPIPs is the main impediment that prevents large scale adoption of SPIPs. Given this, can we design appropriate financial solutions that will help in the large scale adoption of this clean and efficient technology? We ran a randomized experiment in order to estimate demand for SPIPs under three financial models – ‘grant’; ‘grant-loan’ and ‘grant-pay as you go’ in Saptari district of Nepal. We provided an additional 10 % discount to women applicants, provided they owned the land on which SPIPs were to be installed. These models were based on policies of Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), and similar schemes available in India and Bangladesh. Village Development Committees (VDCs) were randomly divided into three groups and one financial option was provided to each group of VDCs. This randomized control trial (RCT) helped estimate absolute demand {{for each of the}} models. We ran 45 -days promotional campaigns to solicit demand from farmers.
