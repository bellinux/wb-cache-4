50|$|Vice President Al Gore {{was seen}} as the frontrunner for the nomination. Bill Bradley {{was seen as}} a non-threat. Al Gore campaigned in Des Moines, Iowa in May 1999. Bradley, knowing he was the outsider, campaigned tirelessly. Gore {{successfully}} painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers in rural America. The Vice President received the endorsement from the Governor of Iowa Tom Vilsack and Senator Tom Harkin and had a tremendous lead over <b>Senator</b> <b>Bradley.</b> But a devastating loss for the Gore camp was when Bradley got the endorsement of the Des Moines Register. Bradley started to gain momentum and the race become closer. A week before the caucus polls had it 40% to 49% in Gore’s favor. On January 23, 2000, a day before the primary polls had Al Gore winning by 2 or 3 points.|$|E
40|$|Hospitals {{have been}} {{squeezed}} by the Balanced Budget Act; the uninsured population {{is still on}} the rise; long-term care is paid for largely by welfare grants. The nation's flawed structure of health care finance ultimately will adversely affect the quality of care for all. Not long after the failure of the Clinton health plan in 1994, Henry J. Aaron, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, published a book entitled The Problem That Won't Go Away. The conventional wisdom at the time was that health care policy would be off the nation's agenda {{for a long time to}} come. But Aaron knew better. It took no special gift of prophesy, though, to conclude that the problems building in health care several years ago were deeply entrenched: a rising number of uninsured, inordinately high out-of-pocket costs (for prescription drugs, in particular) for many who are otherwise well insured, loss of patient and physician autonomy with the ascendancy of managed care, and the resistance of third-party payers, government and employers alike, to pay for health care with the openhandedness of old. Aaron, unlike many others, clearly foresaw that these and other increasingly characteristic features of American health care would put it back in the headlines before long. And so it is. Patients ' rights are now the subject of a House-Senate conference; adding a prescription drugs benefit to Medicare is high on the administration's agenda; and access to medical care was central to the insurgency candidacy of <b>Senator</b> <b>Bradley.</b> Even Harry and Louise are back-this time no...|$|E
40|$|This social historiography {{tells the}} story of the origin of the Newborns 2 ̆ 7 and Mothers 2 ̆ 7 Health Protection Act of 1996. In the 1980 s when the federal {{government}} reduced allocations to states 2 ̆ 7 Medicaid programs as a cost saving measure, hospitals, initiated early discharge of patients to save costs. Given four million births annually, childbirth is the most frequent reason for hospitalization in the United States. Hospitals discharged Medicaid insured mothers and newborns very early at twenty-four hours for a normal birth and seventy-two hours for a cesarean. Other insurers adopted similar managed care strategies in the early 1990 s. ^ By 1995, unionized nurses from New Jersey, bolstered by a national outcry against early maternal discharge, and individual states legislative actions, met with staff in <b>Senator</b> <b>Bradley</b> 2 ̆ 7 s (Democrat, NJ) Washington, DC office to request a federal law that would extend hospital length of stays for maternity patients. The result was the creation of the Newborns 2 ̆ 7 and Mothers 2 ̆ 7 Health Protection Act of 1996 (Newborn 2 ̆ 7 s Act). Insurers must now reimburse hospitals a minimum length of maternity stay of forty-eight hours for a normal birth and ninety-six hours for a cesarean birth. ^ This historical investigation found that a revival occurred in professional nursing organizations 2 ̆ 7 voice in health care policy. The American Nurses Association, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, and the Association of Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nursing, not only testified at the congressional hearing for the Newborn 2 ̆ 7 s bill, but also helped craft the bill that became law. One nursing specialty, Public Health Nursing, at one time a cornerstone for autonomous nursing practice, was omitted from the NMHPA policymaking. As a nursing section of the American Public Health Association, it is now considering options to become more visible in health care policy development. ^ Second, this study suggests that the federal government may have attempted price-fixing when it recommended in 1982, and again in 1983, that other insurers also limit reimbursements to hospitals to contain costs. In one last finding, congressional lawmakers omitted costly Medicaid insured mothers from the NMHPA law, but regulations formulated in 1999 captured this vulnerable group of mothers and newborns. ...|$|E
