40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{estimation}} of comminution effects, apart from process efficiency, forces presented during comminution and comminution level, the grain composition {{and content of}} irregular grains in product are very important. The jaw crushers give disadvantageous results of grain symmetry of products, but the very high changeability of crushing forces and individual comminution energy was obtained, dependently on the compressing tool shape. In experimental jaw crusher of <b>straight</b> <b>jaw</b> movement, the jaws with longitudinal ruts of transverse triangular, trapezoidal or circular profile were used. Furthermore, the ruts of various teeth sizes, i. e. of various height (h) and scale (t), were applied. The best results were obtained for jaws with trapezoidal ruts, of proportionally low scale t(t= 1, 1 e) - where e is the output rift size – and high values of teeth height h(h= 0, 8 e). The industrial efforts confirmed the results given in laboratory scale...|$|E

It had {{relatively}} short legs, heavy feet, and in the hip, shorter ilia, the latter indicating that the musculature of the legs was not as well-developed as in most ornithomimids. The foot had four toes and a vestige of the first digit, whereas all (other) ornithomimids were three-toed with the first and fifth toe lost. The toothless skull has very <b>straight</b> <b>jaws</b> ending in a more rounded snout tip than that of others of the group, and larger eyes.|$|R

40|$|The Upper Cretaceous of Africa has {{produced}} a diverse fauna of mosasaurs, including the highly specialized, long-jawed Pluridens. The type of Pluridens walkeri comes from the Maastrichtian Farin-Doutchi Formation of Niger, with a second, referred specimen coming from the Campanian section of the Campanian-Maastrichtian Nkporo Shale near Calabar, in southern Nigeria. Comparisons of this referred specimen with the holotype suggest that it represents a distinct and more primitive species. The Calabar jaw resembles P. walkeri in being long and narrow anteriorly with a shallow subdental shelf, and in having small, numerous, recurved teeth with medially positioned replacement pits. However, it lacks many of the derived features that characterize Pluridens walkeri, such as the extremely long and <b>straight</b> <b>jaw,</b> the extreme lateral protrusion and subcircular section of the dentary, strong transverse expansion of the dental thecae, and extreme reduction and increase in number of the teeth. The Calabar Pluridens is therefore referred to a new species, Pluridens calabaria. Following recent studies, Pluridens is considered to represent a highly derived member of the Halisaurinae. The marked differences between the Campanian and Maastrichtian species of the genus underscore the rapid pace of mosasaur evolution during the Cretaceous...|$|E
40|$|Edward G Chekan, Mark A Davison, David W Singleton, John Z Mennone, Piet Hinoul Ethicon, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} two commonly used advanced bipolar devices (ENSEAL® G 2 Tissue Sealers and LigaSure™ Blunt Tip) for compression uniformity, vessel sealing strength, and consistency in bench-top analyses. Methods: Compression analysis was performed with a foam pad/sensor apparatus inserted between closed jaws of the instruments. Average pressures (psi) were recorded across the entire inside surface of the jaws, and over the distal one-third of jaws. To test vessel sealing strength, ex vivo pig carotid arteries were sealed and transected and left and right (sealed) halves of vessels were subjected to burst pressure testing. The maximum bursting pressures of each half of vessels were averaged to obtain single data points for analysis. The absence or presence of tissue sticking to device jaws was noted for each transected vessel. Results: Statistically higher average compression values were found for ENSEAL® instruments (curved jaw and <b>straight</b> <b>jaw)</b> compared to LigaSure™, P< 0. 05. Moreover, the ENSEAL® devices retained full compression at the distal end of jaws. Significantly higher and more consistent median burst pressures were noted for ENSEAL® devices relative to LigaSure™ through 52 firings of each device (P< 0. 05). LigaSure™ showed a significant reduction in median burst pressure for the final three firings (cycles 50 – 52) versus the first three firings (cycles 1 – 3), P= 0. 027. Tissue sticking was noted for 1. 39 % and 13. 3 % of vessels transected with ENSEAL® and LigaSure™, respectively. Conclusion: In bench-top testing, ENSEAL® G 2 sealers produced more uniform compression, stronger and more consistent vessel sealing, and reduced tissue sticking relative to LigaSure™.

40|$|AbstractMulti-gripper {{flexible}} {{stretch forming}} {{is a novel}} sheet metal forming process aimed at improving the conformability of sheet metal to forming die, material utilization and forming quality of sheet metal. <b>Straight</b> <b>jaws</b> in traditional stretch forming machines are replaced {{by a pair of}} opposed clamping mechanisms movable relative to each other during the forming process. In the present study, a wave-like surface part was selected as the study object, and the forming processes of traditional stretch forming and multi-gripper flexible stretch forming were performed using a commercially available finite element analysis software to show their influences on conformability of sheet metal. In addition, three levels of transition lengths in multi-gripper flexible stretch forming were chosen to investigate their influence on forming results. The simulation results show that multi-gripper flexible stretch forming would result in an easier conformability of sheet metal than traditional stretch forming. It is also found that the sheet metal can be formed without a transition length, which could significantly improve the material utilization. In addition, the simulation results show that a shorter transition length would result in a smaller maximum strain in the forming zone, which may provide a useful guidance on choosing the transition length of sheet metal...|$|R

50|$|Echinerpeton {{is known}} from six specimens, five {{housed in the}} Museum of Comparative Zoology and a sixth in the Redpath Museum: the holotype MCZ 4090, which {{consists}} of a partial postcranial skeleton and some jaw fragments; MCZ 4091, which includes vertebrae and an interclavicle; MCZ 4092, a left maxilla or upper jaw bone; MCZ 4093, a partial right maxilla; MCZ 4094, including three neural arches or vertebral spines; and RM 10057, consisting of a right maxilla, neural arch, rib, and a phalanx or finger bone. Since all other specimens besides the holotype are isolated bone fragments, their assignment to the same species is not certain. The maxillae are distinct in having straight lower margins, distinct from the often curved jaws of ophiacodontids and sphenacodontids but similar to the <b>straight</b> <b>jaws</b> of some other synapsids like Archaeothyris, Haptodus, and Varanops. The dentary or lower jaw bone has a slight upward curve. The teeth of both {{the upper and lower}} jaws are small and cone-shaped, some having slightly serrated edges, and are only differentiated by slight differences in length (some other synapsids have teeth that vary greatly and shape across their jaws). The three forward-most dentary teeth are angled slightly outward as in more derived synapsids such as Dimetrodon and Sphenacodon. Several features, including straight-margined maxillae and simple conical teeth, are also seen in the earliest reptiles.|$|R

The reduced number of maxillary teeth in Ningyuansaurus is shared with the scansoriopterygids and other basal oviraptorosaurs such as Incisivosaurus. Though the skull is poorly preserved, the specimen preserved at least 14 teeth in the lower jaw (dentary) and 10 teeth in the upper jaw, four in the premaxilla and six in the maxilla. The teeth were closely packed together and lacked serrations. The eyes were relatively large. The skull was generally triangular in shape but longer than other basal oviraptorosaurs like Caudipteryx, with a <b>straight</b> lower <b>jaw</b> unlike most other oviraptorosaurs.|$|R

Other caimans that lived {{during the same}} time in South America (including those in the genera Mourasuchus and Purussaurus) were much larger than Culebrasuchus. Features that Culebrasuchus shares in common with other caimanines include {{nostrils}} that open upward (rather than slightly forward, as in alligatorines), and bones that do not overlap the edges of two openings in the skull table called supratemporal fenestrae. Like living caimanines, Culebrasuchus has blunter teeth {{at the back of the}} jaw, and the teeth in the upper jaw completely overly the teeth in the lower jaw when the mouth is closed. Features in Culebrasuchus that are not found in other caimanines include the lack of ridges above the eye sockets and the large size of a hole in the lower jaw called the external mandibular fenestra. These features may be plesiomorphic ("primitive") for alligatorids. Culebrasuchus also has a <b>straighter</b> lower <b>jaw</b> than most other alligatorids, it lacks the ridges on the frontal bone between the eye sockets that are common among crocodylians, and the fourth tooth of the maxilla (rather than third, as in almost all other alligatorids) is the largest in the upper jaw.|$|R
