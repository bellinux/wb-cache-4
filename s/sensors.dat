40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the recent}} {{development}} of <b>sensor</b> networks, integrated <b>sensor</b> networks, in which some <b>sensor</b> networks are managed systematically, have attracted considerable at-tention. To implement various applications, such as weather forecasting and environmental observation, with integrated <b>sensor</b> networks, users (clients) usually aggregate and collect the <b>sensor</b> data obtained from all the <b>sensor</b> networks. After this, the clients execute some operations, such as averaging and analysis, on the aggregated <b>sensor</b> data. However, such processes cause heavy network traffic in aggregating data from all the <b>sensor</b> networks. Hence, in this paper, we propose a data aggregation system using mobile agents. Mobile agents are programs that migrate among <b>sensor</b> networks. Since the mobile agents migrate while executing operations on the <b>sensor</b> data, the clients {{do not need to}} aggregate the <b>sensor</b> data by collecting it from all the <b>sensor</b> networks, and the network traffic can be reduced.
