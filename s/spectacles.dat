40|$|ABSTRACT Debord’s {{influential}} {{theory of}} the <b>spectacle</b> is vitiated by its lack of historical and analytical differentiation. This article draws on Debord’s own undeveloped distinction between the concentrated <b>spectacle</b> and the diffuse <b>spectacle</b> in order to propose a double genealogy and a fourfold typology of the <b>spectacle</b> since the French Revolution. KEYWORDS aestheticization • festival • sacralization • secularisation • spec-tacle The term <b>spectacle</b> covers a multitude of phenomena. I want to distin-guish two main meanings: <b>spectacle</b> as festival and <b>spectacle</b> as <b>spectacle.</b> <b>Spectacle</b> in the second sense has such {{a wide range of}} reference – from sport and entertainment to the staging of politics and protest in the contem-porary world – that I shall, with Guy Debord (1983), focus {{on the question of the}} <b>spectacle</b> and the representation and self-representation of society. Debord’s use of the term <b>spectacle</b> silently presupposes the distinction between festival and <b>spectacle.</b> He distinguishes between the concentrated <b>spectacle</b> of totalitarianism, which refers back to the religious and political functions of the festival, and the diffuse <b>spectacle</b> of the society of the spec-tacle. Debord complicates things however, by claiming that the diffuse spec-tacle has taken over the traditional religious function of the festival. In the present article I want to propose a typology of the <b>spectacle</b> in modernity, which retrieves and elaborates Debord’s undeveloped distinction betwee...|$|R

5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish <b>spectacles</b> for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spectacle</b> {{associated}} with modern capitalist countries. The integrated <b>spectacle</b> borrows traits from the diffuse and concentrated <b>spectacle</b> {{to form a}} new synthesis. Debord argues {{that this is a very}} recent form of spectacular manifestation, and that it was pioneered in France and Italy. According to Debord, the integrated <b>spectacle</b> goes by the label of liberal democracy. This <b>spectacle</b> introduces a state of permanent general secrecy, where experts and specialists dictate the morality, statistics, and opinions of the <b>spectacle.</b> Terrorism is the invented enemy of the <b>spectacle,</b> which specialists compare with their [...] "liberal democracy", pointing out the superiority of the latter one. Debord argues that without terrorism, the integrated <b>spectacle</b> wouldn't survive, for it needs to be compared to something in order to show its [...] "obvious" [...] perfection and superiority.|$|R

5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s <b>spectacles</b> kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E
5|$|Circuses {{were the}} largest {{structure}} regularly {{built in the}} Roman world, though the Greeks had their own architectural traditions for the similarly purposed hippodrome. The Flavian Amphitheatre, {{better known as the}} Colosseum, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome after it opened in 80 AD. The circus races continued to be held more frequently. The Circus Maximus could seat around 150,000 spectators, and the Colosseum about 50,000 with standing room for about 10,000 more. Many Roman amphitheatres, circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today. The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring <b>spectacles</b> and arena events, which both enhanced their status and drained their resources.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including that he wore the wrong <b>spectacles,</b> that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, {{or a combination of}} the two conjectures.|$|E
50|$|The Society of the <b>Spectacle</b> (La société du <b>spectacle)</b> is a 1967 work of {{philosophy}} and Marxist critical theory by Guy Debord, in which the author develops and presents {{the concept of the}} <b>Spectacle.</b> The book is considered an important text for the Situationist movement.

5|$|Little {{literary}} evidence survives of {{the activities}} of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the <b>spectacles</b> but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|Philip II {{was assassinated}} in 336 BC at the theatre of Aigai, Macedonia, amid games and <b>spectacles</b> celebrating the {{marriage}} of his daughter Cleopatra of Macedon. Alexander the Great was allegedly a great admirer of both theatre and music. He was especially fond of the plays by Classical Athenian tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, whose works formed part of a proper Greek education for his new eastern subjects alongside studies in the Greek language, including the epics of Homer. While he and his army were stationed at Tyre (in modern-day Lebanon), Alexander had his generals act as judges not only for athletic contests but also for stage performances of Greek tragedies. The contemporaneous famous actors Thessalus and Athenodorus performed at the event.|$|E

50|$|Guy Debord's {{best known}} works are his {{theoretical}} books, The Society of the <b>Spectacle</b> and Comments on the Society of the <b>Spectacle.</b> In {{addition to these}} he wrote a number of autobiographical books including Mémoires, Panégyrique, Cette Mauvaise Réputation..., and Considérations sur l'assassinat de Gérard Lebovici. He was {{also the author of}} numerous short pieces, sometimes anonymous, for the journals Potlatch, Les Lèvres Nues, Les Chats Sont Verts, and Internationale Situationniste. The Society of the <b>spectacle</b> was written in an “interesting prose”, unlike most writings in that time or of that nature. For Debord, the <b>Spectacle</b> is viewed as false representations in our real lives. The <b>Spectacle</b> is a materialized worldview. The <b>spectacle</b> 'subjects human beings to itself'.|$|R

5|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box; senators and equestrians watching from the advantageous seats reserved for them; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else packed in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. <b>Spectacles</b> could quickly become sites {{of social and political}} protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} for his O-levels {{he began to}} have difficulties reading the blackboard and was initially devastated when told he would need glasses. At first, he played poorly at school, encumbered by the fragile <b>spectacles.</b> However, matters improved when a more robust pair, similar to those glasses worn by cricketer Roy Marshall, were fashioned {{for him at the}} behest of his maternal uncle, Albert Speight. Albert would go on to be a strong influence on Boycott's early cricketing game while playing for Brierley Juniors Football Club. In 1958, Boycott left school with seven O-level passes and the school's Individual Cricket Cup. That summer he played for the Leeds United under-18 football team alongside Billy Bremner and attracted the attention of Leeds United scouts. During the winter he continued to play nets with uncle Lawrence.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} develop an {{aesthetics}} of <b>spectacle</b> in mainstream cinema. Whilst {{a significant amount of}} critical work has been undertaken on <b>spectacle</b> within the context of narrative theory, little {{attention has been paid to}} defining and analysing <b>spectacle</b> in itself and its place in the cinematic experience. Not only does this mean that a pervasive concept in film studies is left poorly defined and unconsidered, it also hampers an understanding of the nature of the cinematic experience itself. The central question addressed by the thesis is ‘What is the role of <b>spectacle</b> in the cinematic experience, with particular reference to mainstream cinema?’ This involves a consideration of the ways in which <b>spectacle</b> has been treated in theoretical terms to date. In particular, the contribution of cognitive approaches is critically assessed with a view to establishing a more inclusive framework that recognises the experiential nature of cinematic <b>spectacle.</b> In the light of this, the thesis proposes a new critical model for understanding <b>spectacle,</b> one based on a notion of transmission which presents narrative and <b>spectacle</b> as coexistent within the cinematic experience rather than as antithetical qualities. As another aspect of this, the thesis considers the historical development of <b>spectacle</b> in the context of spectatorship at the time of early cinema at the end of the nineteenth century. The latter part of the thesis applies its definition of <b>spectacle</b> to specific elements of the cinematic experience, namely the use of technology and miseen-scene. It thereby engages with the aesthetics of <b>spectacle</b> within particular contexts and conditions. This exercise makes it clear that far from being a marginalised element, as suggested by current narrative-centred film theory, <b>spectacle</b> is central to the cinematic experience...|$|R

5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed <b>spectacles</b> for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the <b>spectacles</b> (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E
