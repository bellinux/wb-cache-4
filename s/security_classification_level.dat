40|$|One of {{the current}} {{research}} areas is to integrate database technology with object-oriented concepts. This dissertation addresses the problems involved with object-oriented data models and provides additional proposals for multilevel security in such an environment. A new object-oriented data model is presented, using formal specifications to provide a concise description of the data model, which includes aggregate and composite objects as well as versioning of objects. Multilevel security is addressed {{with the introduction of}} a multilevel security policy which describes the security needs and protection requirements of an object-oriented database system. Mandatory security and discretionary security are part of the security model which represents the security policy and specifies security properties that must exist for various entities in an object-oriented system, such as classes, methods and objects. All entities in the system are required to have a <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> <b>level</b> and all users must have a security clearance. In addition, various entities may contain negative authorization lists, specifying restricted access to certain users or groups of users. This security policy, which also addressed information flow violation, is then integrated into the new object-oriented data model. Protection in an object-oriented database system is further extended by providing secure transaction processing. New locking algorithms are introduced to enforce the security policy. At the user level, strategies for secure query processing are addressed. The concept of a virtual class is used to implement a secure view for users. Simple, content-based and context-based security constraints are enforced by integrating a rule base with the database to perform query modification. The rule base contains security constraints as well as environmental information to protect against user inference...|$|E

The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), the seminal work on the subject, provided the original definition of MAC as [...] "a means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity (as represented by a label) of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization (i.e., clearance) of subjects to access information of such sensitivity". Early implementations of MAC such as Honeywell's SCOMP, USAF SACDIN, NSA Blacker, and Boeing's MLS LAN focused on MLS to protect military-oriented <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> <b>levels</b> with robust enforcement.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recent {{developments}} in small satellites {{have led to}} an increasing interest in building satellite clusters as open systems that provide a “cluster-as-a-service ” in space. Since applications with different <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> <b>levels</b> must be supported in these open systems, the system must provide strict information partitioning such that only applications with matching <b>security</b> <b>classifications</b> interact with each other. The anonymous publish/subscribe communication pattern is a pow-erful interaction abstraction that has enjoyed great success in previous space software architectures, such as NASA’s Core Flight Executive. However, the difficulty is that existing solutions that support anonymous publish/subscribe communication, such as the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS), do not support information partitioning based on <b>security</b> <b>classifications,</b> which is a key requirement for some systems. This paper makes two contributions to address these limitations. First, we present a transport mechanism called Secure Transport that uses a lattice of labels to represent <b>security</b> <b>classifications</b> and enforces Multi-Level Security (MLS) policies to ensure strict information partitioning. Second, we present a novel discovery service {{that allows us to}} use an existing DDS implementation with our custom transport mechanism to realize a publish/subscribe middleware with information partitioning based on <b>security</b> <b>classifications</b> of applications. We also include an evaluation of our solution {{in the context of a}} use case scenario. I...|$|R
5000|$|NCCW, began {{operation}} in May, 1920, through {{an act of}} the Nebraska State Legislature establishing the [...] "State Reformatory for Women." [...] The original facility consisted of a 2-story house that {{was used as an}} inmate and staff residence. The facility was a working dairy farm. The inmates assisted with the livestock. The current institution consists of 17 buildings on 27 acre of land, secured by two security fences. NCCW houses all <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> <b>levels</b> of female inmates including those in its own Diagnostic and Evaluation Center (D&E) (All male new commitments are taken to the Nebraska Diagnostic and Evaluation Center located in Lincoln). The NCCW D&E houses all new commitments. The average stay of a new commitment in the NCCW D&E is 30 days. This allows the inmate time to adjust to the institution and to learn about the institution's programs, rules, and regulations. During the evaluation period staff develop a personalized classification plan for the inmate.|$|R
40|$|Database {{security}} is usually implemented {{in terms of}} access control. Mandatory <b>security</b> requires <b>classification</b> <b>levels</b> for objects and clearance levels for subjects. In Object Oriented Databases, all operations are invoked via message passing. Such operations belong to two categories: those that create new objects {{and those that do}} not. The security scheme must use different rules to handle the two categories of operations. This paper addresses the impact of database operations, which implement an object algebra, on mandatory access control. Keywords: Mandatory Access Control, Mandatory Security Specification, Object Algebra, Database Operations 1 Introduction Object Oriented Database Systems, OODBS, have attracted the attention of many researchers for almost a decade now. Today the debate centers around standardization [Dit 90, Kim 90, ABD + 90, OOD 91] to realize harmony of definitions and therefore a standard.

They {{rely on the}} implementation of an underpinning “digital coalition platform ” which unites and governs the policy, information and technology layers of the enterprise architecture. Not only does the platform need to provide interdisciplinary and coordinating services, it must do so flexibly across multiple <b>security</b> domains and <b>classification</b> <b>levels.</b> The value proposition of information and computing clouds is to provide functional services and information for smart decisions from a virtualized infrastructure transparent to the service consumer – with negotiated and bounded service levels. A cloud consists of both a converged network and various hybrid transformational IT resources formed from and leveraging re-usable mature hardware and software components. The cloud management layer assures separation of concerns and provides guaranteed levels of security and service quality. This paper illustrates how the dynamic infrastructure delivered by a private cloud can deliver decision superiority in environments where organizational structures, goals and objectives ar...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a first step}} towards a security model that defines access control for logical document structures. This model benefits from roles to abstract from users and from <b>security</b> <b>levels</b> (<b>classifications)</b> that abstract from objects. The security levels are defined {{on top of a}} complex document structure which will be needed for real web applications. Since a user clearance for an operation can be designated from roles and permissions, we use a lattice that defines a partial order over classifications to make an authorisation decision. Ordinary users should be able to handle the right management of their documents. The proposed model {{can be used in a}} decentral way. 1. Introduction When the Inter- or Intranet is used for cooperative work the users want to create new documents to be shared with others or they want to get access to documents created by others. In a project complex hyper-linked documents are shared among the participants who are working collectively on documents [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Classified {{information}} generally {{refers to}} {{information that is}} subject to special <b>security</b> <b>classification</b> regulations imposed by many national governments, the disclosure of which may cause harm to national interests and security. The protocol of restriction imposed upon such information is categorized into a hierarchy of <b>classification</b> <b>levels</b> in almost every national government worldwide, with the most restricted levels containing information that may cause the greatest danger to national security if leaked. Authorized access is granted to individuals on a need to know basis who have also passed the appropriate level of security clearance. Classified information can be reclassified to a different level or declassified (made available to the public) depending on changes of situation or new intelligence.|$|R

40|$|Security {{assessment}} {{is crucial for}} the reliable and secure operation of power systems. This paper proposes a <b>security</b> <b>level</b> <b>classification</b> (SLC) method to analyze the security level of power systems both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this SLC method, security levels are graded according to a comprehensive safety index (CSI), which is defined by integrating the system margin index (SMI) and load entropy. The SMI depends on the operating load and the total supply capacity (TSC) under N- 1 contingency, and the load entropy reflects the heterogeneity of load distribution calculated from entropy theory. In order to calculate the TSC under N- 1 contingency considering both of the computational accuracy and speed, the TSC is converted into an extended conic quadratic programming (ECQP) model. In addition, the load boundary vector (LBV) model is established to obtain the capacity limit of each load bus, and thus detect potential risks of power systems. Finally, two modified practical power systems and the IEEE 118 -bus test system are studied to validate the feasibility of the proposed SLC method...|$|R
