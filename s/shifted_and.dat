5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period and the {{following}} Late Period (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell {{to a series of}} outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the Kushite pharaohs of the eighth and seventh centuriesBC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their native land of Nubia, beginning a long tradition of sophisticated Nubian temple building. Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies <b>shifted</b> <b>and</b> the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.|$|E
5|$|The first {{election}} in Delta County occurred on October 6, 1870, to establish {{control in the}} newly formed county. Cooper held its first {{election in}} 1881, establishing an aldermanic government. Around that time, the first county courthouse was built in Cooper. Delta County, in addition to Cooper, voted for the Democratic Party in every presidential election from its incorporation in 1870 until 1968. However, the Populist Party won numerous local and county government positions during the 1890s and the early 1900s. In the 1970s, politics in Delta County <b>shifted,</b> <b>and</b> most of the county began voting for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had <b>shifted</b> <b>and</b> the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A CPS {{translation}} is a syntactic translation of programs, which {{is useful for}} describing their operational behavior. By iterating the standard callby-value CPS translation, Danvy and Filinski discovered the CPS hierarchy and proposed a family of control operators, <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset, that {{make it possible to}} capture successive delimited continuations in a CPS hierarchy. Although <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset have found their applications in several areas such as partial evaluation, most studies in the literature have been devoted to the base level of the hierarchy, namely, to level- 1 <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset. In this article, we investigate the whole family of <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset. We give a simple calculus with level-n <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> level-n reset for an arbitrary n> 0. We then give a set of equational axioms for them, and prove that these axioms are sound and complete with respect to the CPS translation. The resulting set of axioms is concise and a natural extension of those for level- 1 <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset...|$|R
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers <b>shifted</b> <b>and</b> came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed {{himself to}} William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He {{established}} his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer {{as well as an}} artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, {{largely as a result of}} Boydell's initiative, the trade imbalance had <b>shifted,</b> <b>and</b> he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Classic Maya social {{organization}} {{was based on}} the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by tradition to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate systemic problems. By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities. Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned. Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years. One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at Toniná in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes <b>shifted</b> <b>and</b> bypassed Petén.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{these results}} show that PEGylated AuNPs {{experience}} smaller spectral <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> decreased broadening in a cellular environment compared with bare AuNPs, likely due to lower cellular uptake and formation of smaller intracellular clusters. Such results suggest that PEGylating NPs can be utilized as a method for mitigating changes to NPs’ spectral profiles; however, we also find that PEGylation does not completely prevent spectral <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> broadening, and that the extent of spectral <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> broadening is time- and exposure dose-dependent (Fig.  2).|$|R

This paper gives a direct axiomatization of calculus with <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> reset, namely, we introduce a set of equations, and prove that it is sound and complete with respect to the CPS-translation.
