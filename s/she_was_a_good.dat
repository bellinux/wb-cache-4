Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} {{to act in the}} film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala.

500|$|Mimi {{was portrayed}} on film in Birth of The Beatles (1979), [...] (1985), [...] (2000), and by actress Kristin Scott Thomas in Nowhere Boy (2010). McCartney {{disagreed}} with the director of Nowhere Boy, Sam Taylor-Wood, about the original script portrayal of Mimi, saying: [...] "Aunt Mimi was not cruel. She was mock strict, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> heart who loved John madly." [...] Taking McCartney's advice, Taylor-Wood agreed to change the script.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Picto was Lady Dudley's maid and Thomas Blount {{asked whether}} she thought what had {{happened}} was [...] "chance or villany": she said by her faith she doth judge very chance, and neither done by man nor by herself. For herself, she said, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> virtuous gentlewoman, and daily would pray upon her knees; and divers times she saith that she hath heard her pray to God to deliver her from desperation. Then, said I, she might have an evil toy [...] in her mind. No, good Mr. Blount, said Picto, do not judge so of my words; if you should so gather, I am sorry I said so much.|$|E

500|$|According to Taraborrelli, {{the album}} has been hailed as bold and {{refreshing}} in contemporary {{music of the}} late 1990s, which was dominated by boybands and teenage artists such as the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Larry Flick from Billboard said that the album [...] "not only provided the chameleon-like artist with her first universally applauded critical success, it has also proved that she remains a vital figure amongst woefully fickle young audiences." [...] Music critic Lucy O'Brien commented: [...] "1998's Ray of Light certainly rehabilitated Madonna's image. Up to that point she had still been written off as an average pop glamour girl who got lucky, but with this record she reached a whole new audience, proving that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> songwriter with an intensely productive talent." [...] Mary von Aue from Stereogum stated that [...] "Ray of Light reestablished Madonna as a groundbreaking artist." ...|$|E
500|$|She died on 1 April 2015 at {{her home}} in Majorca, Spain, at the age of 75 after a short {{struggle}} with cancer, with her son Julian by her side. [...] Public messages of condolence were made by McCartney and Starr, with the former saying [...] "She was a lovely lady who I've known since our early days together in Liverpool. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mother to Julian and will be missed by us all ..." [...] and the latter [...] "Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia". Ono also issued a statement, emphasizing the position she held in common: [...] "Being a single parent of a strong and intelligent boy is never easy. Cynthia and I understood each other in that way, wishing well for our sons and their future." [...] Beatles biographer Hunter Davies, who had spent considerable time with her and John in the 1960s while researching his book, remembered her as [...] "a lovely woman ... She was totally different from John in that she was quiet, reserved and calm." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{her closest}} friends was 13-year-old Michael Higgins, {{who lived in}} a nearby street. In June 1957, he invited her to go {{swimming}} with friends at a local disused reservoir. Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> swimmer, Hindley chose not to go and instead went out with a friend, Pat Jepson. Higgins drowned in the reservoir, and upon learning of his fate Hindley was deeply upset, and blamed herself for his death. She collected for a funeral wreath, and his funeral at St Francis's Monastery in Gorton Lane—the church where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic on 16 August 1942—had a lasting effect on her. Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that she be baptised a Catholic only on the condition that she was not sent to a Catholic school, as her mother believed that [...] "all the monks taught was the catechism". Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the confirmation name of Veronica, and received her first communion in November 1958. She also became a godparent to Michael's nephew, Anthony John. It was also at about this time that Hindley first began bleaching her hair.|$|E

2500|$|On June 24, 1937, Pickford {{married her}} third and last husband, actor and band leader Buddy Rogers. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). As a PBS American Experience {{documentary}} noted, Pickford's {{relationship with her}} children was tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that [...] "Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. I think that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Jenny Harrison was named as a [...] "favourite" [...] to Shortland Street viewers. Harper herself {{did not enjoy}} playing Jenny when the soap began, but influenced the characters development with her own personality, she stated, [...] "At first, I thought Jenny {{was a bit of}} a victim [...] They've made her a stronger character now. I got sick of her being so passive. It was annoying to play and I don't think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> role model, either." [...] Jenny's abortion in 1995 was seen as highly controversial and several complaints were made to the Broadcasting Standards Authority, though none were upheld. A storyline featuring Jenny developing a cyst was introduced to the soap but never continued due to the writers effectively forgetting about it. This later became a codename, [...] "Jenny's cyst", for forgotten or misplaced storylines occurring in the soap. 2011 advertisements for repeats of the soap's original episodes, noted Jenny as one of the featured characters to entice an audience.|$|E

In many occasions, particularly at charity telethons, Fernández {{would be asked to}} sing the song as a closer, which she would do willingly.
