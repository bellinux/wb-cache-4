It was originally given the Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 7 but on 1 August was given the triangle N tail markings of the 444th Bombardment Group as a <b>security</b> <b>measure,</b> and had its Victor changed to 77 to avoid misidentification with an actual 444th aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>security</b> <b>measure,</b> The Football Association {{secretly}} manufactured {{a replica}} of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned trophy was indeed a replica and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E

30|$|There is a {{multitude}} of different IT <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> that companies can apply {{as part of their}} IT security strategy. These differ in their modes of action, but ultimately their effect on the possible extent of damage is decisive.

In contrast, other IT <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> have a more holistic effect on the information network such as process-related IT <b>security</b> <b>measures,</b> e.g., reduced damage potentials through improved recovery measures. Here, our structured approach serves as guidance in the derivation of an appropriate IT security strategy.

40|$|This paper examines, for {{the first}} time, the trade and FDI impacts of a North American Security Perimeter that would liberalize the post 9 / 11 <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> at the Canada-US border. First, the study {{estimates}} econometrically the impact of post 9 / 11 <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> on bilateral (US-Canada) trade flows using a gravity model. Second, using these econometric estimates together with a three-region nine-sector general equilibrium model, we compute sectoral tariff rates “equivalent ” to the 9 / 11 <b>security</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, we assess the (general equilibrium) impacts on trade and FDI of a change of security paradigm toward a North American Security Perimeter. The paper shows that the economic opportunity gains occurring to Canada and the US from the liberalization of the 9 / 11 <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> amount to US$ 20 billion annually. This figure, once added to the direct administrative costs of the post 9 / 11 <b>security</b> <b>measures,</b> warrants serious consideration in policy discussions of a North American Security Perimeter...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the terrible shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, our nation has turned its {{attention}} to school security. For example, several states have passed or are considering passing legislation that will provide new funding to schools for security equipment and law enforcement officers. Strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> in schools are certainly not new. In response to prior acts of school violence, many public schools for years have relied on metal detectors, random sweeps, locked gates, surveillance cameras, and law enforcement officers to promote school safety. Before policymakers and school officials invest more money in strict <b>security</b> <b>measures,</b> this Article provides additional factors that should be considered. First, drawing on recent, restricted data from the U. S. Department of Education, this Article presents an original empirical analysis revealing that low-income students and minority students {{are much more likely to}} experience intense security conditions in their schools than other students, even when taking into account neighborhood crime, school crime, and school disorder. These findings raise concerns that such inequalities may continue or worsen as policymakers provide additional funding for <b>security</b> <b>measures.</b> Second, this Article argues that strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> do not support long-term solutions needed to effectively prevent school violence. Indeed, strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> exacerbate the underlying problems by creating barriers of adversity and mistrust between students and educators. In addition, this Article offers recommendations to address the disproportionate use of <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> on low-income and minority students and to curb violence more effectively. It urges school officials and policymakers to support programs that build trust and collective responsibility instead of providing grants for strict <b>security</b> <b>measures.</b> Further, it recommends that the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights play a more active role in addressing the disproportionate use of strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> on minority students...|$|R

25|$|Credit card {{security}} {{relies on}} the physical security of the plastic card {{as well as the}} privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century a {{national}} awakening occurred in Finland. It {{was supported by}} the Russian central administration for practical reasons, as a <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> to weaken Swedish influence in Finland. This trend was reinforced by the general wave of nationalism in Europe in the mid-19th century. As a result, {{under the influence of the}} German idea of one national language, a strong movement arose that promoted the use of the Finnish language in education, research and administration. Many influential Swedish-speaking families learned Finnish, fennicized their names and changed their everyday language to Finnish, sometimes not a very easy task. This linguistic change had many similarities with the linguistic and cultural revival of 19th century Lithuania where many former Polish speakers expressed their affiliation with the Lithuanian nation by adopting Lithuanian as their spoken language. As the educated class in Finland was almost entirely Swedish-speaking, the first generation of the Finnish nationalists and Fennomans came predominantly from a Swedish-speaking background.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{nuisance}} raid by Japanese flying boats in May, Nimitz dispatched a minesweeper {{to guard the}} intended refueling point for Operation K near French Frigate Shoals, causing the reconnaissance mission to be aborted and leaving Yamamoto ignorant of whether Pacific Fleet carriers were still at Pearl Harbor. It remains unclear why Yamamoto permitted the earlier attack, and why his submarines did not sortie sooner, as reconnaissance was essential to success at Midway. Nimitz also dispatched his carriers toward Midway early, and they passed the intended picket line force of submarines en route to their station, negating Yamamoto's back-up <b>security</b> <b>measure.</b> Nimitz's carriers positioned themselves to ambush the Kido Butai (striking force) when it struck Midway. A token cruiser and destroyer force was sent toward the Aleutians, but otherwise Nimitz ignored them. On June 4, 1942, days before Yamamoto expected them to interfere in the Midway operation, US carrier-based aircraft destroyed the four carriers of the Kido Butai, catching the Japanese carriers at an especially vulnerable moment.|$|E
