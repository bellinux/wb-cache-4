40|$|A {{critical}} {{challenge for}} {{the integration of the}} optoelectronics is that photodetectors have relatively poor sensitivities at the nanometer scale. It is generally believed that a large electrodes spacing in photodetectors is required to absorb sufficient light to maintain high photoresponsivity and reduce the dark current. However, this will limit the optoelectronic integration density. Through spatially resolved photocurrent investigation, we find that the photocurrent in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors based on layered GaSe is mainly generated from the photoexcited carriers close to the metal-GaSe interface and the photocurrent active region is always close to the Schottky barrier with higher electrical potential. The photoresponsivity monotonically increases with shrinking the <b>spacing</b> <b>distance</b> before the direct tunneling happen, which was significantly enhanced up to 5, 000 AW- 1 for the bottom contacted device at bias voltage 8 V and wavelength of 410 nm. It is more than 1, 700 -fold improvement over the previously reported results. Besides the systematically experimental investigation of the dependence of the photoresponsivity on the <b>spacing</b> <b>distance</b> for both the bottom and top contacted MSM photodetectors, a theoretical model has also been developed to well explain the photoresponsivity for these two types of device configurations. Our findings realize shrinking the <b>spacing</b> <b>distance</b> and improving the performance of 2 D semiconductor based MSM photodetectors simultaneously, which could pave the way for future high density integration of 2 D semiconductor optoelectronics with high performances.

Ionic surfactants have strong effects on this iridescent system. We have interestingly found that the iridescent color changes with time after mixing DGI and ionic surfactants and the color in equilibrium state changes greatly with concentration of the ionic surfactants. The time-dependent color change results from the transformation of DGI aggregate structure after being mixed with ionic surfactant. It is first found that the iridescent color of this nonionic system can be changed from red to deep blue by altering the concentration of ionic surfactants added even though the total concentration of surfactant is almost constant. Such large blue shift of the iridescent color in equilibrium state cannot be fully explained by the ordinary undulation theory applied so far for this phenomenon. The flat lamellar sheets tend to curve by increasing the concentration of ionic surfactants to form separated onion-like and/or myelin-like structures.

40|$|Software cost {{estimation}} nowadays plays a {{more and more}} important role in practical projects since modern software projects {{become more and more}} complex as well as diverse. To help estimate software development cost accurately, this research does a systematic analysis of the similarity distances in analogy-based software {{cost estimation}} and based on this, a new non-orthogonal <b>space</b> <b>distance</b> (NoSD) is proposed as a measure of the similarities between real software projects. Different from currently adopted measures like the Euclidean distance and so on, this non-orthogonal <b>space</b> <b>distance</b> not only considers the different features to have different importance for cost estimation, but also assumes project features to have a non-orthogonal dependent relationship which is considered independent to each other in Euclidean distance. Based on such assumptions, NoSD method describes the non-orthogonal angles between feature axes using feature redundancy and it represents the feature weights using feature relevance, where both redundancy and relevance are defined in terms of mutual information. It can better reveal the real dependency relationships between real life software projects based on this non-orthogonal <b>space</b> <b>distance.</b> Also experiments show that it brings a greatest of 13. 1 % decrease of MMRE and a 12. 5 % increase of PRED(0. 25) on ISBSG R 8 dataset, and 7. 5 % and 20. 5 % respectively on the Desharnais dataset.
