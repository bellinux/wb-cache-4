50|$|Nutrients are {{important}} to the growth and survival of living organisms, and hence, are essential for development and maintenance of healthy ecosystems. Humans have greatly influenced the phosphorus cycle by mining phosphorus, converting it to fertilizer, and by shipping fertilizer and products around the globe. Transporting phosphorus in food from farms to cities has made a major change in the global Phosphorus cycle. However, excessive amounts of nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, are detrimental to aquatic ecosystems. Waters are enriched in phosphorus from farms' run-off, and from effluent that is inadequately treated before it is discharged to waters. Natural eutrophication is a process by which lakes gradually age and become more productive and may take thousands of years to progress. Cultural or anthropogenic eutrophication, however, is water pollution caused by excessive plant nutrients; this results in excessive growth in the algal population; when this algae dies its putrefaction depletes the water of oxygen.Such eutrophication may also give rise to toxic algal bloom.Both these effects cause animal and plant death rates to increase as the plants take in poisonous water while the animals drink the poisoned water. Surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> and erosion from high-phosphorus soils may be major contributing factors to this fresh water eutrophication. The processes controlling soil Phosphorus release to surface runoff and to subsurface flow are a complex interaction between the type of phosphorus input, soil type and management, and transport processes depending on hydrological conditions.|$|E
50|$|Mining {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} {{surrounding}} surface and groundwater if protective measures are not taken. The result can be unnaturally high concentrations of some chemicals, such as arsenic, sulfuric acid, and mercury over a significant area of surface or <b>subsurface.</b> <b>Runoff</b> of mere soil or rock debris -although non-toxic- also devastates the surrounding vegetation. The dumping of the runoff in surface waters or in forests is the worst option here. Submarine tailings disposal {{is regarded as a}} better option (if the soil is pumped to a great depth). Mere land storage and refilling of the mine after it has been depleted is even better, if no forests need to be cleared for the storage of the debris. There is potential for massive contamination of the area surrounding mines due to the various chemicals used in the mining process as well as the potentially damaging compounds and metals removed from the ground with the ore. Large amounts of water produced from mine drainage, mine cooling, aqueous extraction and other mining processes increases the potential for these chemicals to contaminate ground and surface water. In well-regulated mines, hydrologists and geologists take careful measurements of water and soil to exclude any type of water contamination that could be caused by the mine's operations. The reducing or eliminating of environmental degradation is enforced in modern American mining by federal and state law, by restricting operators to meet standards for protecting surface and ground water from contamination. This is best done through the use of non-toxic extraction processes as bioleaching. If the project site becomes nonetheless polluted, mitigation techniques such as acid mine drainage (AMD) need to be performed.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} nutrients (N and P) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations during high, intense typhoon storm and base flow periods from three watersheds (W 1, W 2 and W 3) in central Japan. Concentrations in base flow were low and relatively constant. In contrast, concentrations of N, P, and DOC in runoff during typhoon storms became highly dynamic. Particulate nitrogen (PN) and particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations in runoff were 4 - 50 times greater than those in base flow for all storm events. Because PN and PP concentrations were significantly correlated with suspended sediment concentrations, particulate nutrient transport {{may be associated with}} overland flow in forested hillslopes. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NO 3 -N, DOC and dissolved phosphorus (DP) concentrations in runoff were 1 - 10 times greater than those in base flow. All nutrients showed a clockwise, discrete hysteresis pattern, which implied that the sources of nutrients were from forested hillslopes. Additionally, the time constant (t 1 /e) calculated from a decreasing function suggested that particulate nutrients were mainly sourced from surface flow, whereas dissolved nutrients were provided from both surface flow and subsurface flow. The ratios of DOC: nitrate and UV: DOC suggested that higher values occurred in the early period of a storm event and was potentially related to the occurrence of overland flow. Our findings suggested that investigation of the parameters (e. g. DOC: nitrate and UV: DOC) were potentially useful for identifying sources of nutrients and potential applications of hydrological separation. Our results also contribute towards understanding the nutrient dynamics during intense storm events when various hydrological processes such as surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoffs</b> govern the nutrient concentrations in headwater streams.

At the outlet of the furrow of the experimental plot, only the surface runoff was collected and measured, whereas both the surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoffs</b> were collected at the drainage ditches outlets of the field and the small catchment. The present study showed that the relatively narrow range of rainfall amounts resulted in significantly different runoff amounts at all the three scales. When the ground water is close to surface, the runoff amount is a great percentage of rainfall amount. Significant linear relationships between the difference of rainfall and runoff amounts and the changes in water table or the initial water table depth were found. When the 30 events were divided into three groups with initial water table (as a parameter indicating the antecedent moisture condition) shallower than 0. 5 m, deeper than 2. 3 m or between 0. 5 m and 2. 3 m, significant rainfall-runoff relationships existed for each group. These imply that saturation-excess surface flow dominated the runoff response, especially when water table is shallow. For almost all the events, the water table rose above the bottom of drainage ditch during the event, and the total runoff amounts were larger at the field and the catchment than that at the plot with only surface flow measured, showing a great contribution of subsurface flow. Groundwater table depth, not only reflecting the antecedent moisture conditions, but also influencing the lateral sub-surface flow to the drainage ditches, would be an important parameter dominating runoff formation process in catchment like the study area with shallow water table and dense drainage system...|$|R
5000|$|Infiltration {{is caused}} by two forces: gravity and {{capillary}} action. While smaller pores offer greater resistance to gravity, very small pores pull water through capillary action in addition to and even against the force of gravity. [...] The rate of infiltration is determined by soil characteristics including ease of entry, storage capacity, and transmission rate through the soil. The soil texture and structure, vegetation types and cover, water content of the soil, soil temperature, and rainfall intensity all {{play a role in}} controlling infiltration rate and capacity. For example, coarse-grained sandy soils have large spaces between each grain and allow water to infiltrate quickly. Vegetation creates more porous soils by protecting the soil from raindrop impact, which can close natural gaps between soil particles, loosening soil through root action and enhancing the presence of soil organism like termites, worms and small mammals that have a direct impact on soil bulk densities. This is why forested areas have the highest infiltration rates of any vegetative types. [...] The top layer of leaf litter that is not decomposed protects the soil from the pounding action of rain; without this the soil can become far less permeable. In chaparral vegetated areas, the hydrophobic oils in the succulent leaves can be spread over the soil surface with fire, creating large areas of hydrophobic soil. Other conditions that can lower infiltration rates or block them include dry plant litter that resists re-wetting, or frost. If soil is saturated at the time of an intense freezing period, the soil can become a concrete frost on which almost no infiltration would occur. Over an entire watershed, there are likely to be gaps in the concrete frost or hygroscopic soil where water could infiltrate. [...] Once water has infiltrated the soil it remains in the soil, percolates down to the ground water table, or becomes part of the <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> process.|$|E

So far, many literature studies {{have investigated the}} hydraulic efficiency and the <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> coefficient of green roofs, showing their strong variability according to several factors, including the characteristics of storm events. Furthermore, only few {{studies have focused on}} the hydraulic efficiency of green roofs under Mediterranean climate conditions and defined the influencing hydrological parameters on the <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> coefficient. Nevertheless, for designing purposes, it is crucial to properly assess the <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> coefficient of a given green roof under specific climate conditions and its influencing factors. This study intends to, firstly, evaluate the <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> coefficient at daily and event-time scales for a given green roof, through a conceptual model implemented in SWMM. The model was loaded with both daily and 1 -min rainfall data from two Mediterranean climate sites, one in Thessaloniki, Greece and one in Cosenza, Italy, respectively. Then, the most influencing hydrological parameters were examined through a statistical regression analysis. The findings show that the daily <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> coefficient is 0. 70 for both sites, while the event-based one is 0. 79 {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 23 for the site in Cosenza, Italy. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the influencing parameters are the rainfall intensity and antecedent dry weather period with a confidence level of 95 %. This study demonstrated that, due to the high variability of the <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoff</b> coefficient, the use of a unique value for design purposes is inappropriate and that a preliminary estimation could be obtained as a function of the total rainfall depth and the antecedent dry weather period by using the validated multi-regression relationship which is site specific...|$|E

The intensive agricultural practices {{used in this}} region lead to an important risk for water resources by pesticides, especially during storm events. This {{is why we have}} paid special attention on storm events when a large quantity of contaminant was transported during hydrological periods. Fourteen molecules of pesticides (herbicides and fungicides) were investigated during the study period. Both of these groups are widely used for agricultural purposed in these catchments. The results achieved over the two years monitoring (2007 - 2009) enable us to emphasize the principal processes, implied in pesticide transfer on these agricultural catchments. The majority of compounds are detected during storm runoff events. And, the average concentrations of some pesticides are exceeded at the authorization limit of the European Union for pesticide concentrations in drinking water (0. 1 µg. L- 1 for individual pesticides and 0. 5 µg. L- 1 for total pesticides). To better understand the {{mechanisms of}} pesticide transport hysteresis, patterns on the concentration-discharge relationship (result of different concentration of pesticides in rising and falling limb of storm) were studied. However, clockwise or anticlockwise hysteresis patterns could be observed for some molecules of pesticide and their controlling factors such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and total suspended matters (TSM) according to their transfer dynamic in the catchment. We proceeded with hydrograph separation of the main stormflow components (surface <b>runoff,</b> <b>subsurface</b> flow and groundwater) so that the main pesticide routing could be traced for its soil-river transfers. We also {{came to the conclusion that}} there is a positive relationship between riverine TSM, DOC and pesticide, concentrations and the discharges of surface or <b>subsurface</b> <b>runoffs</b> according to pesticide properties. Pesticide flux calculation shows between 60 to 90 % of the molecule transport takes place during storm periods. Specific flux calculation also demonstrated the higher flux value in Save catchment than in Aurade with higher pesticide concentration for a given specific discharge. The latter result may be due to the more consumption of pesticide in Save catchment. The analyses of pesticides both in filtered and unfiltered water enabled us to estimate the distribution of pesticides into particulate and dissolved phases. Moreover, the pesticide flux values allow calculating average partition coefficients kd between dissolved and particulate fractions which present good relationship with Kow values (octanol-water) extracted from literature. The percentage of each pesticide transported as particulate forms is also well correlated to Kow...|$|R

In addition to traditional correlation analysis, we applied wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis to study variations in the correlation and lag time between the N and C time series for different time scales.

The main objective {{of this research was}} to assess the magnitude of the effect of land use changes on runoff parameters, using the Baghsalian watershed in Iran as a case study site. At first, land use maps of years 1986 and 2012 were prepared using synthetic method, and then simulation was done based on land use changes in the 1986 to 2012 period. Land use map of year 2030 was simulated using CLUE-s model. Spatially distributed hydrological WetSpa model was used to simulate runoff at daily scale with land use maps of 1986, 2012, and 2030. Total volume of runoff, peak flow, and surface flow were compared.

Soil water models based on column mass balance treat soil moisture contents {{as a result of}} meteorological inputs (precipitation, <b>runoff,</b> <b>subsurface</b> flow) and demands (evaporation, transpiration, percolation). The remote sensing approaches are based on measurements of the diurnal range of surface temperature and the crop canopy temperature in the thermal infrared, measurements of the radar backscattering coefficient in the microwave region, and measurements of microwave emission or brightness temperature. Advantages and disadvantages of the various methods are pointed out, and it is concluded that a successful monitoring system must incorporate all of the approaches considered...|$|R
5000|$|Physically based models (sometimes {{known as}} deterministic, {{comprehensive}} or process-based models) try {{to represent the}} physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of surface <b>runoff,</b> <b>subsurface</b> flow, evapotranspiration, and channel flow, {{but they can be}} far more complicated. [...] "Large scale simulation experiments were begun by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1953 for reservoir management on the main stem of the Missouri River". This, and other early work that dealt with the River Nile and the Columbia River are discussed, in a wider context, in a book published by the Harvard Water Resources Seminar, that contains the sentence just quoted.Another early model that integrated many submodels for basin chemical hydrology was the Stanford Watershed Model (SWM). The SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), the HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN) and other modern American derivatives are successors to this early work.|$|R
40|$|A {{fraction}} of applied irrigation water is lost by <b>subsurface</b> or surface (<b>runoff)</b> flow, this fraction is called tailwater [3], {{that can be}} stored, transported and re-used for irrigation. Thus, water and dissolved nutrients would be recycled in agricultural irrigated soils. Rationale, mechanism of action Surface irrigation in non-flat plots can promote soil particles and dissolved nutrients loss from soils [1, 2]. Losses of dissolved nutrients could be of particular concern after fertilizer application at a high rate, which may promote incidental losses of nutrients [3]. Water and nutrient that are lost can be re-used if an accurate system for storing and transportation is used. Design of these systems should be site-specific [4]. Applicability Tailwater capture, storage, and re-use is possible on irrigated fields after installing accurate systems for conducting, capture, storage, pumping and irrigation. Depending on the field slope, high energy costs and an investment in powerful pumps could be required. It is thus important to study the management costs of the system accurately...|$|R
