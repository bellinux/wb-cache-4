Later that year, Morley was replaced on drums by Grant Young.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke toured America with Fastway, {{supporting}} AC/DC, {{followed by}} a lengthy European tour, which produced 1992's <b>Say</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Will</b> – Live album. Fastway were also engaged to provide music for the Trick Or Treat film soundtrack, for which they composed the title track and performed [...] "Heft" [...] and [...] "If You Could See" [...] from their albums.|$|E
2500|$|In 1893, the {{distance}} between the pitcher and home plate was extended by nine feet, resulting in a dramatic increase in batting averages. The rule change helped Zimmer statistically, as he compiled a [...]308 batting average, the first of four [...]300 seasons. However, Zimmer bemoaned the rule change's effect on pitchers: [...] "They are making the pitcher a mere automaton. By and by they will make him stand on a cake of ice and pitch. <b>Say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>will,</b> the pitcher is the central figure in the game. People pay their money to see base ball, and the more scientific it is the better. When you put a pitcher out of sight and make a toy of him you are working squarely against the interests of the game, in my opinion." ...|$|E

[...] "I hear that the Admiral has made you and my cousin knights; and more than that, I heard half an hour since from De Valecourt that, while {{carrying}} despatches to the Germans, you had time {{to do a little}} knight-errant's work, and {{had the good fortune to}} save his daughter from being massacred by the Catholics. By my faith, chevalier, there is no <b>saying</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> come to, if you go on thus." ...|$|R
2500|$|The MDNA Tour has {{received}} positive reviews. A journalist from The Jerusalem Post described {{the show in}} Tel Aviv as an [...] "assault on the senses". He further comments, [...] "Despite the confused ideas underlying the performance, it's difficult to imagine somebody not enjoying a Madonna concert. <b>Say</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> about the Kabbalah-studying, gun-toting, fashionista of pop music– and everyone has something to say– but the woman knows how {{to put on a}} good show". Jon Parales from The New York Times wrote that [...] "the concert is a display of energy and nutty inventiveness, with Madonna costumed as everything from baton twirler to folk dancer", adding that it [...] "is less a story than an excellent excuse for extravagant, perpetually surprising production numbers involving more than three dozen performers, while it turns some of Madonna's past hits inside out." [...] New York Daily News called the show [...] "an idea-intensive, message-packed riddle wrapped in an enigma that must be seen to be believed", arguing that the show's risky artistry [...] "deserves praise." [...] German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost wrote: [...] "Madonna live in 2012 is still magical and unmatched", Newspaper El País said [...] "Madonna shows her intelligence, femininity and elegance in a danceable and spectacular show," [...] Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "With three decades of superstardom under her belt, Madonna has pretty much perfected the art of mass entertainment with a hint of scandal. So {{it should come as no}} surprise, even in the Holy Land, that her show would open with a giant cross, the clang of a church bell and cloaked clergymen"; while the show was given a positive review, the fact that the tour contains many songs from the MDNA album was criticized. Saeed Saeed from The National states the performance in Abu Dhabi saw Madonna [...] "bearing her soul". He says, [...] "While her previous Sticky and Sweet tour saw her lightly poking fun at herself and her various musical guises throughout the years, this concert was at times brutally dark and suffocating and as much an emotional exorcism as a performance".|$|E
