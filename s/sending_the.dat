40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the construction of}} a preset checking sequence that will not pose controllability (synchronization) and observability (undetectable output shift) problems when applied in a distributed test architectures that utilize remote testers. The controllability problem manifests itself when a tester is required to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> current input and because it did not <b>send</b> <b>the</b> previous input nor did it receive the previous output it cannot determine when to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> input. The observability problem manifests itself when a tester is expecting an output in response to either the previous input or the current input and because it is not <b>the</b> one to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> current input, it cannot determine when to start and stop waiting for the output. Based on UIO sequences, a checking sequence construction method is proposed to yield a sequence that is free from controllability and observability problems...|$|R
