500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, but it was <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise {{to keep in touch}} and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E

She said, 'I'm doing a movie about Wonder Woman. Do {{you want to be}} her trainer?' And I was like, 'Yes. Of course.' And the general of the Amazonian army. That was pretty cool." [...] Describing her character mentoring and training Diana to be a warrior, Wright said [...] "It's a sixth sense that it is coming and I think that's also in the mythological story behind Antiope and Queen Hippolyta. They know it's coming and it's her duty as the aunt to her young niece to make sure she is the fiercest warrior of all time." [...] On the Amazons fighting style, Wright said [...] "It's hand combat. Yes, swords and knives and arrows, but the precision that they have, right, as these warrior women; it's <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that disparity between what we had in the day of just raw fighting materials and the guns and how easy that is in comparison." [...] On the message of the film, Wright stated [...] "Is not just female empowerment. It's about love and justice. That's what the film's about. And what a great message to spread to our little ones." [...] Commenting about training for the film, Wright said [...] "The most empowering was to get into that physical shape. So we were doing horseback riding training, weight training, martial arts, and 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day".|$|E
40|$|It was <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{so many of}} you in {{the vibrant}} city of Palermo. For myself, as half Sicilian, I knew I had arrived home again, when {{ordering}} a white coffee at the airport I was asked whether I wanted a coffee with milk or milk with coffee!! It's the latter for me- a glass of frothy milk topped with a small Italian espresso, unparalleled anywhere in the world. Warmest congratulations to Manuela and the team from the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sicilia especially Paolo Tronca for the excellent organization of this workshop. In fact all our Italian colleagues {{could not have been more}} helpful. (Who can forget Antonio who seemed to be everywhere in his role as helper, facilitator and welcomer!) The Palazzo dei Normanni, which has been the seat of the Regional Sicilian Assembly since 1947, was a wonderful location. The spectacular Cappella Palatina was an added bonus and it is sufficient to quote the famous French writer Guy de Maupassant who defined it as "the most beautiful in the world, the most surprising religious jewel ever dreamt of by man". In the courtyard the vendors praised the location of their booths, enjoying exhibiting their wares al fresco and similarly the marvellous catering on the elegant terrace was enjoyed by all participants. The organization of the prompt bus service for both the scientific and social seemed to me one of the best I have experienced. I thought it especially thoughtful that they had also arranged a bus back to the hotels on Saturday afternoon for those not going on the Cefalu trip. Our Cluj conference in 2006 has a great example to follow! This issue is dedicated to the Palermo workshop and I do hope you will enjoy the photos and impressions as well as the reports of all the business meetings and the EAHIL Board and Council. My thanks to to everyone who sent in their photos especially Joyce Backus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Through the {{in-depth}} analysis {{of the features of}} Huabei rural industrialization, the unique factory regime in Baigou, Hebei, and the resulting special workers, this paper reveals two dilemmas the migrant workers in Baigou and larger Hubei area face: Because of the interpersonal network of labor market, personalized trade, familial labor process, and patrimonial management, the workers are unable to become either industrial working class or citizens. Facing this special group of workers, we still believe in their power of self-liberation. Drawing on Touraine’s action sociology and sociological intervention, and Burawoy’s public sociology and praxis-oriented research, we modify “sociological intervention ” according to the reality of Chinese society and propose the methodology of “strong sociological intervention ” whose vehicle is “Baigou Migrant Worker Night School. ” The night school provided workers with courses of labor law, English, and computer based on their actual needs. Labor law is the core to evoke the self-consciousness of the workers. Through communications in the night school and workers ’ real living circumstances, we collected their true information and treated it as the source of sociological knowledge. After three sessions of night school training, workers showed changes in skills, social, and psychological aspects, laying a foundation for the growth of self-consciousness. Keywords Factory regime. Publics. Social action. Sociological intervention It was the night of October 15 th, 2005 when I entered my classroom and saw all my students already there waiting for me. They were gossiping with each other and laughing excitedly. “ Hello everyone, ” Isaid, “ <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you again in English class of our night school.

He notes that {{at this stage in}} the series ‘the characters were well established with the viewers’ and ‘Dennis was able to have some fun sending them up.’ He compares Commander Shore and King Titan as ‘representing the older generation’s incomprehension’. He goes on to praise production and use of models, ‘Several other episodes are let down by close-ups of smaller versions which should only have been used for medium or long shots, <b>so</b> it’s <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the big version in all its glory.’ He does however describe the scene evolving Troy running as ‘a total failure and looks like the puppet is being stretched on a rack'. Vincent Law states that 'Titan Goes Pop' ‘sends up teen culture' and describes the episode as a classic.|$|R
5000|$|Frazer {{was created}} in 2006 along with another three {{characters}} created {{at the same time}} as part of a new group of characters branded [...] "20 somethings". Nicky Whelan, Natalie Saleeba and Christian Clark were cast as Pepper Steiger, Rosetta Cammeniti and Will Griggs respectively, around the same time as Ben Lawson was cast as Frazer after he was offered the role. Their inclusion in the serial was part of the producers attempts to introduce more contemporary characters, despite not knowing each other they all share the same house upon their on-screen debuts, a first for the series. Of the house share plot, Lawson stated during an interview with tabloid The Daily Telegraph: [...] "I've been in the worst share house. <b>So</b> it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> years of misery are finally paying off." [...] Before his debut in the serial Rosie was stated to be the object of his affections, stating Frazer just wanted to be part of a wealthy family. In September 2007 it was reported that Lawson had decided not to renew his contract at the end of the year, opting to pursue other projects.|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins]:Monday night. Dearest Judson, Golly, today went so fast. I wrote {{three letters}} and pasted a few {{pictures}} in my photograph album and it’s five o’clock already. I didn’t do anything I had planned to. Was {{going to get}} all my Christmas cards addressed but maybe I’ll get that done tomorrow. Honestly, I just can’t understand where the day went. Whenever I’m home the day goes so much faster. Tomorrow I have an appointment for the doctor’s but I’m going to call him 2 ̆ 6 see if I can make it Wednesday instead. Golly, honey, I hope all this week will go as fast as today did. It’s wonderful how fast they [sic] days go. I’ll have to stay home from work more often—Hah— Just talked to Charlotte 2 ̆ 6 Bobbie. Gee, honey, I miss you so much. You’re so wonderful and it’s so hard to be away from you. I love you so. You’re a bad boy. Why didn’t you buy your own Christmas presents? Calling Bobby up 2 ̆ 6 getting her to do it. Fine thing. Honey, {{what do you want to}} do this weekend? Ace may be home on Saturday. He has a chance of getting three planes. I wish you were coming home for seven days now, honey. That would be marvelous. Well, we really did have a lot of time, I guess. I[t] doesn’t seem as though we did but I guess we were pretty lucky. Gee, honey, I love you so. It’s so lonesome without you. How many times have I said that 2 ̆ 6 that I love you—I wonder. Millions probably. Woody should call any minute now 2 ̆ 6 let me know how she made out in school today. She was really tired. I was too but I slept until nine today. It was nice to lie in bed and not have to worry about getting up. Eileen Billet announced her engagement this weekend—we beat her to it. I’ll have to read it again and see when they’re getting married. I wish we were getting married Christmas but I suppose everything happens for the best. Honey, do you think we’ll be able to go south for our honeymoon? I hope that you’re stationed down there 2 ̆ 6 we’ll be able to get there that way. Have your orders come through from Maxwell Field yet? I’ll be praying that they do before Friday. Today was a horrible day. Looked as though it would rain or snow any second. How was it up at Stewart? Did you fly today? I wish that you’d get those couple of hours in and be able to come home early for Christmas. Honey, I wish you were here now. Gee, we could have a fire in the fireplace 2 ̆ 6 lie in front of it. Just you and I and grandmaw—nice and cozy like. Vaughn Monroe is playing “The Love I Longed For. ” All we did this weekend was ride in taxis. Gee, I love you so. Honey, please get some sleep this week; you were so tired this weekend. Do your ears still ring? Gee, honey, I can’t consentrate [sic] on anything but you. I love you so. It’s getting worse 2 ̆ 6 worse—I can’t even read or write anyone but you. The letters I write are all about you or to you. Do you want to go to the Meadowbrook this weekend? Should I call 2 ̆ 6 make reservations? How do you make them[?] Just ask them for a table for four? I’ve never had to but I imagined that’s the way. Gee, I’ve been sitting here 2 ̆ 6 looking at my ring. It[‘s] so beautiful, honey. Gee, I love you so. It will be <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you for a few days, I hope, this Christmas. I wish we never had to be separated. Hon, this war seems endless. It’s just been going on for so long that it doesn’t ever want to stop. Golly, I’ll be the happiest person in the world when this war ends 2 ̆ 6 we can be together forever. Won’t it be marvelous not to watch [the] clock 2 ̆ 6 rush to catch trains 2 ̆ 6 being able to be together whenever we want to be. Have to call your mother now. Be back in a while. I love you so, honey. Well, hon, I’m back again. I love you so. Think I’ll go to the city tomorrow 2 ̆ 6 do a little Christmas shopping. That should be a nice job for a commando. The stores are really mobbed at this time of year. You should see the millions of people in one store, all after the same thing—It’s murder. Honey, if you’re home after Christmas on Tuesday, we should go 2 ̆ 6 look at wedding rings. We won’t have time to do it in March. You[‘ll] want to get married the day you get home won’t you or would you rather wait a few days 2 ̆ 6 get rested from the trip? Woody was real tired and said she’d write Steve tonight. Gee, honey, I wish you were going to be home all this week 2 ̆ 6 next week and the week after that 2 ̆ 6 every week. Anyway, I wish we could be together forever. Honey, I wish I could decide what to get Nanny 2 ̆ 6 Mom. I guess maybe if I go 2 ̆ 6 look around I might find something. Gee, hon, I love you so. I’ll never be able to tell you how much. There just aren’t words enough. I’ll have to spend the rest of my life trying to. What a wonderful way to spend a lifetime. Steve 2 ̆ 6 Woody seem to be getting along rather well. Really in the groove or are they more in a rut. Just found out that I started to make a list of people to send Christmas cards to on this paper. What a dope I am. It wouldn’t erase very well so please just ignore it. Gee, honey, this weekend went so darned fast. This was worse than any of them because we couldn’t be out late Saturday night. That wasn’t fair at all. Can’t write much more because I haven’t any more paper around. I was a good girl today and stayed off my ankle almost all day. I should get a good conduct ribbon for that. Honey, when I’m with you I’m so happy. Everything is wonderful as long as we can be together. Wonder what you did today, honey? The only thing that I did well was miss you so much. That scribbling is the remains of that list. [Referring to a large area of scribbling in the right margin] Well, my darling, good nigh[t]. I love you. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E

5000|$|After election, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal {{government}} promised, on April 20th, 2016, that {{an introduction}} to new legislations, in regards to laws around marijuana, can be expected by Spring 2017. In response, Toronto immediately metastasized with illegal dispensaries willing and ready to sell marijuana to the public. Dispensaries and “Pot Shops” were taking over neighbourhoods by the dozen; immediate response from the municipal government was to shut them down. The Toronto Police Force raided 43 storefront dispensaries and arrested close to a 100 individuals. The optimism once instilled by Trudeau, while running for election as Prime Minister in 2015, was now encountering major abruption and an inevitable fade into the obscurity of the law’s double standards (especially when considering licensed producers such as Tweed, Bedrocan, etc.) On May 21, 2016, Young spoke to CBC News and expressed that [...] "The biggest problem is that nobody knows what's coming down the pipeline as they draw up this piece of legislation.

However, he felt that it [...] "did {{a pretty good job}} of picking up the threads of part one, {{particularly}} when it came to the importance of hope. It's been a while since the show has embraced the optimism of its premise, <b>so</b> it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> both Barry and Gyspy step up to the plate. Furthermore, I loved Harry and H.R.'s interactions, as Harry spent the entire episode reminding H.R. that he wasn't a genius. There was something weird about Tom Cavanagh's portrayal of Harry, who was grumpier than usual, but that's a quibble. Cavanagh is one of the show's best assets, and he makes H.R. work through sheer force of will". Agard gave the episode a B grade. Collider.com's Evan Valentine said that the episode [...] "was an extremely solid episode of the Flash, one of the better installments of the season in fact. It managed to play well on the series strength, though it was also hampered by some pacing issues ... "Attack on Central City" [...] was certainly ambitious. Dedicating an episode to the Flash team dealing with an army of sentient, super-powered apes from an alternate reality is a storyline that you'd expect from a comic book, but not so much from a prime time television show. Understandably, the show's budget didn't allow for the entire episode to be devoted to Flash fighting a telepathic gorilla twice his size, but thanks to the strength of the characters, we're able to forget about the special effect shenanigans and focus on the interactions they all have with one another". He gave the episode four stars out of five, praising [...] "the 'balls to the wall' method that the creators have taken in attempting to bring a comic book to life here".|$|R
