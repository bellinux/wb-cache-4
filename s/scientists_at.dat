5|$|Enrico Fermi {{and a team}} of <b>scientists</b> <b>at</b> the University of Rome {{reported}} that they had discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938. The sample was actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this was not known at the time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Scottish <b>scientists</b> <b>at</b> the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute {{concluded}} that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors {{often associated with}} pain in other animals. Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do. Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.|$|E

5|$|The Dayton Project {{began in}} 1943 when Monsanto's Charles Allen Thomas was {{recruited}} by the Manhattan Project to coordinate the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at various sites. <b>Scientists</b> <b>at</b> the Los Alamos Laboratory calculated that a plutonium bomb would require a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources used radioactive polonium and beryllium, so Thomas undertook to produce polonium at Monsanto's laboratories in Dayton.|$|E

5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was not one of}} the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project, and was developed independently by Philip H.

This was primarily due to doubts about the process's technical feasibility, but inter-service rivalry between the United States Army and United States Navy also played a part.|$|E
5|$|Wadham College, {{founded in}} 1610, was the {{undergraduate}} college of Sir Christopher Wren.

This group held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the College's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus which went on to found the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that <b>scientists</b> <b>at</b> Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E
