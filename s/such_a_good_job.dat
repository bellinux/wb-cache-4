Initially, Cafferty was only hired to write a few songs for the film, but he did <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of capturing the feeling of the 1960s and 1980s that Davidson asked him to score the entire film.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} rejections of the concept of desert was made by the political philosopher John Rawls. Rawls, writing in the mid to late twentieth century, claimed that a person cannot claim credit for being born with greater natural endowments (such as superior intelligence or athletic abilities), as it is purely the result of the 'natural lottery'. Therefore, that person does not morally deserve the fruits of his or her talents and/or efforts, <b>such</b> as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> or <b>a</b> high salary. However, Rawls was careful to explain that, even though he dismissed the concept of moral Desert, people can still legitimately expect to receive the benefits of their efforts and/or talents. The distinction here lies between Desert and, in Rawls' own words, 'Legitimate Expectations'.|$|R
40|$|In {{the regions}} of the so called "purple soils", in the State of São Paulo and Northern Paraná, coffee {{harvested}} from the ground is attended {{by a number of}} foreign matter among which lumps of soils of varying sizes make up the bulk of it. The separation of such lumps as attained by mechanical devices usually employed is always not satisfactory, the result being that remaining lumps will give a red color to the coffee beans, thus lowering the grade. Since the soil lumps have an appreciable amount of iron oxyde, mainly in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4); there would appear that the use of electro-magnets or permanent magnets of high power would give <b>good</b> results. <b>A</b> new machine "catador Dr. Isay" having rotative permanent magnets thus appeared in the market and tests were officiary run to determine its perfomance. It was verified that <b>such</b> machine performs <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> in the separation of small lumps, just the ones which are not efficiently separeted by other types of machines usually employed like "washers" (lavadores) "assorting machines" (seletores), and "stoners" (catadores de pedra). A theoretical study of the new machine "catador Dr. Isay" was also perfomed, showing that the following factors are likely to have an important bearing on its performances : a) centrifugal force to which the lumps are subjected which is dependent upon the velocity of the magnetic rolls and the lumps effective size; b) shape of the "entre-ferro"; c) characteristics of the material employed in the manufacture of the permanent magnet. In this respect it seems advisable to recommend the use of alnico alloys, mainly class 5 and 6...|$|R

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015, Garland participated in The Basketball Tournament (TBT), a five-on-five, single-elimination {{basketball}} tournament in which the winner out of the 96 teams wins a total of $1 million. He competed for a team made up of former La Salle men's basketball players, called 20th & Olney, reuniting with Ramon Galloway, Steve Zack, and Tyreek Duren. Explorers video coordinator Andrew McGlynn, who acted as the team's general manager and coach, said, [...] "The main reason [...] is how close the program is here. [...] has done <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of making it a family atmosphere around here". Garland was one of 50 players with NBL Canada experience that were playing in TBT. On July 18, 2015 at Philadelphia University, he debuted with 22 points in a win over Max's All Stars, {{a team led by}} Dominique Jones. 20th & Olney lost in the next round to Boeheim's Army, which was led by Hakim Warrick and Olu Famutimi, as Garland notched 21 points.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art, {{photographed by}} Brad Klausen, depicts an avocado {{cut in half}} with the seed still in place. McCready said, [...] "That symbolizes just kind of...

Let's throw an avocado on the cover. I think that's what happened, and our art {{director}} goes, hey, that's not a bad idea. I think we were watching the Super Bowl, and we had some guacamole or something." [...] Because the album is self-titled, many fans refer to it as [...] "Avocado" [...] or [...] "The Avocado Album." [...] The cover was named in Pitchfork Media's top 25 worst album covers of 2006. The liner notes art features footage from the [...] "Life Wasted" [...] music video, directed by artist Fernando Apodaca. The photographs involve the band members with their skin decaying and animals crawling in and out of it, as Apodaca felt the songs, [...] "Life Wasted" [...] in particular, fit [...] "my interpretation of the how fragile life is".

[...] The review continued, [...] "In these straitjacketed settings, Lewis' considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren't given sufficient room to fully emerge." [...] Time noted that Acid Tongue [...] "sprawl with misplaced ambition" [...] and that only the title track sticks. Another review observed, [...] "Lewis seems to be [...] on her way to a more definitive musical existence [...] but she doesn’t quite seem to know yet." [...] Acid Tongue was also slated for its [...] "hip-hop-like roster of unnecessary cameos. Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward of She and Him make sense, but Elvis Costello sounds intrusive during his duet on [...] "Carpetbaggers," [...] while the black Crowes' Chris Robinson is just superfluous."

With barely 4,000 men and only two cannon to hold off Joseph Hooker's 16,000 attacking troops, Cleburne deployed his division across both sides of the narrow pass, ordering them to conceal themselves from view and wait for his signal to spring their ambush. He had barely half an hour to wait, as the 33rd and their friends steadily backed into the gap; Matthews reports that his comrades from the other regiments had done <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of concealing themselves that he and his friends never noticed them until they had passed their positions. The 33rd was ordered to take its place with the rest of their brigade in the center of its line atop White Oak Ridge, on the pass's northern side.
