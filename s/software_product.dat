40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly difficult to ignore the complexity of <b>software</b> <b>products.</b> <b>Software</b> metrics are proposed to help show indications for quality, size, complexity, etc. of <b>software</b> <b>products.</b> In this paper, software metrics related to complexity are developed and evaluated. A dataset of many open source projects is built to assess {{the value of the}} developed metrics. Comparisons and correlations are conducted among the different tested projects. A classification is proposed to classify software code into different levels of complexity. The results showed that measuring the complexity of <b>software</b> <b>products</b> based on decision coverage gives a significant indicator of degree of complexity of those <b>software</b> <b>products.</b> However, such indicator is not exclusive as there are many other complexity indicators that can be measured in <b>software</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, we conducted a comparison among several available metric tools that can collect software complexity metrics. Results among those different tools were not consistent. Such comparison shows the need to have a unified standard for measuring and collecting complexity attributes...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{elements}} of the package will be the software package. The software package is a package in itself, because it consists of the different software components that together form the product. In contrast with the overall package, the software package is always a technical package in which all the files needed are combined in order to run the <b>software</b> <b>product.</b> Another concept of the software package is the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the <b>software</b> <b>product.</b> By relating it to the software package the vendor and the customer are able {{to keep track of the}} functionality and properties of the product the customer is using.|$|E

25|$|As {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} one, the {{delivery}} phase is in between the release phase and the deployment phase. A software vendor develops and releases a <b>software</b> <b>product</b> and afterwards it has to be transported to the customer. This phase is the delivery process. This process is highly complex because the vendor often has to deal with a product which has multiple versions, variable features, dependency on external products, and different kinds of distribution options.

25|$|A notable {{exception}} was the Executor commercial <b>software</b> <b>product</b> from Abacus Research & Development, the only product that used 100% reverse-engineered code {{without the use}} of Apple technology.

Executor filled a niche market for porting 68k Mac applications to x86 platforms; development ceased in 2002 and the source code was released by the author in late 2008. Emulators using Mac ROM images offered near complete Mac OS compatibility, and later versions offered excellent performance as modern x86 processor performance increased exponentially.|$|E
