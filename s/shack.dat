5|$|Krusty, {{refusing to}} submit to Bob's demands, takes refuge in a civil defense <b>shack</b> in the desert, which he uses to {{transmit}} a heavily improvised show. Bart and Lisa {{find their way into}} the cockpit of the Duff Blimp, where Bob, having lost his patience thanks to Krusty, tries to detonate the bomb, which {{turns out to be a}} dud. Lisa alerts the police to Bob's location, but Bob deflates the blimp and kidnaps Bart, before stealing the original Wright Brothers aircraft, which had been an exhibit at the air show. Bob attempts to carry out a kamikaze attack against the civil defense <b>shack</b> where Krusty is hiding, but the slow-moving plane ends up merely bouncing harmlessly off the <b>shack.</b> The authorities quickly arrest Bob and take him into custody while Bart is reunited with his family.|$|E
5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the <b>shack</b> where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the <b>shack,</b> and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the <b>shack</b> and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the current}} <b>shacks</b> were built {{beginning}} around 1920, there were <b>shacks</b> {{built in the}} dunes to house members of the United States Life-Saving Service, whose mission was to assist survivors of shipwrecks along the largely unpopulated coastline of the United States. These <b>shacks</b> were built by the Massachusetts Humane Society and were also designed to provide shelter and supplies to washed-ashore sailors whose ship might have been wrecked in a storm. The dune <b>shacks</b> are mentioned by Henry David Thoreau in his book Cape Cod published in 1865.|$|R
5|$|A {{slightly}} different {{version of the}} short story was featured in the November 1991 issue of Omni. The OMNI version concerns an unnamed girl and an old man named Skinner who live in the one-room <b>shack</b> built on top of the first cable tower of the Bridge. This version was collected in Gardner Dozois' 1992 anthology , and in Larry McCaffery's After Yesterday's Crash (1995).|$|E
5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} oil field <b>shack</b> while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for. While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of the <b>shack</b> into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the stairs {{to the top of a}} tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E

During this time Lazzell produced white-line prints and flower monoprints and she taught painting and block printing classes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century shipwrecks on Stockton Beach were so common that two tin sheds were {{constructed}} on {{a part of}} the beach in what is now Bobs Farm near Salt Ash to hold provisions for shipwrecked sailors. During the Great Depression of the 1930s a group of squatters constructed a series of tin <b>shacks</b> at the site which is approximately 11 km south west of Anna Bay. During World War II the <b>shacks</b> were torn down to make way for an Army camp. [...] Today, eleven of the <b>shacks,</b> known collectively as [...] "Tin City", remain but no new <b>shacks</b> may be built, nor can existing <b>shacks</b> be rebuilt if they are destroyed by the elements. Tin City and the beach's sand dunes were used for several scenes in the 1979 movie Mad Max.|$|R
50|$|Writers {{who wrote}} about the dune <b>shacks,</b> besides Thoreau, {{included}} Henry Beston, whose The Outermost House chronicles a season spent living in the dune <b>shacks,</b> and Hazel Hawthorne-Werner, who wrote Salt House about her year in the dunes in 1929.|$|R

5|$|Adkins {{was born}} in Boone County, West Virginia on April 29, 1937, where he spent his entire life. He was the {{youngest}} of ten children of Wid Adkins, a coal miner, and Alice Adkins, raised in a tarpaper <b>shack</b> on property rented from a local coal company. Born {{at the time of the}} Great Depression, Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to provide him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very brief time, as few as two days of first grade.|$|E
5|$|Alice (Milla Jovovich) {{wakes up}} disoriented in a mansion {{laying in the}} showers floor. She wanders through the halls, where she defeats several obstacles, {{including}} a deadly laser beam obstacle and a giant blade that falls from the ceiling. However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be a clone. The camera zooms out to show a <b>shack</b> camouflaging the facility's above-ground entrance - {{with the rest of}} the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.|$|E
2500|$|Witcher {{described}} {{the northern part}} of the Third Ward, which in his view [...] "more than any other in the Third Ward, call to mind the word 'ghetto,' Houston-style," [...] as having [...] "rows of shotgun <b>shacks,</b> worn frame houses and fraying apartments" [...] owned by absentee landlords. The section included crime, families affected by welfare dependency, unemployment, and proliferation of recreational drugs. In the summer residents of that area who wanted to cool down from the summer heat sat on porches and visited friends on the streets. The Third Ward area included many churches of varying sizes; some churches still attracted members who lived in Missouri City and other suburbs. The shotgun <b>shacks,</b> located north of Truxillo Street, are smaller and more cheaply built than the houses, and they have been historically occupied by working class African Americans. Some shotgun <b>shacks</b> have been continually occupied, and some shotgun <b>shacks</b> have been abandoned; some of the abandoned shotgun <b>shacks</b> have been boarded up.|$|R
60|$|I {{have made}} friends with the engine, but the <b>shacks</b> {{are still looking for}} me. At the next stop, the <b>shacks</b> ride out all three blinds, and as before, I let them go by and deck {{in the middle of the}} train. The crew is on its mettle by now, and the train stops. The <b>shacks</b> are going to ditch me or know the reason why. Three times the mighty {{overland}} stops for me at that station, and each time I elude the <b>shacks</b> and make the decks. But it is hopeless, for they have finally come to an understanding of the situation. I have taught them that they cannot guard the train from me. They must do something else.|$|R

5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden <b>shack.</b>|$|E

They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote <b>shack.</b> There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{damage was}} worst along the Indian River Lagoon; several farms in Stuart {{experienced}} total losses, and statewide, 16% of the citrus crop, or 4million boxes, were destroyed. Many chicken coops in Stuart were destroyed, {{and the local}} chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Indiantown. Across southeastern Florida, the hurricane damaged 6,465houses and destroyed another 383, causing over $3million in damage. One person, an African American farm worker, was killed when his <b>shack</b> blew down in Gomez, a brakeman died after sevenrailcars derailed, and a child was killed by airborne debris.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internment}} {{camps in}} the B.C. interior were often ghost towns with little infrastructure to support the influx of people. When Japanese Canadians began arriving {{in the summer and}} fall of 1942, any accommodations were shared between multiple families and many had to live in tents while <b>shacks</b> were constructed in the summer of 1942.The <b>shacks</b> were small and built with damp, green wood. When winter came, the wood made everything damp and the lack of insulation meant that the inside of the <b>shacks</b> often froze during the night.|$|R

After a period of time passes, Jake begins absentmindedly narrating the events around him. Finn and BMO are drawn into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration.|$|E
5|$|From 1944 to 1979, the {{configuration}} of Readville was static: the two-story depot served the lower level (Northeast Corridor) tracks, while the elevated track to Franklin and beyond was served by a small <b>shack</b> with stairs to the lower level. Starting in 1979, construction of the Southwest Corridor necessitated closure of the main line between Back Bay and Forest Hills. From November 3, 1979 until October 5, 1987, all Franklin Line and Providence/Stoughton Line service ran to Boston on the Midland Division via Readville.|$|E
5|$|I Want You is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, {{also known as}} Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and the erotic, sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar <b>Shack</b> (1971).|$|E

Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew and ask him to research the passengers.|$|E
5|$|On January 18, 1977, the Dade County Commission {{approved}} {{a law that}} would outlaw {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public services. Commissioner Ruth <b>Shack</b> proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40gay bathhouses across the United States, political and gay activist Bob Basker, and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the Human Potential Movement.|$|E
