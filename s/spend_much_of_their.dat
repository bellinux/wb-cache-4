5|$|Because banded sea kraits <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time on land, {{they are}} often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto reclused {{himself in his}} family {{compound}} in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto's family <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time feeding {{in order to gain}} enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E

50|$|In general, these snakes are {{arboreal}} to semi-arboreal, <b>spending</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> life in {{the forest}} canopy. Although there are exceptions, most attain adult lengths of 2 - 3 m.|$|R
5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E
5|$|Lions <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time resting and are {{inactive}} {{for about}} 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with {{a period of}} socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They {{spend an average of}} two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
50|$|These snakes are fossorial, <b>spending</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time hidden. They emerge at dusk to {{actively}} forage for frogs, other snakes, and small mammals. They are not venomous, and kill their prey with constriction.|$|R
50|$|Asian {{box turtles}} are terrestrial, semiaquatic or mainly aquatic, most <b>spending</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{time on the}} edge of shallow swamps, streams or pond that are dense with vegetation. Most are omnivorous, but {{carnivores}} do occur.|$|R
50|$|These {{clinical}} signs first appear approximately 1-2 weeks after infection. Birds infected with gapeworms {{show signs of}} weakness and emaciation, usually <b>spending</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time with eyes closed and head drawn back against the body. An infected bird may give its head a convulsive shake {{in an attempt to}} remove the obstruction from the trachea so that normal breathing may be resumed.|$|R
5|$|Muskrats <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time in {{the water}} and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, {{but they are not}} known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|The only genus {{that has}} {{retained}} the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, Laticauda, with only five species. These snakes {{are considered to}} be more primitive, as they still <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip. Laticauda species are also the only sea snakes with internasal scales, i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.|$|E

Loved One co-producer John Calley was a frequent visitor to Southern's Chateau Marmont suite, and he hired Southern to work on several subsequent Filmways projects, including The Cincinnati Kid and Don't Make Waves.|$|R
60|$|The prize {{which had}} thus {{fallen into the}} hands of the Norsemen was of great importance, because it {{furnished}} a large supply of food, which thus enabled them to go leisurely to work in establishing themselves, instead of, as would otherwise have been the case, <b>spending</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time and energy in procuring that necessity of life by hunting and fishing.|$|R
50|$|Otters {{are active}} hunters, chasing prey {{in the water}} or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, {{otherwise}} <b>spending</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic {{and live in the}} ocean for most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|R
5|$|Researchers {{speculate}} that acoustical mimicry {{is related to}} the level of interaction between the host and parasite. In the Phengaris genus, there are two different strategies: the cuckoo strategy used by P. rebeli and the predatory strategy used by Phengaris arion. In P. rebeli, the Phengaris larvae become integrated into the colony and are attended by worker ants. However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> life hiding in pockets of the brood nest.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and {{only a small part}} at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|They {{lose the}} {{diamonds}} {{in the plane}} crash and <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time on the island searching for them. Paulo suspects {{they are the only}} reason for their relationship, and thus does not tell Nikki when he finds them on their thirty-third day after the crash. One day while looking in the jungle, they come across the , a scientific research station built in the early 1980s. Nikki is uninterested, but Paulo later returns by himself on his forty-ninth day on the island, hiding the diamonds in the toilet. While in the washroom, Paulo overhears two of the mysterious and dangerous island inhabitants known as the Others speak of capturing some of Paulo's fellow survivors; however, he keeps this information to himself.|$|E

5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{time looking}} for {{food on the}} ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach {{to the head of}} a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} {{and must}} constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie {{still on the}} bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver {{the two of them}} into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E
5|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} {{are found in}} warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean it is found off the eastern coast of United States of America, the Gulf Stream, the Caribbean, and down past {{the southern part of}} Brazil. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from the Red Sea down to South Africa and eastward to the Andaman Sea. In the Western Pacific Ocean it can be found near Japan and north of Australia. In the Central Pacific Ocean, it can be found throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen in bays and reefs. They <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time swimming freely in open waters, generally in schools close to the surface, and can travel long distances in a day.|$|E
