25|$|With oil {{declining in}} importance, the Oil Creek area settled into {{an era of}} slower growth, with lumber {{eventually}} returning as its major industry until the hills and valleys were clear cut. Oil Creek State Park {{was part of a}} vast effort to reclaim the forests of Pennsylvania. The young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression worked to clear the forest and streams of dried brush, and replant the forests. They also built state roads, bridges and state park facilities. Through the efforts of the CCC and the later years of water and forest management, Oil Creek State Park is once again a wild area with a thriving wildlife population, diverse <b>second</b> <b>growth</b> <b>forest,</b> and crystal clean streams.|$|E

25|$|The lumber {{boom that}} {{swept through the}} hills and forests of Pennsylvania did not reach the Great Trough Creek area until 1910. At this time the area was a {{thriving}} <b>second</b> <b>growth</b> <b>forest</b> that had grown {{in place of the}} forests that were stripped during the industrial era. The mountains were stripped by the lumbering operation of Caprio and Grieco who had built a railroad into the area and built a sawmill at Paradise Furnace. The lumbermen took the logs to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber. Smaller logs were used to reinforce the mine shafts at the Broad Top Coal and Mineral Company mines in Jacobs, Pennsylvania. The only thing the lumbermen left behind was the treetops. These tree tops were left to dry. The passing steam locomotives on the railroads would ignite this dry brush causing massive wildfires that swept through the mountains and valleys. The Great Trough Creek area was left to waste. The forests struggled to regrow {{in the wake of the}} wildfire. The hills began to erode. The streams were dying and wildlife was scarcely found.|$|E

Children are taught to stay away and even learn, eventually, to stop asking why it is forbidden. Unknown to the Outsiders, it is filled with magical talking animals and people, some living in the pastoral, almost medieval conditions of North Wood, while the country of South Wood is industrialized with technology typical of the 19th and early 20th Century. North Wood and South Wood are separated by Wildwood, an untamed no man's land filled with bandits and ostensibly wild coyotes. Travelers, and the Postmaster's truck, make the risky journey from the northern and southern countries by the Long Road through Wildwood.
