In addition, mature black oak trees have the potential to develop cavities that provide cover, rest, and nest sites for two important western species: fishers (Martes pennant Erxleben) and great grey owls (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa</b> Foster) (Zielinski et al. 2004, Wu et al. 2015).|$|R

However, the heaviest (and largest winged) owls are two similarly sized eagle owls; the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) and Blakiston's fish owl (B. blakistoni). These two species, which are on average about 2.53 cm shorter in length than the great grey, can both attain a wingspan of 2 m (6.6 ft) and a weight of 4.5 kg (10 lb) in the largest females.|$|R
50|$|A 2015 {{study in}} California {{estimated}} {{there were fewer}} than 300 birds in the state at the time. The species is listed as Endangered under the California Endangered Species Act. The California range for the species includes a small extension of the Oregon population, north of Alturas. In addition breeding has been confirmed in the Tahoe National Forest east of Nevada City; in the Sierra Nevada foothills south of I-80 at around 2,000 ft elevation; and for the population clustered around Yosemite. In Yosemite is where the first nest south of Canada was found in 1914. A study of the Yosemite owls shows that this population has been genetically isolated from populations in Oregon and farther north for over 25,000 years. Biologists working on that study suggest that the Yosemite population {{should be considered a}} separate sub-species (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa</b> yosemitensis).

Because of their particular prey preferences, these predators {{are not likely to}} have induced an important bias on the representation of species. The high proportions of Microtus gregalis and Dicrostonyx torquatus, in association with the occurrence of Spermophilus sp. to a lesser extent, clearly confirm the existence of very severe weather conditions and indicate the presence of a steppe biotope. The associations of rodents therefore support the assignment of the studied levels to MIS 2, especially at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which is consistent with radiometric dating. Furthermore, the presence of rodent species closely related to moist habitats (Microtus agrestis, Arvicola sapidus and Arvicola amphibius) suggests that wet and wooded environments persisted next to the cavity and that the Erve Valley presumably was a micro-cryptic refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum...|$|R

40|$|We studied great gray owls (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa</b> Forster) in Yosemite National Park, California, {{measuring}} {{variables that}} could potentially influence patterns of occurrence and conservation of this state endangered species. We found that owl presence was closely tied to habitat (red fir (Abies magnifica A. Murray) and the abundance of meadows), prey, and snags across the landscape. We also found that indicators of human recreational activities negatively influenced owl distribution and habitat use. Great gray owls appear to prefer mid-elevation red fir forest with meadows that are drier and more productive in terms of small mammal populations. That these areas also have the highest human activity presents a paradox, both for individual owls and for the future conservation and management of this California endangered species. The extent to which human recreation in natural areas affects animal behavior, species distribution, and productivity is a growing issue in natural area management. We present information that will allow land managers to better understand how existing natural resources, coupled with human recreation, influence the distribution and habitat use of the great gray owl...|$|R

Annual surveys and long-term monitoring efforts are frequently conducted to determine the status of this species within its very limited range in the Sierra Nevada. Great Gray Owls are difficult to study because they are rare, nocturnal, and secretive. I investigated two bioacoustic techniques that {{may be useful to}} incorporate into current survey protocols and monitoring efforts of Great Gray Owls: (1) vocal individuality, and (2) the use of autonomous recording units (ARUs). 	To investigate the potential of individually distinct vocalizations for population monitoring, I recorded the territorial calls of 14 male and 11 female Great Gray Owls between March and July 2006 and 2007. Nineteen of these owls were recorded on multiple occasions within a season, and eight owls were recorded on separate occasions between seasons. Seventeen frequency and 15 temporal variables of the calls were analyzed from 312 sonograms.

5000|$|Despite the {{alternate}} common name of giant eagle-owl, the Verreaux's eagle-owl {{is not the}} largest owl or eagle-owl in the world. It is, however, a very large and powerful owl species. This species is both the largest owl found in Africa and the world's largest owl {{to occur in the}} tropics. Among all the world's owls, it is fourth heaviest living owl, after Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni), the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) and the tawny fish owl (Bubo flavipes), and is also the fourth longest living owl (measured from the bill to the tip of the tail), after the great gray (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa),</b> Blakiston's fish and Eurasian eagle-owls.

30|$|In forest fires, {{standing}} dead {{pines and}} kelo trees easily catch fire and burn partly {{and therefore they}} may comprise {{a significant amount of}} charred wood, to which some lichen species are specialized (Lõhmus and Kruustuk 2010; Fig. 8). In our study area 41 % of the kelos had been charred reflecting past fires in the landscape (Lehtonen and Kolström 2000). Substrate type diversity is also increased by disturbances such as broken tree tops, which were recorded for 52 % of the kelos. Also woodpeckers, for example the big Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), are known to make their nesting cavities in kelo trees (Fayt 2003), thus providing habitat for a number of other cavity nesting birds and animals, including Tengmalm’s Owl (Aegolius funereus), Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), Swift (Apus apus), bats and the Siberian Flying Squirrel (Pteromys volans). Thus, kelo trees can also potentially be an important structural component contributing to the “cavity web” in these forests (cf. Martin and Eadie 1999; Martin et al. 2004; Cooke and Hannon 2011). However, in our data only 12 (3.8 %) kelos were reported to have a cavity. It may be that kelo wood is so hard that only trees with decayed heartwood are attractive for woodpecker nesting. Large hollow and broken kelos can also be used for nesting by large owls such as the Great Grey Owl (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> (Fig. 8).|$|R
25|$|Owls, {{which may}} have {{dissimilar}} periods of activity, are not entirely exempt from golden eagle predation either. Several species have been recorded as prey, especially in Northern Europe, Slovakia (where owls make up 2.4% of prey remains) and {{some parts of the}} Western United States. Species hunted have ranged in size from tiny Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) and little owl (Athene noctua) to the formidable, large great horned, Eurasian eagle and great gray owls (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa).</b> Barn owls (Tyto alba) have been predated by golden eagles in both North America and Eurasia. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands, barn owls made up 4.5% of the diet, the largest known occurrence of that species in the eagles' diet. However, the great horned owl is the owl species that occurs most regularly in the diet of North American golden eagles. In Europe, golden eagles are relatively minor predators of owls compared to Eurasian eagle-owls and northern goshawks. The primary owls hunted by European eagles are Ural owls (Strix uralensis) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Few eye-witness accounts are known of owl predation, but one violent mid-day confrontation between a golden eagle and an adult great horned owl was witnessed in Jefferson County, Colorado. Although this owl was {{about a third of the}} eagle's weight, it was able to land some damaging blows on the larger bird. In the end, despite its wounds, the eagle was victorious over the dead owl.

50|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl is a {{very large}} bird, smaller than the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) but larger than the snowy owl, despite some overlap in size with both species. It is {{sometimes}} referred to as the world's largest owl, although Blakiston's fish owl (B. blakistoni) is slightly heavier on average and the much lighter weight great grey owl (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> is slightly longer on average. Heimo Mikkola reported the largest specimens of eagle-owl as having the same upper body mass, 4.6 kg, as the largest Blakiston’s fish owl and attained a length of around 3 cm longer. In terms of average weight and wing size, the Blakiston’s is the slightly larger species seemingly, even averaging a bit larger in these aspects than the biggest eagle-owl races from Russia. Also, although 9 cm shorter than the largest of the latter species, the Eurasian eagle-owl can weigh well {{more than twice as much}} as the largest great grey owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl typically has a wingspan of 131 - 188 cm, with the largest specimens possibly attaining 200 cm. The total length of the species can vary from 56 to 75 cm. Females can weigh from 1.75 to 4.6 kg and males can weigh from 1.22 to 3.2 kg. In comparison, the barn owl (Tyto alba), the world's most widely distributed owl species, weighs about 500 g (1.1 lb) and the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), which fills the eagle-owl's ecological niche in North America, weighs around 1.4 kg (3.1 lb).|$|R

50|$|Blakiston's fish owl is {{the largest}} living species of owl. A pair field study of the species showed males {{weighing}} from 2.95 to 3.6 kg, while the female, at up to 2.95 to 4.6 kg, is about 25% larger. Blakiston's fish owl measures 60 to 72 cm in total length, and thus measures slightly less at average and maximum length than the great gray owl (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa),</b> a species which has a significantly lower body mass. The Eurasian eagle-owl (B. bubo) is sometimes considered the largest overall living owl species. The three largest races of eagle-owl, all found in Siberia and the Russian Far East, are close in size to the Blakiston's fish owl. According to Heimo Mikkola, the very largest specimen of eagle-owl was 30 mm longer in bill-to-tail length than the longest Blakiston's fish owl, while the top weight of the two species is exactly the same. The longest great gray owl was 120 mm longer than the biggest Blakiston's fish owl but would be about 2.5 times lighter than {{the weight of the}} largest female Blakiston's. However, the average measurements of Blakiston's fish owl surpass the average measurements of the Eurasian eagle-owl in the three major categories: weight, length, and wingspan, making Blakiston's the overall largest species of owl. Even the large Siberian races of eagle-owl are slightly smaller on average than the Blakiston's, {{at least in terms of}} body mass and wing size. The maximum wingspan of the Blakiston's fish owl is also greater than any known eagle-owl. The wingspan range known for Blakiston's fish owls is 178 to 190 cm. The Blakiston's is noticeably larger than the other three extant species of fish owl.|$|R
50|$|This species {{measures}} 45 to 65 cm {{in length}} and spans 112 to 135 cm across the wings. Unlike in {{a vast majority of}} owl species, the male is slightly larger than the female on average. Most owls and raptors have reverse sexual dimorphism (RSD) whereas the powerful owl is considered to have normal sexual dimorphism (NSD) as do a majority of living (non-raptorial) birds. Body mass in males have been reported at 0.99 to 2.22 kg, with 13 males averaging 1.45 kg, while females can weigh from 1.04 to 1.6 kg, with an average in 9 females of 1.25 kg. Among all the owls in the world, the powerful owl is the ninth longest from bill-to-tail, the tenth heaviest and the eighth longest winged. Its body mass is about the same on average as the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) but has a proportionately much longer tail and wings than that species. The wing chord length further illustrates slight sexual dimorphism in favor of the male, with the male measuring 397 to 434 mm and the female measuring 381 to 410 mm. The tail can be 280 mm or more in length, the fifth longest of any owl with only the great grey (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> and ural owls (Strix uralensis) having proportionately longer tails. As a relatively geographically restricted species, there are no subspecies and no known geographic variation in the powerful owl. In comparison to the barking owl (Ninox connivens) it is much larger and lacks that species' white-spotted smoky-brown coloration on the upperparts and dark grey to rusty streaks on a whitish background on the underside. The other larger and relatively powerful owl found in Australia, the rufous owl, is not found in the same range in the wild so poses no identification problem.|$|R
40|$|Owls are {{efficent}} predators with a {{well developed}} auditory system adapted to localize the exact {{position of the}} prey. In captivity owls rarely {{get the chance to}} perform their hunting behaviour. Very few studies has been made on owls in captivity and none about environmental or behavioural enrichment. In BIAZA’s Owl Management Guidelines there is a small chapter about behavioral enrichment describing the lack of knowledge on the subject and emphasizing the importance of more research and the introduction of enrichment into the keeping routine. This study was performed on two Great grey owls (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa</b> lapponica) at Nordens Ark in Bohuslän, Sweden for twelve days. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether enrichment of a recorded sound of a prey animal could stimulate the owls’ hunting behavior. The aim was also to consider the possibility of feeding in the night using an automatic food dispenser to promote natural foraging behavior. Three different treatments were presented to the owls combined with four control days without enrichmet. A food dispenser, PetPod for cats, was used and placed in two different locations, combined with the recorded sound of a house mouse. The various treatments were (1.) LJ, sound enrichment - only sound was presented to the owls; (2.) VM, audio- and feed enrichment - presented the sound in combination with feed from PetPod hung on a pillar inside the aviary; (3.) MP, audio- and feed enrichment - presented the same things as VM but from the ground inside the aviary. The results showed that the owls activity increased by all treatments compared to the control. It also showed that the owls hunting behavior increased considerably and they also attacked the food from PetPod in a natural way. MP was the presentation that triggered the strongest responses and there is potential to feed the owls at night automatically in that way. Futher studies are required to refine the methods and learn how the responses to the sound enrichment develop over time...|$|R
40|$|During {{late summer}} 2001 in Austria, {{a series of}} deaths in several species of birds occurred, similar to the {{beginning}} of the West Nile virus (WNV) epidemic in the United States. We necropsied the dead birds and examined them by various methods; pathologic and immunohistologic investigations suggested a WNV infection. Subsequently, the virus was isolated, identified, partially sequenced, and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The isolates exhibited 97 % identity to Usutu virus (USUV), a mosquito-borne Flavivirus of the Japanese encephalitis virus group; USUV has never previously been observed outside Africa nor associated with fatal disease in animals or humans. If established in central Europe, this virus may have considerable effects on avian populations; whether USUV has the potential to cause severe human disease is unknown. sutu virus (USUV) is a relatively unknown member of the mosquito-borne cluster within the Flavivirus genus, closely related to important human pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), and West Nile virus (WNV) (1 – 3). Isolated for the first time from mosquitoes in South Africa in 1959 and named after a river in Swaziland (4), USUV was sporadically isolated from several mosquito and bird species over the next decades (5 – 7). Only two isolations have been reported from mammals, one from Praomys sp. (African soft-furred rats) and one from a man with fever and rash (5). The virus has never been associated with severe or fatal diseases in animals or humans, and it has never before been observed outside tropical and subtropical Africa. From the beginning of August through mid-September 2001, a considerable die-off of Eurasian Blackbirds (Turdus merula) was observed in and around Vienna, Austria.

40|$|In {{a rapidly}} {{changing}} climate, effective bird conservation requires not only reliable information about the current vulnerability of species of conservation concern, but also credible projections of their future vulnerability. Such projections may enable managers to preempt or reduce emerging climate-related threats through appropriate habitat management. We used NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to predict vulnerability to climate change of 168 bird species that breed in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, USA. The CCVI assesses species-specific exposure and sensitivity to climate change within a defined geographic area, through the integration of (a) species' range maps, (b) information about species' natural history traits and ecological relationships, (c) historic and current climate data, and (d) spatially explicit climate change projections. We conducted the assessment under two different downscaled climate models with divergent projections about future precipitation {{through the middle of}} the 21 st century. Assessments differed relatively little under the two climate models. Of five CCVI vulnerability ranking categories, only one species, White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), received the most vulnerable rank, Extremely Vulnerable. No species received the second-highest vulnerability ranking, Highly Vulnerable. Sixteen species scored as Moderately Vulnerable using one or both climate models: Common Merganser (Mergus merganser), Osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Prairie Falcon (Falco mexicanus), Spotted Sandpiper (Actitis macularius), Great Gray Owl (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa),</b> Black Swift (Cypseloides niger), Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), American Dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), American Pipit (Anthus rubescens), Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch (Leucosticte tephrocotis), Pine Grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator), and Evening Grosbeak (Coccothraustes vespertinus). Species associated with alpine/subalpine habitats and aquatic habitats received significantly more vulnerable rankings than birds associated with other habitats. In contrast, species of foothill, sagebrush, and chaparral habitats ranked as less vulnerable than other species, and our results suggest these species may respond to climate change in the region with population increases or range expansions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2012 The great gray owl (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> {{has been}} a state {{endangered}} species in California since 1980 because of low population size. Annual productivity of the great gray owl in California {{is thought to be}} largely dependent on vole (Microtus spp.) and pocket gopher (Thomomys spp., hereafter gopher) abundance, yet the factors influencing these prey populations have not been thoroughly investigated. The abundance of voles and gophers has been influenced by vegetation and cattle grazing in other regions, and many meadows are grazed within the breeding range of the great gray owl in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Therefore I evaluated the influence of vegetation and cattle grazing on great gray owl foraging habitat by quantifying vole abundance, gopher abundance, and vegetative conditions in grazed and ungrazed meadows during owl nestling and fledgling stages. I surveyed 17 grazed and 15 ungrazed meadow sites in 2010, and 19 grazed and 19 ungrazed meadow sites in 2011. I found that vole presence was positively associated with plant sward height and corn lily (Veratrum californicum) dominance; vole abundance was weakly negatively associated with cattle grazing. Gopher abundance was negatively associated with site wetness, and positively associated with stem density, the frequency of forb presence, cattle grazing, and the dominance of corn lily. When managing meadows for great gray owl conservation, cattle grazing and vegetation should be monitored to accommodate the habitat relationships of both voles and gophers. Management of owl prey may be most efficient by prioritizing wet meadow sites for voles since gophers were not likely to be abundant in wet sites, and vole abundance has been correlated with moist soils in other studies. Therefore particularly in areas with moist soils, I recommend maintaining plant sward height commensurate with the habitat relationships of voles found in this study.

[...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2013 Eight owl {{species of}} special concern {{occur in the}} Sierra Nevada: California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), Long-eared Owl (Asio otus), Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), Great Gray Owl (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa</b> nebulosa), Flammulated Owl (Otus flammeolus), Elf Owl (Micrathene whitneyi), and Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus). Additionally, four other owl species occur in the Sierra Nevada: Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), Northern Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium gnoma), Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus), and Western Screech Owl (Megascops kennicottii). Outside of the {{extensive}} demographic monitoring efforts focused on the California spotted owl and Great Gray Owl, there are no current inventory or monitoring efforts directed at the majority of owl species in the Sierra Nevada. In this study I explored passive bioacoustic methods and techniques for multi-species inventory and monitoring of the Long-eared Owl and Great Horned Owl in the Sierra Nevada. I focused on testing the methods and techniques within meadow vegetation types and surrounding conifer and mixed conifer-hardwood ecotones. During the 2009 field season I passively recorded owl species with Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs) at 50 sites divided evenly between Yosemite National Park and Stanislaus National Forest. Detection histories were constructed and used to estimate occupancy (the probability of a random site being occupied, ??) and detectability (the probability of detecting an individual at an occupied site given the individual is detected, p) using program MARK and RMARK. Covariates such as meadow location (Yosemite National Park (YOSE) or Stanislaus National Forest (STNF)), survey duration, and meadow size were incorporated to model occupancy and detectability. Despite 50 sample sites and 11, 781 hours of recordings, results suggest that passive bioacoustic methods {{may not be an}} efficient technique for multi-species monitoring of owl species given low detection rates for uncommon species and high variability in occupancy and detection rates for common species (e. g., Long-eared Owl; ?? = 0. 020 p = 0. 420, and Great Horned Owl; ?? = STNF = 0. 500 and YOSE = 0. 465, p = STNF = 0. 423 and YOSE = 0. 415). This suggests that effective implementation of passive bioacoustic methods for multi-species monitoring of owl species may require greater sampling intensity or improved technology and methods than that used in this study. Further research to evaluate the ecological factors that contribute to variability in occupancy and detection rates across owl species should also improve using passive bioacoustics methods. Additionally, incorporating active broadcasts of species-specific owl territorial calls may be an approach for increased efficiency of bioacoustics methods for monitoring multiple owl species...|$|R
60|$|In {{the deepest}} snows, the path which I used {{from the highway}} to my house, {{about half a mile}} long, might have been {{represented}} by a meandering dotted line, with wide intervals between the dots. For a week of even weather I took exactly the same number of steps, and of the same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks--to such routine the winter reduces us--yet often they were filled with heaven's own blue. But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree, or a yellow birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and snow causing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had changed the pines into fir trees; wading to the tops of the highest hills when the show was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a barred owl (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he would stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus with his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There was only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote that interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them. Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way, as it were, with his sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace await the dawning of his day.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 In {{the field}} of forest planning, {{assumptions}} regarding the appropriate modeling of management behavior, translated through management prescriptions, minimum harvest ages, green-up periods, and other variables are needed if a stand-level optimization process is not used to guide the selection of stand management regimes Forest planners thus generally have a few options regarding the level of detail of management intentions they can model, from detailed, finely-tuned assumptions to coarser, less detailed assumptions. The question of interest to this study is whether similar forest plan results can be obtained over a range of detail assumed in the management intentions. With that in mind, forest plans are developed under three different levels of detail of management intentions. Using a simulated annealing heuristic, forest plans were developed for a 95, 063 acre eastern Oregon private industrial forest, covering a fifty-year planning horizon. Within this landscape 32, 782 acres were even-aged forests, 22, 106 acres were uneven-aged, and 40, 175 acres were indicated as meadow or grassland. A {{survey conducted by the}} Oregon Department of Forestry was used to define the management intentions. The finest level of detail was one where all of the management intention data available were used, allowing prescriptions to be developed by site class and species breakdowns. The intermediate level of detail, called the medium scale, represented management intentions, and hence prescriptions, developed by species information only, since site class information is generally difficult to obtain in a geographic information system (GIS) database across broad landscapes. The most aggregated level of detail was called the coarse scale. Here both site class and species information was ignored, and a generalized idea of what the management intentions, hence prescriptions, would be on uneven-aged and even-aged stands in eastern Oregon was developed. Measure of economic, or commodity production, results were represented by net present value (NPV), timber volume production, and harvested acres. One measure of ecological value (great gray owl, <b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa,</b> nesting habitat) was also evaluated in the ensuing forest plans. No significant differences in owl habitat were found across the three levels of detail in management intentions. However, {{a significant difference in the}} NPVs generated among the three management intention scales was observed. A non-parametric rank sum test showed that the mean of the values of the NIPV were significantly different (all combinations having a one-sided p-value < 0. 0001). In addition, large differences in the timing of harvest volumes, and hence revenue generated and acres treated, were observed. This analysis indicates that if resources are available (databases, time budget), the finest level of detail should be used when developing forest plans in order to produce the most accurate results in forest planning efforts...|$|R
2500|$|Hunting mainly {{consist of}} the owl {{watching}} from a perch for prey activity and then swooping down swiftly once prey is spotted. The prey is often killed quickly by the eagle owl's powerful grip and talons though is sometimes bitten {{on the head}} to be killed as well. Then the prey item is swallowed whole or torn into pieces with the bill. The same basic hunting and killing methods are used by all owls in the Bubo genus, except that the [...] snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) and fish owls regularly watch for prey from a ground position (on a bank {{in the case of}} fish owls). Most hunting occurs in wood-cloaked openings, often those carved out by wetlands or watersheds. While they can and do hunt within woodlands, they are not well suited to hunting in areas with dense understories, thick foliage or tree thickets, as they seem to hunt firstly by vision and only secondarily by sounds, unlike some other owls. Eurasian eagle-owls are too heavy with relatively modest wing areas to hunt extensively on the wing although this species’ relatively short, broad wings allow it low-speed maneuverability in the moments are it takes off after they spot a prey item. Because of the limits of its flying abilities, the Eurasian eagle-owl requires ample, elevated perches from which to watch for prey activity and thus in most areas it will not hunt extensively in open, treeless areas, unlike smaller owls like the barn owl (Tyto alba). Tree branches are often the main hunting perches used but they will also use rock formations, rubble with large rocks, hills with tall grasses or even a building, tall pole or other elevated manmade perch. Occasionally, they may capture other birds on the wing, including nocturnal migrants, taking advantage of their distraction and diminished visual acuity to intercept them in mid-flight. They seem to hunt mostly by opportunity, taking whatever detectable prey item that is available, preferably those that are active. Most prey, even up to the size of small rabbits, are swallowed whole. While a small rodent can easily be swallowed in an instant, if the prey item is large, the swallowing process can appear grueling and grotesque and in some cases eagle-owl nestlings have choked to death while attempting to swallow overly large prey (i.e. moorhens). Small prey is often swallowed immediately after capture by the eagle-owl, although occasionally small prey items are also carried in the bill to the nest for the young or to a roost for quick consumption. Larger prey is normally carried in the owl’s feet and is more likely than smallish prey to be brought to the nest due to its nutritional value. Exceptionally large prey (probably any over [...] ) is consumed on the ground where it is killed, possibly being torn apart into management pieces. This leaves the owl vulnerable to loss of their prey to scavengers or to confrontations with heavier predators. The undigestable portions of prey are regurgitated in the form of pellets as in all owls. Pellets of the Eurasian eagle-owl average around , thus they are around the same size as those of most other large Bubo owls, even the notably smaller great horned owl (B. virginianus). In some cases, pellets of Bubo owls can range up to [...] in length. Eagle-owl pellets average slightly larger (about 10%) than those of great grey owls (<b>Strix</b> <b>nebulosa).</b> As is the case with all owls, pellets are indisputably the best method to examine the main diversity of prey consumed by an owl. However, {{it is also important to}} examine the prey remains left around a roost or nest when available. Larger prey, which may be torn apart before the eating of portions or fleshy parts of the prey item, is frequently determined solely by remains rather pellets as are birds, in which the wings, feet and some feathers may be removed before consumption. As in the great horned owl, after capturing larger prey, the Eurasian eagle-owl often beheads it. In part, this may be due to making prey easier to carry off and, in both large owl species, it is considered a signature indicator for predator identification.|$|R
