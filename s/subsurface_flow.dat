25|$|Though widespread, {{systematic}} contamination by {{hydraulic fracturing}} has been heavily disputed, one {{major source of}} contamination that has the most consensus among researchers of being the most problematic is site-specific accidental spillage of hydraulic fracturing fluid and produced water. So far, a significant majority of groundwater contamination events are derived from surface-level anthropogenic routes rather than the <b>subsurface</b> <b>flow</b> from underlying shale formations. Examples of such events include: a fracking fluid spillage in Acorn Fork Creek, Kentucky that caused a widespread death among aquatic species in 2007; a 420,000 gallon spillage of hyper-saline produced water that turned a once very-fertile farmland in New Mexico into a dead-zone in 2010; and a 42,000 gallon fracking fluid spillage in Arlington, Texas that necessitated an evacuation of over a 100 homes in 2015. While the damage can be obvious, and much more effort {{is being done to}} prevent these accidents from occurring so frequently, the lack of data from fracking oil spills continue to leave researchers in the dark.
