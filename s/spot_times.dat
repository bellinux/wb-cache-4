40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{and execution of}} ramp area operations is a challenging task. Unlike aircraft maneuvers on taxiways, ramp area aircraft maneuvers are typically not confined to well-defined trajectories. The stochastic nature can force ramp area aircraft to slow down or stop along routes to the taxiway spot to avoid a loss of separation. To address this, we provide a tool for ramp controllers to help meet the assigned taxiway <b>spot</b> <b>times.</b> We formulate a mixed integer linear program model to compute the optimal push back windows that ensure conflict free trajectories. Initiating the push back within the optimal window ensures each departing aircraft can proceed along the route to the taxiway spot without having to slow down or stop for other traffic. I...|$|E
40|$|As {{the amount}} of air traffic {{increases}} over the years, most airports simply {{do not have the}} means of expanding to handle the intensified traffic on the surface that will ensue. Precise surveillance equipment and automation concepts, as well as advanced surface traffic algorithms are being developed to improve airport efficiency. These surface algorithms require inputs unique to each airport to ensure maximum efficiency, and minimal taxi delay. This study analyzes surface traffic at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) to determine the effect of the number of aircraft on the surface and {{the amount of}} stop and go situations they experience to the amount of additional taxi time encountered. If the surface capacity of an airport is known, minimal delay can be accomplished by limiting the number of taxiing aircraft to that capacity. This concept is related to highways, where traffic flow drastically decreases as more cars occupy the road. An attempt to minimize this effect on highways is seen with the use of metering lights at freeway on-ramps. Since the surface traffic at airports is highly regulated, and aircraft are less mobile on the ground, limiting the surface count to a certain number can greatly reduce the amount of additional taxi time encountered, as well as reduce hazardous emissions. This study will also find the regions of an airport that encounter the most additional taxi time when the number of aircraft in that area is increased. This could help surface traffic algorithms avoid congesting that area, or re-route aircraft to different runways when that area reaches its capacity. The relationship between the amount of stop and go situations an aircraft encounters and their effect on the taxi time of that aircraft will also be investigated. This will help to determine the effect of holding an aircraft on the taxiway as opposed to re-routing it. The lesser of the two should be used when developing surface traffic algorithms to further minimize the delay encountered. The fields investigated in this study include taxi time, the number of aircraft on the surface, the number of stop and go situations, and the time stopped for each aircraft. Taxi time is defined as spot to runway for departures, and runway to spot for arrivals. It does not include ramp area taxi time because the ramp area is controlled differently, and surface traffic schedulers do not currently incorporate them. Taxi time is found by finding the difference between take-off time (OFF) and spot crossing time for departures, and spot crossing time and landing time (ON) for arrivals. All surface data was either found directly using the Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA), a tool to analyze the Surface Management System (SMS) generated log files, or indirectly from SODAA using Matlab to derive values from SODAA data. The number of aircraft on the surface is found by looping through the ON times, OFF times, and <b>spot</b> <b>times</b> for each aircraft during a particular day. For each departure aircraft, surface counts are taken at its spot crossing and OFF time. The average of these two is used as the surface count for that aircraft. For arrivals, surface counts are taken at its ON time and its spot crossing time. The average of these two is used...|$|E

40|$|In the {{introductory}} definition of <b>spots</b> of <b>time,</b> Wordsworth claims that these important childhood episodes are virtuous {{and worthy of}} celebration. This definition is incongruous with the episodes considered independently, because they reveal themselves as essentially disturbing memories.

The following study is a Freudian reading of Wordsworth's <b>spots</b> of <b>time</b> in their various stages of revision.

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{usefulness}} of urine sodium (Na) excretion in <b>spot</b> or <b>timed</b> urine samples to estimate population dietary Na intake relative to the gold standard of 24 -hour (h) urinary Na. Methods. An electronic literature search was conducted of MEDLINE (from 1950) and EMBASE (from 1980) {{as well as the}} Cochrane Library using the terms “sodium,” “salt,” and “urine. ” Full publications of studies that examined 30 or more healthy human subjects with both urinary Na excretion in 24 -h urine and one alternative method (<b>spot,</b> overnight, <b>timed)</b> were examined. Results. The review included 1 380 130 participants in 20 studies. The main statistical method for comparing 24 -h urine collections with alternative methods was the use of a correlation coefficient. <b>Spot,</b> <b>timed,</b> and overnight urine samples were subject to greater intraindividual and interindividual variability than 24 -h urine collections. There was a wide range of correlation coefficients between 24 -h urine Na and other methods. Some values were high, suggesting usefulness (up to r = 0. 94), while some were low (down to r = 0. 17), suggesting a lack of usefulness. The best alternative to collecting 24 -h urine (overnight, <b>timed,</b> or <b>spot)</b> was not clear, nor was the biological basis for the variability between 24 -h and alternative methods. Conclusions. There is great interest in replacing 24 -h urine Na with easier methods to assess dietary Na. However, whether alternative methods are reliable remains uncertain. More research, including the use of an appropriate study design and statistical testing, is required to determine {{the usefulness of}} alternative methods...|$|R
