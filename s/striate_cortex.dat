It is generally agreed that information flow within the cortex follows a hierarchical configuration.

From this it was postulated that information flowed outwards in a feed forward fashion; the complex end products eventually binding to form a percept. However, via fMRI and intracranial recording technologies, {{it has been observed}} that the activation time of successive levels of the hierarchy does not correlate with a feed forward structure.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{clinical}} outcomes of brain lesions necessitates knowing the networks of cerebral structures {{that constitute the}} substratum of cognitive or sensorimotor functions. This is achieved by interpreting activation data obtained, during {{the performance of a}} task, through functional neuroimaging techniques. The difficulty is that no one-to-one correspondence between activated networks and functions can be found. Actually, neuroimaging methods aim at analyzing specifically the activation. They are used to localize spatially and temporally the activated areas, to detect the different areas participating in the same function, and to determine the role of anatomical links on the activation. Clearly, an interpretative method explaining how the activation of large-scale networks derives from the cerebral information processing mechanisms involved in the task performance is missing. Our goal is to provide such a tool. At this global level of representation, the human brain can be considered as a dynamic biological system that can be best modeled by a dynamic Bayesian network. Our modeling approach is based on the anatomical connectivity of cerebral regions, the information processing within cerebral areas and the causal influences that connected regions exert on each other.

Single letters, subtending a visual angle of 0. 35 degrees, were foveally presented for 10 ms and were immediately followed by a mask. We investigated 30 different delays (d), defined as the time between the onset of the visual stimulus and the onset of the magnetic stimulus, from d = - 100 ms to d = + 190 ms, and 4 different midsagittal coil positions (x), defined as the distance between the lower edge of the coil and the upper edge of the inion, from x = 1 cm to x = 7 cm. Three out of four subjects showed three distinct delay intervals (dips) at which application of TMS resulted in an impairment of the task. The first dip was centred around d = - 50 ms and occurred independently of the coil position; the second dip was centred around d = 0 ms and was elicitable only with the two lowest coil positions; the third dip was centred around d = 100 ms and was also elicitable only with the lower coil positions. In the fourth subject, only the first and the third dip were found.

Here we parametrically modulated the relative orientation of stimuli and their backgrounds to investigate the neural correlates of pop-out in visual cortex while subjects were performing a demanding fixation task in a scanner. Whole brain and region of interest analyses confirmed a representation of orientation contrast in extrastriate visual cortex (V 4), but not in <b>striate</b> visual <b>cortex</b> (V 1). Thus, although previous studies have shown that human V 1 can be involved in orientation pop-out, our findings demonstrate that there are cases where V 1 is “blind” and pop-out detection is restricted to higher visual areas.

40|$|Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{of the visual}} system {{that is associated with}} disrupted binocular vision during early childhood. There is evidence that the effects of amblyopia extend beyond the primary visual cortex to regions of the dorsal and ventral extra <b>striate</b> visual <b>cortex</b> involved in visual integration. Here we review the current literature on global processing deficits in observers with either strabismic, anisometropic or deprivation amblyopia. A range of global processing tasks have been used to investigate the extent of the cortical deficit in amblyopia including: global motion perception, global form perception, face perception and biological motion. These tasks appear to be differentially affected by amblyopia. In general, observers with unilateral amblyopia appear to show deficits for local spatial processing and global tasks that require the segregation of signal from noise. In bilateral cases, the global processing deficits are exaggerated, and appear to extend to specialized perceptual systems such as those involved in face processing...|$|R
40|$|Emotional attention, the {{boosting}} of {{the processing}} of emotionally relevant stimuli, has, up to now, mainly been investigated within a sensory modality, for instance, by using emotional pictures to modulate visual attention. In real-life environments, however, humans typically encounter simultaneous input to several different senses, such as vision and audition. As multiple signals entering different channels might originate from a common, emotionally relevant source, the prioritization of emotional stimuli {{should be able to}} operate across modalities. In this study, we explored cross-modal emotional attention. Spatially localized utterances with emotional and neutral prosody served as cues for a visually presented target in a cross-modal dot-probe task. Participants were faster to respond to targets that appeared at the spatial location of emotional compared to neutral prosody.

40|$|Selective visual {{attention}} can strongly influence perceptual processing, {{even for}} apparently low-level visual stimuli. Although {{it is largely}} accepted that attention modulates neural activity in extrastriate visual cortex, {{the extent to which}} attention operates in the first cortical stage, <b>striate</b> visual <b>cortex</b> (area V 1), remains controversial. Here, functional MRI was used at high field strength (3 T) to study humans during attentionally demanding visual discriminations. Similar, robust attentional modulations were observed in both striate and extrastriate cortical areas. Functional mapping of cortical retinotopy demonstrates that attentional modulations were spatially specific, enhancing responses to attended stimuli and suppressing responses when attention was directed elsewhere. The spatial pattern of modulation reveals a complex attentional window that is consistent with object-based attention but is inconsistent with a simple attentional spotlight. These data suggest that neural processing in V 1 is not governed simply by sensory stimulation, but, like extrastriate regions, V 1 can be strongly and specifically influenced by attention...|$|R
40|$|Visual evoked {{potentials}} {{have been}} traditionally triggered with flash or reversing checkerboard stimuli and recorded with electroencephalographic techniques, largely but not exclusively in clinical or clinically related settings. They have been crucial {{in determining the}} healthy functioning or otherwise of the visual pathways {{up to and including}} the cerebral cortex. They have typically given early response latencies of 100 ms, the source of which has been attributed to V 1, with the prestriate cortex being secondarily activated somewhat later. On the other hand, magnetoencephalographic studies using stimuli better tailored to the physiology of individual, specialized, visual areas have given early latencies of < 50 ms with the sources localized in both striate (V 1) and prestriate cortex. In this study, we used the reversing checkerboard pattern as a stimulus and recorded cortical visual evoked magnetic fields with magnetoencephalography, to establish whether very early responses can be traced to (estimated) in both <b>striate</b> and prestriate <b>cortex,</b> since such a demonstration would enhance considerably the power of this classical approach in clinical investigations. Our results show that cortical responses evoked by checkerboard patterns can be detected before 50 ms post-stimulus onset and that their sources can be estimated in both <b>striate</b> and prestriate <b>cortex,</b> suggesting a strong parallel input from the sub-cortex to both striate and prestriate divisions of the visual cortex...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} task of vision is the segregation of {{figure and ground}} in situations of spatial occlusion. Psychophysical {{evidence suggests that the}} depth order at contours is defined early in visual processing. We have analysed this process in the visual cortex of the alert monkey. The animals were trained on a visual fixation task which reinforced foveal viewing. During periods of active visual fixation, we recorded the responses of single neurons in <b>striate</b> and prestriate <b>cortex</b> (areas V 1, V 2, and V 3 /V 3 A). The stimuli mimicked situations of spatial occlusion, usually a uniform light (or dark) rectangle overlaying a grating texture of opposite contrast. The direction of figure and ground at the borders of these rectangles was defined by the direction of the terminating grating lines (occlusion cues). Neuronal responses were analysed with respect to figure-ground direction and contrast polarity at such contours. Striate neurons often failed to respond to such stimuli, or were selective for contrast polarity; others were non-selective. Some neurons preferred a certain combination of figure-ground direction and contrast polarity. These neurons were rare both in <b>striate</b> and prestriate <b>cortex.</b> The majority of neurons signalled figure-ground direction independent of contrast polarity. These neurons were only found in prestriate cortex. We explain these responses in terms of a model which also explains neuronal signals of illusory contours. These results suggest that occlusion cues are used at an early level of processing to segregate figure and ground at contours...|$|R

Short-latency ERPs generated in <b>striate</b> and peristriate <b>cortex</b> were sensitive to elementary stimulus features such as luminance.

Face-specific N 200 s were preceded by P 150 and followed by P 290 and N 700 ERPs. N 200 reflects initial face-specific processing, while P 290, N 700 and P 350 reflect later face processing at or near N 200 sites and in anterior ventral temporal cortex.

40|$|Abstract. Object {{recognition}} {{developed to}} the most common approach for detecting arbitrary objects based on their appearance. Statistical pat-tern analysis methods, are able to extract features from appearing im-ages, enabling a classification of the image content; have reached certain maturity; and achieve excellent recognition on rather complex problems. However, these systems seem not directly scalable to human performance in cognitive sense and appearance does not attribute to understanding the structure of objects. Due to noise, occlusions, and illumination, ob-jects are segmented often poorly with more or less drop outs in contour that yields poor recognition performance, and since object representa-tion enables logical input of spatial arrangements to higher cognitive processes, scene interpretation in cognitive manner gets inhibited. In another paper we proposed the architecture and a simulation of the five bottom layers of a cognitive vision model by implementing the <b>striate</b> visual <b>cortex</b> as the first level. Hence, in this work {{we focus on the}} concept of modeling object prototypes from geon recipes on biological formations, such as the circuit of Papez, and show how structure of such formation can be utilized for the modeling of objects.
