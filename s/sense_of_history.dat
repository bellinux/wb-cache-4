5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players available to them, they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E

25|$|Together {{with the}} other texts in the Kongsbókin, the Statute {{concerning}} sheep breeding on the Faroes (Seyðabrævið) contains information on conditions in society, the economy, the language, culture and cultural history.

The Løgting's archives for the period from 1852 to the present also provide the most important source of information on the more recent and latest political history of the Faroes. The Faroese cultural heritage is founded on this abundance of source material, which is thus at the very heart of the Faroese identity and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> right from the landnam period to the present time.|$|E

25|$|Phylogeny {{can give}} some <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> when {{combined}} {{with a little bit}} more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an idea about other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.|$|E
500|$|Author Michael Bronski {{highlights}} the [...] "attack on pre-Stonewall culture", particularly gay pulp fiction for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, {{which he describes}} as [...] "an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men", have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, [...] "gay liberation was a youth movement whose <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> was defined {{to a large degree}} by rejection of the past." ...|$|E
500|$|Badu's songwriting was {{characterized}} by pointillism, stream of consciousness, and scenic narrative. Her lyrics are alternately overtly political and deeply personal, interlaced with Five Percenter notions and references to the Nation of Islam. Badu expresses a motherly perspective and feelings of dismay and empathy for {{the subjects in the}} songs. Charles Aaron commented that [...] "a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> and maternal compassion ... grounds even her most oblique forays." [...] Abebe wrote similarly, [...] "her keen writing about people" [...] gives songs [...] "much of their shape" [...] and views that her candor helps communicate the album's [...] "social concerns, which could otherwise sound like a laundry list of black-community struggles".|$|E

500|$|The Beguiling is [...] "a {{store with}} an agenda", {{according}} to Birkemoe, {{and has been}} derided for some for its perceived elitism, which stems in part from its sponsoring of Crash, a journal of comics criticism that mainly condemned bad comics. [...] Others, such as comics historian Charles Hatfield, have praised the store for its <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> saying, [...] "You always leave the shop with a larger sense of what comics are about." [...] The Beguiling is patronized by an international audience. The store has made the top five retailer list in The Comics Journal, and among the awards it has received, it shared the inaugural Eisner Spirit of Retailing Award in 1993, and it won the Joe Shuster Awards' Harry Kremer Retailer Award in 2010.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} Roberts' idea {{to bring back}} the Cybermen, because there were no other {{returning}} monsters in the series and he thought [...] "there should be a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> about the Doctor's final battle to save Earth before he heads off to meet his death". He felt that this was consistent with the theme of [...] "death and lingering darkness" [...] that had run throughout the sixth series. Roberts wanted the audience to think that maybe Craig would really be converted. Moffat felt the [...] "blowing the Cybermen up with love" [...] conclusion was the Doctor Who version of a father bonding with his son.

500|$|Author Marvin Olasky said public {{relations}} in the 1800s was spontaneous and de-centralized. In the 1920s, Americans wanted to disprove the perspective of French aristocrats that the American democracy run by [...] "the mob" [...] had [...] "no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> no sense of gratitude {{to those who had}} served it, and no sense of the meaning of 'virtue'". To combat this perception, French aristocrat Marquis de Lafayette, who helped fund the American Revolution, was invited to a tour of the United States. Each community he visited created a committee to welcome him and promote his visit. In the mid-1800s P. T. Barnum founded the American Museum and the Barnum and Bailey Circus. He became well known for publicizing his circus using manipulative techniques. For example, he announced that his museum would exhibit a 161-year-old woman, who had been Washington's nurse, then produced an elderly woman and a forged birth certificate.|$|E

500|$|Much of Volubilis was {{excavated}} by the French {{during their}} rule over French Morocco between 1912 and 1956, but the excavations {{at the site}} began decades earlier. From 1830, when the French conquest of Algeria began the process of extending French rule over much of northern, western and central Africa, archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism. The French army undertook scientific explorations {{as early as the}} 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time. By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover north-west Africa's pre-Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites. The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims. As the historian Gwendolyn Wright puts it, [...] "the Islamic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign", which [...] "gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could fully appreciate the Moroccan past and its beauty." [...] Emile Pauty of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Marocaines criticised the Muslims for taking the view that [...] "the passage of time is nothing" [...] and charged them with [...] "let their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them." ...|$|E
500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b> So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E
