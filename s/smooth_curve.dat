5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a <b>smooth</b> <b>curve</b> in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of a}} geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up. For a <b>smooth</b> <b>curve</b> without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any <b>smooth</b> <b>curve</b> would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{prove that the}} E^†_K-valued cohomology, {{introduced}} in [9] is finite dimensional for <b>smooth</b> <b>curves</b> over Laurent series fields k((t)) in positive characteristic, and forms an E^†_K-lattice inside `classical' E_K-valued rigid cohomology. We do so by proving a suitable version of the p-adic local monodromy theory over E^†_K, and then using an étale pushforward for <b>smooth</b> <b>curves</b> to reduce {{to the case of}} A^ 1. We then introduce E^†_K-valued cohomology with compact supports, and again prove that for <b>smooth</b> <b>curves,</b> this is finite dimensional and forms an E^†_K-lattice in E_K-valued cohomology with compact supports. Finally, we prove Poincaré duality for <b>smooth</b> <b>curves,</b> but with restrictions on the coefficients. Comment: 40 pages, comments very welcome...|$|R
5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a <b>smooth</b> <b>curve,</b> creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E

Two instances of this family reduce to previously known interpolants: one based on a generalization of Wachspress coordinates to <b>smooth</b> <b>curves</b> and the other an integral version of mean value coordinates for <b>smooth</b> <b>curves.</b> A third instance of this family yields a previously unknown generalization of discrete harmonic coordinates to <b>smooth</b> <b>curves.</b> For closed, piecewise linear curves, we prove that our interpolant reproduces a general family of barycentric coordinates considered by Floater, Hormann and Kós that includes Wachspress coordinates, mean value coordinates and discrete harmonic coordinates.

25|$|Kurzweil says {{evolutionary}} progress looks smooth, {{but that}} really it {{is divided into}} paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So {{what looks like a}} single <b>smooth</b> <b>curve</b> is really series of smaller S curves.

40|$|In this paper, we {{prove that}} the notions of Hilbert {{stability}} and Mumford stability agree for vector bundles of arbitrary rank over <b>smooth</b> <b>curves.</b> The notion of Hilbert stability was introduced by Gieseker and Morrison in 1984, and they showed that for <b>smooth</b> <b>curves</b> and vector bundles of rank two it agrees with Mumford stability.

40|$|In some {{applications}} {{objects are}} known to have nonsmooth or "jagged" edges, which are not well approximated by <b>smooth</b> <b>curves.</b> We use subdivision curves as a simple but flexible curve representation, which allows tagging corners to model non-smooth features along otherwise <b>smooth</b> <b>curves.</b> A Markov chain Monte Carlo approach yields an approximate posterior distribution over tags, while Rao-Blackwellization allows us to integrate out the control point locations by an approximation.

But the enclosing circle shrinks under the curvature flow, remaining circular, until it collapses, and by the avoidance principle [...] must remain contained within it.
