50|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis photogenis) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the genus Notropis. It {{is found in the}} United States and Canada where it inhabits much of the Ohio River basin south to {{northern}} Georgia in the Tennessee River drainage. It also found in western Lake Erie tributaries and the Grand River system in Ontario.|$|E
50|$|Fusconaia flava males release {{sperm and}} the females collect the sperm through the {{incurrent}} siphon. The eggs are fertilized internally. Fusconaia flava has a parasitic larva stage called glochidia, the mussels use a lure to attract fish and then release the glochidia {{when the fish}} is close enough. The glochidia latch onto the gills or fins of the fish and remain there feeding of {{the blood of the}} fish until the glochidia reach the juvenile stage. Known host species for Fusconaia flava include <b>silver</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis photogenis) and creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus). Parent mussel provides no care once the glochidia are released. Fusconaia flava are filter feeders, waste is released through the excurrent siphon. They are sedentary creatures and are anchored to the substrate or buried in the substrate.|$|E
5000|$|Bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus): The bluntnose minnow is {{a primary}} bait fish for Northern America (more {{specifically}} Ohio) and has a very high tolerance for variable water qualities, which helps its distribution throughout many regions. The snout of the bluntnose minnow overhangs the mouth, giving it the bluntnose. There is a dark lateral line which stretches from the opercle {{to the base of}} the tail, where a large black spot is located. The average size of the adult is approximately 5 cm (2 in). 'PimephalesCommon shiner (Notropis cornutus): These fish are one of the most common type of bait fish and are almost exclusively stream dwellers. The common shiner can be identified by the nine rays on its anal fin and terminal mouth. This minnow is typically bluish silver on the sides and greenish blue on the back., save for breeding season in which case the male gains a rose colored tail and anal fin. The shiner grows about 5-10 cm (2-4 in) within one year and reach a size of 13 cm (5 in) at adulthood. Another common [...] "shiner" [...] bait fish is the young version of the European chub (Leuciscus cephalus or Squalius cephaloides) which is quite easy to catch. Notropis potteri is known as the chub shiner.Common emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides atherinoides): Common shiners are most abundant in the Great Lakes of North America, primarily Lake Erie. The name of the emerald shiner comes from the greenish emerald band that expands from the back of the gill cover to the tail. This type of minnow has a short, rounded snout, the only difference between the common emerald shiner and the <b>silver</b> <b>shiner</b> is that the <b>silver</b> <b>shiner</b> has a longer snout and a larger eye. These fish grow to an average length of about 6 cm. This is one of the most common bait fish used in the Lake Erie region of Ohio and many fisherman hold it over all other bait.* Cheat minnow, a species in the genus Pararhinichthys* Cutlips minnow, a species in the genus Exoglossum* Desert minnows, fishes in the genus Dionda* Eurasian minnows, fishes in the genus Phoxinus* Fathead minnow (rosy-red minnow), a species in the genus Pimephales* Loach minnow, a species of the genus Rhinichthys* Short levered minnow, a species of the genus Minnellinus* Pikeminnows, fishes in the genus Ptychocheilus* Pugnose minnows, fishes in the genus Opsopoeodus* Silverjaw minnow, a species in the genus Notropis* Longjaw minnow, a species in the genus Ericymba* Silvery minnows, fishes in the genus Hybognathus* Suckermouth minnows, fishes in the genus Phenacobius* Vietnamese cardinal minnow, a species in the genus Tanichthys* White Cloud Mountain minnow, a species in the genus Tanichthys ...|$|E

50|$|The weed shiner, Notropis texanus, is {{a member}} of the Cyprinidae family. It is a {{medium-sized}} minnow with a broad, dark lateral band down and a dark spot at the base of the caudal fin. The posterior 3-4 anal rays often have a dark pigment. Weed shiners have a somewhat compressed body, a large terminal to subterminal mouth, a gently rounded snout, and an eye diameter less than or equal to its snout length. The lateral line system is completely pored with 34-36 scales and is slightly decurved anteriorly. The dorsal surface of this fish tends to be olive-yellow with a silvery overlay and has dark-edged scales, giving off a checkerboard appearance. The ventral surface is white with <b>silver</b> tones. Weed <b>shiners</b> have a total of 6-8 gill rakers, 8 dorsal rays, 7 anal rays, 13-14 pectoral rays, and 8 pelvic rays.|$|R
40|$|Diel {{substrate}} preferences {{were tested}} in artificial stream experiments for six cyprinids: redfin shiner (Lythrurus umbratilis), <b>silver</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis photogenis), spotfin shiner (Cyprinella spiloptera), central stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum), striped shiner (Luxilus chrysocephalus), and bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus). We used experimental pools containing two of three substrate types (sand, cobble, and gravel) per trial to test if habitat preferences differed in day and night observations. Over 85 % of specimens were observed over cobble substrate during the day, and all species switched substrate preferences at night for the tanks containing cobble. Our results suggest that day-night differences in habitat use may occur in other small-bodied species. Interpretations for habitat use of these species {{in the majority of}} studies that are based on daytime observations may need to be modified. Interpretations for habitat use by fish assemblages in the majority of studies that are based on daytime observations may need to be modified. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} form of semi-alluvial bedrock channels was investigated. Channel geometry {{data were}} collected from a variety of streams in Ontario and Qu√©bec, Canada to develop empirical downstream scaling relationships. The relationships revealed that bedrock, mixed, and alluvial channels scale at similar rates with respect to discharge. The widest channels were formed in low-relief sedimentary bedrock with minimal alluvial cover. Channels influenced by resistant igneous/metamorphic bedrock produced a strong scaling relationship, whereas channels influenced by weak sedimentary bedrock produced a weak scaling relationship. Alluvial cover appeared to exhibit more control on channel width in low-relief settings in comparison to high-relief settings, with increased alluvial cover promoting channel narrowing. Channels influenced by igneous/metamorphic bedrock produced identifiable thalwegs, presumably due to well-defined bedload transport pathways. Channels influenced by sedimentary bedrock tended to have planar beds. Additionally, fish habitat was investigated at one semi-alluvial bedrock stream in Ontario, Canada. Fish sampling was conducted at proximate bedrock and alluvial sections followed by a survey of physical habitat parameters to evaluate habitat preferences. Adult logperch (Percina caprodes), juvenile white sucker (Catostomus commersonii), adult round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and adult longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) demonstrated preference toward alluvial substrate, whereas juvenile logperch and adult banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus) demonstrated preference toward bedrock. Juvenile <b>silver</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis photogenis) and juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were indifferent to substrate type. Empirical depth and flow velocity habitat suitability indices (HSIs) were developed for each fish species. This study presents the first fish habitat suitability criteria developed from a small semi-alluvial bedrock stream and may provide valuable information for fisheries management endeavours in such environments...|$|E
