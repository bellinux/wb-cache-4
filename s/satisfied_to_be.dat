She was a member of the Latter Day Saint Church and lived with Joseph Smith and his family for a time in Nauvoo, Illinois. She traveled with her husband to Utah, spending the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters. She petitioned the First Presidency to be endowed and sealed; as a result of her requests she was adopted as a servant into the Joseph Smith family through a specially created temple ceremony. Not <b>satisfied</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an eternal servant in the Smith family, she continued to petition to receive her own temple endowment but was denied these rites during her lifetime. She was posthumously endowed by proxy in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{accounts}} {{say that}} Prince Henri had not forgotten her. According to these versions, he learned her address from the theater, arrived in Paris, {{and moved into}} the apartment with Bernhardt. After a month, he returned to Brussels and told his family {{that he wanted to}} marry the actress. The family of the Prince sent his uncle, General de Ligne, to break up the romance, threatening to disinherit him if he married Bernhardt. According to other accounts, the Prince denied any responsibility for the child. She later called the affair [...] "her abiding wound", but she never discussed Maurice's parentage with anyone. When asked who his father was, she sometimes answered, [...] "I could never make up my mind whether his father was Gambetta, Victor Hugo, or General Boulanger." [...] Many years later, in January 1885, when Bernhardt was famous, the Prince came to Paris and offered to formally recognize Maurice as his son, but Maurice politely declined, explaining he was entirely <b>satisfied</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the son of Sarah Bernhardt.|$|E

The purpose of this evaluation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> see whether existing agile ontology engineering methodology are appropriate for the development of ontology modules or whether a new methodology should be developed. It first gives an overview of ontology module development as well as three agile ontology engineering methodologies which have been identified in existing literature.
