Part of that exploration is an in-depth examination of real practices of colour film workflow, investigating the common myth amongst Malaysian filmmakers that environmental colour temperature affects the image quality of Malaysian films. Analysis of this myth may help to establish why many Malaysian films have been processed through foreign laboratory facilities using foreign expertise. The argument and analysis are based on background analysis and interviewing using video documentation of Malaysian film workflow practices, which provides valuable data {{for the benefit of}} the Malaysian film industry. All the processes and evidence from the Malaysian film industry were recorded through qualitative video documentation, alongside quantitative data from filmstrip testing. This mixed action research method forms the main approach together with the use of participatory action research as a tool to narrate the development of the research. In justifying the use of all the data, an explanatory mixed method design has been applied. Indeed, the cooperation with expert witnesses in finding a solution to the research problem brought to the circle of practice-based research processes that validated the research. This validation becoming a central of investigation about the Malaysian film workflow complication. The initial technique (pursing the myth of colour temperature variation) proved inadequate, and, consequently, a broader action research methodology was adopted. As such, the filmstrip test data were used more as a tool to enhance the contributions of the expert witnesses, thereby shifting the direction and strengthening the research findings. It is hoped that the methods used could be transferred to solve other film industry problems This research also proves that the method applied has created new evidence of knowledge transfer in historical and film development context, which benefits the film industry in Malaysia. This development of new knowledge could provide a significant opportunity for future potential research, which will <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> workflow processes and lead to the development of film practices in Malaysia and the surrounding areas. It is the aim of this research to suggest solutions to the current problems of workflow practices among educators, government agencies and filmmakers in the Malaysian film industry...|$|E
40|$|Using {{an optimal}} image {{subtraction}} technique, we have derived the V and R light curves {{of the four}} lensed QSO components of Q 2237 + 0305 from the monitoring CCD frames obtained by the GLITP collaboration with the 2. 6 m NOT telescope in 1999 / 2000 (Alcalde et al. 2002). We give here {{a detailed account of}} the data reduction and analysis and of the error estimates. In agreement with Wozniak et al. (2000 a,b), the good derived photometric accuracy of the GLITP data allows to discuss the possible interpretation of the light curve of component A as due to a microlensing event taking place in the deflecting galaxy. This interpretation is <b>strengthened</b> by <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> dependence of <b>the</b> early rise of the light curve of component A, as it probably corresponds to a caustics crossing by the QSO source.

It was white velvet, without any other garniture than rich white lace worked with pearls across her bosom, {{and the same}} round the armlets of her dress. Across her brow she wore a band of red velvet, on the centre of which shone a magnificent Cupid in mosaic, the tints of whose wings were of the most lovely azure, and <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> of his chubby cheeks the clearest pink. On the one arm which her position required her to expose she wore three magnificent bracelets, each of different stones. Beneath her on the sofa, and over the cushion and head of it, was spread a crimson silk mantle or shawl, which went under her whole body and concealed her feet. Dressed as she was and looking as she did, so beautiful and yet so motionless, with the pure brilliancy of her white dress brought out and <b>strengthened</b> by <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> beneath it, with that lovely head, and those large, bold, bright, staring eyes, it was impossible that either man or woman should do other than look at her.|$|R
50|$|Circular motifs {{represent}} the sun, {{the symbol of}} power. Golden kris ('daggers') motifs symbolise wealth. Geometric spiralling designs and motifs are used that include buffalo heads - representing a prosperity and ritual sacrifice. Cockerels are represented in <b>the</b> <b>colours</b> of red, white, yellow and black; colors which {{represent the}} indigenous Toraja religion the Aluk To Dolo (the Way of the Ancestors). Black symbolises death and darkness; yellow, God’s blessing and power; white, <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> of flesh and bone symbolising purity; and red, <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> of blood symbolising human life. The pigments are sourced from common materials; black from soot; white from lime; red and yellow from colored earth; and tuak (palm wine) is used to <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> colors.|$|R
50|$|The woodcuts of Kim Hoang village {{are more}} {{delicate}} and detailed than ones of Dong Ho village, {{they are used}} to print in sheets of paper which are dyed beforehand with red or yellow <b>colours,</b> <b>the</b> red ones are called giấy hồng điều (scarlet paper) and the yellow ones is giấy vàng tầu (Chinese yellow paper). <b>The</b> <b>colours</b> used in making Kim Hoang painting are obtained from black Chinese ink and other natural materials such as white gypsum, red vermilion and yellow gardenia. To <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> durability of <b>the</b> <b>colours,</b> <b>the</b> craftsmen often mixed colour paints with glue extracted from buffalo skin. Like the production of Hang Trong painting, Kim Hoang craftsmen only used the woodblocks to create the black outlines and then drew and coloured details by their own hands. For this reason, pictures of a subject, although outlined by the same woodcut, are slightly different from one to another, thus they becomes more valuable and attractive to customers.|$|R

5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, <b>strengthening</b> <b>the</b> contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas <b>the</b> <b>colours</b> of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|R

40|$|To {{measure the}} quality of green {{vegetables}} in digital images, <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> appearance of <b>the</b> vegetable {{is one of the}} main factors. In general, green colour represents good quality and yellow colour represents poor quality empirically for green-vegetable. <b>The</b> <b>colour</b> appearance is mainly determined by its hue, however, the value of brightness and saturation affects <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> appearance under certain conditions. To measure <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> difference between green and yellow, a series of experiments have been designed to measure <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> difference under varying conditions. Five people were asked to measure <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> differences in different experiments. First, colour differences are measured as two of the values hue, brightness, and saturation are kept constant. Then, the previous results are applied to measure <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> difference as one of the values hue, brightness, and saturation is kept constant. Lastly, we develop a colour difference model from the different values of hue, brightness, and saturation. Such a colour difference model classifies <b>the</b> <b>colours</b> between green and yellow. A windows application is designed to measure {{the quality of}} leafy vegetables by using <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> difference model. <b>The</b> <b>colours</b> of such vegetables are classified to represent different qualities.

40|$|The use {{of natural}} food colours is {{preferred}} to that of arti­ficial dyestuffs for modern alimentary purposes. Paprika is a spice plant grown and consumed in considerable quantities worldwide and also used as a natural food <b>colour,</b> so <b>the</b> <b>colouring</b> power of powders is very important. <b>The</b> <b>colour</b> of paprika powder is highly relevant too because the consumer concludes its colouring power based on its <b>colour.</b> <b>The</b> <b>colouring</b> power of paprika powders is directly determined by {{the quality and quantity}} of <b>the</b> <b>colouring</b> agent of paprika. The paprika oleoresin, that is an oil soluble extract from the fruits of Capsicum Annum Linn or Capsicum Frutescens, is suitable to raise <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> agent content of paprika powders. We investigated how <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> and <b>the</b> characteristics of paprika powder samples with added oleoresin change in the course of storage. <b>The</b> <b>colour</b> agent content of 7 different quality powders was increased with 7 - 75 % using oleoresin. <b>The</b> initial <b>colour</b> agent content of samples changed between 41 and 169 ASTA units. The powders were made from Chinese, Peruvian, and Hungarian paprika. Colour measurements were performed with a HunterLab MiniScan colour-measuring instrument. <b>The</b> CIELab <b>colour</b> system was used for <b>colour</b> characterization. <b>The</b> <b>colour</b> agent content and <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> coordinates of samples were measured throughout 9 months. <b>The</b> decrease of <b>colour</b> agent con­tent varied between 22 and 51 percent, while the average reduction was 33 percent.
