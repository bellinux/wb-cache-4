5|$|On {{the other}} hand, recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> rather than forming a single {{monophyletic}} group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes {{a number of}} lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes.

5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> {{geographically}} separated R.brevipes populations (globally and continentally) develop significant genetic differentiation, {{suggesting that}} gene flow between these populations is small. In contrast, {{there was little}} genetic differentiation observed between populations sampled from a smaller area (less than approximately 1000meters). R.brevipes {{is one of several}} Russula species that associates with the myco-heterotrophic orchid Limodorum abortivum.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E
5|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations of}} several Sclerodermatineae genera have been established. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> Astraeus, Pisolithus, and Scleroderma form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Previously {{thought to be}} saprophytic, the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and Scleroderma {{have been used in}} forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth and vigor of young seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The spores are thin-walled, {{elliptical}} with narrowed ends, {{and covered}} with fine warts; they have dimensions of 10–22 by 8–10μm. Both the spores and the asci (spore-bearing cells) are nonamyloid. The asci are narrow and typically 275–300μm long. The paraphyses (sterile cells interspersed among the asci in the hymenium) are slender threadlike. Ultrastructural <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> {{the development of the}} spore wall in G.rufa is similar to the genus Discina (in the Helvellaceae family) and to the other Sarcosomataceae, especially Plectania nannfeldtii; both of these species have fine secondary wall spore ornaments.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-one {{species from}} several orders of slime molds (myxomycetes) have been {{isolated}} from the bark of Banksia menziesii. Over half (13) were from the order Stemonitales, and Echinosteliales and Liceales were also common. The abundance {{of the first two}} orders {{may be due to the}} acidity of the bark. Another order, the Physarales, was unusually rare—other <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> the order is typically abundant on the bark of various species of tree around the world.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another {{superspecies}} {{and replace}} each other geographically across Asia. They are currently {{considered to be}} four separate species, but the south-Asian forms were once {{believed to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A recent change in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, Sitta castanea, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese nuthatch, Sitta neglecta, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied nuthatch sensu stricto, S. cinnamoventris, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian nuthatch, S. (europea) arctica, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists' Union.|$|E

5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the {{bay bolete}} was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, {{and it is}} still listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from a common ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> the mushroom can bioaccumulate some trace metals from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> the {{condition}} in most children improves with maturity. Tics {{may be at}} their highest severity {{at the time that}} they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of {{the condition}} by individuals and their families and friends. The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.|$|E
