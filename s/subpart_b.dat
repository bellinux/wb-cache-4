Gentiva Health Services (2014), much of the Alabama district court’s dismissive language was traceable to the unfavorable facts of the case. 15 The plaintiff, a former account executive for a hospice provider, only pled the first type of ADA liability in her complaint, claiming that she was limited in a major life activity under 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (1)(A). (She did not claim that her former employer regarded her as substantially limited or that she had a record of a limiting impairment under <b>subparts</b> (<b>B)</b> and (C).) Contrary to her claims, however, the plaintiff referred to herself in the deposition as merely “overweight”; she also testified that she exercised regularly and that she did not have any health conditions or limitations {{as a result of her}} obesity.

The Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) has provided an independent technical oversight for the WIPP project since 1978, and is responsible for many improvements in the location, design, and testing of various aspects of the project, including participation in the development of the EPA standards since the early 1980 s. The EEG reviewed the development of documentation for assessing the WIPP`s compliance by the Sandia National Laboratories following the 1985 promulgation by EPA, and provided many written and verbal comments on various aspects of this effort, culminating in the overall review of the 1992 performance assessment. For the US Department of Energy`s (DOE) compliance certification application (CCA), the EEG provided detailed comments on the draft CCA in March, 1996, and additional comments through unpublished letters in 1997 (included as Appendices 8. 1 and 8. 2 in this report). Since the October 30, 1997, publication of the EPA`s proposed rule to certify WIPP, the EEG gave presentations on important issues to the EPA on December 10, 1997, and sent a December 31, 1997 letter with attachments to clarify those issues (Appendix 8. 3). The EEG has raised a number of questions that may have an impact on compliance. In spite of the best efforts by the EEG, the EPA reaction to reviews and suggestions has been slow and apparently driven by legal considerations.

40|$|This Article {{seeks to}} support that {{position}} with an argument in three parts. Part I describes the conventional historical picture of the period and the major weaknesses of that picture. The received account—which sees a “critical period” of chaos brought {{to an abrupt end}} by the Constitution—is not just a selective rendering of the facts, but also constricting to both historical and legal insights in a variety of areas. By obscuring institutional continuities and interpreting political debates primarily as ideological contests, the conventional view has (1) limited the ability of historians to draw useful connections between related events (like the compromises in the Continental Congress and the ones at the Philadelphia Convention), and (2) wholly blinded constitutional lawyers to the extent of important data that the Confederation period offers for the interpretation of the Constitution. Some of the most familiar parts of the Constitution, including the Supremacy Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Full Faith and Credit Clause, were drawn directly from the Articles of Confederation, while many of the additional textual powers granted to the new government were ones that the old government had been exercising in practice. Yet the resulting interpretive possibilities have been largely ignored, because the conventional account has been unable to accommodate these facts. Part II of the Article illustrates some of the weaknesses of the existing paradigm through a new consideration of the drafting of the Articles of Confederation. Subpart II. A sets forth a brief chronology of the proceedings as the Articles passed through the Continental Congress. <b>Subpart</b> II. <b>B</b> describes the interpretations that prior authors have given to these events and critiques them as inadequate to account for the known facts. Subpart II. C puts forward a new interpretation, supported by a detailed examination of the congressional debates and roll calls on the Articles. This account challenges both those previous writers who have seen the drafting process as the collision of coherent, opposed factional blocs, defined by either ideology or region, and those who have seen it as wholly incoherent. If one examines the debates on an issue-by-issue basis, a repeated pattern appears: the delegates divide initially {{on the basis of the}} interests of their states, and then unite, on the basis of shared ideological premises and the practical need for consensus, to reach pragmatically acceptable compromises. The modest conclusion, set forth in Part III, is that the more accurately we recapture the full texture of the circumstances under which the Constitution was written, the better we will be able to understand it...|$|R
