Sprucewood (Picea abies), among others, are reported to possess cellulose fibrils with a normalized diameter of 2.5 nm. There is also a reported link between the age of the wood and the <b>spiral</b> <b>angle</b> of the fibrils with respect to the longitudinal direction. Earlywood is said to have a consistent 4.6 ± 0.6° rest angle, whereas latewood is said to have a transition region from 4.6° to 19.8 ± 0.7°. [...] In latewood, the two <b>spiral</b> <b>angle</b> regions of cellulose fibrils are not continuous, meaning that there are two independent tracheid structures in “older” trees meeting different mechanical requirements. Moreover, longitudinally oriented fibrils improve tensile strength, whereas the addition of 20° tilted fibrils, exclusive to latewood tracheids, provides stability against compression.|$|E

50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the <b>spiral</b> <b>angle</b> of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|E

30|$|Distortions due to {{moisture}} {{changes during}} drying or in service {{are a major}} problem for construction timber. Twist, caused mainly by the cylindrical geometry, the orthotropic nature of the wood material, and the tendency of the wood fibers to grow in a spiral around the stem, is often regarded as the most detrimental distortion of sawn timber. There is a need for a basic mechanical understanding of how the twist distortion arises and also a need for a simple formula to predict the amount of twist distortion. In this article such a formula is proposed, and theory and experimental data that indicate the validity of the formula are shown. The first term in the formula is a modification of a traditional expression which is proportional to the mean value of the <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angle</b> in the cross section in question. The second term in the formula is new and is proportional to the gradient of the <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angle,</b> and this term normally counteracts the first term so that a stud with a left-handed spiral grain might achieve a right-handed twist. Linear elastic finite element method (FEM) results and comparisons with experimental data show that the formula works well and that linear FEM calculations exaggerate the twist, which is probably partly due to nonlinear effects. The formula could be used to predict the twist of sawn timber from measured <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angles</b> on the log surface.|$|R

Roll forming is a suitable method for the manufacturing of cupper tubes. However, roll forming is applicable only for cupper and its productivity is not high, resulting in high cost. In the present paper, additional small grooves were newly carved on the surface of bearing for the acceleration of spiral movement of the tube during extrusion. While relatively small projections were formed on the outer surface by the die-bearing grooves, large ones were formed on the inner surface by the mandrel grooves. With increase of bearing length, the more the spirality was improved.

40|$|Timber is {{a natural}} {{material}} that is environmentally friendly, renewable, light, strong and, {{in the eyes of}} most people, beautiful. Timber does, however, have one important drawback when it is used in a modern mechanised building process - its lack of straightness. This {{is one of the main}} reasons for the building industry to choose materials other than timber. The main objective of this work was to identify the cause of moisture-induced distortion and create statistical and analytical models to predict distortion on the basis of material parameters. The work also gives recommendations on the parameters that should be focused on in order to develop methods to remove material prone to distortion. Studies were conducted in which the distortion in a large number of studs was measured at several moisture content levels. The changes in moisture content were made without outer restraints in order to study the effect of the material without the effect of restraints. Several material parameters were also measured on the studs; <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angle,</b> annual ring curvature, juvenile wood, knots, annual ring width, compression wood, cracks, wane, density, shrinkage and skew sawing. <b>Spiral</b> grain <b>angle</b> and annual ring curvature together explain about 65 % of the variation in twist. An analytical model for twist created by Stevens and Johnston (1960) was used. The same level of coefficient of determination was found as that produced by the statistical method. This model was based on annual ring curvature, <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angle</b> and tangential shrinkage strain. None of the measured parameters was able to explain bow and spring statistically. Detailed studies to determine how the longitudinal shrinkage varies within a stud were conducted. A simple model was developed to calculate bow and spring on the basis of the variation in longitudinal shrinkage. This model shows that the most of the bow and spring caused by changes in moisture content can be explained by the variation in longitudinal shrinkage. The most important parameters which can be used to remove timber prone to distortion are, in the case of twist, annual ring curvature and <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angle</b> and, in the case of bow and spring, the variation in longitudinal shrinkage...|$|R

Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} in order to establish the respective influence of geometric parameters such as fins number, fin shape (apex angle), <b>spiral</b> <b>angle,</b> fin height, fin pitch etc. on the condensation heat transfer performance of the spiralled micro-fin tubes. However, the effect of the <b>spiral</b> <b>angle</b> could not be clearly established in those investigations, because other geometric parameters affecting the heat transfer performance such as fin height, fin thickness, apex angle were also varied. The influence of the <b>spiral</b> <b>angle</b> on the heat transfer performance during condensation inside spiralled micro-fin tubes having all other geometric parameters the same was experimentally investigated in this study. A new experimental-based predictive correlation was developed for practical design of this specific class of micro-fin tubes. Tests were conducted for condensation of R 22, R 134 a and R 407 c inside a smooth and three micro-fin tubes having spiral angles of 10, 18 and 37 degrees. Experimental results indicated a heat transfer augmentation due to heat transfer area increase. As the <b>spiral</b> <b>angle</b> was increased, the heat transfer area increased causing a substantial heat transfer augmentation. Condensation inside the 10 ° spiralled micro-fins produced a heat transfer augmentation of about 170 % for a heat transfer area increase of 1. 87 when compared to condensation in ~he correspondent smooth tube while the 18 ° spiralled " micro-fins produced an augmentation of 180 % for a heat transfer area increase of 1. 94. The 37 ° spiralled micro-fins produced the highest enhancement of 220 % for a heat transfer area increase of 2. 13. Additional heat transfer augmentation was produced by: (a) the turbulence in the condensate film due to the presence of spiralled micro-fins (stronger effect at lower mass velocities and vapor qualities) and (b) the effect of surface tension forces (at higher vapor qualities).

30|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method, called the CT-direction method, {{in which the}} fiber directions in wood in three-dimensional space are calculated from the pixel information {{on a series of}} two-dimensional computed tomography images. Local fiber directions are calculated from the principal directions of inertia of measurement spheres distributed throughout the body of the wood object. The calculated fiber directions are probably due to density streaks in the material, such as fiber bundles, which are directed in the fiber direction, and not the density of individual fibers, which are too small to be detected. The fiber directions vary locally, and density streaks from knots, growth rings, and compression wood influence the results, which adds spread to the results. The fiber directions are presented as <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angles</b> and conical angles and are compared with <b>spiral</b> grain <b>angles</b> measured with the tracheid-effect method.
