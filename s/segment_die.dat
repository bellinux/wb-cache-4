40|$|Using two {{different}} lesion models, the spinal root avulsion and the distal nerve axotomy, {{the present study}} investigated effects of known neurotrophic factors on motoneuron survival in newborn rats. Results of the present study show that 100 % of motoneurons in the lesioned spinal <b>segment</b> <b>die</b> at I week following root avulsion, and more than 80 % of them die at 2 weeks following distal nerve axotomy. Local application of GDNF can rescue 92 % of motoneurons up to 1 week from degeneration due to root avulsion and almost 100 % of them up to 2 weeks from degeneration due to distal nerve axotomy. Local application of BDNF fails to prevent any motoneuron death in newborn rats following root avulsion, but it can rescue about 50 % of motoneurons up to 2 weeks from degeneration due to distal nerve axotomy. CNTF and IGF- 1 fail to prevent any motoneuron death following either distal nerve axotomy or root avulsion. Thus, comparing all the neurotrophic factors tested in this study, GDNF is most effective in preventing death of motoneurons following axonal injury in newborn rats.

The distortion of a quadrilateral element of a grid was tracked to compute strains during deformation.

Although the method {{can be applied to}} any mode of deformation, its application plane-strain deformation is considered. The method has been verified by application to basic cases of deformation such as uniaxial compression, tension, pure shear, and rotation of element. Wedge testing was used for verification of the analytical results of a viscoplastic finite-element program ALPID which was developed to simulate metal flow in deformation processes such as forging and extrusion. Wedge-shaped specimens were machined from plates of 1100 -F and 6061 -T 6 aluminum, and grids were engraved on the meridian plane by means of a CNC engraver.

Physical build-and-test procedures used for designing forging dies are prohibitively expensive and result in long lead times in obtaining satisfactory designs. In the present study the wedge test was advanced to the level of a standard laboratory test in order to verify the analytical results of a viscoplastic finite-element program, ALPID (Analysis of Large Plastic Incremental Deformation), which was developed to simulate the metal flow in deformation processes such as forging and extrusion. Wedge-shaped specimens were machined from plates of 1100 -F and 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy and the grids engraved on the meridian plane by means of a CNC engraver. The specimens were compressed in <b>segmented</b> <b>dies</b> at room temperature. The undeformed and deformed grids were digitized, and the true effective strains were calculated using a computer program developed for that purpose. The effective strains were then displayed as contour plots for comparison with the ALPID-generated strain values.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop a method {{that could be used to}} estimate the necessary bore load on a part quenched in a quenching machine with an expanding <b>segmented</b> <b>die.</b> Such a method would be of special benefit to gear manufacturers with little quenching experience; and it could also help to greatly reduce or eliminate the very costly trial and error procedure presently used.

The theory has been developed for each portion of the procedure. Elastic deflections and stresses of the part, as predicted by the theory, have been compared with a finite element modeled part which agreed with the theory within 8 %.

40|$|Hot {{stamping}} of quenchenable ultra {{high strength}} steels currently represents a promising forming {{technology for the}} manufacturing of safety and crash relevant parts. For some applications, such as B-pillars which may undergo impact loading, it may be desirable to create regions of the part with softer and more ductile microstructure. In the article, a laboratory-scale hot stamped U-channel was produced with <b>segmented</b> <b>die,</b> which was heated by cartridge heaters and cooled by chilled water recirculation independently. It can be concluded {{that in order to}} satisfy tailored mechanical properties by introducing regions, which have an increased elongation for improved energy absorption, the minimum die temperature should be no less than 450 C. Optical micrographs were used to verify the microstructure of the as-quenched phases with respect to the heated die temperatures. For the cooled die region, the microstructure was predominantly martensite for all the die temperatures interested. With the increase of heated die temperature, there was a decrease of Vickers hardness in the heated region due to the increasing volume fractions of bainite. The finite element (FE) model was developed to capture the overall hardness trends that were observed in the experiments. The trends between the simulations and experiments were very similar, with acceptable differences in the magnitude of Vickers hardness.

The integrated circuit (IC) pattern is usually periodic and regular. Therefore, we can implement a classification scheme whereby the regular pattern in the die image is classified as the acceptable circuit pattern and the die defect can be modeled as irregularity on the image. The detection of irregularity in image is thus equivalent to the detection of die defect. We propose a method where the defect detection algorithm first <b>segments</b> the <b>die</b> image into different regions according to the circuit pattern {{by a set of}} morphological segmentations with different structuring element sizes.

40|$|The {{segmented}} {{nature of}} Lake Baikal is well {{expressed by the}} different geometry of its three sub-basins. This {{is a result of}} the different orientation of the main border faults, changing their strike from a more or less SW-NE direction in the southern basin to an almost N-S direction in the northern part of Lake Baikal. The Zavarotny area, along the northwestern lake border, is one of the areas where such a change in orientation is observed. Within this area two different segments of the Baikalsky border fault partly overlap, revealing a linking relay structure. Here the southern fault <b>segment</b> <b>dies</b> out in the lake, allowing a western onshore fault to take over its displacement towards the north. The morphology of the offshore part in this relay zone was examined on digital terrain models, constructed from echo sounding data. This DTM revealed the presence of small basins and ridges within the area, striking obliquely to the border faults. Structural investigations on a detailed high-resolution seismic grid, allowed us to accurately determine the geometry of the faults delimiting these basins. The structure of the onshore part is less well studied because large parts of it are covered by coarse-grained sediments from the Baikalsky Range. Although the two Baikalsky fault segments strike – within the zone of overlap – almost parallelly and have the same dip direction, we observe structures that differ significantly from those well known from relay ramp studies. The ramp structure we observe dips towards the north east, but it is not cross-cut by faults striking more or less orthogonal to the main fault segments. Instead we observe only faults that are slightly oblique, and even smaller faults that are almost parallel. These smaller faults are interpreted as being a result of block rotations in some parts of the ramp along axes parallel to the major faults. The observed deviation from the ideal relay ramp picture is most probably a result of the interference between fault linking processes as well as others. Indeed other processes are to be expected as the border fault deflection systematically occurs on left overstepping relays or splays. This suggests that the main active fault is slightly ‘rotated’ in a clockwise direction, leaving earlier fault traces to become less important. Whether lateral movements on the major transfer zones, separating the different Baikal basins, could be the underlying mechanism is a topic of future research...|$|R

The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] belangrikheid van ’n skrywer binne ’n bepaalde literêre veld kan afgelees word uit ’n diachroniese beeld wat bepaal word deur sy of haar verteenwoordiging in literatuurgeskiedenisse en ’n sinchroniese beeld wat afgelei kan word uit die distribusie van ’n skrywer se werk, die aktuele bestaan daarvan in akademiese onderrig, navorsing, publikasies, akademiese byeenkomste, die media en algemene publikasies sowel as die produktiewe bestaan daarvan in onderhoude en manifeste, poëtikale uitsprake, vertalings, verwerkings, intertekstualiteit en sitering. In hierdie artikel word daar ondersoek ingestel na die status van die digter N. P. van Wyk Louw aan die hand van die wyse waarop sy werk ’n voortgesette bestaan het deur intertekstualiteit en sitering in die werk van ander Afrikaanse digters. Naas ’n bepaalde opvatting van die begrip intertekstualiteit word daar gebruik gemaak van Lefevere se begrip herskrywing. Laasgenoemde word aangepas om te verwys na dié gedigte waarin digters ’n intertekstuele gesprek aanknoop met ’n voorganger soos Louw as ’n vorm van herskrywing wat verwant is aan literêre kritiek. Die ondersoek het byna ’n honderdtal gedigte deur ander Afrikaanse digters opgelewer waarin hulle gesprek voer met voorbeelde uit Louw se poësie. In die proses is verskillende soorte herskrywings of gesprekke geïdentifiseer wat geïllustreer word deur die bespreking van voorbeelde: kritiese herskrywings, siterings, parodieë, prikkels, huldigings, takserings, kommentare en versbiografieë. Die artikel kom tot die konklusie dat Louw steeds ’n baie sterk teenwoordigheid is in daardie <b>segment</b> van <b>die</b> Afrikaanse literêre veld verteenwoordig deur digter-herskrywers. Uit die bespreekte voorbeelde blyk dit dat die gedigte wat ander digters uitnooi of dwing om te reageer, dié is waarin daar sprake is van ’n sekere onbepaaldheid van betekenis en ’n konfronterende stelligheid. The importance of a writer in a literary field can be deduced from a diachronic perspective which is determined {{by his or her}} presence in literary histories and from a synchronic perspective which can be deduced by the distribution of a writer’s work, its continued presence in academic teaching, research, publications, meetings, the media and general publications as well as its productive existence in interviews, manifestoes, statements about poetics, translations, reworkings, instances of intertextuality and citation. This article explores the status of the poet N. P. van Wyk Louw with reference {{to the way in which}} his work is a continued presence in the work of Afrikaans poets through intertextuality and citation. The article makes use of a specific definition of intertextuality, but also adapts Lefevere’s concept of re-writing (which normally refers to translation, the editing of texts and the production of anthologies, literary histories, reference works on literature, interpretative studies and literary criticism) to refer to poets’ rewriting of the texts by a predecessor like Louw as a form of literary criticism. The reason for this is the somewhat provocative view proposed by Louw himself that a poet carries out a form of literary criticism in producing his own work. In this investigation into rewritings of Louw’s work by other Afrikaans poets more than a hundred poems were discovered which conduct intertextual dialogues with poems by Louw. The article identifies and discusses a wide range of rewritings: critical re-writings, citations, parodies, stimuli, homages, evaluations, commentaries and poetic biographies. It is concluded that Louw’s poetry elicited reaction from a wide spectrum of poets and that his work is evoked in both high and popular forms of poetry. It seems as if Louw’s poetry functions as a yardstick for some of the most important poets in Afrikaans (Breytenbach, Cussons, Stockenström, Krog). These poets measure themselves against his work, they articulate their own views in opposition to the example set by his work and sometimes distance themselves from him to find their own (poetic) identity. It is therefore evident that while the poets who rewrite Louw’s work honour him by their response, they also contradict him, differ from him, reproach him and negotiate with him. It is also noted that writers who operate in the domain of popular culture like Koos Kombuis as well as rock-singers like the band Fokofpolisiekar and the singer Jan Blohm rewrite his work. The article finally comes to the conclusion that Louw is still a very strong presence in that part of the Afrikaans literary field represented by poet-rewriters. Although this is not the main aim of the article, a final paragraph speculates about the reasons why Louw is still remembered by poet-rewriters. It is proposed that some of the reasons may be found in the way in which Louw’s work is embedded in the canon of Afrikaans literature and the cultural memory of Afrikaans poets as well as in the position of the language Afrikaans and Afrikaans literature within the political, cultural and economical fields of South African society. It is also proposed that the importance of his work as a predecessor for succeeding poets has something to do with the nature of his poetry. The examples discussed in the article point to the fact that it is the poems which feature an indeterminacy of meaning as well as a confronting self-assuredness which invite, even compel, his successors to react by rewriting his work.

Der Forschungsstand in der Modellierung des Freizeitverkehrs ist allerdings weniger fortgeschritten als in der Modellierung des Pendlerverkehrs. Dies ist unter Anderem dadurch zu begründen, dass der Freizeitverkehr eine sehr heterogenes <b>Segment</b> darstellt und <b>die</b> Datengrundlage deutlich geringer ist. Studien zu Freizeitaktivitäten legen nahe, dass Freizeitaktivitäten nicht allein durch den Zweck der Erholung oder Unterhaltung motiviert sind, sondern auch durch das Bedürfnis des physischen Kontakts zu Personen aus dem sozialen Netzwerk motiviert sind. In der Verkehrswissenschaft stellt die Rolle sozialer Netzwerke einen Themenkomplex dar, der immer mehr an Bedeutung gewinnt. Diese Dissertation leistet einen Beitrag zu diesem Forschungsthema, in dem sie die Frage beantwortet, in wie weit das soziale Netzwerk für die Modellierung des Freizeitverkehrs {{relevant}} ist. Zu diesem Zweck werden drei Arbeitspakete behandelt: (i) Analyse eines sozialen Netzwerks von Freizeitkontakten, (ii) Modellierung und Simulation eines räumlich eingebetteten sozialen Netzwerks und (iii) Modellierung und Simulation eines Ortswahlmodell für Freizeitaktivitäten unter Einbeziehung eines sozialen Netzwerks. Das erste Arbeitspaket basiert auf einem sozialen Netzwerk von Freizeitkontakten, welches in der Schweiz zwischen 2009 und 2011 erhoben wurde. Dieses Netzwerk wird insbesondere hinsichtlich seiner räumlichen Struktur untersucht. Ein wesentliches Ergebnis dieser Untersuchung ist, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Person in Distanz als sozialen Kontakt zu akzeptieren mit dem Potenzgesetz ~ d^− 1. 4 skaliert. Auf Grundlage weiterer Beobachtungen wird die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass die Topologie des Netzwerks unabhängig von der räumlichen Struktur ist. Obige Hypothese wird durch Simulationsstudien zweier Netzwerkmodelle unterstützt. In einem naiven Modell wird nur die Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Person in einer gegebenen Distanz zu akzeptieren vorgegeben, woraus sich dann die Topologie und die räumliche Struktur des Netzwerks ergeben. In einem Verbundmodell wird der Prozess welcher die Topologie beschreibt und jener der die räumliche Struktur beschreibt in zwei unabhängigen Schritten modelliert. Simulationsergebnisse des naiven Modells zeigen eine deutliche Korrelation zwischen Topologie und räumlicher Struktur, welche jedoch nicht in den empirischen Daten identifiziert werden kann. Dagegen kann das Verbundmodell die empirischen Beobachtungen hinsichtlich Topologie, räumlicher Struktur und Korrelation beider Aspekte korrekt reproduzieren. Dies ist ein Indiz dafür, dass die Topologie und die räumliche Struktur eines sozialen Netzwerks aus zwei weitgehend unabhängigen Prozessen resultieren. Im letzten Arbeitspaket werden zwei Simulationsmodelle zur Ortswahl im Freizeitverkehr gegenüber gestellt. Die Modelle unterscheiden sich dahingehend, dass im ersten Modell Entscheidungsprozesse unabhängig ablaufen während im zweiten Modell Entscheidungsprozesse kooperativ ablaufen. Wer mit wem kooperiert wird durch das soziale Netzwerk bestimmt. Beschränkt man die Analyse auf eine makroskopische Betrachtung, d. h. auf die Distanzverteilungen und Zeitstruktur, so können beide Modelle so kalibriert werden, dass sie die empirischen Beobachtungen reproduzieren. Hinsichtlich einer mikroskopischen Analyse ist das zweite (kooperative) Modell dem ersten Modell in seiner Erklärungskraft deutlich überlegen. Zusammengefasst ist die Beantwortung der Frage nach der Relevanz sozialer Netzwerke in der Modellierung des Freizeitverkehrs zweigeteilt: Einerseits kann ein Modell ohne soziale Netzwerke hinsichtlich einer makroskopischen Betrachtung so kalibriert werden, dass es die gleichen Resultate wie ein Modell mit sozialen Netzwerken liefert. Andererseits repräsentiert es somit nur eine statistische Approximation mit vergleichsweise limitierter verhaltenstechnischer Grundlage. Dies stellt die Prognosefähigkeit des Modells in Frage. Ein Modell mit Berücksichtigung sozialer Netzwerke bietet dagegen eine plausible und intuitive verhaltenstechnische Grundlage, welche auch mikroskopische Prozesse erklären kann. Leisure travel {{represents the}} dominating travel segment {{with respect to}} number of trips and mileage. In Germany, about one third of trips is related to leisure travel. Models for the forecasting of travel demand, however, usually focus on commuter travel and treat leisure travel, if at all, as a homogeneous travel segment, which {{is assumed to be}} similar to commuter travel. Yet, studies on leisure activities show that they differ considerably from other activities, especially with respect to distances travelled and activity duration, and generally feature more heterogeneity. Leisure activities are not only for the purpose of recreation and entertainment but also do meet friends and acquaintances. For instance, going to a restaurant is not only motivated by the necessity to get something to eat, it is also, if not predominantly, motivated by the need to socialise with other people. Thus, {{it is not only the}} question of "where", "when", and "what" but also of "with whom". The answer to the question of "with whom" is given by the social network. The role of social networks represents a subject that gains increasing attention in transport research. This dissertation contributes to this research field by answering the question to what extend social networks are relevant for the modelling of leisure travel demand. For that purpose, three work packages are treated: 1. Analysis of a social network of leisure contacts. 2. Modelling and Simulation of a spatially embedded social network. 3. Modelling and Simulation of a location choice model for leisure activities that accounts for a social network. The first work package is based on a social network of leisure contacts surveyed between 2009 and 2011 in Switzerland. This network is analysed with special focus on its spatial structure. A key finding of the analysis is that the probability to accept a person in distance d as a social contact scales with the power-law ~d^- 1. 4. This law holds for the entire distance scale and is independent from the location of the decision maker. Based on further observations, the hypothesis is proposed that the topology is independent from the spatial structure of the network. For instance, the number of contacts per person does not depend on the location and is thus independent from the accessibility of other contact opportunities. The above hypothesis is supported by simulation experiments with two network models. In a naive model, only the probability with which a person in distance d is accepted is given from which then the topology and spatial structure of the network emerges. In a composite model, the processes that governs the topology and the one that governs the spatial structure are modelled as two independent steps. Simulation results of the naive model show a strong correlation between topology and spatial structure, which, however, is not identified in the empirical data. To the contrary, the composite model reflects the empirical observations with respect to topology, spatial structure, and correlations between both aspects. This indicates that the topology and the spatial structure of a social network result from two almost independent processes. In the last work package, two location choice models for leisure activities are compared. In the reference model, the decision making process is modelled as independent from other actors. In the cooperative model, actors are organised in activity groups with which they conduct joint activities. The composition of activity groups is defined by the social network. In the reference model, trip distances are controlled by the marginal utility of performing an activity. In the cooperative model, trip distances can be additionally controlled by an extra utility the actors gain for joint activities. Restricting the analysis to a macroscopic perspective, that is, to trip distance distributions and activity timing, both models can be calibrated so that they both reflect the empirical observations. With respect to a microscopic perspective, the cooperative model features much more explanatory power compared to the reference model. For instance, the empirical observation that if the number of activity participants increases, the average distance to the joint activity decreases, can only be reproduced by the cooperative model. In summary, the answer to the relevance of social networks in leisure travel demand models is twofold: On the one hand, a model without social networks can be calibrated so that it yields the same results as a model with social networks. On the other hand, the reference model represents just a statistical fit with a limited behavioural basis. This renders the forecasting power of the model questionable. A model that accounts for social networks, however, is based on a sound and intuitive behavioural basis and is moreover able to reflect microscopic processes...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Thermodynamic {{models have}} been {{investigated}} extensively since Johannes van der Waals first devised a mathematical relation capable of predicting both vapour and liquid phases for a mixture at equilibrium. With the advent of modern computing power, these equations of state have gone from their humble empirical beginnings to the comprehensive and fundamentally derived models we have today. One such physically sound model is the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) family of equations, derived from the molecular perturbation theories of the 1980 ’s. The relative youth of this thermodynamic framework has meant that much work has gone into modification and optimisation of the model recently. The variants {{of particular interest to}} this work are the simplified perturbed chain SAFT equations with the Jog & Chapman (sPC-SAFTJC) and Gross & Vrabec (sPC-SAFTGV) polar terms. Each of the polar terms supports one adjustable polar parameter that relates to the quantity of polar segments in the reference fluid but not necessarily its position in the carbon chain. The strength of polar interactions is known to decrease as the functional group moves away from the terminal methyl group and the effects of steric hindrance increase. Thus, in question here is whether the models can account for the change in polar interactions associated with the changing position of the polar group, by only adjusting the values of the existing pure component parameters; that is, in lieu of a position specific parameter. The carbonyl group in ketone molecules is one such polar group, and it is this homologous series that is the focus of this study. The decrease in polar interactions as the carbonyl group in a ketone molecule shifts centrally is apparent from the lower boiling points of the isomers where the polar group is central as compared to those where the functional group is nearer the terminal methyl group. The effect of this functional group shift on binary phase behaviour has not previously been assessed for any system however, as the lack of experimental data attests. Thus, experiments had to be conducted to generate phase equilibrium data for systems comprising each structural isomer of a mid-length ketone with a common second component with no functionality. This limitation was imposed to isolate the cause of experimentally observed phenomena to the shifting polar group alone. The generated data could then be appropriately modelled using the polar sPC-SAFT variants and the capabilities of each model, as outlined above, assessed. To this end, isobaric binary vapour-liquid equilibrium data were measured for 2 -, 3 - & 4 -heptanone with three separate normal alkanes of similar length (n-octane, n-nonane & n-decane) at 40 kPa. The apparatus used was a dynamic Gillespie VLE still with temperature and pressure accuracies of 0. 03 °C and 1. 6 mbar respectively. Equipment verification was achieved through the reproduction of experimental data for the ethanol/ 1 -butanol system at 1. 013 bar. The vapour and liquid samples for all nine systems were analysed by gas chromatography with a maximum compositional error of ± 0. 022 mole fraction. All reported data were found to be thermodynamically consistent using both the L/W and McDermott-Ellis consistency tests. When paired with a common n-alkane, all three structural heptanone isomers displayed similar qualitative trends in phase behaviour. Minimum boiling azeotropes were measured in all nine systems; in the high alkane region for n-octane systems (~ 98 mole%), the equal concentration region for n-nonane systems (34 mole% to 53 mole%) and in the very dilute n-alkane region for n-decane systems (~ 3 mole%). The n-nonane systems in particular highlighted the effect of shifting functional group, with completely separate phase envelopes away from the pure alkane composition space evident in a particularly small temperature range. Modelling was performed using in-house developed software, with pure component parameters generated for each system using five different regression procedures. The first was traditional fitting of the segment diameter (σ), segment number (m), segment energy (є/k) and the respective polar parameter (xp, np) to DIPPR correlations of pure component saturated vapour pressure, liquid density and the heat of vaporisation. The latter four procedures included the fixing of the polar parameter according to functional group correlations and the three instances of including the binary VLE data set {{for each of the three}} alkanes considered in this work. When applied to the nine binary ketone-alkane systems measured in this work, excellent predictions of the experimental data were in evidence in most cases and only small binary interaction parameters were necessary to correlate the data where pure predictions were poor. The performance of the parameter sets based on the fixing of the polar parameter and the inclusion of VLE data were consistent and of a high quality for both models, with near identical parameters generated in all four cases for each of the nine systems. The parameter sets generated in this fashion were shown to be applicable not only to the systems measured in this work, but also successfully predicted the independently measured experimental data of the n-hexane/ 4 -heptanone system. It was thus concluded that either of these regression alternatives are viable for the generation of accurate component parameters, and the choice of VLE data set included is trivial. The pure predictions of the sPC-SAFTGV model were generally better than its sPC-SAFTJC counterpart, particularly in the case of the traditionally regressed parameter sets. sPC-SAFTGV displayed constant qualitative agreement with the experimental data for each of the heptanone isomers with a given n-alkane. The quality of the predictions of sPC-SAFTJC, however, worsened significantly as the polar interactions diminished from 2 - to 4 -heptanone, with no predictions even possible for the least polar isomer. This was attributed to the different perturbation theories used in the development of these terms, but a more detailed study would be necessary to confirm this. This work thus shows an apparent inability of the sPC-SAFTJC equation of state to account for the decreasing polar interactions associated with the carbonyl group in a ketone molecule shifting centrally, while sPC-SAFTGV produces qualitatively good fits for all three isomers. These flaws can be overcome through the incorporation of VLE data in the regression procedure if such data is available, or otherwise through the use of group specific correlations for fixing the polar parameter value. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Sedert Johannes van der Waals die eerste wiskundige verhouding ontwikkel het wat beide die damp- en vloeibare fases van 'n mengsel by ewewig kon voorspel, is die veld van termodinamiese modellering al deeglik ondersoek. Na die koms van die moderne rekenaars het hierdie vergelykings van hul nederige empiriese wortels gegroei tot die omvattende, fundamentele modelle wat ons vandag het. Een so 'n fundamenteel gebaseerde familie van vergelykings is die ‘Statistical Associating Fluid Theory’ (SAFT) modelle, wat afgelei is vanaf molekulêre versteuringsteorieë, ontwikkel in die 1980 s. Hierdie relatiewe jong modelle het in die afgelope ruk aansienlike aanpassing en optimering ondervind. Modelvariante van besondere belang tot hierdie werk, is die vereenvoudigde versteurde ketting of ‘simplified perturbed chain’ SAFT vergelykings, met Jog & Chapman (sPC- SAFTJC) en Gross & Vrabec (sPC- SAFTGV) polêre terme. In die sPC-SAFT toestandsvergelyking word elkeen van die polêre terme ondersteun deur een polêre veranderlike. Hierdie veranderlike is afhanklik van die aantal polêre segmente in die verwysingsvloeistof, maar nie noodwendig hul posisie in die koolstofketting nie. Daarteen is dit bekend dat die polêre interaksies tussen molekules swakker word soos die polêre groep wegbeweeg van die terminale metielgroep, en steriese hindernis ŉ groter rol begin speel. Dus is die vraag of die model die verandering in die polêre interaksie, as gevolg van veranderende posisie van die polêre groep, kan voorspel deur in plek van ŉ posisie afhanklike parameter, slegs ŉ aanpassing van die polêre waardes van die suiwer komponente te maak. Die karbonielgroep in ketoon molekules is een so 'n polêre groep, en ŉ homoloë reeks ketone word in hierdie studie ondersoek. Die afname in die polêre interaksie soos wat die karbonielgroep in 'n ketoon molekule weg skuif vanaf die terminale metiel groep is sigbaar deur die afname in kookpunt van die verskillende isomere. Hierdie effek van die funksionele groepsposisie op binêre fasegedrag is nog nie voorheen vir enige stelsels geëvalueer nie en geen eksperimentele data is vrylik beskikbaar nie. Om hierdie tekortkoming in die literatuur aan te spreek, is eksperimentele fase ewewig data gemeet. ŉ Reeks stelsels is ondersoek wat elk bestaan uit ŉ struktuurisomeer van ŉ mid-lengte ketoon en ŉ tweede komponent met geen funksionele bydrae. Eksperimente is so opgestel om die effek van die skuiwende polêre groep op die fasegedrag te isoleer en kwalitatief te ondersoek. Die gegenereerde data is dan gemodelleer met behulp van die polêre sPC- SAFT variante, soos hierbo gespesifiseer, en die vermoëns van elke model is beoordeel. Isobariese binêre fase ewewig data is by 40 kPa gemeet vir damp-vloeistof stelsels bestaande uit 2, 3 & 4 heptanoon, gemeng met drie verskillende normaal alkane van vergelykbare kettinglengte (n-oktaan, n-nonaan & n-dekaan). Die apparaat wat gebruik was is 'n dinamiese Gillespie VLE eenheid met temperatuur- en drukakkuraatheid van 0, 03 °C en 1. 6 mbar, onderskeidelik. Die akkuraatheid van die toerusting is bevestig deur eksperimentele data vir ŉ etanol/ 1 -butanol stelsel by 1. 013 bar te reproduseer. Die damp en vloeibare monsters vir al nege stelsels is ontleed deur gaschromatografie met 'n maksimum komposisionele fout van ± 0, 022 (molfraksie). Alle data is as termodinamies konsekwent gevind deur van beide die L/W en McDermott-Ellis konsekwentheidstoetse gebruik te maak. Mengsels van die drie strukturele isomere van heptanoon met ŉ gemene n-alkaan het tydens eksperimente soortgelyke kwalitatiewe tendense in fasegedrag getoon. Gedurende eksperimente is die lae kookpunt asiotrope gemeet vir al nege stelsels. Die asiotrope verskyn in die hoë alkaan konsentrasies (~ 98 mol%) vir n-oktaan stelsels, medium konsentrasies (34 mol% tot 53 mol%) vir n-nonaan stelsels en baie verdunde konsentrasies (~ 3 mol%) vir n-dekaan stelsels. Die n-nonaan stelsels beeld veral die effek van die verskuiwing van die funksionele groep uit, met diskrete fasegrense wat duidelik apart staan van die suiwer alkaan ruimte, binne ŉ klein temperatuurverskil. Modellering van die stelsels is uitgevoer met behulp van sagteware wat in-huis ontwikkel is. Suiwer komponent data is gegenereer vir elke stelsel deur van vyf verskillende regressie prosedures gebruik te maak. Die eerste is die tradisionele passing van <b>die</b> <b>segment</b> deursnee (σ), segment nommer (m), segment energie (є/k) en die onderskeie polêre parameters (xp, np) op DIPPR korrelasies van die suiwer komponent versadigde dampdruk, vloeistof digtheid en die hitte van verdamping. Die oorblywende vier prosedures sluit in die bepaling van die polêre parameter deur funksionelegroep korrelasies, en drie gevalle waar die binêre VLE data vir elk van die drie alkane ingesluit is. Deur hierdie prosedures op die modellering van die nege binêre ketoon/alkaan stelsels toe te pas, is uitstekende passings van die eksperimentele data verkry met slegs baie klein binêre interaksie parameters nodig waar voorspellings minder akkuraat was. Die prestasie van die parameter stelle, gebaseer op die bepaling van die polêre parameter en die insluiting van VLE data, is konsekwent en van 'n hoë gehalte vir albei modelle, met 'n byna identiese parameters gegenereer in al vier gevalle vir elk van die nege stelsels. Die parameter stelle wat op hierdie metode gegenereer is, is nie net toepaslik gevind op eksperimentele data gemeet in hierdie werk nie, maar ook op onafhanklike data vir die n-heksaan/ 4 -heptanoon stelsel. Daar is tot die gevolgtrekking gekom dat beide van die regressie alternatiewe lewensvatbaar is vir die generasie van akkurate suiwer komponent parameters, en dat die insluiting van die VLE data triviaal is. Die suiwer sPC - SAFTGV voorspelling was oor die algemeen beter as die suiwer sPC- SAFTJC model met die voorspelling van data, veral in die geval van passings gedoen met parameters verkry vanaf tradisionele regressie metodes. sPC- SAFTGV het ŉ voortdurende, kwalitatiewe ooreenkoms met eksperimentele data getoon vir elk van die nege stelsels. Daarteen het voorspellings deur sPC- SAFTJC beduidend verswak soos die polêre interaksies afgeneem het vanaf 2 - na 4 - heptanoon, met geen akkurate voorspelling moontlik vir die minste polêre isomeer nie. Die verskynsel kan toegeskryf word aan die verskil in versteuringsteorieë wat gebruik word in die ontwikkeling van die onderskeie toestandsvergelykings, maar ŉ meer in-diepte ondersoek is nodig om hierdie teorie te bevestig. Hierdie werk toon dus 'n skynbare onvermoë van die sPC - SAFTJC toestandsvergelyking om die verandering in polêre interaksie, as gevolg van die veranderende posisie van die polêre groep, vir die karbonielgroep in ŉ ketoon te voorspel, terwyl die sPC-SAFTGV toestandsvergelyking goeie kwalitatiewe passings vir al drie isomere bied. Hierdie tekortkominge kan oorkom word deur VLE data, indien beskikbaar, in die regressie prosedure in te sluit, of deur die gebruik van groep spesifieke korrelasies vir die aanpassing van die polêre parameter...|$|R
