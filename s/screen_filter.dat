Basically, the acquisition system is composed by pressure and flow transducers connected to signal conditioner, A/D converter and controlled by a PC microcomputer. The results showed that the mathematical behavior of the head loss for both type of filters could be explained significantly at level of 1 %, by the power function H-f=a. Q(b). Despite the mesh and flow used, the disc filters had higher values of head loss when compared to <b>screen</b> <b>filters.</b> For the disc filters, the mesh 155 had head loss values higher than the mesh 120, and for the <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> the difference of the head loss values between the two meshes was not significant.

5000|$|A {{disc filter}} {{is a type}} of water filter used {{primarily}} in irrigation, similar to a <b>screen</b> <b>filter,</b> except that the filter cartridge is made of a number of plastic discs stacked {{on top of each other}} like a pile of poker chips. Each disc is covered with small grooves or bumps. The discs (or rings) each have a hole in the middle, forming a hollow cylinder in the middle of the stack. The water passes through the small passages in between and the impurities are trapped behind. The filtration quality is based on the quantity and size of particles that the filtering element is able to retain. Higher quality filtration simply means cleaner water. This depends on the geometry of the channels, including the size, length, angle, and number of generated intersection points. [...] The discs are typically color coded to denote the level of filtration. [...] Filtration quality is usually measured in microns, based on the smallest size particle filtered. The typical range is from 25 microns for the finest level of filtration to 400 microns for the coarsest. [...] Sometimes the filtration quality is given as the equivalent mesh size of a comparable <b>screen</b> <b>filter.</b> Typical mesh sizes range from 40 to 600. [...] When using mesh sizes, 40 is the coarsest and 600 is the finest or highest level of filtration.|$|E
50|$|Ultrafiltration is a {{membrane}} filtration process and provides an alternative to conventional pre-treatment. In this method water is only pre-filtered with a common <b>screen</b> <b>filter</b> before being filtered at high pressure through a membrane, separating the water from contaminants within it. Ultrafiltration {{can be used on}} its own for water purification or as a pre-treatment for reverse osmosis. Its advantages over conventional pre-treatment include: very high water quality independent of the contaminants in the initial raw water, a plant that is simpler in design and more flexible, which makes it easier to automate, lower use of chemicals, and final product free of viruses and microorganisms.|$|E

50|$|While {{the most}} common method of {{building}} Natural Swimming Pools is by using a regeneration zone, advances in NSP technology have all but made this method obsolete. Using a regeneration zone strictly limits where building an NSP is plausible. In the new Pools by Nature US Bio filtration method water flows from the pool, usually by gravity, {{through a series of}} filter systems without the need for any regeneration plant area. Skimmers are not required and after the initial stage, an automatic <b>screen</b> <b>filter</b> cleans the remaining debris particles, down to a particle size of 70 microns. At that time, water move through a Biofermenta filter system, where it is biologically purified and oxygen is added to the water. Pure water can then returned to the pool through low-wattage water pumps, dispersed from bottom outlets that drive the water up to the surface, and provide more of the needed water oxidation. This method works very well in warmer climate and achieves excellent performances in water clarity and health.|$|E
40|$|This {{project set}} out to design, build and monitor a pilot trial of the {{self-cleaning}} ninety series Forsta <b>Screen</b> <b>filter</b> using polished seawater as the feedwater. The trial’s task was to investigate if a five micron self cleaning <b>screen</b> <b>filter</b> {{can be an effective}} technology when used {{near the end of the}} seawater pretreatment stream found in a conventional seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant. To assess the performance of the <b>screen</b> <b>filter</b> several key parameters were identified including backwash frequency, silt density index testing, turbidity, and pressure. The project originated from the desalination industry’s desire to look for alternative fine filtration technologies away from the commonly used cartridge filters. This project also outlines the scalability of the filter in an industrial setting with comparisons to the cartridge filters found at the Perth Seawater Desalination Plant (PSDP). The design required the filter to treat seawater from the Perth Seawater Desalination Plant, with the testing to occur at the National Centre of Excellence in Desalination Australia (NCEDA) in Rockingham, Western Australia. The trial was to last up to 6 weeks during the teaching period. The project faced several unexpected issues in implementing the design over the semester and unfortunately could not fulfill the requirement to conduct the pilot trial within this time. However preliminary testing was completed which confirmed the effective operation of the filter system. Primary objectives for the test were to see if the system design fulfilled its function and verify if certain parameters were attainable in regards to pressure, flow rate, and backwash cycle. The feedwater was brackish groundwater. Results showed: the filter system operated effectively; attained a system flow rate of 5 kiloliters per hour; attained the minimum system back pressure of 40 PSI; and successful automation of the backwash cycle and system. Further work is anticipated to be carried out after the semester to gain closure on the project...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{field data}} {{has shown the}} {{effectiveness}} of automatic self-cleaning filters in removing suspended solids down to less than 3 microns in size without flocculents, pre-coats or granulated media. Pre-treatment of ozone systems is often needed to remove organic solids that would utilize high amounts of ozone during oxidation leaving little for complete disinfection. Self-cleaning <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> can physically remove much of that organic matter efficiently and economically resulting in the need for lower ozone concentrations. The use of ultraviolet light water treatment has been growing rapidly. An effective job of disinfection requires that microorganisms be directly exposed to light of the appropriate wavelength. If suspended particles of sufficient size are present, shadowing can protect microorganisms from inactivating doses of ultraviolet light. Self-cleaning filters remove the likelihood of shadowing. Tests conducted over many days have demonstrated the removal of particles 10 -micron and larger from raw lake-water prior to UV treatment. The ratio of water needed in cleaning the screen to process water varied between 0. 31 % and 0. 40 %. Membrane systems of differing types (micro, ultra, nano, RO) require different degrees of pre-filtration. Self-cleaning <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> with weavewire elements down to 10 microns are available for most membrane pre-treatmen...|$|R
