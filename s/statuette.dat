5|$|The only secure {{depiction}} of the king dating to the Old Kingdom that has survived to this day is a rough, possibly unfinished, alabaster <b>statuette</b> showing Menkauhor enthroned and wearing the tight-fitting ceremonial robe of the Heb-sed. The statue was discovered in a cachette built during the late New Kingdom beneath {{the floor of a}} room {{to the west of the}} sacred lake at the temple of Ptah in Memphis. The Egyptologist Jocelyn Berlandini proposed that another <b>statuette,</b> usually attributed to Teti, belongs instead to Menkauhor Kaiu. Berlandini bases her hypothesis on stylistic grounds, noting the resemblance with Menkauhor's seated statue, as well as the location of the second statue, which was uncovered east of Teti's pyramid, in close proximity to Menkauhor's pyramid.|$|E
5|$|While {{they are}} unable to locate the sorcerer's lair, Indu refuses the sorcerer's {{proposal}} to marry him.

Posing as an assistant, Ramudu shaves the sorcerer's beard, making him lose his powers. Afterwards, Ramudu finds the <b>statuette</b> and wishes to bring the palace back to Ujjain. In a fight between Ramudu and the sorcerer mid-way in the sky, the latter dies when Ramudu throws him out. The palace is back in Ujjain and Surasena apologises to both Ramudu and Indu before uniting them. While Anji marries Indu's best friend, the film ends with the marriage of Ramudu and Indu with the elders' blessing.|$|E
5|$|Most World Fantasy Award nominees and {{winners are}} decided by {{attendees}} and judges {{of the annual}} World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which {{has the power to}} break ties. Unlike the other World Fantasy Award categories, the Convention Award has no nominees and is not decided in the usual way; instead, the winner is selected by the convention organizers themselves and announced along with the nominees in the other categories. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Through 2015, winners were presented with a <b>statuette</b> of H.P.Lovecraft, but at the 2015 ceremony it was announced that the <b>statuette</b> would not be given out in future years.

Her {{existence}} and relation to Nyuserre are attested by a fragmentary alabaster <b>statuette</b> of her discovered in the valley temple of Nyuserre's pyramid complex. Pieces of relief from the tomb of vizier Ptahshepses give the titles of a queen and while her name is lost, these titles {{are the same as}} those that Reptynub bore, leading Egyptologists to propose that these refer to her.|$|E

5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is looking at the woman rather than out of the picture, and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic <b>statuette</b> of a couple on the table.|$|E
