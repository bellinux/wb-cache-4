This work will provide an updatig of the species population status, its geographical distribution and occurrence within the remnant habitat of this primate.

40|$|Demographic {{data are}} {{essential}} to assessments {{of the status of}} endangered species. However, establishing an integrated monitoring program to obtain useful data on contemporary and future population trends requires both the identification of priority areas and populations and realistic evaluations of the kinds of data that can be obtained under different monitoring regimes. We analyzed all known populations of a critically endangered primate, the muriqui (genus: Brachyteles) using population size, genetic uniqueness, geographic importance (including potential importance in corridor programs) and implementability scores to define monitoring priorities. Our analyses revealed nine priority populations for the northern muriqui (B. hypoxanthus) and nine for the <b>southern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (B. arachnoides). In addition, we employed knowledge of muriqui developmental and life history characteristics to define the minimum monitoring intensity needed to evaluate demographic trends along a continuum ranging from simple descriptive changes in population size to predictions of population changes derived from individual based life histories. Our study, stimulated by the Brazilian government's National Action Plan for the Conservation of Muriquis, is fundamental to meeting the conservation goals for this genus, and also provides a model for defining priorities and methods for the implementation of integrated demographic monitoring programs for other endangered and critically endangered species of primates...|$|E
40|$|Muriquis, genus Brachyteles Spix, 1823, are {{the largest}} of the extant New World primates, and they are one of the three extant genera of the {{subfamily}} Atelinae along with Ateles (spider monkeys) and Lagothrix (wooly monkeys). The taxonomy of Brachyteles has constantly changed since its first description in the 19 th century. First treated as a monotypic genus, and after several modifications in the number of species, Brachyteles currently contains two species, B. arachnoides (<b>Southern</b> <b>muriqui)</b> and B. hypoxanthus (Northern muriqui). The morphological evidence for this taxonomic arrangement relies on two diagnostic characters: the occurrence of a black-pigmented face and the absence of the first digit (thumb) in <b>Southern</b> <b>muriqui</b> populations vs. mottled face and fully-developed thumb in Northern muriqui populations. In addition, the phylogenetic relationship between atelines is disputed: on the one hand, the molecular evidence suggests an (Ateles (Brachyteles + Lagothrix)) clade and, on the other, most morphological evidence supports a clade (Lagothrix (Ateles + Brachyteles)) based on the high degree of postcranial and locomotory resemblances between Ateles and Brachyteles. My aims here are: 1) to verify how many taxa at the species level group there are in Brachyteles, and 2) to estimate the phylogenetic relationships among Atelinae using morphological characters. To achieve these goals, I have performed a qualitative analysis of external morphological characters as {{the presence or absence of}} the thumb, pelage coloration, and face pigmentation to test sexual dimorphism or dichromatism and intrapopulational variation. I also performed linear and geometric morphometrics analyses to test sexual dimorphism and geographical variation in both size and shape of the skull. Finally, I carried out a morphological phylogeny using 74 discrete morphological characters, two ecological and one karyological. This analysis includes 11 species of extant and fossil atelids and the outgroup was composed of Sapajus nigritus and Callicebus personatus. The analysis of the pelage coloration reveals that there is no sexual dimorphism or dichromatism in Brachyteles; besides, the pelage presents a high degree of individual variation. The development of the thumb and the facial pigmentation do not exhibit uniformity; thus, they have no taxonomic meaning. Linear and geometric morphometrics failed on to discriminate between sexes and populations based on the size and shape of the skull. For these reasons, I consider Brachyteles as a monotypic genus with no subspecies. Lastly, the morphologic phylogenetic analysis shows that Brachyteles is more closely related to Lagothrix than to Ateles, suggesting that the postcranial similarities between muriquis and spider monkeys could be a plesiomorphic condition in Atelidae, and the arboreal quadrupedalism of Alouatta and Lagothrix evolved convergently in alouattines and atelines. Os muriquis ou monos-carvoeiros, gênero Brachyteles Spix, 1823, são os maiores primatas existentes do Novo Mundo, fazendo parte da subfamília Atelinae, juntamente com os gêneros Ateles (macaco-aranha) e Lagothrix (macaco-barrigudo). A taxonomia de Brachyteles tem sofrido constantes alterações desde sua primeira descrição no século XIX. Inicialmente foi tratado como um gênero monotípico, entretanto, após diversas alterações no número de espécies, atualmente considera-se composto por duas espécies, B. arachnoides (muriqui-do-sul) and B. hypoxanthus (muriqui-do-norte). O suporte para este arranjo taxonômico baseia-se em dois caracteres diagnósticos: a ocorrência de face com coloração preta e a ausência do primeiro dígito (polegar) nos muriquis-do-sul vs. face com manchas e polegar totalmente desenvolvido em populações de muriquis-do-norte. Adicionalmente, as relações filogenéticas entre os atelinos é contestada: por um lado, a evidência molecular sugere o clado formado por (Ateles (Brachyteles + Lagothrix)), por outro, a evidência morfológica suporta o clado (Lagothrix (Ateles + Brachyteles)), baseando-se na grande similaridade pós-craniana e locomotora. Desta forma, o meus objetivos neste trabalho são: 1) verificar quantos taxa do grupo da espécie existem em Brachyteles, e 2) estabelecer as relações filogenéticas entre os Atelinae utilizando caracteres morfológicos. Para isso, analisei qualitativamente os caracteres morfológicos externos, como a presença ou ausência de polegar, a coloração da pelagem, e a pigmentação facial, a fim de testar a ocorrência de dimorfismo sexual ou dicromatismo e a variação intraespecífica. Além disso, realizei análises morfométricas lineares e geométricas para testar o dimorfismo sexual e a variação geográfica do tamanho e forma do crânio. Por fim, realizei uma filogenia morfológica utilizando 74 caracteres morfológicos, dois ecológicos e um cariotípico. Estas análises incluíram 11 espécies de atelídeos viventes e fósseis e um grupo-externo composto por Sapajus nigritus e Callicebus personatus. A análise da coloração da pelagem revela que não há dimorfismo sexual ou dicromatismo em Brachyteles; além disso, a pelagem apresenta um alto grau de variação individual. O desenvolvimento do polegar e a pigmentação facial não apresentam uniformidade, assim, não tem relevância taxonômica. A morfometria linear e geométrica falharam em discriminar entre os sexos e as populações com base no tamanho e forma do crânio. Finalmente, as análises filogenéticas mostraram que Brachyteles está mais estreitamente relacionado com Lagothrix do que com Ateles, sugerindo que a similaridade pós-craninana entre os muriquis e os macacos-aranha poderia ser uma condição plesiomórfico dos atelídeos, e o quadrupedalismo arborícola de Alouatta e Lagothrix teria evoluído convergentemente em alouatíneos e atelíneos...|$|E
