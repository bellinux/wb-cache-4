40|$|Purpose: To {{elucidate}} the key parameters affecting solute transport from semi-interpenetrating networks (sIPNs) comprised of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGdA) and gelatin that are partially crosslinked, water-swellable and biodegradable. Effects of material compositions, solute size, solubility, and loading density have been investigated. Materials and Methods: sIPNs of following gelatin/PEGdA weight-to-weight ratios were prepared: 10 : 15, 10 : 20, 10 : 30, 15 : 15, 20 : 15. Five model solutes of different physicochemical properties were selected, i. e. silver sulfadiazine (AgSD), bupivacaine hydrochloride (Bup), <b>sulfadiazine</b> <b>sodium</b> (NaSD), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and bovine serum albumin conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC). Release studies were performed {{and the results}} were analyzed using three hydrogel based common theories (free volume, hydrodynamic and obstruction). Results: The release kinetics of model solutes was influenced by each factor under investigation. Specifically, the initial release rates and intra-gel diffusivity decreased with increasing PEGdA content or increasing solute molecular weight. However, the initial release rate and intra-gel diffusivity increased with increasing gelatin content or increasing solute water solubility, which contradicted with the classical hydrogel based solute transport theories, i. e. increasing polymer volume leads to decreased solute diffusivity within the gel. Conclusion: This analysis provides structure-functional information of the sIPN as a potential therapeutic delivery matrix. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|Abstract. Silk fibroin film (SFF) {{has good}} {{mechanical}} property, cells compatibility and biodegradability, and was {{widely used in}} the biomedical area as controlling materials. In this work, silk fibroin (SF) was obtained from cocoons. It was dissolved in distilled water to form 5 % and 8 % (W/V) SF solution, which was used to prepare 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 2 % (W/V) <b>sulfadiazine</b> <b>sodium</b> (SD) solution. Five layers of SFF was prepared with salivation method, dried under 37 ℃, and annealed with 90 % (V/V) methanol. The structure information was analyzed by FT-IR and SEM, SD release in PBS (0. 2 mol/L, pH 7. 4) and PBS containing 2 U/ml trypsin at 37 ℃ was measured. The FT-IR spectra showed that more β-sheet was formed after annealed by methanol; a lot of pores were in the SFF and SD was embedded in SFF through analyzing the image of SEM. The release speed from SFF made by 5 % SF solution was faster than that from SFF made by 8 % SF solution. As for SFF containing different concentration of SD, the release rate improved {{with the increase of}} concentration of SD, however, the time of reaching the maximum were approximate. In PBS with trypsin, the time of reaching the maximum accumulative release was one hour earlier compared with in the PBS. Therefore, we draw a conclusion that the SFF incorporating SD has good properties and it has the feasibility to be used as artificial skin for burned patients...|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of modern antibiotics, colloidal silver was used as a germicide and disinfectant. With the development of modern antibiotics in the 1940s, the use of silver as an antimicrobial agent diminished. Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is a compound containing silver and the antibiotic <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfadiazine,</b> which was developed in 1968.|$|R
40|$|Silver {{sulfadiazine}} (AgSu) {{was found}} to interact with isolated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to form nondissociable complexes. These complexes differ in {{physical and chemical properties}} from those that are established when silver nitrate is added to DNA. The reaction between AgSu and DNA is visualized as occurring in two stages: (i) a weak and reversible interaction (intercalation) between DNA and the sulfadiazine moiety and (ii) a tight binding involving the silver atom. In the first stage, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfadiazine</b> competes with AgSu for the DNA...|$|R
40|$|During {{continuous}} intraperitoneal {{passage of}} liver and spleen suspension in normal stock mice, a syndrome developed which involved ascites and certain other visceral changes but seldom clinical illness and never fatality. From these mice, a chlamydia {{was established in}} yolk sacs of chick embryos and in tissue cultures. This agent readily infects mice when inoculated intranasally but is without effect intracerebrally. It has very low pathogenicity for guinea pigs and is resistant to <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfadiazine.</b> These characteristics, together with results of serum neutralization tests, indicate that the agent {{is different from the}} Nigg and DeBurgh strains of mouse pneumonitis...|$|R
40|$|Penicillin {{was found}} to cause epileptiform (spike) {{activity}} when injected into the hippocampus of male rats. Animals so prepared {{were found to be}} severely impaired in the acquisition of a two-way active avoidance task. Animals with bilateral hippocampal destruction produced by aspiration and animals receiving an antibiotic, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfadiazine,</b> which did not cause epileptiform activity learned the task as quickly as did unoperated animals. In a second study, rats were trained on the two-way task and then subjected to penicillin injection. They rapidly reached the pre-operative criterion showing significant amounts of retention. The fact {{that they were able to}} perform the avoidance response quite readily suggested that the impaired animals in Experiment 1 were not suffering from some basic sensory or motor loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{action of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfadiazine</b> {{on the growth}} of psittacosis virus (6 BC) in embryonated eggs is readily reversed by citrovorum factor but not by small amounts of vitamin B 12. In embryonated eggs, the pteroylglutamic acid analogues, 9 -methylpteroylglutamic acid and 4 -aminopteroylaspartic acid, produced some suppression {{of the growth of}} psittacosis virus (6 BC). 4 -Aminopteroylglutamic add, 4 -amino-N 10 -methylpteroylglutamic acid, and 4 -aminopteroylaspartic acid inhibited the growth of this virus in tissue cultures at concentrations which were not toxic for the host tissue. The inhibitory action of 4 -amino-N 10 -methylpteroylglutamic acid and 4 -aminopteroylaspartic acid was readily overcome by addition of citrovorum factor. Growth of meningopneumonitis virus in embryonated eggs or tissue culture is suppressed by 4 -aminopteroylaspartic acid. The advantages of the tissue culture technic for studies on the growth of viruses are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{substances}} other than p-aminobelazoic acid (PABA) and pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) will reverse the inhibitory action of suifona_mldes on some bacteria, when {{employed in the}} proper mixtures (1). Among these are certain purines and pyrimidines, and {{this has led to}} the assumption that they are products either directly or indirectly of the utilization of PABA by the cell and that suifonamides interfere with the synthesis of nucleic acid and its derivatives (1). Since a similar situation exists with reference to sulfonamides and PABA in the case of psittacosis virus (6 BC) (2), the effects of various purines and pyrimidines on the inhibition of virus growth by <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfadiazine</b> (NaSD) were investigated to see if evidence could be obtained concerning relationships of nucleic acid synthesis to virus growth. Since analogues are now available for a number of purines, it was possible to examine the role of purines in the growth of psittacosis virus (6 BC) by testing the effects of these analogues on the multiplication of virus in tissue culture, as already briefly noted in preliminary experiments (3) ...|$|R
