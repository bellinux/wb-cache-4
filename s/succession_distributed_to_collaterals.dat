40|$|Loan Loss Provisioning (LLP) is {{an amount}} of reserve that banks "put aside" to cover loss in case that loan goes in default, meaning that clients do not repay it. It is a safety buffer for {{preserving}} banks liquidity and capital adequacy. On the other hand, the Loan Loss Provisioning is a cost. In the Profit and Lost statement of banks, LLP decreases profit. It is a good tool/mechanism for risk management, but also expensive one, {{and that is why}} it is important for banks to optimize it in every possible way. The aim of optimization is <b>to</b> <b>distribute</b> <b>collateral</b> value <b>to</b> the connected loans, in a way to minimize amount of LLP. It can be done easily on a one loan level, but creating a universal algorithm that is applicable to all loans and all collaterals on the Bank portfolio level, is the goal to be achieved...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into the {{function}} of the central nervous system it is of importance to know the lay-out of fiber connections between its constituent cells and cell-groups. Much is already known of the anatomy of the spinal cord and its afferent and efferent fibers; this will be reviewed in Chapter 2. A large part of the spinal neuronal network consists of propriospinal connections representing the anatomical basis for integration of information within the spinal cord itself. The present study was undertaken to investigate propriospinal neurons in more detail. Specifically, a search was made for neurons which project to more than one target area by way of divergent side-branches, or collaterals, of their axon. Earlier anatomical findings already suggested that such "branching" neurons' might be present within the spinal cord. Thus retrograde HRP studies in the cat [254, 286, 288, 359, 416] identified the spinal neurons which give rise to descending propriospinal fibers. The distribution of these neurons largely overlaps that of the neurons giving rise to ascending propriospinal and supraspinal fibers [286, 288]. Therefore some of these neurons may be "branching" neurons which give rise to ascending and descending collaterals. In fact, such neurons were already noted in several Golgi studies [68, 242, 344], but their collaterals could be traced only over short distances. Electrophysiological studies [9, 146, 173, 360] supported these Golgi findings, indicating that some cervical spinal neurons projecting to lumbar levels also give rise <b>to</b> ascending supraspinal <b>collaterals.</b> In the present series of experiments in the rat, an attempt was made: a) to determine the location and relative numbers of such branching neurons in the cervical cord, and b) to approximate the rostral and caudal extent of projection of their <b>collaterals.</b> <b>To</b> this purpose we used the retrograde fluorescent double-labeling method (described in Chapter 3). The results of the first set of experiments (Chapter 4), in which tracer injections were made at various spinal levels, indicated that many neurons in the cervical grey matter in the rat are branching neurons, <b>distributing</b> ascending <b>collaterals</b> <b>to</b> upper cervical or supraspinal levels, and descending <b>collaterals</b> <b>to</b> thoracic or lumbosacral levels. Most descending collaterals of the branching cervical neurons were found to terminate at short distances, i. e. in the upper thoracic cord. On the other hand, the majority of the ascending <b>collaterals</b> were <b>distributed</b> <b>to</b> supraspinal levels. Although the findings suggested that many of these <b>collaterals</b> projected <b>to</b> the caudal brainstem, it remained unsettled whether the supraspinally ascending fibers specifically belonged to any of the various ascending tracts. Therefore, further sets of experiments were designed to clarify this issue, investigating the presence and relative numbers of supraspinal <b>collaterals</b> <b>to</b> the cerebellum (Chapter 5), the thalamus and tectum (Chapter 6) and the dorsal medulla (Chapter 7). Summarizing, the results of the latter series of experiments indicate that relatively many of the supraspinally ascending <b>collaterals</b> are <b>distributed</b> <b>to</b> the medulla, only few to the thalamus and tectum and extremely few to the cerebellum...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal {{monetary}} policy {{response to a}} shock <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> when policymakers act under discretion and face model uncertainty. The analysis {{is based on a}} New Keynesian model where banks supply loans to transaction constrained consumers. Our results confirm the literature on model uncertainty with respect to a cost-push shock. Insuring against model misspecification leads to a more aggressive policy response. The same is true for a shock <b>to</b> <b>collateral.</b> A preference for robustness leads to a more aggressive policy. Increasing the weight attached to interest rate smoothing raises the degree of aggressiveness. Our results indicate that a preference for robustness crucially depends on the way different types of disturbances affect the economy: {{in the case of a}} shock <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> the policymaker does not need to be as much worried about model misspecification as in the case of a conventional cost-push shock.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Stroke-related tissue {{pressure}} {{increase in the}} core and penumbra determines regional cerebral perfusion pressure (rCPP) defined as a difference between local inflow pressure and venous or tissue pressure, whichever is higher. We previously showed that venous pressure reduction below the pressure in the core causes blood flow diversion–cerebral venous steal. Now we investigated how transition <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> circulation after complete arterial occlusion affects rCPP distribution. Methods—We modified parallel Starling resistor model to simulate transition <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> inflow after complete main stem occlusion. We decreased venous pressure from the arterial pressure to zero and investigated how arterial and venous pressure elevation augments rCPP. Results—When core pressure exceeded venous, rCPPinflow pressure in the core. Venous pressure decrease from arterial pressure to pressure in the core caused smaller inflow pressure to drop augmenting rCPP. Further drop of venous pressure decreased rCPP in the core but augmented rCPP in penumbra. After transition <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> circulation, lowering venous pressure below pressure in the penumbra further decreased rCPP and collaterals themselves became a pathway for steal. Venous pressure level at which rCPP in the core becomes zero we termed the “point of no reflow. ” Transition from direct <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> circulation resulted in decreased inflow pressure, decreased rCPP, and a shift of point of no reflow to higher venous loading values. Arterial pressure augmentation increased rCPP, but only after venous pressure exceeded point of n...|$|R

40|$|Does a country’s {{ability to}} enforce debt {{contracts}} affect {{the sensitivity of}} economic activity <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> values? <b>To</b> answer this question, we introduce a novel industry-specific measure of real asset redeployability - {{the ease with which}} real assets are transfered to alternative uses - as a proxy for collateral liquidation values. Our measure exploits the heterogeneity of expenditures in new and used capital and the heterogeneity in the composition of real asset holdings across U. S. industries. Using a cross-industry cross-country approach, we find that industry size and growth are more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> values in countries with weaker debt enforcement. Our estimates indicate that the differential effect is sizeable. The sensitivity of economic activity <b>to</b> <b>collateral</b> values is not affected by a country’s financial development once the quality of debt enforcement is accounted for. We then rationalize our empirical findings based on a model of credit under imperfect enforcement and discuss an important implication of our empirical result: macroeconomic volatility generated by fluctuations in collateral values is higher in countries with weaker debt enforcement institutions. ...|$|R

One of Bank efforts was <b>distributing</b> debt <b>to</b> society. The effort owed certain risks. Debt giving close with risk where debtor did agreement violation. One of the agreement violation happened was collateral transfer which often happened in bank and the transfer was transfer <b>to</b> fiducia <b>collateral.</b> This action caused stuck debt since debtor has no more responsibility to pay debtor installment since debt caused by <b>collateral</b> guaranteed <b>to</b> bank has been sold so the debtor has no obligation to pay their debt in bank. The research has statement of problems: (1) how is the debtor responsibility <b>to</b> fiducia <b>collateral</b> transfer <b>to</b> third party in doing business capital debt in BPR Mandiri Adiyatra? (2) What efforts done by BPR Mandiri Adiyatra in overcome the fiducia <b>collateral</b> <b>to</b> third party which was done by debtor in business capital debt? Research type was juridical sociologist, where the discussion according law existed and related with law theories, also compared with the practice in field. While data kind used in this research were primary and secondary. In analyzing the data, the writer used descriptive method which was analyzed in qualitative, which is an analysis method using facts about problem researched and analyzing it {{according to the law}} related with existing problems. The research result about fiducia collateral transfer done by debtor, there could be concluded that debtor responsibility was fulfilling their agreement or still pay all their debt in bank by selling fiducia collateral togetherly with bank, debtor, and third party according to the deal. From the fiducia collateral selling, there needed to pay all the debtor obligation and cost from the ‘under-hand’ selling, then if there was residue of fund, it would be returned into debtor and/or third party.
