5|$|The biggest {{component}} of Árbenz's project of modernization was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill {{himself with the}} help of advisers that included some leaders of the communist party as well as non-communist economists. He also sought advice from numerous economists from across Latin America. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 17 June 1952, and the program went into effect immediately. The focus of the program was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to their poverty stricken laborers, who would then be able to begin a viable farm of their own. Árbenz was also motivated to pass the bill because he needed to generate capital for his public infrastructure projects within the country. At the behest of the United States, the World Bank had refused to grant Guatemala a loan in 1951, which made the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> more acute.|$|E
25|$|To {{finance the}} cost of construction, the {{community}} had, since 1941, already amassed a fund of $250,000. But soon after construction got underway, the building fund was entirely depleted and the whole project was nearly aborted due to lawsuits regarding a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> for the project.|$|E
25|$|India's mineral {{resources}} are vast. However, its mining industry has declined– contributing 2.3% of its GDP in 2010 compared to 3% in 2000, and employed 2.9 million people– a decreasing percentage {{of its total}} labour. India is a net importer of many minerals including coal. India's mining sector decline is because of complex permit, regulatory and administrative procedures, inadequate infrastructure, <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> resources, and slow adoption of environmentally sustainable technologies.|$|E

This increase in national savings rates increases the stock <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in developing countries already facing <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and leads to higher productivity as the accumulated capital is invested.|$|R
40|$|The {{enormous}} {{challenges for}} those who manage cities include providing adequate urban services and amenities, alleviating urban poverty, designing new infrastructure, establishing systems of governance, and revitalizing slum neighborhoods. These challenges are multiplied when growth is rapid and continuous, where there are critical <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> skills, and information, and where levels of poverty and inequality are extreme. All these factors exist in Asia...|$|R
25|$|Russia was {{in need of}} big {{transportation}} systems and geographically suited to railroads, with long flat stretches of land and comparatively simple land acquisition. It was hampered, however, by its outmoded political situation and a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> Foreign initiative and capital were required. It was the Americans who brought the technology of railway construction to Russia. In 1842 planning began for the building of Russia's first important railway; it linked Moscow and St Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|The heavy {{armor plates}} {{required}} {{to build the}} two monitors forced the company to upgrade its ironworking facilities, leaving it with as little as $25,000 to $30,000 in working capital. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> {{may have contributed to}} the fact that, of all the companies contracted to build Passaic class monitors, Reaney, Son & Archbold was the last to make delivery, which was achieved respectively in February and April 1863. With a displacement of 1,875 tons apiece, these would be the two largest-tonnage vessels ever built by the company.|$|E
25|$|The state Bank of Indiana was a {{government}} chartered banking institution established in 1833 {{in response to}} the state's <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> caused by the closure of the Second Bank of the United States by the administration of President Andrew Jackson. The bank operated for twenty-six years and allowed the state to finance its internal improvements, stabilized the state's currency problems, and encouraged greater private economic growth. The bank closed in 1859. The profits were then split between the shareholders, allowing depositors to exchange their bank notes for federal notes, and the bank's buildings and infrastructure were sold and reincorporated as the privately owned Second Bank of Indiana.|$|E
40|$|Africa is well {{endowed with}} {{potential}} for hydro and solar power, but its other endowments – <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> skills, and governance capacity – make {{most of the}} green options relatively expensive, while its abundance of hydro-carbons makes fossil fuels relatively cheap. Current power <b>shortages</b> make expansion <b>of</b> power capacity a priority. Africa’s endowments, and the consequent scarcities and relative prices, are not immutable and can be changed to bring opportunity costs in Africa closer {{to those in the}} rest of the world.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{characteristics}} of new businesses in the German ICT industry, distinguishing them based on their choice between two IPR regimes: open source software (OSS) or closed source software (CSS). The share of new firms with an OSS-based business model has increased considerably {{over the last several}} years. OSS-based firms tend to be smaller (in terms <b>of</b> staff and <b>capital)</b> and experience less <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> Only older cohorts of OSS-intensive start-ups had more difficulty than their CSS counterparts in convincing potential financiers of their viability, indicating that OSS business models are now well established. We find no evidence that the lower entry barriers for OSS firms are particularly attractive to start-ups with low human capital endowment or to necessity-motivated entrepreneurs.

25|$|Not much coal {{seems to}} have traversed {{the part of the}} canal that was open, so that quite apart from the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> to {{continue}} construction, the Company was making an operating loss and was unable to pay its debts. An extraordinary general meeting was called on 3 May 1780, at which those present decided to make a call of 10% on all shareholders. This was a difficult time to ask for money, as the American War of Independence (1775–83) had ruined many of the Glasgow businesses, dependent on the American tobacco business. Moreover, asking for more money to keep a bankrupt business going was inopportune.|$|E
25|$|The IMF's {{role was}} {{fundamentally}} altered by the floating exchange rates post-1971. It shifted to examining the economic policies of countries with IMF loan agreements {{to determine if}} a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> was due to economic fluctuations or economic policy. The IMF also researched what types of government policy would ensure economic recovery. A particular concern of the IMF was to prevent financial crisis, such as those in Mexico 1982, Brazil in 1987, East Asia in 1997–98 and Russia in 1998, from spreading and threatening the entire global financial and currency system. The challenge was to promote and implement policy that reduced the frequency of crises among the emerging market countries, especially the middle-income countries which are vulnerable to massive capital outflows. Rather than maintaining a position of oversight of only exchange rates, their function became one of surveillance of the overall macroeconomic performance of member countries. Their role became a lot more active because the IMF now manages economic policy rather than just exchange rates.|$|E
25|$|Of all the {{countries}} in Southern and Central Africa, Nyasaland was notorious {{for the duration of}} thangata and its importance to the colonial economy. Labour tenancy and sharecropping continued to exist in other less developed parts of Southern and Central Africa in the 20th century, but without the same social and political impact as in Nyasaland. In much of South Africa and Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, the growth of the money economy led rapidly to waged employment rather than labour in lieu of rent, and in North-Eastern Rhodesia estate agriculture was less dominant and land reasonably plentiful. In early Natal, the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> caused landowners to extract rent from African tenants in the forms of produce or labour, and this applied in Zululand until the early 20th century. However, in central Natal, employment for wages took over in the last third of the 19th century. African tenant farmers on European-owned estates in Matabeleland in the early colonial period could either pay rent or provide labour in lieu of rent, but after 1910, it was more usual to employ Africans for wages.|$|E

40|$|Extract: This paper explores {{strategies}} {{for improving the}} value for money to Government in the financing component of public private partnership (PPP) procurement for social infrastructure projects, drawing {{on the experience of}} methods trialled {{over the past five years}} in the United Kingdom and Australia. The primary purpose is to examine Credit Guarantee Financing (CGF) and the Supported Debt Model (SDM) which have been applied in the United Kingdom and Queensland respectively, with a view to discussing their relative strengths and weaknesses. The present uncertainty, <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and volatile pricing in world capital markets signals a diminished role for the private sector in the provision of economic and social infrastructure in the medium term. The CGF and SDM approaches suggest alternative methods that undoubtedly will come under closer examination by all governments in 2009...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{a growing}} social-political {{movement}} developed within Italy to start expanding its influence, since many other European countries had already been doing so, which was effectively leaving Italy behind. [...] Italy also had a huge <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and other serious economic problems. It is also argued by some historians that Italy had a minor interest in the mutton and livestock that were then plentiful in Somalia, though whatever designs Italy may have had on the resource-challenged Somali landscape were undoubtedly subordinate to its interest in the region's ports and the waters and lands to which they provided access.|$|E

Charmian of CBI Valiollah Seif warned the public in an interview recently that some banks and financial institutions are offering higher interests in order to postpone their bankruptcy. Mizan, Caspian, Fereshtegan, Arman are among many financial institutions which declared bankruptcy in recent years. There has been an increasing reports regarding Iran banking system becoming bankrupt in 2017. However Akbar Komijani deputy governor of CBI down played the reports {{but at the same}} time he has admitted to the fact that: “a number of banks are facing problems such as a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and non-performing loans higher than international standards” in March 2017 [...] Though, He has not mentioned how many banks are dealing with such problems.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} new technologies {{on the development of}} small-scale handicraft clusters in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam. It was found that the adoption of such technologies is important for growth, although their use is very much limited to the export-orientated enterprises based in the urban and semi-urban areas of the Delta. Most entrepreneurs in these clusters face important challenges, including depletion of natural resources, and acute <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and land. Such shortages have been identified as the main cause of overcrowding, poor working conditions and extreme environmental degradation. Insecurity over property rights, in particular, is impeding commercial transactions and reducing the level of economic activity in the Delta. The paper {{discusses the}} implications of these findings and suggests three specific types of intervention concerning the economic development of regional agglomerations in Vietnam and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the capital {{adjustment}} process in Swedish manufacturing firms and relate the empirical findings to standard models of firm {{behavior in the}} presence <b>of</b> impediments to <b>capital</b> adjustments. We find that (i) a model with irreversible capital goes {{a very long way}} in capturing the salient features <b>of</b> firm-level <b>capital</b> adjustment behavior. To see this, an integrated approach is necessary since different alternative models do well in certain comparative dimensions but not in others. (ii) The partial adjustment model generally fails to explain capital adjustment patterns. (iii) The capital accumulation process is a highly volatile and non-persistent process on the firm-level. (iv) Firms adjustment behavior is asymmetric in that {{they are more likely to}} tolerate excess <b>capital</b> than <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> and finally, (v) the estimated adjustment function implies that aggregate investment is relatively unresponsive to aggregate shocks in deep recessions as compared to the responsiveness in normal times...|$|R

2500|$|Himachal {{is facing}} a number of {{difficulties}} in the advancement of industries. Lack of means of dependable transport and poor accessibility {{was one of the}} major drawbacks. Other problems faced by the state were the poor mineral resources, non-availability of infrastructure and communication facilities, <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and lack of modern skills. The only plus point of the state was the ample availability of electricity. Parwano, Barotiwala, Baddi, Paonta Sahib, Mehatpur, Shamshi, Nagrotu Bagwan, Bilaspur, Reckong Peo and Sansar Pur Tera are some of the industrial areas of the state at present.

2500|$|After his {{political}} career ended, Orville Hungerford began focusing his energies on establishing the Watertown & Rome Railroad. On April 17, 1832, the New York legislature incorporated the Watertown & Rome Railroad, naming Hungerford {{as one of its}} commissioners charged with promoting the line. Although, the initial act called for track to be laid within three years and the line to be completed within five years, a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> forced the promoters to seek extensions of the charter in 1837, 1845, and 1847 at which point Orville was elected its first president. He {{played a key role in}} raising the necessary capital. [...] Unfortunately, he never got to see a train complete a journey because he died shortly before the inaugural run on May 29, 1851, covering the 53-mile stretch between Rome to the hamlet of Pierrepont Manor (originally called Bear Creak). The Hon. William C. Pierrepont, who owned the property where the railroad initially ended, followed Orville as president. At 11:00p.m. on September 5, 1851, the first train steamed into the temporary passenger station on Stone Street in Watertown. The railroad named its fifth engine, the Orville Hungerford, in his honor. Delivered to the railroad, on September 19, 1851, this engine, built by William Fairbanks in Taunton, Massachusetts, was twenty-one and a half tons in weight.|$|E

40|$|Focusing on core-infrastructure capital vis-�-vis {{productive}} capital, {{we propose}} a macroeconomic method to determine both which type <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> would be constraining potential output {{and what would}} be the optimal composition, or optimal ratio between these two types, <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in any given period. This method is based on an adapted two-gap model, estimated via linear programming, and illustrated with the cases of Chile and Mexico over the 1950 - 2000 period. The results show that there appears to be an oscillating pattern over this period, with either type <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> alternating each other. The results also show that, optimally, core infrastructure appears to support a variable level of productive investment over time. However, the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> productive <b>capital</b> would at least be as important as that <b>of</b> infrastructure <b>capital,</b> suggesting an optimal trade off between the two. That is, the social opportunity cost of investing in either type <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> would be determined by the gap between the optimal growth rates estimated from these two types <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> For either type <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> a macroeconomic <b>shortage</b> would mean that {{the economy as a whole}} is in a net state <b>of</b> <b>shortage.</b> <b>Capital</b> shortage, Potential output, Two-gap model, Linear programming...|$|R
