A Goursat {{structure}} on a manifold of dimension n is a rank two distribution D such that dim D(i) = i + 2, for 0 i n − 2, where D(i) denote {{the elements of}} the derived flag of D, de ned by D(0) = D and D(i+ 1) = D(i) + [D(i);D(i) ]. Goursat structures appeared rst in the work of von Weber and Cartan, who have shown that on an open and dense subset they can be converted into the so-called Goursat normal form. Later, Goursat structures have been studied by Kumpera and Ruiz. In the paper, we introduce a new local invariant for Goursat structures, called the singularity type, and prove that the growth vector and the <b>abnormal</b> <b>curves</b> of all elements of the derived flag are determined by this invariant.

Insight to Scoliosis Surgery.   Scoliosis surgery repairs <b>abnormal</b> <b>curving</b> of the spine.   The goal is to correct this back problem by safely straightening the spine and aligning the shoulders and hips.   So what’s {{the problem with the}} current procedure?  Screening methods for scoliosis include general physical examinations and radiological studies, primarily chest radiography.   This results in high exposure to potentially harmful radiation.   During the surgical procedure numerous x-rays need to be taken.   This increases the patient’s exposure to radiation and consumes valuable time.   This more time that is taken, the greater the risk of intro-surgical complications. What can we do to improve the current practice?  Using stereophotogrammetry techniques, we can drastically reduce the number of radiographs needed to assess a patient, reducing their overall exposure to harmful radiation, and reducing {{the amount of time spent}} setting up and developing radiographs.  Advisor: Prof. Mark Bachma...|$|R

40|$|Background: Asymptomatic {{peripheral}} arterial disease (PAD) {{is common}} amongst the elderly and is {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD can be assessed by non-invasive tests such as the ankle/brachial pressure index (ABPI) at rest and Doppler flow velocity (DFV) scanning, but these tests may underestimate the prevalence of PAD. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the added value, for the detection of PAD, of the one-minute exercise test, defined as positive if the drop of the ankle systolic pressure was more than 30 mmHg. We also investigated whether the combination of the ABPI at rest and the one-minute exercise test could replace DFV scanning. Materials and methods: We studied this in a random sample (n = 631) of a 50 - to 75 -year-old population. Results: Of these subjects 11 % (66 / 631) had an abnormal ABPI (< 0. 9) and 16 % (102 / 631) had an <b>abnormal</b> DFV <b>curve.</b> Of this sample 72 % of the subjects performed a one-minute exercise test. Of all subjects 6 % (27 / 451) had an abnormal ABPI (< 0 · 9) and 12 % (54 / 451) had an <b>abnormal</b> DFV <b>curve.</b> The one-minute exercise test revealed seven cases of PAD (beyond the 67 already identified) which were not detected by an abnormal ABPI at rest and/or DFV scanning.

40|$|Uroflowmetry is a simple, {{non-invasive}} examination {{that should}} be the first test in the diagnostic process of lower urinary tract disorders in children. It is applicable particularly in the paediatric population where a comprehensive urodynamic examination, involving urinary bladder catheterisation, is frequently difficult due to the lack of cooperation with children. It must be remembered that the prerequisite for optimal uroflowmetry is recreating natural conditions of micturition. When interpreting results, one must assess the uroflow curve, which is a resultant of urethral resistance and pressure inside the urinary bladder. That is why the main paediatric disorders that can be suspected after uroflowmetry include a functional or anatomical subcystic barrier and hyperactivity of the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder. In normal conditions, the uroflow curve resembles a bell. An <b>abnormal</b> <b>curve</b> can be flattened, tower-shaped or irregular, but none of them is pathognomonic for a given urinary pathology. After a preliminary interpretation of the curve, one must assess whether the calculated micturition parameters, such as maximum flow and average flow rates, are within normal ranges. For this purpose, age- and sex-specific nomograms have been created. The final part of uroflowmetry involves the evaluation of post-void residual urine volume. Currently, ultrasound scan is the recommended method. It has been shown that post-void residual urine volume decreases with age and depends upon sex and bladder capacity. It must be emphasised that one abnormal result of uroflowmetry requires re-examination. Moreover, the results should be interpreted in combination with patient’s medical history...|$|R

In doing so, the minimised mean squared error methods are applied. Most existing empirical studies {{were based on the}} analysis of the options traded in American markets, for example, on S&P 100 Index and S&P 500 Index. Regardless {{of the importance of the}} London markets, there is less research on pricing issues in the FTSE 100 index options contracts. By filling the gap in the literature, this dissertation is according to the study on the FTSE 100 Index call and put options. The empirical studies have proven the existence of the volatility smile, which is derived from the fact that volatility of the FTSE 100 Index options vary across moneyness and maturity. The implied volatilities for both call and put options appear to exhibit a U-shape although some <b>abnormal</b> <b>curves</b> also occur under the incomplete markets condition. Generally, the empirical results from the comparison present that the GARCH model is outperformed than Black-Scholes model and Modified Black-Scholes Model in most cases, and the reduction of pricing errors by implementing the Modified Black-Scholes Model is noticeable. However, its performance on call and put options with less than 60 days and 60 - 120 days to maturity are relatively poor. In addition, GARCH is better in pricing long term to maturity...|$|R

METHODS: Children were divided into 3 groups according to the position of eye and the type of strabismus as follow: concomitant esotropia group(67 cases), concomitant exotropia group(129 cases) and normal eye position group(23 cases). For each group of the children, the extraocular muscle were cut out and frozen for detecting the expression pattern of IGF- 1 by means of immunohistochemistry and Western-blot. We also used ELISA to measure the serum level of IGF- 1. RESULTS:(1) Result detected by immunohistochemistry: IGF- 1 was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm of extraocular muscle cells, small amount of IGF- 1 was expressed in the extracellular matrix. The expression of IGF- 1 in extraocular muscle of normal eye position group was significantly more than that of concomitant esotropia group and concomitant exotropia group(P P P > 0. 05).

The 1999 Ljubljana classification distinguished four grades: <b>simple,</b> <b>abnormal</b> and atypical hyperplasia and in situ carcinoma (ISC). The first two grades are considered benign lesions; the ISC is the malignant lesion, while the atypical hyperplasia is considered a "risky lesion".

Such characteristics refer to cytomorphological (e. g., nuclear hyperchromatism, nucleoli, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio) and architectural (e. g. stratification, orientation, maturation) features. In the Ljubljana scheme, nuclear pleomorphism {{is one of the most}} important features. We wanted to improve the importance of nuclear pleomorphism in the basal cells layer in different classes of EHLL using morphometrical analysis. We studied 8 cases of simple hyperplasia, 10 of abnormal hyperplasia, 10 of atypical hyperplasia and 8 of ISC using the software SAM (Shape Analytical Morphometry). The results were submitted to univariate statistical analysis. Nuclear dimensions (maximum diameter, perimeter and area) showed a progressive increase from simple to atypical hyperplasias to ISC, while abnormal hyperplasia showed the lowest values. On the contrary, analytical parameters related to nuclear contour irregularities and asymmetries showed their highest values in abnormal hyperplasia nuclei. There were no significant differences between atypical hyperplasia and ISC, while it was possible to differentiate abnormal hyperplasia from the others. In conclusion basal nuclei of atypical hyperplasia and ISC are similar so that other cytological and morphological architectural parameters are necessary to distinguish the two lesions.
