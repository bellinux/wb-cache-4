The attack failed and proved to be ill-prepared and disorganised, with an identical <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> and objectives. For his actions during the battle, Captain Chavasse, attached to the Liverpool Scottish, gained the first of two VCs for attending to and rescuing wounded in no man's land. The village would not be captured until the final struggle began on 3 September, by which time the 12th was the King's only contribution, and the regiment had more than 3,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{reputation}} {{continued to}} grow. An innings for Shannon in 1921 against renowned fast bowler George John received great local publicity, {{but according to}} the cricket writer and social historian C. L. R. James, this was the only time prior to 1928 that Constantine played in such an effective way. Constantine's father, still a formidable player, did not put himself forward for selection into the Trinidad team in 1921, in the hope that his son would replace him. The white captain of the Trinidad team, Major Bertie Harragin, recognised the younger Constantine's promise, and selected him to play in Trinidad's Inter-Colonial Tournament match against British Guiana. Unfortunately, Constantine arrived late after a newspaper advertised the wrong <b>starting</b> <b>time,</b> and did not play. However, he made his first-class debut in the following match, the final of the tournament, against Barbados on 21 September 1921. He scored a duck in his first innings, batting at number eight in the batting order. After taking two wickets at a cost of 44 runs in Barbados' only innings, he scored 24 in his second innings, batting at number three.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an activity-based {{bottleneck}} {{model with}} staggered work hours (SWHs) is proposed. Commuters’ departure time choice {{is assumed to}} follows user equilibrium (UE) principle in terms of total activity utility. The equilibrium departure rates of the activity-based bottleneck model with both single work <b>start</b> <b>time</b> and double work <b>start</b> <b>times</b> are analytically derived. Analytical results show {{that there are three}} possible travel patterns for the bottleneck model with double work <b>start</b> <b>times,</b> and the formulations of the departure rates with respect to double work <b>start</b> <b>times</b> are the same as that with respect to single work <b>start</b> <b>time.</b> However, SWHs indeed change commuters’ travel choice behavior, and can result alternative cumulative departure flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{elucidate}} the impact of earlier school <b>start</b> <b>times</b> on elementary school children. Research demonstrates that adolescents are chronically sleep deprived due to shifting biological rhythms and early school <b>start</b> <b>times.</b> As a result, some schools have restructured their schedules to allow for later <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for {{middle and high school}} students. This change has inadvertently resulted in earlier <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for the elementary school students. Although studies demonstrate a positive impact of later <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for adolescents, no studies have examined younger children. This project, therefore, examined the effect of an earlier <b>start</b> <b>time</b> on the sleep patterns of elementary school students, as well as assessed correlations between sleep and cognitive functioning. Two groups of second graders (an experimental and control group) were followed for one-year; one experienced an earlier school <b>start</b> <b>time</b> in third grade, and the other did not. Measures of actigraphy and survey data were obtained. Results demonstrated that changing to an earlier school <b>start</b> <b>time</b> may cause school-aged children to obtain less quality of sleep, and experience a higher rate of daytime sleepiness. Because of the limited sample size included in this study, results are dependent on a larger scale experiment which will be completed within the next year...|$|R
40|$|Duration and <b>start</b> <b>time</b> of {{respirometry}} {{experiments have}} significant {{effects on the}} measurement of basal values for several commonly measured physiological variables (metabolic rate, evaporative water loss and body temperature). A longer measurement duration reduced values for all variables for all <b>start</b> <b>times,</b> and this was an effect of reduced animal activity rather than random sampling. However, {{there was also an}} effect of circadian rhythm on the timing of minimal physiological values. Experiment <b>start</b> <b>time</b> had a significant effect on time taken to reach minimal values for all variables, ranging from 0400 hours ± 38 min (body temperature, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 2300 hours) to 0854 hours ± 52 min (evaporative water loss, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 1700 hours). It also influenced the time of day that minimal values were obtained, ranging from 2224 hours ± 40 min (carbon dioxide production, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 1500 hours) to 0600 hours ± 57 min (oxygen consumption, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 2300 hours), and the minimum values measured. Consequently, both the measurement duration and the experiment <b>start</b> <b>time</b> should be considered in experimental design to account for both a handling and a circadian effect on the animal’s physiology. We suggest that experiments to measure standard physiological variables for small diurnal birds should commence between 1700 and 2100 hours, and measurement duration should be at least 9 h. 9 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Although the {{eventual}} hit game Family Feud ran against As The World Turns from July 12, 1976, until April 22, 1977, {{it did not}} become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with All My Children did trouble really began for As the World Turns (and Days of our Lives), since ABC kept that serial's <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss {{the last half of}} that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the As The World Turns or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the bottom of the hour). Further, All My Children's emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of As the World Turns (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical Days). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old One Life to Live to the 2:00 PM/1:00 PM <b>starting</b> <b>time,</b> compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of As The World Turns from the top spot in the ratings {{at the end of the}} 1978-79 season.

25|$|From around 1950 to 1965, {{the support}} for these {{theories}} was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising {{from the fact that}} the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of hydrogen and helium, whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as quasars and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and physically paradoxical singularity at the <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again. This was formalized as Richard Tolman's oscillating universe. In the sixties, Stephen Hawking and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable, and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of quantum gravity, there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.|$|E
