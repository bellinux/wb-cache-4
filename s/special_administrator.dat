The purpose of this study was to determine the general knowledge of <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> concerning ASD and knowledge of educational programming, to explore their educational training and professional development experiences in ASD, to identify the training needs of <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> in ASD, and to determine if knowledge, training and experience in ASD predict litigation. Using survey methods, data were collected from a sample of 106 <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> in Texas. Data revealed <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> were most knowledgeable of general characteristics, common myths, and instructional strategies, and less knowledgeable of eligibility criteria. Knowledge regarding educational programming for learners with ASD produced mixed results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the role of the special {{education}} teacher aide as perceived by <b>special</b> education <b>administrators,</b> <b>special</b> education teachers, and special education teacher aides in classes for trainable and severely/profoundly mentally retarded. The study involved sixty-four <b>special</b> education <b>administrators,</b> sixty-one <b>special</b> education teachers, and one hundred three special education teacher aides. Data were gathered by use of a questionnaire containing one hundred items representative of behavioral tasks usually performed by special education teachers or special education teacher aides. Participants were asked to respond to each of the one hundred items by marking one of five response categories ranging from "exclusively or primarily the teacher-aide's responsibility to exclusively or primarily the teacher's responsibility. " Data were analyzed statistically by use of chi-square and the. 05 level of significance was chosen. Only school corporations or special education joint cooperatives employing ten or more special education teacher aides in classes for trainable and severely/profoundly mentally retarded were utilized in the study. Fifty-six of the one hundred questionnaire items met the requirements for statistical significance on the basis of a threeway group comparison at the. 05 level. Subsequent, two-way chi-square tests were utilized to determine the response disparities for each possible two-way comparison among the three groups. Conclusions from the findings of the study were: 1. Perceptions held by <b>special</b> education <b>administrators,</b> <b>special</b> education teachers, and special education teacher aides differed concerning the role of the special education teacher aide. 2. Based upon more frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education teacher aides perceived the role of the special education teacher aide less clearly than <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> and <b>special</b> education teachers. 3. Based upon more frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> perceived the role of the special education teacher aide less clearly than special education teachers. 4. Based upon less frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education teachers perceived the role of the special education teacher aide more clearly than <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> or <b>special</b> education teacher aides. 5. Pre-service and in-service training programs do not provide the necessary congruent role adaptation and role integration for clear definition of role and role relationships. 6. Role responsibilities have not been identified for the special education teacher aide. Data supported similar findings of other researchers that I individual efficiency of the job performance of a special education teacher aide is lessened when role and role relationships are not clear. Data supported similar findings of other researchers that organizational effectiveness is lessened when the special education teacher aide is not efficient in job performance. The emergence of role and role relationships of the special education teacher aide evolved from the interaction between the special education teacher and the special education teacher aide and not through definition. The possibility of conflict or incongruency may occur when individual need-dispositions are not the same as the organizational expectations of the role. The possibility of conflict or incongruency may occur when role incumbents are expected to conform and perform simultaneously to different reference groups. Evaluation and supervision of the role incombents would be spurious due to different reference groups expectations. Instruction questionnaire items had the greatest perceptual response disparity between and among the <b>special</b> education <b>administrators,</b> <b>special</b> education teachers, and the special education teacher aides. Clerical questionnaire items had the next greatest perceptual response disparity between and among the <b>special</b> education <b>administrators,</b> <b>special</b> education teachers, and special education teacher aides.

40|$|The 1997 {{amendments}} to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandate that schools evaluate, {{through the process of}} a functional behavioral assessment, those students with disabilities who are exhibiting significant behavior problems which may lead to suspension and expulsion. We conducted a statewide survey of <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> and school psychologists to examine their views of the relative effectiveness, usability, suitability, and practicability of functional behavioral assessment procedures for two types of problem behaviors (i. e., low-level chronic or low frequency unique problem behaviors). The results suggest that <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> and school psychologists are generally supportive of the use of functional behavioral assessments for a range of problem behaviors. However, administrators and psychologists are uncertain of whether such assessments would be acceptable for unique low-frequency problem behaviors that lead to suspension and expulsion such as violations of firearms and drug policies. Additionally, <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> and school psychologists indicated that educators might be unaware of and unwilling to conduct functional behavioral assessments.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} current practices in the verification and placement of learning disabled students. ^ Methods and Procedures. School administrators were surveyed concerning the practices utilized in the identification and placement of learning disabled students. Administrators responded to questions concerning membership of evaluation and placement teams, IQ levels within the definition of learning disabilities, methods used to determine severe discrepancy and rule out contributing conditions, and the desirability of specified roles on evaluation and placement teams. ^ Data Analysis. Data were analyzed by school enrollment, learning disabled incidence rate, and endorsements of the district 2 ̆ 7 s supervisor for special education services. A series of chi-square and analysis of variance tests were used to analyze the data. ^ Findings. Smaller school districts used grade level deviation more frequently than larger districts. ^ Endorsed <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> used expectancy formulas and standard scores to determine severe discrepancy more frequently than nonendorsed <b>special</b> education <b>administrators.</b> ^ Districts with a learning disabled incidence rate below the median used standard scores or expectancy formulas more frequently. ^ Individuals frequently on evaluation and placement teams were: school psychologist, regular education teacher, special education resource teacher, teacher of the learning disabled, speech therapist, parent and regular education administrator. ^ Highest roles by degree of desirability for evaluation and placement teams were: school psychologist, special education resource teacher, regular education teacher, teacher of the learning disabled, and parent. ^ Endorsed <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> used student files more than nonendorsed special education supervisors for contributing conditions. ^ I. Q. range between 81 and 140 was considered within the learning disabled definition by school administrators. ^ Conclusions.

40|$|When Ella Young Flagg, {{the first}} female {{superintendent}} of the Chicago Public Schools, proposed that educational leadership was a woman’s “natural field” {{she could not have}} predicted that one hundred years later women would have neither a majority of school leadership positions, nor would they be proportionally represented when compared with female teachers (Grogan 2 ̆ 6 Shakeshaft, 2011). Unlike the school leadership positions of the principal and superintendent that have been traditionally dominated by men, female leaders have achieved greater parity in special education administration (Keefe 2 ̆ 6 Parmley, 2003). Although female <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> represent an exception to this phenomenon of underrepresentation in school leadership, limited research has been done on this specific population. The purpose of this qualitative study with phenomenological interviewing was to understand the leadership experiences of female <b>special</b> education <b>administrators.</b> The central research question asked: How do female <b>administrators</b> in <b>special</b> education understand their leadership experiences? Eight female <b>special</b> education <b>administrators</b> shared how their personal history and their current leadership experiences influenced their leadership behaviors.
