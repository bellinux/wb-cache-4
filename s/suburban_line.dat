5|$|The North East line {{originated}} from a <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> to Essendon in 1860, being extended to Wodonga by 1873, connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break-of-gauge in 1883. A standard gauge track was completed {{parallel with the}} broad gauge track from Albury to Melbourne in 1962. The broad gauge track has been converted to standard gauge between Seymour and Albury.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 1928 the <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner {{was fully}} {{equipped}} with DC third rail gear. Five trains {{of the new}} DRG Class ET 165 – the type appropriately named Stadtbahn – went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Grünau {{as well as the}} Berlin Ringbahn, were fully electrified. Therefore, suburban services to Spandau could be moved from the long-distance tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when the ring became fully operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as peak time services.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Bracks State Government {{investigated}} {{the construction of}} a heavy rail link to the airport under the Linking Victoria programme. Two options were considered; the first branched off the Craigieburn <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line</b> to the east, and the second branched off the Albion Goods Line, which passes close to the airport's boundary to the south. The second option was preferred. Market research concluded most passengers preferred travelling to the airport by taxi or car, and poor patronage of similar links in Sydney and Brisbane cast doubt on the viability of the project. This led to the project being deferred until at least 2012. On 21 July 2008, the Premier of Victoria reaffirmed the government's commitment to a rail link and said that it would be considered within three to five years. To maximise future development options, the airport is lobbying for the on-grounds section of the railway to be underground.|$|E
50|$|Electrification of Australian {{railways}} {{began with}} the Melbourne and Sydney <b>suburban</b> <b>lines.</b> Melbourne <b>suburban</b> <b>lines</b> were electrified from 1919 using 1.5 kV DC. Sydney <b>suburban</b> <b>lines</b> were electrified from 1926 using the same syatem.|$|R
25|$|After {{building}} the East-West cross-city <b>line</b> connecting western <b>suburban</b> <b>lines,</b> which until then terminated at Charlottenburg station with eastern <b>suburban</b> <b>lines</b> which had terminated at Frankfurter Bahnhof (later Schlesischer Bahnhof), the logical {{next step was}} a North-South cross-city line connecting the northern <b>suburban</b> <b>lines</b> terminating at Stettiner Bahnhof with the southern <b>suburban</b> <b>lines</b> terminating at the subsidiary stations of the Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof. The first ideas for this project emerged only 10 years {{after the completion of}} the East-West cross-city line, with several concrete proposals resulting from a 1909 competition held by the Berlin city administration. Another concrete proposal, already very close to the final realisation, was put forward in 1926 by Professor Jenicke of Breslau university.|$|R
50|$|On 6 November 1928 the <b>suburban</b> <b>lines</b> were electrified.|$|R
5|$|Mass transit {{provides}} intra-city and inter-city {{connections in}} form of bus and rail. Zaprešić is a major railway intersection, with railways leading west to Slovenia (Corridor X), north to Zabok, and Kumrovec (Corridor Xa) and east to the main regional railway hub Zagreb. Croatian Railways services the Zaprešić train station with major interstate trains going to the west, {{but also with the}} <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> Savski Marof–Zagreb Main Station–Dugo Selo. The town is serviced by two bus companies: the regional Zagrebački električni tramvaj (ZET) and local Meštrović prijevoz. ZET operates line 172 to Zaprešić, which starts at the Črnomerec bus terminal in Zagreb and runs every 8 to 15minutes during day, and at irregular intervals during the night. Lines 176 and 177 run to the Zaprešić suburban municipality of Bistra. Meštrović prijevoz, the main intra-city bus company of Zaprešić, operates bus lines connecting Zaprešić and all municipalities in its metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1903 the Leith Central branch opened, serving {{large areas}} of {{northern}} suburbs. The Edinburgh <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line</b> trains were diverted to use Leith Central as their eastern terminus, connections being provided at Portobello for journeys from the eastern area of the <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line</b> to Waverley.|$|E
25|$|The <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> {{continued}} to be maintained to passenger standards as it was used for through services on diversion. Princes Street, the former Caledonian Railway Edinburgh terminus, was closed on Sundays from 20 May 1962 and the trains on that line reached Waverley {{by way of the}} Slateford spur and the <b>suburban</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

25|$|Diesel {{multiple}} unit operation on the <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> was introduced on 9 June 1958. However {{the costs of}} operating a passenger service considerably exceeded the income, and on 10 September 1962 the local passenger service was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|While future heavy rail {{passenger}} {{use of the}} <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line</b> {{cannot be}} ruled out, {{it may be that}} it is a solution looking for a problem: the roundabout route from its stations to the city centre compare adversely to bus transits.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary purpose}} of {{building}} the line had been the provision of a by-pass route for goods and mineral trains, but usage of the circle passenger service developed better than had been expected. Craiglockhart station on the <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> was opened on 1 June 1887.|$|E

25|$|In 1960 a spur {{was opened}} {{connecting}} the former Caledonian route at Slateford, with the Edinburgh <b>Suburban</b> <b>line</b> at Craiglockhart; this enabled trains from the Carstairs direction to run direct towards Niddrie and vice versa; previously such movements had still to run via Edinburgh Waverley. The spur cost £700,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{actual cost}} of the line was {{relatively}} low, although in 1882 the Merchant Company of Edinburgh (governors of George Watson’s Hospital) presented the Company with a claim for £23,368.10/-, to cover the {{cost of the}} land upon which the <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> was being built, as well as rectification works.|$|E
25|$|The {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, and the LNER lines locally {{became part}} of the Scottish Region of British Railways. A marked change in the routing of coal from the Lothian coalfields took place now: instead of running over the Edinburgh <b>Suburban</b> <b>line</b> it ran via Granton and Crewe Junction, a considerable detour.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the {{independent}} existence of the North British Railway, twelve passenger trains ran each way on the <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line</b> each weekday. The railways of Great Britain were grouped in 1923, following the Railways Act 1921 and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).|$|E
25|$|So far as Edinburgh's guided {{transportation}} systems are concerned, the troubled tramway scheme for Edinburgh has enjoyed the limelight for some years. First seriously planned in 2003, {{the emphasis was}} on connecting the airport and northern suburbs to the city centre although a branch route to Newcraighall was contemplated, and later dropped. None of the proposals involved running on the <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line,</b> although a tram-train solution has been advocated by a special interest group: this would have involved vehicles running on the <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line</b> and transferring to street running to achieve a more direct and convenient access to the city centre. This {{would have had the}} incidental advantage of avoiding adding to the train movements on the congested four-track section of the main line from Haymarket to Waverley, but would of course have constrained the route options on the South Side.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> {{was built}} by the Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company in 1860, with their line running from North Melbourne to Essendon, with a branch line from Newmarket to Flemington Racecourse opening in 1861. On {{the eastern side of}} town, the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company opened a branch line from Richmond to Burnley and Hawthorn in 1861.|$|E

25|$|The North Clyde Line (defined by Network Rail as the Glasgow North Electric <b>Suburban</b> <b>line)</b> is a {{suburban}} railway in West Central Scotland. The route is operated by Abellio ScotRail. As {{a result of}} the incorporation of the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and the Edinburgh to Bathgate Line, this route is the fourth rail link between Glasgow and Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|The {{core of this}} network, that is the cross-city ("Stadtbahn") East-West {{line and}} the {{circular}} Ringbahn, and several suburban branches were converted from steam operation to a third-rail electric railway {{in the latter half}} of the 1920s. The Wannsee railway, the <b>suburban</b> <b>line</b> with the highest number of passengers, was electrified in 1932/33. A number of suburban trains remained steam-hauled, even after the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Writing in 1991, Mullay {{said that}} {{from time to}} time schemes for {{re-opening}} the passenger service are urged in the media. The pace has not slackened since, with groups such as the Capital Rail Action Group and TRAC (a public transport subsidiary of Transform Scotland) being active currently. Neither of those groups has a proposal for passenger use of the <b>Suburban</b> <b>Line</b> on its website at present (2015).|$|E
