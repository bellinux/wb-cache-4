Pivot less tilting pad gas bearing mainly used for high speed rotors where whirling is the main issue. Each pad of the journal bearing forms a subsystem with its own local parameters to sustain the load. Basically three pads are used and each pad acts separately on the journal for better load carrying capacity. So during frequent start and <b>stop</b> application <b>pads</b> are coming in contacts protecting the bearing house. This paper contains aeronamic analysis of pivot less tilting pad gas journal bearing. Reynolds’equation is solved by finite difference method and Newton-Raphson method. Static characteristics like pressure profile, load carrying capacity, frictional force,coefficient of friction are calculated, and method to find dynamic parameters of stiffness and damping of a pivotless tilting pad gas journal bearing is shown. The author believes that such detail analysis on tilting pad gas journal bearing at different condition will help researchers around the world. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Women {{with drug}} {{refractory}} neurogenic mixed incontinence (NMI) have limited {{minimally invasive treatment}} options and require reconstructive surgery. We examined efficacy {{of a combination of}} day case intradetrusor (ID) botulinum toxin (BTX-A) bladder injections and transobturator (TOT) or tension free vaginal tape (TVT). Materials and Methods: Eleven women who are pharmacotherapy intolerant or who have drug refractory NMI were treated. Two opted for open surgery and the remaining 9 received 1000 units of Dysport diluted in 30 mL saline cystoscopically at 30 ID sites followed by TOT in 6 or TVT in 3 as a day case combination treatment. Patient demographics, pre and post treatment videocystometrogram (VCMG), pad test and International Committee on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ) scores were recorded. At 6 weeks (repeat ICIQ, pad test and patient satisfaction), at 3 and 12 months (VCMG) and ‘current’ (ICIQ and patient satisfaction) was recorded. Results: The mean age was 56. 7 years (range 41 to 78) with a mean follow up of 19. 1 months (range 7 to 33). All women were continent at 3 and 12 months. Quality of life (ICIQ scores) improved at 6 weeks (p> 0. 001) and remained stable up to the last follow up (p> 0. 001). Eight women have <b>stopped</b> using <b>pads.</b> At 3 months, there was significant improvement in MDP (p> 0. 014) and MCC (p = 0. 002). Anticholinergics were discontinued in 7 with global high satisfaction with the treatment BTX-A injections were repeated in 4 (mean 13. 5 months). Conclusion: Anticholinergic refractory women with NMI can be effectively treated as a day case with combination of ID BTX-A injections and TVT or TOT.

Derek Bell set the fastest lap in the Kremer 935, but nonetheless two BMW coupés won {{ahead of a}} private 934. Porsche still had a narrow lead in the points standings, but only the best {{five of the seven}} events would count. BMW had now three wins compared to Porsche's two, which meant that Porsche had to win the final two races. The new engine setup was tested at Weissach in a modified 934 while the race cars were shipped overseas. At Watkins Glen, the regular race chassis 002 of Mass and Ickx needed an extra <b>stop</b> for new <b>pads</b> for the Porsche 917 derived brakes, and the test chassis 001 of Stommelen and Schurti won, with the best BMW being fourth. Porsche now had three wins and two seconds equaling ninety points, which meant that only another win could add five more points to their tally. BMW had also three wins, but only one second and a fourth, equaling 85 points. Without a competitive third brand, the winner of the final round would take the world championship.|$|R
40|$|Purpose We {{sought to}} predict the {{duration}} of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy based on potential risk factors. Materials and Methods We included 104 patients after radical retropubic prostatectomy at University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven. To evaluate incontinence a 24 -hour pad test, a 1 -hour pad test, a visual analog scale and a questionnaire were used. Patients were considered continent when they <b>stopped</b> wearing incontinence <b>pads,</b> when 24 and 1 -hour pad tests showed less than 2 gm urine loss, and when patients considered themselves continent. On univariate and multivariate analyses we examined the influence of different risk factors on the duration of incontinence. Results The amount of urine loss the first day after catheter withdrawal was the only predictor of the duration of urinary incontinence on univariate and multivariate analyses. Patient age was significant but only on univariate analysis. The duration of incontinence after prostatectomy was estimated. The average time needed to regain continence was 8, 16, 29, 29 and 70 days in men who lost 2 to 50, 51 to 100, 101 to 200, 201 to 500 and more than 500 gm urine, respectively, on day 1. Conclusions The amount of urine loss on day 1 after catheter withdrawal {{is the most important}} predictive factor in terms of regaining urinary continence after radical prostatectomy. An estimation table can provide realistic information to the patient regarding the duration of urinary incontinence. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeveral factors {{influence}} bus transit reliability {{which includes}} bus stop conditions along the route, traffic conditions, route {{of travel and}} time of day. The overall transit bus reliability is generally affected by dwell time (DT), the fare payment method, the bus stop location, {{and the number of}} passengers alighting or boarding. A new variable is defined in this study, total bus stop time (TBST), which is the summation of DT and the time it takes a bus to effectively park at a bus stop and the re-entering the traffic stream. It is suggested that the overall bus transit reliability along routes could be improved if the TBST is minimized at bus stops. In this study, TBST models for bus stops located at mid-blocks and near intersections were developed based on multivariate regression analysis using ordinary least squares method. Data collection was conducted at 60 bus stops, 30 of which were near intersections and 30 at mid-blocks, in Washington DC during morning, mid-day and evening peak hours. The variables observed at each bus stop are as follows: number of passengers alighting or boarding, DT, TBST, bus <b>stop</b> type, bus <b>pad,</b> length number of lanes on approach to the bus stop, and permitted parking. Statistical inferences were based on 5 % level of significance. From the results, it was inferred that the new variable, TBST, could potentially be used to improve scheduling and transit bus systems planning in a dense urban area...|$|R

40|$|A new in vivo {{animal model}} that {{produces}} diffuse brain injuries (DBI) in sagittal plane rearward rotational acceleration has been developed. In this model, {{the skull of}} an anesthetized adult rat is tightly secured to a rotating bar. During trauma, the bar is impacted by a striker that causes the bar and the animal head to rotate rearward; the acceleration phase last 0. 4 ms and {{is followed by a}} rotation at constant speed and a gentle deceleration when the bar makes contact with a <b>padded</b> <b>stop.</b> The total head angle change is less than 30 degrees. By adjusting the air pressure in the rifle used to accelerate the striker, resulting rotational acceleration between 0. 3 and 2. 1 Mrad/s 2 can be produced. Numerous combinations of trauma levels, post-trauma survival times, brain and serum retrieval and tissue preparation techniques were adopted to characterise this new model. The trauma caused subdural bleedings in animals exposed to severe trauma. Staining brain tissue with β-Amyloid Precursor Protein antibodies and FD Neurosilver that detect degenerating axons revealed wide spread axonal injuries (AI) in the corpus callosum, the border between the corpus callosum and cortex and in tracts in the brain stem. The observed AI:s were apparent only when the rotational acceleration level was moderate and above. On the contrary, only limited signs of contusion injuries were observed following trauma. S 100 serum analyses indicate that blood vessel and glia cell injuries occur following moderate levels of trauma despite the absence of obvious BBB injuries. We conclude that this rotational trauma model is capable of producing graded axonal injury, is repeatable and produces limited other types of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and as such is useful in the study of injury biomechanics, diagnostics and treatment strategies following diffuse axonal injury (DAI) ...|$|R
