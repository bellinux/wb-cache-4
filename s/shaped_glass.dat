2500|$|The [...] "saucer" [...] <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> {{is another}} Champagne icon {{associated}} with a celebrity sex symbol. The Champagne coupe is often {{claimed to have been}} modeled on the shape of the breast of a French aristocrat, often cited as Marie Antoinette or Madame de Pompadour. This is almost certainly apocryphal, as the glass was designed especially for sparkling wine in England in 1663, preceding those aristocrats by almost a century, and sparkling Champagne itself by several decades.|$|E
60|$|At last, her eye {{rested on}} an article which stood upon the table, {{and she started}} up impetuously from her chair. She did this so suddenly, that the doctor's hand fell beside him before {{he knew that she}} had risen. The table was covered with all those {{implements}} which become so frequent about a house when severe illness is an inhabitant there. There were little boxes and apothecaries' bottles, cups and saucers standing separate, and bowls, in which messes have been prepared with the hope of suiting a sick man's failing appetite. There was a small saucepan standing on a plate, a curiously <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> utensil left by the doctor, and sundry pieces of flannel, which had been used in rubbing the sufferer's limbs. But {{in the middle of the}} débris stood one black bottle, with head erect, unsuited to the companionship in which it was found.|$|E
60|$|And by {{her side}} there was an odd {{bubbling}} that put her in mind of blowing the soap-suds into a froth when preparing them for bubble blowing; but when she looked round she saw something very unlike the long pipes her big brother used, or the basin of soap-suds. There was a beautifully <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> bottle, and into it went a very long twisting tube, like a snake coiled on the floor, and {{the other end of}} the serpent, instead of a head, had an amber mouth-piece which went between a pair of lips. Lucy knew it for a hubble-bubble or Turkish pipe, and saw that the lips were in a brown face, with big black eyes, round which dark bluish circles were drawn. The jet-black hair was carefully braided with jewels, and over it was thrown a purple satin sort of pelisse over a white silk embroidered vest, tied in with a sash, striped with all manner of colors; also immense wide white trousers, out of which peeped a pair of brown bare feet, on which, however, were a splendid pair of slippers curled up at the toes.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, a [...] "schooner" [...] {{refers to}} a large {{capacity}} beer glass. Unlike the Australian schooner, which is smaller than a pint, a Canadian schooner is always larger. Although not standardized, the most common size of schooner served in Canadian bars is 32 oz. (946 mL); the volume of two US pints. It is usually a tankard (mug) <b>shaped</b> <b>glass,</b> rather than a pint <b>shaped</b> <b>glass.</b> It shouldn't be confused with Schooner Lager, which is a regional brand of beer found only in the eastern maritime provinces of Canada.|$|E
50|$|On average, Belgians drink 84 litres of beer each year, {{down from}} around 200 {{each year in}} 1900. Most beers are bought or served in bottles, rather than cans, and almost every style of beer has its own particular, uniquely <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> or other drinking-vessel. Using the correct glass is {{considered}} to improve its flavor.|$|E
50|$|A {{building}} {{near the}} museum has been equipped with glassblowing facilities for demonstrations and classes. Larry Rutland, the late president's husband, teaches classes in flameworking and lampworking, the art of <b>shaping</b> <b>glass</b> in a flame. Classes in making art glass marbles are also available by appointment.|$|R
50|$|After <b>shaping,</b> <b>glass</b> {{and crystal}} beads {{can have their}} surface {{appearance}} enhanced by etching a translucent frosted layer, applying an additional colour layer, or both. Aurora Borealis, or AB, is a surface coating that diffuses light into a rainbow. Other surface coatings are vitrail, moonlight, dorado, satin, star shine, and heliotrope.|$|R

50|$|With lesser milk consumption, milk in Hong Kong {{is sold in}} both {{glass and}} plastic bottles {{as well as in}} cartons. The glass milk bottles are sold in supermarkets, {{convenience}} stores and in small restaurants. The glass milk bottle carries a deposit of 1 Hong Kong dollar. Most commonly available in the market in glass milk bottles are Kowloon Dairy and Trappist Dairy with different <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> milk bottles with both in school bottle size.|$|E
5000|$|Lacoste Essential is {{the name}} of a men's cologne {{produced}} by high-end apparel company Lacoste. The original Lacoste Essential for men contains aquatics citrus (tangerine, bergamot), tomato leaves, cassis, black pepper, rose, patchouli, sandalwood and “wood accord.” [...] The popular fragrance is recognized by its distinctly <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> container, bearing a brushed aluminum atomizer and the trademark Lacoste crocodile emblem engraved into the glass, as well as the liquid's warm yellow-green tint.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shape of}} a {{wineglass}} can have a subtle impact on the perception of wine, especially its bouquet. Typically, the ideal shape {{is considered to be}} wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg <b>shaped).</b> <b>Glasses</b> which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use ISO XL5 glasses, which are [...] "egg"-shaped. Interestingly, the effect of <b>glass</b> <b>shape</b> {{does not appear to be}} related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.|$|R
50|$|Glass {{will accept}} an almost {{limitless}} number of powder coated colors. Different textures and even metallics {{can also be}} applied. Professionals in this field {{have been able to}} achieve satisfactory silk screen printing and pad printing on the powder coated glass substrate, including in the case of difficult cylindrical <b>shapes.</b> <b>Glass</b> items compatible with powder coating include bottles and containers, decorative pieces, dinnerware, picture frames and more.|$|R
5000|$|Combining many of {{the above}} techniques, but {{focusing}} on art represented in the glass rather than its <b>shape,</b> <b>glass</b> panels or walls can reach tremendous sizes. These may be installed as walls or on top of walls, or hung from a ceiling. Large panels can be found as part of outdoor installation pieces or for interior use. Dedicated lighting is often part of the artwork.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{originally had}} a very small main foyer area with cast aluminium doors {{similar to those of}} the Queen Elizabeth Hall. In 2003, the foyer of the building was remodelled with a larger glass-fronted foyer, designed by the Haworth Tompkins architectural practice, and including a new oval <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> pavilion designed by Dan Graham above a new cafe in the projecting former office space at the east end. A shop had been added earlier inside the north-west end of the lower gallery.|$|E
50|$|Harpa was {{designed}} by the Danish firm Henning Larsen Architects in co-operation with Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson. The structure consists of a steel framework clad with geometric <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> panels of different colours. The building was originally part of a redevelopment of the Austurhöfn area dubbed World Trade Center Reykjavík, which was partially abandoned when the financial crisis took hold. The development was intended to include a 400-room hotel, luxury apartments, retail units, restaurants, a car park and the new headquarters of Icelandic bank Landsbanki.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} plan of San Francisco Science Fiction Conventions, Inc. was {{to hold the}} convention at the futuristic San Francisco Marriott Marquis, designed by the noted architect Anthony J. Lumsden, which is topped with a jukebox <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> tower that makes {{it look like a}} skyscraper from a Flash Gordon comic strip by Alex Raymond. This building is a notable example of futurist architecture. However, the hotel backed out of the contract when a more lucrative larger convention wanted to schedule there on the same weekend.|$|E
5000|$|Several of {{the most}} common {{techniques}} for producing glass art include: blowing, kiln-casting, fusing, slumping, pate-de-verre, flame-working, hot-sculpting and cold-working. Cold work includes traditional stained glass work as well as other methods of <b>shaping</b> <b>glass</b> at room temperature. Glass can also be cut with a diamond saw, or copper wheels embedded with abrasives, and polished to give gleaming facets; the technique used in creating Waterford crystal.|$|R

50|$|The {{most widely}} used and most economical. They range from thinner {{flat-bottomed}} style, to a symmetrical lens <b>shape.</b> <b>Glass</b> stones have the correct weight and can be grasped with ease. White stones are polished and black ones are buffed to a matte finish, giving a feel somewhat like slate and clam stones. Price ranges from US$15 to $80 for glass stones with bowls. Glass 'gems' at an arts and crafts store are an inexpensive alternative.|$|R
50|$|The {{name comes}} from the {{teardrop}} <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> on the front doors and the molding around the eaves of the house.Owned by Edmund Fanning until he sold it to Thomas King, an Inn keeper, in 1768. The {{main body of the}} present structure is probably King's old Inn. Notable eighteenth-century owners include General Thomas Person, Peter Malett, William Duffy and John Taylor, who was clerk of the Superior Court from 1800 to 1845. In 1938, the J.W. Richmond family bought the property and re-opened the house as a private residence. He reopened the house after extensive renovations, as 'The Inn at Teardrops', a bed and breakfast.|$|E
50|$|The new Cougar paid {{homage to}} its smaller {{predecessor}} with a three-piece grille up front, {{topped by a}} new hood ornament which featured the Jaguar-like silhouette of a creeping Cougar. The car's Montego heritage was fairly evident from the sides on back. The Cougar acquired {{the sine qua non}} of the personal luxury car in the 1970s: opera windows. The opera windows were rectangular <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> mounted in the C-pillars and accompanied by a standard partial rear section vinyl roof. This body ran unchanged for three years, and during this period all Cougars were XR-7s.The base model and convertible were dropped this year, but the XR-7 moniker soldiered on as the only model in the Cougar lineup.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005 it was theorized by Los Alamos National Laboratory {{scientist}} Robert Hermes {{and independent}} investigator William Strickfaden {{that much of}} the mineral was formed by sand which was drawn up inside the fireball itself and then rained down in a liquid form. In a 2010 article in Geology Today, Nelson Eby of University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Robert Hermes described Trinitite: [...] Contained within the glass are melted bits of the first atomic bomb and the support structures and various radionuclides formed during the detonation. The glass itself is marvelously complex at the tens to hundreds of micrometre scale, and besides glasses of varying composition also contains unmelted quartz grains. Air transport of the melted material {{led to the formation of}} spheres and dumbbell <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> particles. Similar glasses are formed during all ground level nuclear detonations and contain forensic information that can be used to identify the atomic device.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect of}} <b>glass</b> <b>shape</b> on {{the taste of}} wine has not been {{demonstrated}} by any scientific study and remains controversial. It is however believed by some that the <b>shape</b> of the <b>glass</b> is important, as it concentrates the flavour and aroma (or bouquet) to emphasize the varietal's characteristic. One common belief is that the <b>shape</b> of the <b>glass</b> directs the wine itself into the best area of the mouth from the varietal. This is based on false ideas {{about the nature of}} taste buds on the tongue, such as the thoroughly discredited tongue map.|$|R
50|$|Glassmaking in America symbolized wealth. Ivor Noël Hume {{excavated}} in Virginia {{and found}} one fragment {{of a piece}} of glass. Most glass was utilitarian with a case of glasses in the parlor quite common. Over 70 percent of Hume’s finds were fragments of quatre foil-stemmed glasses. Round bottles assumed a more squat <b>shape.</b> <b>Glass</b> was not universal in most households. Many wealthy colonists had little to no glass in their households. According to his records, a Ralph Fisbourn died in Chester, Pennsylvania in 1708 with an estate of £1,762; his only glass possessions were a few bottles.|$|R
50|$|Other Limburgian specialities are {{beer and}} Jenever. Hasselt, {{the capital of}} Belgian Limburg, {{is home to the}} National Jenever Museum.For a {{comparatively}} small region, Limburg produces {{a very large number of}} beers in a range of different styles.Almost every style of beer has its own particular, uniquely <b>shaped</b> <b>glass</b> or other drinking-vessel.

Some breweries in Limburg are Alken-Maes, Lindeboom, Brand, Gulpener, , Leeuw, Hertog Jan and Alfa. Many of these breweries use water from the Meuse River, which flows through the entire length of the region. Gulpener and Alfa, however, use their own wells in the hilly southeast of the region.Achel brewery or Brouwerij der Sint-Benedictusabdij de Achelse Kluis is a Limburgian Trappist brewery, and the smallest of the seven currently approved Trappist breweries. It is located in the Abbey of Saint Benedict in the Belgian municipality of Achel. It brews five kinds of Trappist beers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{addition}} of a two-door hardtop to the range {{marked the first time}} that this body style had been offered on an Australian Falcon since the XP series of 1965-1966. The hardtop's longer doors with frameless windows were shared with the utility and van, with a different <b>shape</b> <b>glass</b> to suit the commercial vehicles' body apertures. The shorter doors of the sedan and wagon with their framed windows were also available with optional quarter vent windows, though these were very rare, mainly fitted to cars in the hotter parts of Australia. This option was available in the subsequent XB and XC models, though very scarce.|$|R
