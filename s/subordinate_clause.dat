5|$|The participial mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} a <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> describing its subject {{in the state of}} carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as relative clauses.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause,</b> the {{auxiliary}} har is optional and often omitted, particularly in written Swedish.|$|E
5|$|The contemporative mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if {{the subject of the}} <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative {{can also be used to}} form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> the subject, if {{different}} from the subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b> For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5000|$|The strings in bold are <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> and {{the strings}} in non-bold {{are the main}} clauses. Sentences must consist {{of at least one}} main clause, whereas the number of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> is hypothetically without limitation. Long {{sentences}} that contain many <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> are characterized in terms of hypotaxis, the Greek term meaning the grammatical arrangement of [...] "unequal" [...] constructs (hypo="beneath", taxis="arrangement"). Sentences that contain few or no <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> but that may contain coordinated clauses are characterized in terms of parataxis.|$|R
50|$|The gnomic aorist is {{regarded}} as a primary tense in determining the mood of verbs in <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses.</b> That is to say, <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> take the subjunctive instead of the optative.|$|R
50|$|In East Cree {{sometimes}} one sentence is contained within another sentence, {{this is known}} as a <b>subordinate</b> or embedded <b>clause.</b> The verb of the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> have conjunct suffixes and often a conjunct preverb. Below is a table detailing the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause,</b> but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
25|$|Subordinate clauses {{follow the}} main clause {{and have an}} uninflected element (jo) to show the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b> This is {{attached}} to the first verb of the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{relative}} clause {{is a kind}} of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> that contains an element whose interpretation is provided by an antecedent on which the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause</b> is grammatically dependent; that is, there is an anaphora relation between the relativized element in the {{relative clause}} and the antecedent on which it depends.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{description}} of three types of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> in Surui: adverbial <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> complement clauses, and quotative clauses. In adverbial and in one type of complement clauses, reflexive forms are used to show coreference with {{the subject of the}} independent clause. This type of complement clause is closely linked with its complementizer, whereas another type is only in loose construction with a demonstrative complementizer. In this paper, we will survey different types of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> in Surui. 1 One of the first things one notices about <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> in Surui is their scarcity: ignoring direct quotations for the moment, only about 11 % of all <b>clauses</b> are <b>subordinate</b> in text count, compared with 34 % in English (Mithun 1984 : 493).

50|$|Sentences can {{be simple}} or compound, {{depending}} on whether they contain just one verb or more than one. In the sentences {{with more than one}} verb, they can be on an equal footing (juxtaposition or coordination), or there may be one main verb and other subordinate ones. Within the main <b>clause,</b> <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> can be the subject and object (direct or prepositional), which in simple sentences are usually expressed by noun phrases. <b>Subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> can also contain other <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R
25|$|In case of {{coordinating}} clauses, the punctuation mark {{is adapted}} to the ending clause. Subordinated clauses take a punctuation mark reflecting the main clause – except if the main clause is only symbolic, emphasizing the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
500|$|Relative clauses {{are more}} likely to be {{introduced}} with [...] if they do not immediately follow the head noun. Khmer subordinate conjunctions always precede a <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b> Subordinate conjunctions include words such as [...] ("because"), [...] ("seems as if") and [...] ("in order to").|$|E
500|$|Complex {{sentences}} {{are formed}} in Khmer {{by the addition}} of one or more clauses to the main clause. The various types of clauses in Khmer include the coordinate clause, the relative clause and the <b>subordinate</b> <b>clause.</b> Word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above. Coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked; they can simply follow one another. When explicitly marked, they are joined by words similar to English conjunctions such as [...] ("and") and [...] ("and then") or by clause-final conjunction-like adverbs [...] and , both of which can mean [...] "also" [...] or [...] "and also"; disjunction is indicated by [...] ("or"). Relative clauses can be introduced by /deal/ ("that") but, similar to coordinate clauses, often simply follow the main clause. For example, both phrases below can mean [...] "the hospital bed that has wheels".|$|E

40|$|Traditional English grammar {{is still}} not clear on how to define and {{classify}} subordinators for finite clauses in that grammarians mix up relative clauses, which are dependent on NPs, and <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> which are dependent on other clauses. And different functions of the markers of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> are not fully investigated. The author of this aritcle found, through comparative studies, that relative clauses should be distinguished from <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses,</b> which implies that words introducing relative clauses are not subordinators, and even among the markers of <b>subordinate</b> <b>clauses</b> some of them, such as before, because and if that indicates condition, are actually prepositions. There leaves a small class of subordinators for finite clauses, namely, that, whether and if that indicates interrogation...|$|R
