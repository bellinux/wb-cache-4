[...] Game industry executives were confused by Mysts success, not understanding how an [...] "interactive slide show" [...] {{turned out to be a}} huge hit. Online magazine writer Russell Pitts of The Escapist called Myst [...] "unlike anything that had come before, weaving video almost seamlessly into a beautifully rendered world, presenting a captivating landscape filled with puzzles and mystery. In a game market dominated by Doom clones and simulators, Myst took us by the hand and showed us the future of gaming. It took almost a decade for anyone to follow its lead." [...] Critics from Wired and Salon considered the games approaching the level of art, while authors Henry Jenkins and Lev Manovich pointed out the series as exemplifying the promise of new media to create unseen art forms.|$|E
500|$|Andy Shaw of Grovel on {{the other}} hand had a more {{negative}} response, praising the artwork of Dave McKean and calling it [...] "brilliant", but criticized Morrison's story as claustrophobic and [...] "has more ponderous psychology than action and, as a result, not enough room to fit any decent action in." [...] Shaw would later add that Morrison's work [...] "doesn't stand up to his rivals," [...] and that [...] "mixing the history of the asylum – famous dumping ground for Batman's psychotic foes – with a typical Batman adventure is interesting enough, but Morrison throws too much at the hero in too small a space. This makes Batman's journey through Arkham's finest nutters appear too easy – more of a <b>stroll</b> <b>through</b> a fairground haunted house with a few old chums than a serious battle for his life. Coupled with an anti-climatic ending, there's little feeling of impending disaster – the chronicled event should probably appear in Batman's casebook of over-hyped walkovers." [...] Morrison himself admitted that the amount of symbolism made him [...] " [...] up being accused of doing the most pretentious Batman book ever.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's <b>stroll</b> <b>through</b> parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E

[...] When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls, they transferred to carriages to see the sights. [...] The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls, though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol. [...] It was a hot day, and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband, who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch. [...] After smoking a cigar on the veranda, the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long. [...] As it was only 3:30p.m., McKinley stopped for refreshments at the Mission Building before proceeding to the Temple of Music.|$|E
