5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> lies flat.|$|E
5|$|The isotope plutonium-238 has a {{half-life}} of 87.74years. It emits a {{large amount}} of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays/photons and spontaneous neutron rays/particles. Being an alpha emitter, it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. A <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238. One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat.|$|E
50|$|A {{solution}} of 30 percent pulp and 70 percent water is then mixed {{together in a}} vat. Neri may also {{be added to the}} vat. Nagashi-zuki, the most common technique for making <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> is then employed. The mixture is scooped on a screen and allowed to flow {{back and forth across the}} screen to interlock the fibers. This process is ideal for forming thin <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> The other technique for making paper, tame-zuki, does not use neri and forms thicker <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R

5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most common}} {{radiation}} sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation, but {{large amounts of}} alpha particles which do not penetrate even a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or the epidermis of human skin, and is therefore invisible to normal radiation detectors. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation which can cause radiation damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon. Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5000|$|In 1902, J.A. Birchall of Birchalls, a Launceston, Tasmania-based {{stationery}} shop, {{decided that}} the cumbersome method <b>of</b> selling writing <b>paper</b> in folded stacks of [...] "quires" [...] (four <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or parchment folded to form eight leaves) was inefficient. As a solution, he glued together a stack <b>of</b> halved <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> supported by a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> cardboard, creating {{what he called the}} [...] "Silver City Writing Tablet".|$|R

50|$|Organic volume, {{similar to}} organic growth, {{is a term}} used in {{business}} to describe the volume of a product produced due to a specific business process and not due to external circumstances such as acquisition from a separate source. For example, imagine a paper company that produces 1 million <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> notebook <b>paper</b> per month from a plant but also buys 500,000 <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> notebook <b>paper</b> at a discount from a surplus supplier in that same month, then sells all 1.5 million <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> The total volume <b>of</b> notebook <b>paper</b> sold is 1.5 million sheets, however the organic volume <b>of</b> notebook <b>paper</b> sold is 1 million <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> since that was the amount actually produced from the paper company's own factory.|$|R

25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes {{is to take}} a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E

The law would mostly impact the state's 18 million egg-laying hens. The current industry standards call for caged hens {{to get at least}} 67 square inches of space each, a little less than a regular-size <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> (a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> is 93.5 square inches) and hens are typically caged in groups of two to eight. Proposition 2 grew into the most expensive animal welfare ballot measure ever, with both sides raising nearly $8 million each. The measure passed with 63.2 percent of the vote.|$|E
