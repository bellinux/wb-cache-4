40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{protocol}} appropriate for multiple access in a multichannel environment. All free stations contend in one channel, while the busy stations construct one queue belonging to all retransmission channels for collision resolution. Thus asymmetric access methods, such as pre-selection or sequential selection of retransission channels. A queueing model appropriate for the analysis and performance evaluation of the proposed protocol is derived. Analytic solutions are developed for a system with a finite number of stations using discrete time Markov chains. Numerical results indicate the dependence of normalized performance (normalized throughput and normalized delay) on the number of channels.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} often {{suffer from}} rapidly degrading {{performance as the}} number of users increases in the network. One of the major reasons for this rapid degradation of performance is the fact that users are sharing a <b>single</b> <b>channel.</b> Al-though widely deployed standards such as IEEE 802. 11 provides multiple non-overlapping <b>channels,</b> most <b>protocols</b> for wireless ad hoc networks are designed to work in a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> environ-ment. This is because most current devices are equipped with a single transceiver, and they can only listen to one channel at a time. This constraint complicates the protocol design, which discourages the use of multiple channels in ad hot networks. With multiple channels, multiple communications can simulta-neously take place in a region without interfering each other, re-sulting in increased capacity. In this paper, we consider issues re-garding multiple channels at the network layer, assuming a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> MAC <b>protocol</b> such as IEEE 802. 11 DCF. Also, we assume that each node in the network is equipped with a single transceiver. This set of assumptions is very practical, because most devices have a single wireless card implementing the IEEE 802. 11 DCF protocol. We discuss issues in multi-channel routing, and propose a routing protocol which utilizes multiple <b>channels</b> with a <b>single</b> transceiver to improve network capacity. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol using simulations. The re-sults show that the proposed protocol can improve the throughput significantly, without using additional hardware or changing the MAC protocol. I...|$|R

The proposed cognitive radio MAC (CR-MAC) protocol allows SUs to identify and use the unused frequency spectrum in a way that constrains the level of interference to the primary users (PUs). Our scheme improves network throughput significantly, especially when the network is highly congested.

40|$|The ease of {{deployment}} and the auto-configuration {{capabilities of}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) make them very attractive in different domains like environmental, home automation or heath care applications. The use of multichannel communications in WSNs helps {{to improve the}} overall performance of the network. However, in heavy traffic scenarios, routing protocols should be adapted to allow load balancing and to avoid losing data packets due to congestion and queue overflow. In this paper, we present an Acknowledgement-Based Opportunistic Routing (ABORt) protocol designed for high data rate multichannel WSNs. It is a low overhead protocol that does not rely on synchronization for control traffic exchange during the operational phase of the network. ABORt is an opportunistic protocol that relies on link layer acknowledgements to disseminate routing metrics, which helps to reduce overhead. The performance of ABORt is evaluated using the Cooja simulator and the obtained results show that ABORt has a high packet delivery ratio with reduced packet end-to-end delay compared to two <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> routing <b>protocols</b> and two multichannel routing protocols that use number of hops and expected transmission count as routing metrics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a TDMA based energy efficient cognitive radio multichannel {{medium access control}} (MAC) protocol called ECR-MAC for wireless ad hoc networks. ECR-MAC requires only a single half-duplex radio transceiver on each node that integrates the spectrum sensing at physical (PHY) layer and the packet scheduling at MAC layer. In addition to explicit frequency negotiation which is adopted by conventional multichannel MAC protocols, ECR-MAC introduces lightweight explicit time negotiation. This two-dimensional negotiation enables ECR-MAC to exploit the advantage of both multiple channels and TDMA, and achieve aggressive power savings by allowing nodes that {{are not involved in}} communication to go into doze mode. The IEEE 802. 11 standard allows for the use of multiple channels available at the PHY layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a <b>single</b> <b>channel.</b> A <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> MAC <b>protocol</b> does not work well in a multichannel environment, because of the multichannel hidden terminal problem.

This resilience to collisions is shown to hold both when limited feedback and no feedback are available. Despite the increased utilization of the collision channel with the additional traffic produced by the erasure code, it is demonstrated to result in a significant decrease in the probability of loss of multislot and single slot messages. The tradeoffs between message loss probability and delays are shown for a range of medium access transmission designs used in conjunction with the erasure coding...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The use of {{multi-channel}} MAC protocols for mobile ad hoc networks {{has been}} seen as a very potent method of improving the throughput capacity of such networks. In recent past, a number of multi-channel MAC protocols have been proposed for mobile ad hoc networks that have increased the overall network throughput by quite some margin compared to their <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> counterparts. However, there are still many issues with these protocols that need to be resolved. Clock synchronization {{is one of the major}} overhead in a majority of the proposed multi-channel MAC protocols. In this paper we propose a new asynchronous multi-channel MAC protocol that does not require clock synchronization between mobile nodes. Our proposed protocol is an asynchronous solution that uses multiple channels for data transmission. In our proposed protocol, nodes use a <b>single</b> base <b>channel</b> when the network load is considerably lower and migrates to other channels when the network load increases beyond a threshold value. Also, nodes share multi-channel cooperation messages with their neighbors to further improve throughput.

When the control unit is ready to resume such an interrupted connection, it signals the channel to reconnect and resume the interrupted channel program. By closing temporarily dormant connections, channel and control unit facilities may be better utilized to serve other active channel programs and certain protocol timeouts that might otherwise occur may be avoided.|$|R

Control parameters are the retransmission probabilities. Optimization rules are derived which show that the optimal retransmission probabilities may be expressed {{as a function of the}} number of busy stations.

By carefully coordinating the frequency hopping of different nodes, different node pairs can use multiple channels simultaneously. In [17], Mo et al classified these protocols into four generalized categories and compared their performances through both analysis and simulation.
