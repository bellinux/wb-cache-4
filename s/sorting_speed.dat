40|$|Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) is a {{personality}} theory {{often used in}} the study of addictive behaviour (including over-eating) with high reward sensitive individuals typically having greater problems with alcohol and binge-eating. Exposure to external cues associated with drinking (e. g., sight, smell and taste of alcohol) has been shown to increase approach behaviour during a card sorting task (an index of reward sensitivity) in heavy drinkers. However, similar research has yet to examine how appetitive food cues, like the sight and smell of chocolate impact approach behaviour, relative to a non-food cue. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate if a chocolate cue activated appetitive approach response in a sample of “chocolate lovers”. Secondly, it sought to examine if a chocolate reward, enhanced approach responding. Eighty first year university students who identified as “chocolate lovers”, were exposed to a chocolate cupcake cue or a control cue (moneybox). Participants then completed the Card Arranging Reward Responsiveness Objective Test (CARROT). The CARROT involves a number of card sorting trials, one of which is rewarded with either small chocolates or ten cent coins. It was hypothesised that those exposed to the chocolate cupcake and received chocolate rewards would sort faster than participants in the non-chocolate condition. It was predicted that the influence of additional factors, such as reward sensitivity and food addiction would moderate the effects. <b>Sorting</b> <b>speed</b> on the CARROT was not significantly different between the chocolate cue and the moneybox cue. <b>Sorting</b> <b>speed</b> on the CARROT did not significantly differ between chocolate rewards and money rewards.

While Terasort is known for its <b>sorting</b> <b>speed</b> on big data, its performance and energy consumption still can be optimized. We have analyzed the characteristics of Terasort and have identified the existence of idle notes, which does not only waste energy but also loses performance. Therefore, we optimize Terasort through a single-task distributed algorithm and a task self-resizing algorithm to save time and reduce the energy that is consumed by map nodes, which is caused by waiting for tasks and reduce nodes waiting for input. The algorithm proposed in this paper has proved to be effective in optimizing performance and energy consumption through a series of experiments.

This approach builds upon backwards memory allocation, achieving an OIT rendering speed up to 1. 7 × that of the best previous method and 6. 3 × that of the common straight forward OIT implementation.

40|$|Single cell Raman spectra (SCRS) are {{intrinsic}} biochemical profiles and ‘chemical images’ {{of single}} cells {{which can be}} used to characterise phenotypic changes, physiological states and functions of cells. On the base of SCRS, Raman activated cell sorting (RACS) provides a label-free cell sorting approach, which can link single cells to their chemical or phenotypic profiles. Overcoming naturally weak Raman signals, establishing Raman biomarker as sorting criteria to RACS and improving specific sorting technology are three challenges of developing RACS.
