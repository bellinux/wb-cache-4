40|$|From these {{discussion}} groups, 18 problem {{statements were}} developed and prioritized outlining {{the most important}} issues to address now and into the future. Along with each problem statement participants developed potential solutions and action <b>steps</b> <b>geared</b> to move each issue forward. The workshop served as a stepping-stone for action in the field of wildlife toxicology. These problem statements and the resulting action items are presented to the inter-disciplinary wildlife toxicology community for adoption, and future work and action items in these areas are encouraged. For example, it was found that ecologists would be essential in addressing the implications of sublethal or lethal effects of contaminants on wildlife at the population, community and ecosystem scales. The workshop outcome looks to generate conversation and collaboration that will lead to the development of innovative research, future mechanisms for funding, workshops, working groups, and listserves within the wildlife toxicology community. |$|R
40|$|Gear {{rattle of}} {{multi-step}} helical gear system is treated. Mesh stiffness variations and tooth profile errors are considered within the system. The effects of mesh stiffness variations, {{the ratio of}} static torque to dynamic one and tooth profile errors on the rattle are studied by a highly accurate numerical analysis called the shooting method. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) Because of the tooth profile errors, the amplitude of resonances like gear noise becomes large and the vibration becomes chaos. These resonances are confirmed in some regions. (2) The phenomena which generate when the constant torque is smaller than the amplitude of variational torque in some extent {{are similar to those}} of single <b>step</b> <b>gear</b> system, the displacement amplitude of one-sided impact rattle is affected by tooth profile error, but that of both sides impact rattle is not affected so much...|$|R
40|$|An optimal line {{pressure}} control {{algorithm was proposed}} for the fuel economy improvement of an AT-based parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). By performing lever analysis at each <b>gear</b> <b>step,</b> the required {{line pressure}} was obtained considering the torque ratio of the friction elements. In addition, the required line pressure of the mode clutch was calculated. Based on these results, the optimal line pressure map at each <b>gear</b> <b>step</b> of the EV and HEV modes was presented. Using the line pressure map, an optimal line pressure was performed for the AT input torque and mode. To investigate the proposed line pressure control algorithm, a HEV performance simulator was developed based on the powertrain model of the target HEV, and fuel economy improvement was evaluated. Simulation results showed that as the <b>gear</b> <b>step</b> became higher, the optimal line pressure control could reduce the hydraulic power loss, which gave a 2. 2 % fuel economy improvement compared to the existing line pressure control for the FTP- 72 mode...|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} here focused {{on whether the}} precision casting method with a lost model and lost mold {{may be used for}} the production of microcomponents and on whether it may be further developed to a microcasting technique. As lost models, microparts made of plastics were applied. They had been manufactured by microinjection molding using both mold inserts structured by microcutting techniques and LIGA mold inserts. Examples of such parts are microturbine housings and <b>stepped</b> <b>gear</b> wheels. The range of metal materials used for the microparts was extended to multi-component alloys based on the systems of Cu-Al-Ni-Fe, Ag-Cu, Ag-Pd-Cu, and Au-Ag-Cu. Parts with minimum cross sections of 50 #mu#m were cast. To assess microcastability, test devices were developed. They allowed to determine the level of filling of the mold, molding accuracy, mechanical properties, and surface quality for various casting alloys. Furthermore, the cast structures could be characterized. Fundamental experiments were performed to determine the influence of the molding material on the roughness of the cast surface. It was demonstrated that the surface roughnesses that can be achieved are far smaller than those reached by conventional precision casting methods. (orig.) 57 refs.

25|$|Gear {{ranges of}} almost 700% can be {{achieved}} on derailleur setups, though this may result in some rather large <b>steps</b> between <b>gears</b> or some awkward gear changes. However, through the careful choice of chainrings and rear cogsets, e.g. 3 chainrings 48-34-20 and a 10-speed cassette 11-32, one can achieve an extremely wide range of gears that are still well spaced. This sort of setup has proven useful on a multitude of bicycles such as cargo bikes, touring bikes and tandems.

25|$|Racing cyclists {{often have}} gears {{with a small}} {{relative}} difference of around 7% to 10%; this allows fine adjustment of gear ratios to suit the conditions and maintain a consistent pedalling speed.

40|$|The aplyronines are {{a family}} of 24 -membered {{macrolides}} of polyketide origin, isolated from the Japanese sea hare Aplysia kurodai. They exhibit an exceptional biological activity profile, acting through an actin and tubulin dual-targeting mechanism, with subnanomolar growth inhibitory potency against a diverse range of cancer cell lines. These characteristics render the aplyronines ideal payloads for antibody-drug conjugates but their prohibitively low natural abundance calls for an efficient total synthesis to overcome the supply issue. This dissertation describes the efforts towards developing a second-generation Paterson synthesis of the macrocyclic core of the aplyronines, focused on improving the scalability and selectivity of key transformations. Chapter 1 details the isolation, biological background and previous synthetic efforts towards the aplyronines to illustrate their therapeutic potential and the challenges associated with material sourcing by chemical synthesis. Chapter 2 presents the existing body of work on the aplyronine project within the Paterson group, highlighting the lessons learned {{over the past two}} decades and shortcomings to be addressed. Chapter 3 discusses a revised protecting group strategy towards the C 1 -C 27 macrocyclic alcohol 159 with fewer manipulation steps. A refined reaction sequence featuring titanium aldol methodology and an enzymatic desymmetrisation process delivered multigram stocks of the C 15 -C 27 aldehyde 161 upon scale- up, testifying to the robustness of the devised route. Synthesis of the C 1 -C 14 northern fragment 253 closely followed the existing boron aldol approach with optimisation of the C 11 -C 12 alkylation <b>step,</b> <b>geared</b> towards enhancing the regioselectivity. Chapter 4 describes the coupling of the two major fragments using an Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction to assemble the C 1 -C 27 backbone of the cyclic aplyronine core and suitably adjusted endgame steps to enable a one-step oxidative unmasking of the macrolactonisation sites. The first-generation intermediate 159 was accessed via site-specific Yamaguchi esterification and orthogonal deprotection of the C 27 allyl carbonate. Discussion in Chapter 5 includes the appendage of the C 28 -C 34 side chain 118, prepared by the known sequence, and suggestions for the future direction of the second-generation route with the outlook of linker appendage for the purposes of antibody-drug conjugate development.

50|$|Closed {{loop systems}} in mobile {{equipment}} are generally {{used for the}} transmission {{as an alternative to}} mechanical and hydrodynamic (converter) transmissions. The advantage is a stepless gear ratio (continuously variable speed/torque) and a more flexible control of the gear ratio depending on the load and operating conditions. The hydrostatic transmission is generally limited to around 200 kW maximum power, as the total cost gets too high at higher power compared to a hydrodynamic transmission. Large wheel loaders for instance and heavy machines are therefore usually equipped with converter transmissions. Recent technical achievements for the converter transmissions have improved the efficiency and developments in the software have also improved the characteristics, for example selectable gear shifting programs during operation and more <b>gear</b> <b>steps,</b> giving them characteristics close to the hydrostatic transmission.|$|R
