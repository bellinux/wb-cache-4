5|$|Rouget's {{division}} and Paris' brigade apparently {{began to pull}} back after Darmagnac's retreat. Seeing a gap open between Rouget and Taupin, Wellington ordered the 52nd Foot to advance from the Roman Camp and drive a wedge into the French defensive line. The unit's commander John Colborne led his men across some marshy ground and then up the slope toward the Luc knoll, followed by Wellington and his staff. They won a foothold {{at the top of}} the ridge on Taupin's left flank. With both its flanks turned, Taupin's division hurriedly retreated to the northeast, the last French unit to be dislodged. The mauled division never rallied, though it managed to <b>save</b> <b>all</b> but two of its cannons. At some position to the rear, Rouget's {{division and}} Paris' brigade joined together and fought a hard battle against the pursuing Allies.|$|E

25|$|The Canons {{also taught}} that God's {{intention}} in decreeing {{the death of}} Christ was the salvation of only the elect. Later in the 17th century, Moses Amyraut and several others (Amyraldists) proposed a system called hypothetical universalism, which taught that in God's decree for Christ to be a sufficient atonement for all sin, his intention was to <b>save</b> <b>all</b> on condition that they believe. This decree was prior to his decree to elect some people for whom the atonement was to be efficacious, and so {{the efficacy of the}} atonement was still limited to the elect. Most of the Reformed rejected this view because it envisioned a decree of God (the conditional decree to <b>save</b> <b>all)</b> that was intentionally not realized. Though Calvin has been enlisted on both sides of controversies on this issue, he is somewhat vague, as are the Canons of Dort.|$|E

25|$|ChuChu Rocket! is {{an action}} puzzle video game {{developed}} by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega. Released for the Dreamcast in 1999, {{it was the first}} game for the system to support multiplayer gaming over the internet. The foundation of the gameplay requires the players to place arrows on a board to lead mice into their rockets while avoiding hazardous cats. The game features single-player modes in which a player must <b>save</b> <b>all</b> the mice on a given board, and also competitive multiplayer modes that pits players against each other in a battle to collect the most mice.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} modes of play within ChuChu Rocket! {{including}} a single-player puzzle mode, a puzzle editing mode, a cooperative challenge mode, and competitive multiplayer modes. In the puzzle mode, the player is provided a limited set of arrows to {{place on the}} field to <b>save</b> <b>all</b> the ChuChus in play. The puzzle editing mode allows players {{to create their own}} puzzles like this. In the challenge mode, players are given 30 seconds to save the ChuChus in play without any arrow limitations as in puzzle mode. In the competition modes, each player has a rocket and must guide as many ChuChus as possible into their rocket in the time limit. This mode supports up to four players, either in free-for-all or team-based fashion.|$|E

Helen Dukas (1896–1982) began working for Einstein with increased systematization from April 1928, {{although not all}} outgoing correspondence was saved. After the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Einstein's son-in-law Rudolf Kayser, aided by the French Embassy, rescued Einstein's papers in Berlin. Some of the material at Einstein's summer house in Caputh, Brandenburg was destroyed to avoid seizure, although most of his works between 1930 and 1932 were saved. That material was transported via Haberlandstrasse where Einstein lived in Berlin, then to Paris, and ended up stored in Princeton, New Jersey, United States until after Einstein's death.|$|E

The rebels rescue Trudy from the mind-controlling Guardian and recruit numerous tribes to help them win the battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} pitchers for Game 2 were Rich Hill for the Dodgers and Justin Verlander for the Astros.

25|$|In the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana, Durvasa {{appears at}} Rama's {{doorstep}} and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demands {{an audience with}} Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama(the god of death) disguised as an ascetic. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential and anyone who entered the room and saw or heard them was to be executed. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshman with the duty of guarding his door and fulfilling his promise to Yama. Thus, when Durvasa made his demand, Lakshman politely asked the sage to wait until Rama had finished his meeting. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshman did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshman, in a dilemma, {{decided it would be}} better that he alone die to <b>save</b> <b>all</b> of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. Durvasa told Rama of his desire to be fed and Rama fulfilled his guest's request, whereupon the satisfied sage went on his way. Rama was overcome with sorrow, for {{he did not want to}} kill his beloved brother, Lakshman. Still, he had given his word to Yama and could not go back on it. He called his advisers to help him resolve this quandary. On Vasishta's advice, he ordered Lakshman to leave him for good, since such abandonment was equivalent to death as far as the pious were concerned. Lakshman then went to the banks of the Sarayu, resolved on giving up the world through Yoga.|$|E

The teams set a new record for combined home runs in a single World Series game with eight. This was the first World Series game ever won by the Astros as they had been swept in their previous appearance in 2005.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by the trade publications.

It ought to, at any rate, because that story is plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it." [...] A review in The Nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of the film, but the reviewer found the subject to be enhanced by the attention to detail in the production. The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role. Though Lonergan was fond of using the technique. Even The New York Dramatic Mirror gave some praise to the production, but noted that the acting of the mother's friend was the weakest because [...] " [...] man of his [...] wouldn't have backed off so quickly."

500|$|... (1988), as {{the title}} suggests, {{features}} the return of Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) to the film series. The film reveals that Michael survived the fire in Halloween II but {{has been in a}} coma since that night. While being transferred back to Smith's Grove, Michael comes out of his coma and overhears that Laurie Strode, who died in a car accident, has a daughter, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Michael escapes the transport and heads to Haddonfield in search of Jamie. Fellow survivor Dr. Loomis also goes to Haddonfield after learning that Michael has escaped transfer. Eventually, the police track Michael down and shoot him several times before he falls down a mine shaft. Picking up directly where the previous film ends, [...] (1989) has Michael (Don Shanks) surviving the gunshots, and the fall down the mine; he stumbles upon a hermit who bandages him up. One year later, and showing signs of a metaphysical connection to Jamie, Michael tracks Jamie to a local child mental health clinic. Using Jamie as bait, Loomis manages to capture Michael. The film ends with Michael being taken into police custody, only to be broken out of jail by a mysterious stranger, all dressed in black. [...] (1995) picks up the story approximately six years after the events of The Revenge of Michael Myers. The mysterious stranger who broke Michael out of jail kidnaps Jamie Lloyd (J. C. Brandy) in an effort to obtain her illegitimate child. Jamie escapes with her newborn, with Michael (George P. Wilbur) in pursuit. Michael kills Jamie and continues searching for her baby; the infant is found by Tommy Doyle (Paul Stephen Rudd)—the young boy who was babysat by Laurie Strode in the first film—who brings it home for safety. It is revealed that Michael is driven by the Curse of Thorn, which forces a person to kill their entire family in order to <b>save</b> <b>all</b> of civilization. The mysterious stranger is revealed to be Dr. Loomis’s colleague, Dr. Wynn (Mitchell Ryan), who is {{part of a group of}} people who protect the chosen individual so that they may complete their task.
