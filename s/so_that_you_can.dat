[...] After working with The Smeezingtons on Unorthodox Jukebox, Jeff Bhasker admitted that [...] "One of their great talents is that they have this fun, light vibe in the studio", something that enables anyone [...] "to be free <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> let that primal emotion come out without being embarrassed. Then they polish afterward". Mark Ronson concurred adding that the key is on Mars' charisma, which he has had since he began impersonating Elvis. Ronson concluded, [...] "Everything Bruno adds is what takes it into superstardom".|$|E

500|$|Bowie himself remembered {{almost nothing}} of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, [...] "I know it was in LA because I've read it was". The singer {{was not alone in}} his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, [...] "if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do your guitar part, you do the line of coke... the coke use is driven by the inspiration." [...] Like Bowie, Earl Slick had {{somewhat}} vague memories of the recording: [...] "That album's a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts—a lot of hours, a lot of late nights." ...|$|E
500|$|Rewrites were {{commissioned}} once more, specifically to give Halle Berry more screen time. This {{was because of}} her recent popularity in Monster's Ball, earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped. Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set. In the words of Dyas, [...] "The control room [...] was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sit up [...] and travel around the subject {{who is in the}} middle of the control room. The idea for the traveling is that if it's a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can't connect." ...|$|E
500|$|MPC {{handled the}} visual effects for the [...] "Smallville encounter" [...] sequence. Before {{providing}} the visual effects, the shots were previsualized {{for the fight}} choreography. After the previsualizations, live action portions of the scene would be filmed in small pieces. [...] "If say Superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away, we would shoot our start position and end position, and then bridge that gap with the CG takeovers," [...] says Guillaume Rocheron, the MPC visual effects supervisor. A camera rig would then obtain key frames of the choreographed actor. [...] "It's a six-still camera rig that's built on a pipe rig <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> run it in {{at the end of}} a setup and get stills of key frames of a performance or an expression," [...] said Desjardin, [...] "and then we could use those hi-res stills to project onto the CG double and get really accurate transition lighting and color—right from the set." ...|$|E

500|$|With Internationalist, Powderfinger {{first set}} their sights overseas, {{appearing}} at numerous music festivals in the U.S., including South by Southwest in Texas. While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in Los Angeles and New York City. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult {{due to the}} lack of any homegrown fan support. [...] He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped. Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in Austin, as [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "fun". After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as [...] "people [...] are going to get sick of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sustain yourself financially." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{determining}} {{the style of}} 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to My Bloody Valentine 3D. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but {{expressed an interest in}} shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of first-person shooter video games being rendered in 3D. Dunstan added that [...] "It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface {{to try to get a}} reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch." [...] Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an [...] "interesting experience". Mandylor called the 3D shoot [...] "more tedious and longer". Flannery described the 3D aspect as being [...] " [...] shot in 3D <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> perse, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that. But I think we made a good movie." [...] Post-production services were provided by Deluxe.|$|E

We realized that lots of different people get fun out of the game in lots of different ways. We tested on young kids, we tested on adults, we tested on a mix of the two, and we {{came to the conclusion that}} anyone can play this game. We very much wanted the game to be accessible from the start <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> play alongside your granny or with your kids.

The Element of Freedom {{was scheduled to be}} released on December 1, 2009, to correspond with World AIDS Day, but was pushed back to December 15 for additional recording. According to the senior vice president of urban marketing for J Records, Keys [...] "had a couple of more things in the oven and she wants this to be right [...] So we gave her the additional time she needed." [...] Keys pointed out that she felt the album was being rushed for no reason. In {{an interview}} with Scottish newspaper The Scotsman, she stated that it [...] "seems unfair to have to rush these songs that were still coming and not allow them to be the best songs they could be. It was just two weeks' difference, but it made for an even better record".|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Jackson {{unveiled}} an edgier image, flaunting hennaed {{red hair}} and tattoos on her neck, wrist, foot, back, and lower thigh; also acquiring nipple, septum, and labia piercings. The transition was considered to risk alienation, though she was commended as [...] "a master at surprising and shocking her public". Jackson used {{a variation of the}} Akan Sankofa symbol throughout its artwork and imagery; representing the motif [...] "You cannot move into the future until you learn from your past". She tattooed the symbol onto her wrist, saying, [...] " [...] appeared on my album The Velvet Rope and it's very important to me. [...] It's about going into your past and dealing with it <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> move forward". Jackson's tattoo artist later stated, [...] "I {{have a lot of people}} who fly in from all over the world to get something that has to do with Janet’s sacred tattoos... She's an inspiration to a lot of people, and when they see something on Janet that helps her be strong, they want that strength as well".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you."

2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
