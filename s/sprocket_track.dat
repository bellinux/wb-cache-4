50|$|The Grizzly's {{suspension}} used 17-{{tooth drive}} <b>sprockets</b> and CDP <b>tracks.</b> In comparison, the M4 used 13 tooth drive <b>sprockets.</b> The CDP <b>track</b> was lighter and simpler {{than the standard}} US tracks and did not require rubber, which was scarce since the Japanese advance into Southeast Asia and the Fall of Malaya.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two common}} widths of single speed and fixed gear bicycle chains: [...] inch and [...] inch. The chainring, {{sprocket}} and chain {{should all be}} the same width. Although an [...] inch chain will work on a [...] inch chainring or sprocket, it is not ideal. A [...] inch chain will not work on a [...] inch chainring or sprocket. Because {{they do not need}} to shift between <b>sprockets,</b> <b>track</b> chains use a full bushing to reduce flex and increase strength. Newer bicycles with derailleur gears use bushingless chains which flex, making gear changing possible.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Track</b> <b>sprocket</b> - There is no {{mechanism}} {{that allows the}} rider to coast. There are two sets of threads on the hub shell. The threads are in opposite directions. The inner (clockwise) set of threads is for a <b>track</b> <b>sprocket</b> and the outer (counter-clockwise) set is for a reverse threaded lock ring. The reverse threads on the lock ring keep the sprocket from unscrewing from the hub, which is otherwise possible when slowing down.|$|R
50|$|Final drives {{are mounted}} {{in the front and}} the idler <b>sprockets</b> with <b>track</b> {{tensioners}} are mounted at the rear. The running gear has six road wheel stations per side, which guide a lightweight steel or segmented rubber band-type track. The road wheels are mounted on a suspension system comprising swing arms with conventional torsion bars and damper systems, this set-up is proven to be reliable and cost-efficient.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Track</b> <b>sprockets</b> are {{typically}} attached and {{removed from the}} hub by screwing them with a chain whip. This tool also has a lockring spanner for securing a reverse threaded lockring against the sprocket.|$|R
50|$|The {{armour plating}} was {{provided}} by the New Zealand Railways. The four wheels shared drive and idler <b>sprockets</b> with the <b>track,</b> and the move from wheels to track, and vice versa, could be made from within the hull.|$|R
5000|$|Flip-flop hub - Both {{sides of}} the hub are threaded, {{allowing}} the wheel to be removed and reversed in order to change which gear is used. Depending on the style of threads, may be used with either a single-speed freewheel or a <b>track</b> <b>sprocket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The United States would supply: the engine; radiator; fan; piping; silencer; lighting; dynamo; battery; {{propeller}} shaft; transmission, including gearbox; brakes; roller sprockets; {{gear shift}} and brake control; track links and pins; rear <b>track</b> <b>sprockets,</b> hub and shafts; front idler hub and shafts; track roller, track spindles and bushings.|$|R
50|$|The M3 was {{succeeded by}} the {{superior}} M4 Sherman. The Allies agreed to standardise on the M4, and MLW began producing the Canadian version, the Grizzly tanks in August 1943. The Grizzly's suspension used 17-tooth drive <b>sprockets</b> and CDP <b>tracks.</b> In comparison, the M4 used 13 tooth drive <b>sprockets.</b> The CDP <b>track</b> was lighter and simpler {{than the standard}} US tracks and did not require rubber, which was scarce since the Japanese advance into Southeast Asia. The Canadian Grizzly tank production halted when it became apparent US production would be sufficient. Instead, MLW produced the Sexton self-propelled gun Mk II. The Sexton Mk II used the Grizzly chassis, with the upper hull modified to carry the Commonwealth standard QF 25 pounder gun. The Sexton was the Commonwealth counterpart to the US M7 Priest. A small batch of Grizzly medium tank was fitted with an Ordnance QF 17-pounder for training but none saw action.|$|R
50|$|Uncommon for tanks at the time, Porsche {{selected}} a Gasoline-electric drive train. The front drive <b>sprockets</b> for the <b>tracks</b> were driven by two electric motors mounted {{forward in the}} hull. Two, air-cooled, V-10 gasoline engines, mounted toward {{the rear of the}} vehicle, were each connected to a generator to produce electricity. The generated electricity was then used to power the motors. Each engine produced 210 PS at 2500 RPM; a total of 420 PS was therefore available to drive the generators.|$|R
5000|$|BMP-1U Shkval, or BMP-1M Shkval (‘squall’)- 2001 Ukrainian {{modernization}} of BMP-1. The original turret {{was replaced with}} a new Shkval weapons station which was developed for light armored vehicles to increase their combat effectiveness. It resembles the earlier Russian KBP Instrument Design Bureau TKB-799 Kliver one-man weapons station. The Shkval weapons station is built from domestic components and is armed with a 30 mm KBA-2 autocannon, an ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M113 Konkurs (AT-5 Spandrel) ATGMs and a 30 mm AGS-17 [...] "Plamya"automatic grenade launcher. With ammunition for the weapons used in the Shkval being very common around the world, there is no danger of shortages, which {{makes it easier to}} maintain and lowers the cost of production. This gives it a better position on the export market. Because the Shkval weapons station is considerably larger than the standard BMP-1 turret, the troop compartment was cut down and there is space only for six infantrymen instead of eight. The first pair of roof hatches cannot be opened. The vehicle also has other upgrades including flotation sides-skirts/mudguards, drive <b>sprockets</b> and <b>tracks</b> from the BMP-2.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Precise {{cable drive}} has been {{developed}} as an alternative transmission element to gearbox, belt and pulleys, chains and <b>sprocket</b> in Electro-Optical <b>Tracking</b> system. Precise cable drive has several significant advantages including backlash free, high stiffness, high efficiency, no lubrication etc. This paper develops analytical methods to predict the transverse oscillation frequency of precise cable drive to enable designers to better assess dynamic performance in the design study phase. Theoretical formulation of transverse oscillation equation for precise cable drive is carried out based on Hamilton’s principle taking into account flexural rigidity of cable. Furthermore, the transverse oscillation frequency is obtained from the transverse oscillation equation assuming small and linear vibration. Parametric studies are conducted to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} oscillation properties and cable drive parameters...|$|R
5000|$|Tracks may be broadly {{categorized}} as [...] "live" [...] or [...] "dead" [...] track. [...] "Dead" [...] track {{is a simple}} design in which each track plate {{is connected to the}} rest with hinge-type pins. These dead tracks will lie flat if placed on the ground; the drive <b>sprocket</b> pulls the <b>track</b> around the wheels with no assistance from the track itself. [...] "Live" [...] track is slightly more complex, with each link connected to the next by a bushing which causes the track to bend slightly inward. A length of live track left on the ground will curl upward slightly at each end. Although the drive sprocket must still pull the track around the wheels, the track itself tends to bend inward, slightly assisting the sprocket and somewhat conforming to the wheels.|$|R
50|$|Among modern tractors, {{the high}} drive (elevated sprocket) design {{is unique to}} Caterpillar products. The concept {{originated}} in 1914 with Caterpillar predecessor C. L. Best Tractor's 30 Humpback; this tractor was discontinued a year later, and the only other tractor to use the concept until the D10's introduction was the Cletrac Model F, built between 1920 and 1922. The elevated sprocket eliminates the final drive system, inclined to frequent failure. This elevated drive sprocket undercarriage was built in modular form; breakdown of the tracks and removal of the drive sprockets was much easier. The transmission can {{be removed from the}} rear because of the modular design. As the engine and drivetrain are mounted high in a traditional bulldozer, the half shafts from the differential exit above the drive sprocket, requiring a small gear {{on the end of the}} half shaft and another, larger one attached to the drive sprocket. The high-drive system eliminates the traditional final drive in favor of the planetary final drive, which withstands engine torque better, since it distributes the forces over multiple gear teeth instead of a single tooth as in the traditional system. The disadvantage is that the track moves around one more <b>sprocket,</b> reducing <b>track</b> life. Caterpillar claims to have alleviated this with the SALT (Sealed and Lubricated Track), a permanently lubricated track system which was introduced on their track-type tractors in the early 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Precise {{cable drive}} has been {{developed}} as an alternative transmission element to gears, belts and pulleys, chains and <b>sprockets</b> in electro-optical <b>tracking</b> system. The analytical method is developed to predict the transmission backlash of precise cable drive to enable designers to better assess the precision performance in the design study phase. Slip angle of precise cable drive is studied, {{and the effect of}} the rotational velocity and inertia of cable on the force equilibrium of contact region is considered. The deformation of cable in slip region and free region is calculated respectively and theoretical formulation of transmission backlash for precise cable drive system is carried out. Parametric sensitivity is investigated to evaluate the relationship between the transmission backlash and precise cable drive parameters including preload tension, load tension, friction coefficient, center distance and output drum radius. Experimental setup is built and the transmission backlash is tested. Effect of preload tension on the transmission backlash is tested. Results show that the experimental value and the theoretical curve of the transmission backlash fit well, which validates the theoretical method developed in this article...|$|R
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a <b>track</b> <b>sprocket,</b> because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|R
50|$|The hull was {{equipped}} with a torsion bar suspension designed to ensure a vehicle with good cross-country mobility. The hull and suspension recalled both the German Tiger and the Panther tanks which, having entered French service after the war, were well known and deliberately imitated. Especially the engine deck, the <b>sprockets</b> and the <b>tracks</b> are strongly reminiscent of the German design style. The nine overlapping tyred road wheels each side, were however much smaller. The French engineers had not been aware at first that the much admired German overlapping design had been motivated by a shortage of high quality rubber, necessitating large road wheels to lower tyre tension, which then were made overlapping to better distribute the load pressure. As France would have no trouble obtaining rubber of the desired quality, this feature was superfluous. Therefore the road wheels were made smaller, compared to the first design proposal, both to save weight and lower {{the profile of the}} tank, which was quite high due to a deep hull, a problem only changed in the fifth prototype. The track now had to be supported by five top rollers. The overlapping system as such was maintained in all prototypes; with smaller wheels it allowed for nine instead of the originally planned eight wheels, five forming the outer, four the inner row.|$|R
50|$|Dolby Digital data {{is printed}} in the spaces between the {{perforations}} on the soundtrack side of the film, 26 frames before the picture. Release prints with Dolby Digital always include an analog Dolby Stereo soundtrack with Dolby SR noise reduction, thus these prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. Dolby Digital produces 6 discrete channels. In a variant called SR-D EX, {{the left and right}} surround channels can be dematrixed into left, right, and back surround, using a matrix system similar to Dolby Pro Logic. The audio data in a Dolby Digital track is compressed in the 16-bit AC-3 compression scheme at a ratio of about 12:1. The images between each perforation are read by a CCD located either above the projector or in the regular analog sound head below the film gate, a digital delay within the processor allowing correct lip-sync to be achieved regardless of the position of the reader relative to the picture gate. The information is then decoded, decompressed and converted to analog; this can happen either in a separate Dolby Digital processor that feeds signals to the cinema sound processor, or digital decoding can be built into the cinema processor.One disadvantage of this system is if the digital printing is not entirely within the space between the <b>sprocket</b> holes;if the <b>track</b> was off a bit on either the top or the bottom,the sound track would be unplayable,and a replacement reel would have to be ordered.|$|R
5000|$|Many World War II German {{military}} vehicles, initially (starting in {{the late}} 1930s) including all vehicles originally designed to be half-tracks and all later tank designs (after the Panzer IV), had slack-track systems, usually driven by a front-located drive <b>sprocket,</b> the <b>track</b> returning along the tops of a design of overlapping and sometimes interleaved large diameter road wheels, as on the suspension systems of the Tiger I and Panther tanks, generically known by the term Schachtellaufwerk in German, for both half-track and fully tracked vehicles. There were suspensions with one (sometimes double) wheel per axle, alternately supporting {{the inner and outer}} side of the track, and interleaved suspensions with two or three road wheels per axle, distributing the load over the track. [...] The choice of overlapping/interleaved road wheels allowed the use of slightly more torsion bar suspension members, allowing any German tracked military vehicle with such a setup to have a noticeably smoother ride over challenging terrain, leading to reduced wear and more accurate fire. There were some major disadvantages with this though, one being on the Russian front, mud would get stuck in-between the overlapping wheels, and would freeze, immobilizing the vehicle. As a tracked vehicle moves, the load of each wheel moves over the track, pushing down and forward that part of the earth, snow, etc. under it, similarly to a wheeled vehicle but to a lesser extent because the tread helps distribute the load. Apparently, on some surfaces, this consumes enough energy to slow the vehicle down significantly, so overlapped and interleaved wheels improve performance (including fuel consumption) by loading the track more evenly. It also must have extended the life of the tracks and possibly of the wheels. The wheels also better protect the vehicle from enemy fire, and mobility is improved when some wheels are missing. But this complicated approach has not been used since World War II ended. This may be related more to maintenance than to original cost. The torsion bars and bearings may stay dry and clean, but the wheels and tread work in mud, sand, rocks, snow and so on. In addition, the outer wheels (up to 9 of them, some double) had to be removed to access the inner ones. In WW II, vehicles typically had to be maintained a few months before being destroyed or captured, but in peacetime vehicles must train several crews, over a period of decades.|$|R
5000|$|A {{tracked vehicle}} uses a {{combination}} of wheels and rollers, including drive <b>sprockets,</b> idler wheels, <b>track</b> return rollers and road wheels. It is quite similar in concept to a conveyor belt, only instead of a machine carrying objects {{on top of a}} powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a drive sprocket (or drive wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On {{the opposite end of the}} vehicle, there is an idler wheel, which provides a pulley wheel of sorts. On some applications, the drive sprocket and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the drive sprocket and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the drive sprocket is on the front (see M4 Sherman for an example). Since the drive sprocket can be at either the front (M4 Sherman) or the rear (M1 Abrahms) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the drive sprocket (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the drive sprocket and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its rotation), this has nothing to do with the term [...] "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both [...] "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" [...] being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The road wheels are a series of non-powered wheels between the drive sprocket and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered [...] "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the drive sprocket, in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. Track return rollers may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid [...] "road" [...] for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created [...] "road", while the drive sprocket forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down [...] "fresh" [...] track. The idler picks the [...] "used" [...] track back up, and returns it back to the drive sprocket in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a [...] "track-laying machine" [...] (not to be confused with railroad track laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see corduroy road, plank road). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.|$|R
