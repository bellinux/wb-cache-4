50|$|Compared {{to other}} gourami species, the <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> is less {{frequently}} sold as aquarium fish but is {{more commonly used}} as food fish in their native lands. The <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> is a highly economic species that is captured and cultured for food and for export for the aquarium trade. It {{is one of the}} five most important aquacultured freshwater species in Thailand. Its flesh is of good quality, and may be fried, grilled or used for fish soup, like tom yam. In Thailand, there is a trade of dried <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> for the benefit of people in areas where the live fish is not available.|$|E

50|$|A <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> is {{a bottom}} and middle tank level dweller. It {{requires}} a 24-inch (61 cm) length aquarium. A 10 or 20 gallon (38 to 76 liter) tank {{is sufficient for}} a fish of 4 inches (10 cm) length. A larger specimen {{should be kept in}} a 32-inch (81 cm) or 30 gallon (114 liter) tank. The recommended pH is 5.8 to 8.5 with a water hardness of 2 to 30 dH and a temperature of 72 to 86°F (22-30°C). A <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> can grow up to 8 inches (20 cm) in captivity and its spawns are also unusually large.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> {{generally}} feed on {{aquatic insect}} {{and other small}} living organism in its habitat. Like other labyrinth fish, it can breathe air directly, as well as absorb oxygen from water through its gills.|$|E
50|$|Other smaller {{labyrinth}} fish, such as {{the climbing}} perch, the kissing gourami, the <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami,</b> and other gouramies of the genus Trichogaster, are local food fish in Southeast Asia. In some areas, the fish are processed into salted and dried food.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> {{are found}} in rice paddies, shallow ponds, and swamps. They {{are found in}} shallow, sluggish, or {{standing}} water habitats {{with a lot of}} aquatic vegetation. It also occurs in flooded forests of the lower Mekong, and gradually moves back to rivers as floodwaters recede.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} Trichogaster species, Trichopodus gouramis are {{popular in the}} {{aquarium}} trade. The three spot gourami (T. trichopterus), with its several aquarium variants, each known by a different trade name, {{is perhaps the most}} common aquarium gourami. Trichopodus species are also used as food fish in its native range. The <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami,</b> in particular, {{is one of the top}} five aquacultured freshwater fish in Thailand.|$|E
5000|$|Trichopodus (formerly {{included}} in Trichogaster) is a genus of tropical freshwater labyrinth fish of the gourami family found in Southeast Asia. Gouramis of the Trichopodus genus {{are closely related}} to those of Trichogaster (formerly Colisa), species of both genera have long, thread-like pelvic fins (known as [...] "feelers" [...] in the aquarium trade) used to sense the environment. However, Trichopodus species have shorter dorsal fin base and, when sexually mature, are much larger, with the largest, the <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> (T. pectoralis), capable of reaching a length of over 8 in.|$|E
5000|$|Breeding <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> is not difficult. They will breed {{when they}} reach 5 inches (12.5 cm) length. It is the most {{prolific}} among all the gourami species. There can {{be as many as}} 5,000 fry from a single spawning period. The males are relatively nonaggressive, even at spawning times, which is unlike other labyrinth fishes. The parents will also not eat the fry. Fry can be raised by feeding progressively larger flake foods, in accordance with the size of the fry; occasionally feeding of live foods such as newly hatched brine shrimp is a welcome change in their diet. [...] During breeding, like some of other labyrinth species, snakeskin gouramies are observed to vocalize sounds described as croaking, growling or cracking tones, to demonstrate territorial behavior.|$|E
50|$|The <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> is an elongated, {{moderately}} compressed {{fish with}} a small dorsal fin. Its anal fin is nearly {{the length of the}} body and the pelvic fins are long and thread-like. The back is olive in color and the flanks are greenish gray with a silver iridescence. An obvious, irregular black band extends from the snout, through the eye, and to the caudal peduncle. The underparts are white. The rear part of the body may be marked with faint transverse stripes. The fins are also gray-green, and the iris of the eye may be amber under favorable water conditions. The dorsal fins of male fish are pointed and the pelvic fins are orange to red. The males are also slimmer than the less colorful females. Juvenile snakeskin gouramis have strikingly strong zig-zag lines from the eye {{to the base of the}} tail.|$|E
40|$|Many authors {{report on}} the effect of rice-fish culture on rice yields. Some reports show {{increased}} rice yields, others show no effect or even decreased yields. To verify the impact of rice-fish culture, data gathered over eight experiments (1995 - 1999) at the Co Do experimental rice-fish station, Vietnam, were analysed through multiple regressions with rice yield and different yield components as the dependent variables. We used eight independent variables: season, water depth, rice variety, rice seeding rate, and the effective stocking density (ESD) of silver barb, Nile tilapia, common carp and <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami.</b> Season had the biggest impact on nearly all dependent variables. Rice yields in the wet season were on average 2. 42 t/ha lower as compared to the dry season. Higher water levels decreased the number of panicles/m(2) and the rice yield. The rice seeding rate affected the yield component variables, but had no impact on the rice yield. Silver barb feeding decreased the number of panicles/m(2) but this was compensated by an increased number of grains/panicle. <b>Snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> had a positive effect on panicles/m(2) and, together with common carp, on sink capacity, probably through improved nutrient cycling in presence of fish and improved nutrient uptake by the rice plant. <b>Snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> had a negative effect on the ripening ability, whereas Nile tilapia had a positive effect. Fish did not have any impact on the rice yield. Increased water level and reduced rice arable area, the main two requirements for rice-fish culture, result in lower rice yields from rice-fish systems as compared to monoculture systems. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to test the {{antibiotic}} susceptibility of Salmonella isolates from <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami</b> against 17 antibiotics and to reveal the exposure level of the antibiotics known as Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index. Salmonella were isolated using Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate (XLD) medium. A total of ten bacterial isolates were randomly selected for antimicrobial sensitivity test using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method onto Tryptone Soy Agar (TSA) media. Seventeen antibiotics, namely fosfomycin, colistin sulphate, chloramphenicol, spiramycin, ampicillin, erythromycin, novobiocin, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole, compound sulphonamides, florfenicol, lincomycin, flumequine, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, tetracycline and amoxicillin were tested. The result of the study indicated that Salmonella isolates sensitive to antibiotic tested which are gentamicin, florfenicol and nalidixic acid with their percentage values of 100 %, 90 % and 80 % respectively whereas Salmonella isolates was found 100 % resistant to ampicillin, lincomycin and amoxicillin.

40|$|Aim: Epizootic {{ulcerative}} syndrome (EUS) causes by aquatic oomycete fungus, Aphanomyces invadans is {{a dangerous}} fish disease {{of a wide range}} of fresh and brackish water, wild and farmed fish throughout the world. The objective of the present study was to determine the susceptibility of a number of tropical fish species to the EUS and compare the severity of infection between experimental groups. Materials and Methods: Snakehead, Channa striata (Bloch, 1793); <b>snakeskin</b> <b>gourami,</b> Trichopodus pectoralis (Regan, 1910); koi carp, Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758); broadhead catfish, Clarias macrocephalus (Günther, 1864); goldfish, Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758); climbing perch, Anabas testudineus (Bloch, 1792); and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) were challenged by intramuscular injection using zoospores of Aphanomyces invadans (NJM 9701). The infected fish skins and muscles were examined for EUS histopathological characteristics, and the results on the severity of lesions and mortality were analyzed using SPSS program. Results: All zoospore-injected fish were shown to be susceptible to the EUS infection except Nile tilapia. Although, the general histopathological pattern was similar in the zoospore-injected group, but there were some variation in granulomatous reaction, that is the presence or absence of giant cells, and time of mortality were detected. The result of statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between species, (c 2 = 145. 11 and p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Gourami, koi carp, and catfish were demonstrated to be highly susceptible while goldfish and climbing perch were found to be moderately susceptible to the EUS infection. These findings suggested that the cellular response of fish to mycotic infection and granulomatous reaction varied in different fish species, which could not be an indicator of susceptibility or resistant to the EUS itself, although it was shown that the granulation rate and the level of maturity or solidification (consolidation of granulomas) were higher in resistant fish...|$|E

Many biological phenomena recur at reg-ular intervals in both plants and animals and {{are referred to as}} biological rhythms (I). The most frequently occurring bio-logical rhythm is the diel or circadian rhythm (I, 2). Diel rhythms of fishes have been studied by relatively few investigators (3) and most of these studies have dealt with activity periods for particular species (1, 3 - 7). Generally, studies 00 fishes have been conducted in the wild using traps of some type and extrapolating activity pat-terns from percentage of captured popula-tions. There have been relatively few at-tempts to bring animals into the laboratory under conditions where qualitative and quantitative data on their behavior could be acquired. Under such conditions fishes have been shown to exhibit periodicity in movement (4, 8), feeding (9), and oxygen consumption (10, 11). Diel activity patterns have recently come under investigation in aoabantoid fishes.
