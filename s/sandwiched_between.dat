After the game, Chiefs head coach Herman Edwards announced that Croyle would miss the remainder of the 2008 season.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> two cyclooctatetraene ligands.

The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E
5|$|Deptford borders {{the areas}} of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross {{to the west and}} Rotherhithe to the north west; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the River Thames {{separates}} the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is contained within the London SE8 post code area. The area referred to as North Deptford is {{the only part of the}} London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> Rotherhithe and Greenwich. Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards, now known as Convoys Wharf, the Pepys Estate and some eastern fringes of the old Surrey Commercial Docks.|$|E
5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E

The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|No longer {{known by}} the BGCR name, the route meanders north, slowly edging east towards Reesor Road and now {{surrounded}} by undeveloped greenspace. It encounters Highway7, north of which it becomes a divided roadway travelling on {{the eastern edge of}} Cornell as well as parallel to and alongside Reesor Road. Approaching and intersecting 16th Avenue, the road makes a broad sweeping curve northwest, continuing to serve as the boundary of urban development in Markham. It narrows to a two lane road, with adjacent land along the northern side prepared for future northbound lanes, before encountering Ninth Line again. Quickly curving north then east, <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> the neighbourhood of Greenborough and Little Rouge Creek, the route makes a final curve north to end at Major Mackenzie Drive on the northern edge of urban development in eastern Markham.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, {{but most of the}} muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E

5|$|The town {{is built}} on igneous rock in the James Valley, <b>sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> steep cliffs. It is {{therefore}} rather long and thin. The walls of the valley are rough and steep, and rockfalls have been a problem, although now minimised by netting. A small stream, the Run, runs through the valley. The town is commonly divided into lower and upper parts, depending on the distance up James Valley. Being the island's main port (and with the Saint Helena Airport only receiving its first scheduled flight in October 2017) the town is still currently the main entrance to the island to visitors. Despite not being connected to Jamestown proper by road, Rupert's Valley, the next valley north, {{is also part of}} the town. It houses much of the island's infrastructure, such as its power station and associated fuel storage, and a one-ship wharf was completed in June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels {{along the}} Lake Ontario {{shoreline}} through the Niagara Fruit Belt; numerous wineries line {{the south side}} of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road18) provide access to the communities of Vineland and Beamsville, respectively.

The route curves eastward then crosses West Duffins Creek north of the community of Whitevale and south of the future Pickering Airport and planned community of Seaton. <b>Sandwiched</b> <b>between</b> farm fields, the highway is crossed by North Road, where a future interchange is planned, and Sideline 24. Highway407 ended just south of Brougham at a signalized intersection with Brock Road (Durham Regional Road1) until the end of 2015, where it continued eastward as Highway7. A new interchange has been built in conjunction with the provincially maintained and tolled extension, Highway407E, which was constructed east of this point, and ties in with the current freeway, eliminating the at-grade intersection.|$|E
