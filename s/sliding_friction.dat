A ball {{in a ball}} bearing also slides as the diameter of inner and outer races are different and the distance of circumference differs from the inside and out. When a ball bearing is used as the main bearing on a crankshaft (which rarely is the case), eccentricity of the cage (race) normally creates a phase imbalance in <b>slide</b> <b>friction.</b> Friction forces for plain/shell bearings (the {{most common type of}} bearings) are dependent upon diameter and width, which determine bearing surface area. This needs to be balanced for the pressure and the rotational speed of the load. Different main bearing sizes on a crankshaft create plane imbalance in <b>slide</b> <b>friction.</b>|$|R

25|$|Dry {{friction}} resists relative {{lateral motion}} of two solid surfaces in contact.

40|$|<b>Sliding</b> {{shoulder}} <b>friction</b> stir welding (SSFSW) is {{an alternative}} joining technique to the conventional friction stir welding process. The welding mechanism comprises of a rotating probe and a non-rotating shoulder. The shoulder therefore does not contribute to any heat generation or plastic deformation. When welding thicker section material, the contribution of heat generation from the shoulder becomes less significant {{and most of the}} heat and plastic deformation must be generated by the tool probe. For this reason it was decided to develop the process for thick section AA 6082 -T 6. Due to the stationary (non-rotating) shoulder the weld track is smooth and there is no reduction in cross-sectional area. This research is based on the development of a <b>sliding</b> shoulder <b>friction</b> stir welding tool with the ability to create joints of up to 25 mm thick on aluminium alloy 6082 -T 6 plate as well as the associated process development. The <b>sliding</b> shoulder <b>friction</b> stir welding tool was designed, manufactured and tested by initially performing partial penetration welds with various size tool probes and then finally by performing a <b>sliding</b> shoulder <b>friction</b> stir butt weld on 25 mm thick plate. As welds were performed and more knowledge gained about the process, design modifications were made. These included varying the clearance between the tool probe and stationary shoulder; the profile of the shoulder which contributes to material flow during the process; and supporting the tool probe to prevent deflection when welding thicker sections at high forge forces. From the <b>sliding</b> shoulder <b>friction</b> stir welds performed, an understanding of material flow during the process was gained when analysing the macro-sections and exit holes of the welds. Typical process forces and torques associated with the process were measured to assist with future head unit and tool designs with regard to <b>sliding</b> shoulder <b>friction</b> stir welding...|$|R

For example, it is common for a longitudinally-mounted inline engine to have the front-most cylinder cooled more than the other cylinders, resulting in the temperature and torque generated on that cylinder less than on other phase and planes. Also, thermal imbalance creates variations in tolerance, creating varied <b>sliding</b> <b>frictions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Colbeck {{offers an}} {{overview}} of the five friction processes of skis on snow. They are the: 1) resistance due to plowing of snow out of the way, 2) deformation of the snow over which the ski is traveling, 3) lubrication of the ski with a thin layer of melt water, 4) capillary attraction of water in the snow to the ski bottom, and 5) contamination of the snow with dust and other non-slippery elements. Plowing and deformation pertain to the interaction of the ski, as a whole, with the snow and are negligible on a firm surface. Lubrication, capillary attraction and contamination are issues for the ski bottom and the wax that is applied to reduce <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> or achieve adequate grip.|$|E
25|$|The torque {{applied to}} each driving wheel {{is the result}} of the engine, transmission, and drive axle {{applying}} a twisting force against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to slip. If the torque applied to one of the drive wheels exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other driven wheel equal to the <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Sliding</b> <b>friction</b> {{between the}} surface of the cam and the cam {{follower}} which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce <b>sliding</b> <b>friction.</b> The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|E

A special feature of the tool consists in possibility of creating different impact energy by the change of the lifting height of the rod with the tip (indenter) and the exchangeable load mass. This allows the study of the influence of the tip shape and the impact energy on the snow strength parameters in a wide range, extends the scope of application of the durometer and makes possible to determine the strength of snow-ice formations by indenters with various geometrical parameters depending on climatic conditions...|$|R

2500|$|Ski wax is a {{material}} {{applied to the}} bottom of snow runners, including skis, snowboards, and toboggans, to improve their coefficient of friction performance under varying snow conditions. The two main types of wax used on skis are glide waxes and grip waxes. They address kinetic friction—to be minimized with a glide wax—and static friction—to be achieved with a grip wax. Both types of wax are designed to be matched with the varying properties of snow, including crystal type and size, and moisture content of the snow surface, which vary with temperature and the temperature history of the snow. Glide wax is selected to minimize <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> for both alpine and cross-country skiing. Grip wax (also called [...] "kick wax") provides on-snow traction for cross-country skiers, as they stride forward using classic technique.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{a sliding}} ski melts a thin and {{transitory}} film of lubricating layer of water, {{caused by the}} heat of friction between the ski and the snow in its passing. Colbeck suggests that the optimum water film thickness is in the range between 4 [...] and 12 μm. However, the heat generated by friction can be lost by conduction to a cold ski, thereby diminishing {{the production of the}} melt layer. At the other extreme, when the snow is wet and warm, heat generation creates a thicker film that can create increased capillary drag on the ski bottom. Kuzmin and Fuss suggest that the most favorable combination of ski base material properties to minimize ski <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> on snow include: increased hardness and lowered thermal conductivity of the base material to promote meltwater generation for lubrication, wear resistance in cold snow, and hydrophobicity to minimize capillary suction. These attributes are readily achievable with a PFTE base, which diminishes the value added by glide waxes. Lintzén reports that factors other than wax are much more important in reducing friction on cross-country skate skis—the curvature of the ski and snow conditions.|$|E
