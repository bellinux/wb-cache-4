40|$|Historically, {{calibration}} {{results have}} typically been recorded {{and stored in}} the form of attributes data. In the past few years, however, an apparent trend has begun to emerge for recording and storing calibration results {{in the form of}} variables data. This is partly due to ISO/IEC 17025 requirements for uncertainty analysis and partly due to the growing implementation of six-sigma or other SPC quality control systems. The growing availability of variables data has positive implications for calibration interval analysis. This paper describes a methodology for determining calibration intervals from variables data. A regression analysis analytical approach is developed and algorithms are given for <b>setting</b> <b>parameter</b> calibration intervals from the results of variables data analysis. ...|$|E

30|$|Since it is {{a general}} fading distribution, the α−η−μ model {{includes}} as special cases other short-term fading distributions, like Rayleigh, Nakagami-q (Hoyt), Nakagami-m, η−μ, Weibull and one-side Gaussian distribution. By <b>setting</b> <b>parameter</b> α to value α= 2, it reduces to η−μ distribution. Further, from the η−μ fading distribution, the Nakagami-m model could be obtained in two cases: first, for η→ 1, with parameter m being expressed as m=μ/ 2 and second, for η→ 0, with parameter m being expressed as m=μ. It is well-known that η−μ distribution reduces to the Hoyt distribution, for the case when μ= 1, with parameter b defined as b=(1 −η)/(1 +η). By equating the in-phase and quadrature component variances, namely by setting η= 1, the Rayleigh distribution is derived from Hoyt. Also the Weibull distribution could be obtained as a special case of the α−η−μ model by setting corresponding values to the parameters η= 1 and μ= 1. Major contribution of this analysis is then the above-mentioned generality.|$|E
