5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E

25|$|Congress recommissioned Proctor as colonel on April 21, 1780. Under {{the command}} of Anthony Wayne he {{was present at the}} Battle of Bull's Ferry on July 20. The cattle raid was {{successful}} but the Americans were unable to storm a blockhouse manned by Loyalists despite a bombardment by four cannons. Proctor's role is known because British Major John André penned a satirical poem about the battle called the Cow Chace that mentioned the American artilleryman. Infuriated over the Pennsylvania Council's promotion of officers without his approval, Proctor tendered his resignation on April 9, 1781. Reed wrote to Washington that he was pleased to be rid of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> officer.|$|E

Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save anyone in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> spot. One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2013, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies. They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} winter of 195354, Hutton led M.C.C. on a controversial tour of West Indies, {{becoming the first}} professional captain of England on a tour in the twentieth century. His appointment as captain had been queried at home by those who believed that a professional might captain at home but would be unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton also encountered problems as the touring party was being selected. Usually, M.C.C. tours had experienced managers; Hutton had expressed a preference for Billy Griffith, the assistant secretary to the M.C.C. who had toured West Indies as a player in 194748. The M.C.C. decided that Griffith could not be spared from his duties. Instead, they appointed Charles Palmer, the captain of Leicestershire, as a player-manager, despite his inexperience in the role as manager and playerhe had not played Test cricket at the time. This appointment caused authority on the tour to become muddled as Palmer was tour manager {{for most of the}} time, with authority over the captain, but a player {{for the rest of the}} time, under the captain's orders. Nor did Palmer have the experience nor temperament for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> position, according to Alan Gibson, while E. W. Swanton described the appointment of Palmer by the M.C.C. as one of the worst it ever made. Hutton also struggled to lead some of the senior professionals on the tour, feeling uncomfortable giving orders to fellow professionals, particularly as some, such as Godfrey Evans, were unco-operative at first, and he found Trueman difficult to handle.|$|E

Natalia chided him for his absence and Michael retorted that it was simply wrong for his relatives to abandon their units to attend Constantine's funeral at such a time. The American war correspondent, Stanley Washburn, reported that Michael wore [...] "a simple uniform with nothing to indicate his rank but shoulder straps of the same material as his uniform". Michael was [...] "unaffected and democratic" [...] and [...] "living so simply in a dirty village". Natalia was appalled that Michael eschewed fancy uniforms and decorations for life at the front, but he was convinced [...] "that at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time I must serve Russia and serve here at the front".|$|E
500|$|With the {{assistance}} of HMS Otter, which had followed Boadicea from Saint Denis, Rowley was able to return his prize and the battered Ceylon to Île Bourbon without significant difficulty. British casualties had been relatively minor for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> engagement, Ceylon suffering 10 men killed and 31 wounded and Boadicea just 2 wounded. French losses were also comparatively light, with only 9 dead and 15 wounded on Vénus and none at all on Victor. Rowley repaired Ceylon and restored Gordon in command. Vénus was also repaired, and entered British service as HMS Nereide to replace the Nereide lost at Grand Port. Nearly four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by the clasps [...] "BOADICEA 18 SEPT.

500|$|In 1961, Cardinale portrayed a sultry nightclub {{singer and}} young mother in Valerio Zurlini's Girl with a Suitcase. As {{a result of}} her own {{experience}} of early motherhood, Cardinale naturally conveyed the concerns of a teenaged mother, identifying fully with the character of Aida. Such was her psychological involvement that she needed several months to overcome her apprehensions and prepare for the part. Zurlini chose her for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> role against everyone's advice, as she was not yet considered a [...] "real" [...] actress, nor was she (yet) one of the most celebrated Italian beauties. However, he was very close and supportive of Cardinale during the production, and a true friendship developed between the two, based on a deep mutual understanding. Cardinale remarked: [...] "Zurlini {{was one of those who}} really love women: he had an almost feminine sensitivity. He could understand me at a glance. He taught me everything, without ever making demands on me. ... He was really very fond of me." [...] Cardinale was warmly praised by the critics for her performance in Girl with a Suitcase, Dennis Schwartz considering her to have been at her [...] "charming best". Later in 1961, Cardinale starred as a brothel owner opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in Bolognini's La Viaccia. Both Girl with a Suitcase and La Viaccia were presented at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, but several newspapers and magazines including Paris Match began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot. Cardinale's 1961 appearances also included Henri Verneuil's French comedy Les Lions sont lâchés, and Auguste in which she had a cameo role.|$|E

2500|$|In Dune (1965), Duncan is {{described}} as a handsome man with [...] "curling black hair" [...] to whom women are easily attracted. Paul Atreides notes Duncan's [...] "dark round face" [...] and [...] "feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> weapons teacher to emulate." [...] Lady Jessica calls him [...] "the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed." [...] Duncan is fiercely loyal to House Atreides, is a skilled pilot, and as a Swordmaster of the Ginaz is a gifted hand-to-hand fighter. In the fight that ends with his death in Dune, Duncan kills an unheard-of 19 Sardaukar, the Padishah Emperor's fearsome supersoldiers. The Sardaukar sell his body to the Tleilaxu; subsequent gholas of Duncan possess the rebellious streak of the original.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} forty or so years, Dauphin Borough {{has been a}} bedroom {{community}} of Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital. Many of its civic centers had gone into steep decline, industry migrated elsewhere, taverns and hotels closed, as did schools and churches. The railroad, which declined during the late twentieth century, {{has been reduced to}} two tracks paralleling the river, with no stops or stations in Dauphin. One {{of the reasons for the}} decline was that as traffic on U.S. Rte. 22 increased, the borough became less desirable as a place in which to reside. By the 1980s, traffic on Rte. 22 was so heavy that the road essentially cut the borough in half. Residents often had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time traveling across the borough that they waited until after morning and evening rush hours.

2500|$|Descartes himself {{struggled}} {{to come up}} with a feasible answer to this problem. In his letter to Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine, he suggested that spirits interacted with the body through the pineal gland, a small gland in the centre of the brain, between the two hemispheres. The term [...] "Cartesian dualism" [...] is also often associated with this more specific notion of causal interaction through the pineal gland. However, this explanation was not satisfactory: how can an immaterial mind interact with the physical pineal gland? Because Descartes' was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> theory to defend, some of his disciples, such as Arnold Geulincx and Nicholas Malebranche, proposed a different explanation: That all mind–body interactions required the direct intervention of God. According to these philosophers, the appropriate states of mind and body were only the occasions for such intervention, not real causes. These occasionalists maintained the strong thesis that all causation was directly dependent on God, instead of holding that all causation was natural except for that between mind and body.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this period}} of time, he abused his power by taking revenge against those who {{offended}} him before, and by killing them without reason. Some officials approached Zhuge Liang, another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, [...] "When our lord was in Gong'an, he was wary of Cao Cao's influence {{in the north and}} fearful of Sun Quan's presence in the east.

I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand."

2500|$|In mid-May, the King {{started to}} {{consider}} the problem of exiting the war. He was persuaded to consider this possibility by Duke Pietro d'Acquarone, Minister of the Royal House, who {{was worried about the}} future of the monarchy. Italian public opinion, having waited in vain for months for a sign from the King, was starting to turn against the monarchy. At the end of May two high-ranking politicians of the pre-Fascist age, Ivanoe Bonomi and Marcello Soleri, were received by d'Acquarone and the King's aide-de-camp, Gen. Puntoni. [...] Both pressed the royal officials for the arrest of Mussolini and the nomination of a military government. On 2 and 8 June they were received in audience by the King, but were both frustrated by his inaction. On 30 June Bonomi met Crown Prince Umberto, and proposed three generals (Ambrosio, Marshal Pietro Badoglio and Enrico Caviglia) as candidates to succeed Mussolini. On 4 July Badoglio was received by Umberto, who let him understand that the Crown was no longer opposed to a change in government. On the following day Ambrosio proposed to the King to appoint Badoglio or Caviglia to head any government that replaced Mussolini. In favor of Caviglia's candidacy were his courage, personal honesty and his antifascist stance, but he was considered too old for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task and, moreover, was a high-ranking freemason. Badoglio, who had resigned as Chief of the General Staff after the Greece debacle in 1941, had become a bitter enemy of Mussolini and had been waiting for an occasion to exact revenge. Moreover, he was personal friend of Duke d'Acquarone, who had been his aide-de-camp, and both – like Caviglia – were freemasons. A collaboration between the two Marshals was unthinkable, since Caviglia hated Badoglio, defining him once as [...] "a barn dog that goes where there is the biggest morsel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis (Christopher Masterson): Hal and Lois' first son. At the {{beginning}} of the series, he is attending military school in Alabama, run by the strict Commandant Spangler (Daniel von Bargen). It is shown that his parents enjoyed a promising middle-class, comfortable lifestyle before he was born and that he was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult,</b> destructive child that that dream soon ended. He has himself legally emancipated at the start of Season 3, leaves the school, and travels to Alaska. He finds work at a logging camp and later meets and marries Piama (Emy Coligado), a girl of Inuit heritage. When the camp closes, they move to the western United States and take jobs at a Wild West-themed hotel/ranch, run by kindly but eccentric German, Otto Mannkusser (Kenneth Mars), and his wife, Gretchen (Meagen Fay). Francis and his mother have a mutual love-hate war of wills and his main motivation in life is to thwart or irk her (though, ironically, he marries a woman with the same personality as Lois.) Although a juvenile delinquent, he is street-smart. Francis becomes a less frequently seen character after season 5, becoming an occasional recurring character and making only a small handful of appearances in Season 6 and the final Season 7. Whereas he was featured regularly in previous seasons as a side-story to the main family, Francis' steady job disappeared in season 6 due to legal issues, and he returned to being a delinquent, leading a questionable and poor lifestyle with his wife, Piama, until it is revealed in the final episode of season 7, [...] "Graduation", that Francis already has a steady desk job sorting out computers. He admits he likes his job to Hal, but also enjoys frustrating Lois by telling her that he's unemployed. Also in the series finale, Francis and Piama are expecting their first child.|$|E
