In addition, at times English nouns can or indeed must be used without an article; {{this is called the}} zero article. Some of the differences between definite, indefinite and zero article are fairly easy to learn, but others are not, particularly since a learner's native language may lack articles, have only one form, or use them differently from English. Although the information conveyed by articles is rarely essential for communication, English uses them frequently (several times in the average sentence) so that they require <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> the learner.|$|E
5000|$|The {{changes from}} the [...] "political spring" [...] (or [...] "evolution in continuity," [...] as Caetano called it) didn't go nearly far enough for large {{elements}} of the population who were eager for more freedom and had no memory of the instability that preceded Salazar. However, even these meager reforms had to be extracted with <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> the more hardline members of the government, Tomás above all. At his core, Caetano was still an authoritarian himself, and didn't understand democracy. He was very disappointed to realise the opposition was not content with what reforms {{he was able to}} wring out of the hardliners. Indeed, the elections of 1969 and 1973, as in past elections, were characterized by harsh repression of opposition elements. After the 1973 poll, various hardliners in the regime used their closeness to Tomás to pressure Caetano into abandoning his reform experiment. Caetano {{had little choice but to}} accept this, having expended nearly all of his political capital to enact his reforms in the first place.|$|E
50|$|Ring Outs {{occur when}} one of the fighters is {{forcibly}} removed from the games arena (or ring), instantly ending the round and resulting in a round point for their opponent. The idea of Ring Outs in 3D fighting games was originally conceived by the Virtua Fighter series of fighting games and adopted by Namco for Soul Edge. A combatant cannot be knocked out of the ring without being eliminated by <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> themselves or by their opponent. Later games introduced new ring designs that modified the way Ring Outs were handled (Soulcalibur allowed rings to take different shapes instead of a basic square, Soulcalibur II introduced stages with walls that blocked off parts of the ring and made Ring Outs possible only in certain parts of the stage or removing that condition altogether, and Soulcalibur III introduced low walls that can be destroyed to create a Ring Out opportunity). Soulcalibur V introduced a new aspect of Ring Outs; if a Ring Out is declared on certain stages, the battle will continue in a new location that is below the point where the Ring Out occurred. V also includes infinite stages (the stages have no edges of any kind, allowing the battle to continue in any direction with no limit) {{for the first time in}} the history of the series.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{perceptions}} {{of art and design}} students and faculty of the instructional value of iPads. More specifically, this paper draws from the main conclusions of two previous studies to compare the views of the two stakeholders, using as a framework of comparison the Rieber and Welliver (1995) five-step hierarchical model of technology adoption. Briefly, in the two previous studies both students and faculty were given the freedom to use iPads for teaching and learning, but without a specific task to guide their use. This bottom-up approach was deliberate, and together with the characteristics of art and design education and in particular the dominant modes of teaching and learning, provide the delimitations of the earlier studies. When comparing – in this paper – the outcomes of the previous two studies we noted that the adoption pattern was restricted mostly to the first two stages of the Rieber and Welliver (1995) model, familiarisation and utilization, with <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> faculty to integrate iPads in curricula. We argue that integration, reorientation and evolution – the latter stages of the model - require change that can only be achieved if all stakeholders share in the process...|$|E

Our goal is to test the development framework and design flow that we already developed on a real industrial example.

40|$|Suppliers {{are known}} to provide {{technical}} knowledge to buying firms’ product development. Involving an external company in the innovation process {{is one way to}} integrate new technology into the firm’s products. However, before a supplier can be integrated the firm must first find the most suitable supplier and then manage to collaborate within the project. Evaluating potential suppliers before deciding with which supplier to collaborate can require <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> the buying firm. Selecting a supplier {{is a part of the}} precontractual problem while once a supplier has been found and contracted, the relationship between the firms face postcontractual problems. In total, six projects were studied and 44 interviews were conducted. Individuals that worked on the projects or were involved in the decisions of the project were interviewed, such as project manager, technical experts, engineers, purchasers and sales managers. The data was structured and organised according to the two phases described in this paper; precontractual and postcontractual phase. Difficulties with selecting a supplier and verifying that the supplier have the knowledge that they claim is investigated. The paper also discusses knowledge asymmetries that are present in the development projects and how firms tackle these asymmetries...|$|E
40|$|The changed role of IT {{continuously}} influences organisational development, {{the individual}} and {{his role in the}} organization, different kinds of structures, management processes and strategies. One of the big concerns for IT firms is the need for IT consultants with enough experience to effectively and rapidly understand the business procedures of the firm in or-der to become a resource. In the classic IT-consultant role {{in the early days of}} IT, quite dif-ferent features were expected from them in their work procedures. The structure of how and which tasks they were expected to handle has undergone an indisputable transforma-tion. Today’s IT consultants are expected to know how to think in business strategic man-ners as well as the IT strategic manners. The need to formulate this role explicitly has thus emerged. So far it has been a case of implicit non-formulated way of handling this role. We present the implications of these regards, namely the Emerging Strategic Consultant (ESC). The purpose of the thesis is to gain knowledge about obstacles and difficulties in the proc-ess of introducing the IT-consultants to their expected role as a Strategic consultant. We also intend to give recommendations for improvements based on the study when we find apparent correlations. In order to fulfil this purpose and to present a reliable and valid report a qualitative analysis method was used. We wanted to get a deeper understanding of the chosen subject matter, therefore, we conducted interviews and questionnaires in the studied company, Systeam. After having analyzed and compared the empirical findings with the theoretical framework we can point out that there are some problems concerning the new strategic role of the consultants and the potential difficulties relating to these. On the whole we can state that management at Systeam have made a really effective job when hiring the right consultants to fit into their company strategy, however with a great deal of intricacy. The empirical study revealed that finding these consultants is not an easy task and takes <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> many people. However, along with the positive aspects we have found some problems re-garding the replacing and introduction of the consultants into their strategic role. Among the main problems can be named lack of adequate documentation in projects, different personal expectations and non-existence of any documented explicit strategy about how a consultant should work in order to achieve strategic alignment of Business and IT. Draw-ing from this we have gathered some recommendations for the company to consider, which will be presented in the study...|$|E

Within a Physician-dominated health care system, nurses always been under violence and they need <b>some</b> <b>efforts</b> to escape <b>from</b> this inequality in order to reach their professional rights and organizational power. This study explored the state of nurse's dignity in the health care setting of Iran and describes the factors that influence or compromise nurses dignity and empowerment. Qualitative content analysis was used for analyzing semi structured interviews with 16 nurse and nurse managers. Three main categories related to factors influencing nurse's dignity were explored: personal factors, management and organizational structure, and social attitudes and historical legacy. The finding revealed that the nurses live between respect to violence and experience multidimensional problems. Also recognition and focusing on the factors will help managers to preserve nurse's dignity and have empowered nurses. ...|$|R

In {{the face of this}} certainty, this paper argues for a change in focus for fisheries economics from bioeconomic optimization toward goals which are more modest and more easily achievable. In particular, a satisficing approach to management is advocated, whereby efforts are made to reallocate <b>some</b> porportion of <b>effort</b> <b>from</b> overutilized to underutilized fisheries, with no attempt to determine the optimum. In order to achieve such a solution efficiently, managers must accurately predict the response of fishermen to public policy. This paper reports on a study which develops a discrete choice model to predict fishermen's supply response. Fishermen are shown to respond to economic incentives of expected returns and variability of returns, but only after these incentives surpass a substantial threshold.

40|$|In [1], W. Burnside proves what {{is indeed}} {{commonly}} known as Burnside’s Theorem (except when that term is reserved to another of his results, most often the solvability of groups of order p a q b, where p, q are primes) : Theorem 1 (Burnside, 1905). Let k be an algebraically closed field, let G be a subgroup of GLn(k) for some n � 1, and let k[G] be the linear subspace of End(k n) spanned by the elements of G. Then G is irreducible, i. e., there is no linear subspace W ⊂ k n, 0 = W, W = k n, such that G leaves W invariant, if and only if, k[G] = End(k n). In this note, we first simply (try to) interpret Burnside’s original proof in modern terminology and notation. This is instructive for anyone interested {{in the evolution of}} mathematical writing, as Burnside’s language is – at least for the author – essentially unreadable as a rigorous mathematical proof.
