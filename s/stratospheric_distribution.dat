The concept of residual mean meridional circulation (Andrews and McIntyre, 1976; Boyd, 1976) {{is used in the}} model and shown to be a modified Eulerian mean, a good approximation to the Lagrangian mean motion. A simple example in which the equilibrium distribution is computed for a tracer with a uniform tropospheric source and a stratospheric sink proportional to the local mixing ratio demonstrates the potential of the proposed parameterization.

However, we have to point out that we are not using tracer-tracer correlations in the classical sense. Here, we use a method which was put forward by Proffitt et al. (2003).

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{one-dimensional}} (1 -D) analysis the decay time of the lowest eigenmode, τ 1, for the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>distribution</b> of a conserved tracer is derived from measured vertical profiles of the mean age of stratospheric air. Two case studies (a and b) give τ 1,a = 3. 8 ± 0. 8 years and τ 1,b = 5. 3 ± 1. 1 years. These semiobservational times are considerably longer than most of the τ 1  derived from 2 -D and 3 -D models. At the same time they are shorter than the observational eigentime, τ 1,HTO = 7. 7 ± 2 years, determined from the decay of the tritium (T) content in stratospheric water vapor, following the thermonuclear test explosions in the early 1960 s. Part of the differences among the observational eigentimes {{can be explained by the}} assumptions that had to be made to extract τ 1,HTO from the trend in the T content of stratospheric water vapor (namely, the cosmogenic background of tritiated water vapor and the trend in stratospheric water vapor). This leads to a revised value τ 1,HTO = 6. 3 ± 0. 9 years for the time period 1975 – 1983.

The COClF molecule {{is a temporary}} reservoir of both chlorine and fluorine {{and has not been}} measured previously by remote sensing. A maximum COClF mixing ratio of 99. 7 +/- 48. 0 pptv (10 (- 12) per unit volume, 1 sigma) is measured at 28 km for tropical and subtropical occultations (latitudes below 20 degrees in both hemispheres) with lower mixing ratios at both higher and lower altitudes. Northern hemisphere mid-latitude mixing ratios (30 - 50 degrees N) resulted in an average profile with a peak mixing ratio of 51. 7 +/- 132. 1 pptv, 1 sigma, at 27 km, also decreasing above and below that altitude. We compare the measured average profiles with the one reported set of in situ lower stratospheric mid-latitude measurements from 1986 and 1987, a previous two-dimensional (2 -D) model calculation for 1987 and 1993, and a 2 -D-model prediction for 2004. The measured average tropical profile is in close agreement with the model prediction; the northern mid-latitude profile is also consistent, although the peak in the measured profile occurs at a higher altitude (2. 5 - 4. 5 km offset) than in the model prediction.

40|$|Assimilated ozone is {{produced}} at the NASA/Goddard Data Assimilation Office by blending ozone retrieved from the Solar Backscatter UltraViolet/ 2 (SBUV/ 2) instrument and the Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (EP TOMS) measurements into an off-line transport model. The current system tends to overestimate {{the amount of}} lower stratospheric ozone. This is a region where ozone {{plays a key role}} in the forcing of climate. A biased ozone field in this region will adversely impact calculations of the stratosphere-troposphere exchange and, when used as a first guess in retrievals, the values determined from satellite observations. Since these are all important applications of assimilated ozone products, effort is being directed towards reducing this bias. The SBUV ozone data have a coarse vertical resolution with increased uncertainty below the ozone maximum, and TOMS provides only total ozone columns. Thus, the assimilated ozone in the lower stratosphere, and its vertical distribution in particular, are only weakly constrained by the incoming SBUV and TOMS data. Consequently, the assimilated ozone distribution should be sensitive to changes in inputs to the statistical analysis scheme. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the assimilated lower stratospheric ozone fields to changes in the TOMS error-covariance modeling and the SBUV data selection has been investigated. The use of a spatially correlated TOMS error covariance model led to improvements in the product. However, withholding the SBUV/ 2 data for the layer between 63 and 126 hPa typically degraded the product, a result which vindicates the use of this layer ozone product, despite its known errors. These efforts to improve the lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>distribution</b> will be extended to include a more advanced forecast error covariance model, and by assimilating ozone products from new instruments on Envisat and EOS Aura...|$|E

Stratospheric loss rates were calculated using an ultraviolet radiative transfer code with updated cross section and solar irradiance data. Mean steady state lifetimes based on these observations are 50. 3 ± 16. 8 yr for CFC- 11 and 106. 9 ± 21. 7 yr for CFC- 12, which are in reasonable agreement with the most recent WMO Ozone Assessment recommendations but are somewhat longer by 12 % and 7 %, respectively. There are two major sources of error in calculating lifetimes using this method. One error source is due to uncertainties in tropical stratospheric measurements, particularly for CFC- 11.

40|$|A new linear {{parameterisation}} for stratospheric methane (CoMeCAT) {{has been}} developed and tested. The scheme is derived from a 3 -D full chemistry transport model (CTM) and tested within the same chemistry model itself, {{as well as in}} an independent general circulation model (GCM). The new CH 4 /H 2 O scheme is suitable for any global model and here is shown to provide realistic profiles in the 3 -D TOMCAT/SLIMCAT CTM and in the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) GCM. Simulation results from the new stratospheric scheme are in good agreement with the full-chemistry CTM CH 4 field and with observations from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE). The CH 4 scheme has also been used to derive a source for stratospheric water. Stratospheric water increments obtained in this way within the CTM produce vertical and latitudinal H 2 O variation in fair agreement with satellite observations. Stratospheric H 2 O distributions in the ECMWF GCM present realistic overall features although concentrations are lower than in the CTM run (up to 0. 5 ppmv lower above 10 hPa). The potential of the new CoMeCAT scheme for evaluating long-term transport within the ECMWF model is exploited to assess the impacts of nudging the free running GCM to ERA- 40 and ERA-Interim reanalyses. In this case, the nudged GCM shows similar transport patterns to the CTM forced by the corresponding reanalysis data, ERA-Interim producing better results than ERA- 40. The impact that the new methane description has in the GCM radiation scheme is also explored. Compared to the default CH 4 climatology used by the ECMWF model, CoMeCAT produces up to 2 K cooling in the tropical lower stratosphere. The effect of using the CoMeCAT scheme for radiative forcing (RF) calculations has been investigated using the off-line Edwards-Slingo (E-S) radiative transfer model. Compared to the use of a tropospheric global 3 -D CH 4 value, the CoMeCAT distributions produce an overall decrease in the annual mean net RF, with the largest decrease found over the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes.

Two different chemistry models are used to derive photolysis cross sections for the analogues of N 2 O: (1) the zero-point energy shift model, scaled {{by a factor of}} 2 to give better agreement with recent laboratory measurements and (2) the time-dependent Hermite propagator model. Overall, the CTM predicts stratospheric enrichments that are in good agreement with most measurements, with the latter model performing slightly better. Combining the CTM-calculated stratospheric losses for each N 2 O species with current estimates of tropospheric N 2 O sources defines a budget of flux-weighted enrichment factors for each. These N 2 O budgets are not in balance, and trends of − 0. 04 to − 0. 06 ‰/yr for the mean of  14 N 15 N 16 O and  15 N 14 N 16 O and − 0. 01 to − 0. 02 ‰/yr for  14 N 14 N 18 O are predicted, although each has large uncertainties associated with the sources.

This radiance data set is used to check the validity of model used for inversion by checking consistency of the optical thickness deduced from each channel as well as optical thickness deduced from different scattering angles. Using the optical thickness profile previously computed and radiative transfer code assuming Lambertian boundary condition, each pixel of channel 1 and 2 are corrected prior to computation of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Comparison between corrected, non corrected, and years prior to Pinatubo eruption (1989 to 1990) NDVI composite, shows the necessity and the accuracy of the operational correction scheme...|$|R
40|$|A {{diagnostic}} study of Eliassen-Palm flux divergence and isentropic mixing coefficient (Kyy) {{in the stratosphere}} is performed for different seasons and for both hemispheres, based on the nongeostrophic theory of zonally averaged circulation of Tung (1986). An easily implementable procedure is described which yields a Kyy field {{that is consistent with}} advective transport. It is shown that the resultant time- and space-varying structure of Kyy leads to improved simulation of <b>stratospheric</b> species whose <b>distributions</b> are affected by dynamical transport. In particular, it is shown that the simulation of nitric acid is more satisfactory than previous model calculations...|$|R
