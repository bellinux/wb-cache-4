50|$|Grazing fire is {{when the}} cone of fire does not exceed 1.8 meters (the average height of a man) above the ground. When each bullet is fired, it will leave {{the barrel of the}} weapon at the axis of bore set from the angle of sight desired to strike the target area. The {{trajectory}} of the round should be constant as well as maximum ordinate. Maximum ordinate is the highest point of the trajectory, which is usually 2/3 the distance to the target from the weapon. Depending on the caliber of the round being fired and the slope of the terrain, as well as the distance to the target, the bullet will maintain a <b>semi-flat</b> trajectory. With 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition, which is most commonly used with, for example, the M240 machine gun, the bullet will reach a distance of 600 meters traveling at 900 meters per second or 2,800 feet per second, before it begins a pronounced downward trajectory to the earth. Any distance beyond that range will be considered plunging fire due to the arc (axis of bore + angle of sight) needed to impact the target area.|$|E

50|$|Almagreira is {{situated}} in the central southern coast of the island of Santa Maria, limited on the east by the Ribeira do Gato, north-east the regional road dissecting the watersheds of the Ribeira da Praia/Farropo and Ribeira do Salto, north and north-west by the Ribeira de João, Ribeira das Covas and on the west by an escarpment between valley of Valverde and Figueiral. This parish is found within a transitional band from the higher altitude, rugged relief on the eastern coast, and the planar landscape of the western half of the island. The {{eastern half of the}} parish is a mountainous zone covered in forests extending to Pico Alto (in the north) and towards Malbusca (in the southeast), passing through Pico das Cavacas (492 metres); it is an area cut by several ravines and substantial watershed on the island. The western portion of the parish extends to its border with Vila do Porto and São Pedro, along a <b>semi-flat</b> plateau broken by a few volcanic cones, such as Pico do Bom Despacho (294 metres) and Pico do Facho (254 metres). This flat plateau area is the broken by walled parcels of agricultural land from Fonte Nova until Touril and Figuerial, and includes large pasturelands in Brejo de Baixo, in an area known as Tremoçal. Tremoçal has been considered for the location of a new Golf Complex, that includes club house, housing and support structures, covering an area of 99.5 hectares of land. Meanwhile, the southern coast fronts a large bay, surrounded by basaltic and sedimentary cliffs (such as Touril or Macela) cut by ravines that disgorge into the ocean. The alluvial drainage from these ravines have, over the centuries, formed white-sand beaches (Praia Grande and Praia Pequeno) in Praia Formosa, which are atypical in the Azores.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMultiscale signal {{analysis}} {{has been used}} since the early 1990 s as {{a powerful tool for}} image processing, notably in the linear case. However, nonlinear PDEs and associated nonlinear operators have advantages over linear operators, notably preserving important features such as edges in images. In this paper, we focus on nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs defined with adaptive speeds or, alternatively, on adaptive morphological fiters also called <b>semi-flat</b> morphological operators. <b>Semi-flat</b> morphology were instroduced by H. Heijmans and studied only in the case where the speed (or equivalently the filtering parameter) is a decreasing function of the luminance. It is proposed to extend the definition suggested by H.

We also prove that a central property for defining morphological filters, that is the adjunction property, is preserved while dealing with our extended definitions.

40|$|We {{study the}} real Monge-Ampère {{equation}} {{in two and}} three dimensions, both {{from the point of}} view of the SYZ conjecture, where solutions give rise to <b>semi-flat</b> Calabi-Yau's and in affine differential geometry, where solutions yield parabolic affine sphere hypersurfaces. We find explicit examples, connect the holomorphic function representation to Hitchin's description of special Lagrangian moduli space, and construct the developing map explicitly for a singularity corresponding to the type I_n elliptic fiber (after hyper-Kähler rotation). Following Baues and Cortés, we show that various types of metric cones over two-dimensional elliptic affine spheres generate solutions of the Monge-Ampère equation in three dimensions. We then prove a local and global existence theorem for an elliptic affine two-sphere metric with prescribed singularities. The metric cone over the two-sphere minus three points yields a parabolic affine sphere with singularities along a "Y"-shaped locus. This gives a <b>semi-flat</b> Calabi-Yau metric in a neighborhood of the "Y" vertex. In the erratum, we correct a gap in the solution of the elliptic affine sphere equation (with the small caveat that a parameter in the equation, the cubic differential, must be smaller than we assumed before).

40|$|In arid and {{semiarid}} {{regions where}} {{water is the}} main limiting factor, water redistribution is regarded as an important hydrological process of great ecological value. By providing additional water to certain loci, moist pockets of great productivity are formed, characterized by high plant biomass and biological activity. These moist pockets are often a result of runon. Yet, although runoff may take place on <b>semi-flat</b> undulating surfaces, runoff measurements are thus far confined to slopes, where a sufficient gradient facilitates downslope water harvesting. On undulating surfaces of mounds and depressions, such as in interdunes, no quantification {{of the amount of}} water reaching depressions is feasible {{due to the fact that}} no reliable method for measuring the runoff amounts in <b>semi-flat</b> terrains is available. The current paper describes specific runoff plots, designed to measure runoff in depressions (sinks). These plots, termed sink plots (SPs), were operative in the Hallamish dunefield (Negev Desert, Israel). The paper presents measurements of runoff yield that were carried out between January 2013 and January 2014 on SPs and compared them to runoff obtained from crusted slope plots and fine-grained (playa) surfaces.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we develop a {{relative}} version of T-duality in generalized complex geometry which we propose as {{a manifestation of}} mirror symmetry. Let M be an n−dimensional smooth real manifold, V a rank n real vector bundle on M, and ∇ a flat connection on V. We define the notion of a ∇−semi-flat generalized complex structure on the total space of V. We show that there is an explicit bijective correspondence between ∇−semi-flat generalized complex structures on the total space of V and ∇ ∨ −semi-flat generalized complex structures on the total space of V ∨. Similarly we define <b>semi-flat</b> generalized complex structures on real n−torus bundles with section over an n-dimensional base and establish a bijective correspondence between <b>semi-flat</b> generalized complex structures on pairs of dual torus bundles. Along the way, we give methods of constructing generalized complex structures on the total spaces of vector bundles and torus bundles with sections. We also show that <b>semi-flat</b> generalized complex structures give rise to a pair of transverse Dirac structures on the base manifold. We give interpretations of these results in terms of relationships between the cohomology of torus bundles and their duals. We also study the ways in which our results generalize some well established aspects of mirror symmetry as well as some recent proposals relating generalized complex geometry to string theory...|$|E
