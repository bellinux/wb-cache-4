This topic is recent, that is why, this review may often be updated. Using I. F.

In this section, the two main approaches, already defined for moving picture fractal coding using I. F. S., are introduced. Available commercial and public softwares are presented in section IV. In section V, readers can find several summaries of relevant papers. In section VI, open questions, put forth by the previously described methods, are introduced.

40|$|This study compares recruitment, job training, wage structure, {{and labor}} {{mobility}} of Japanese plants {{operating in the}} U. S. (JPUS plants) with local American owned plants. In the Japanese labor market, the job separation rate is remarkably lower and the wage-tenure profile is steeper than in the United States (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>II).</b> This observation has been interpreted mainly through two theories: the view which stresses the cultural and traditional value of company loyalty, and the perspective which places {{a strong emphasis on}} the role of job training.

By looking at the JPUS plants (which employ American workers), this analysis strives to separate cultural influences from the influences of technology and production systems.

40|$|The broad {{notion of}} “commercial common sense” is {{prominent}} in the modern law governing the interpretation of written contracts. For example, in Prenn v Simmonds (1971), 2 Lord Wilberforce said that a suggested interpretation could be tested by considering whether it would “correspond with commercial good sense”. Lord Steyn said in Mannai Investment Co. v Eagle Star Life Assurance (1997) : “Words are … interpreted {{in the way in}} which a reasonable commercial person would construe them. ” 3 In the “Rainy Sky” case (2011), the Supreme Court held that: “If there are two possible constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other. ” 4 Furthermore, Lord Neuberger in Arnold v Britton (2015) 5 placed “commercial common sense” within the list of relevant factors to be applied during the process of interpretation (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>II</b> for the full quotation).

40|$|This is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} two papers (I and II) on the problem of {{decoherence}} in weak localization. In paper I, we discussed how the Pauli principle could be incorporated into an influence functional approach for calculating the Cooperon propagator and the magnetoconductivity. In the present paper II, we check and confirm the results so obtained by diagrammatically setting up a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the Cooperon, which includes self-energy and vertex terms on an equal footing and is free from both infrared and ultraviolet divergencies. We then approximately solve this Bethe-Salpeter equation by the Ansatz C(t) = C^ 0 (t) e^{-F(t) }, where the decay function F(t) determines the decoherence rate. We show that in order to obtain a divergence-free expression for the decay function F(t), it is sufficient to calculate C^ 1 (t), the Cooperon in the position-time representation to first order in the interaction. Paper II is independent of paper I and can be read without detailed knowledge of the latter. Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures. This {{is the second}} of a series of two papers on decoherence.

In chapter I, I review the general ideas which led in the late 70 s {{to the idea of}} electric/magnetic duality in quantum field theory. In chapters II and III, I focus mainly on N= 2 supersymmetric theories. I present the lagrangians and explain in more or less detail the non-renormalization theorems, rigid special geometry, supersymmetric instanton calculus, charge fractionization, the semiclassical theory of monopoles, duality in Maxwell theory and the famous Seiberg-Witten solution. I discuss various physical applications, as electric charge confinement, chiral symmetry breaking or non-trivial superconformal theories in four dimensions. In <b>Section</b> <b>II.</b> <b>3</b> new material is presented, related to the computation of the eta invariant of certain Dirac operators coupled minimally to non-trivial monopole field configurations. I explain how these invariants can be obtained exactly by a one-loop calculation in a suitable N= 2 supersymmetric gauge theory. This is an unexpected application of the holomorphy properties of N= 2 supersymmetry, and constitutes a tremendous simplification of the usual computation.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{stochastic}} approach {{to describe and}} remodel the conversion process of a wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. When conditioning on various wind direction sectors, {{the dynamics of the}} conversion process appear as a fluctuating trajectory around an average IEC-like power curve, <b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>II.</b> Our approach is to consider the wind farm as a dynamical system that can be described as a stochastic drift/diffusion model, where a drift coefficient describes the attraction towards the power curve and a diffusion coefficient quantifies additional turbulent fluctuations. These stochastic coefficients are inserted into a Langevin equation that, once properly adapted to our particular system, models a synthetic signal of power output for any given wind speed/direction signals, <b>see</b> <b>section</b> III. When combined with a pre-model for turbulent wind fluctuations, the stochastic approach models the power output of the wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz using only ten-minute average values of wind speed and directions. The stochastic signals generated are compared to the measured signal, and show a good statistical agreement, including a proper reproduction of the intermittent, gusty features measured. In parallel, a second application for performance monitoring is introduced in section IV. The drift coefficient {{can be used as a}} sensitive measure of the global wind farm performance. When monitoring the wind farm as a whole, the drift coefficient registers some significant deviation from normal operation if one of twelve wind turbines is shut down during less than 4 % of the time. Also, intermittent anomalies can be detected more rapidly than when using ten-minute averaging methods. Finally, a probabilistic description of the conversion process is proposed and modeled in appendix A, that can in turn be used to further improve the estimation of the stochastic coefficients...|$|R

Many social {{scientists}} would argue that it matters very little, since human behavior is transmitted culturally rather than genetically. This course will entertain a different hypothesis.

Readings Most readings are available electronically, via the class web site (see above). In addition to these, you will need a copy of Matt Ridley’s Origins of Virtue, which is in the bookstore. Course Requirements Grades will be based on a midterm (35 pts), a final (41 pts), and four Exercises (6 pts each). The midterm consist of about 12 – 14 short-answer questions (answers to be 4 sentences or less) and 30 – 40 multiple-choice/fill-in questions. The final will be similar, but half again as long.
