500|$|Before {{the actors}} {{went before the}} cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied {{directly}} to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound; Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, [...] "I am acting {{the part of a}} nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." [...] Seiderman replied, [...] "You'd be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?" ...|$|E
500|$|Eddie {{returns to}} Washington as Mulder and, along with Scully, reports to Skinner {{on the case}} with a poorly written report. Eddie visits Mulder's office, then his apartment, being <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> a loser Mulder appears to be (though highly pleased with how {{attractive}} a man he now is in Mulder's face - as he admires himself and practices his 'agent moves' in the mirror). Later that evening Eddie visits Scully {{with a bottle of}} wine and tries to get her drunk, as well as seduce her. As a reluctant Scully is about to give in to a kiss, the real Mulder breaks in and interrupts them. Revealed, Eddie sheepishly reverts back to his actual form, as a shocked Scully just about jumps out of her own skin at the revelation. A month later, Mulder visits Eddie in a prison visitation room at Eddie's bidding. Eddie complains at being given muscle relaxants to prevent him from turning into someone else, asking if that was Mulder's doing. Eddie then tells Mulder that he was born a loser, but Mulder is one by choice and that he should seriously [...] "live a little".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was a rough}} journey for {{the picture}} brides. When they first arrived, they were {{required}} to go through numerous inspections at the immigration station. The United States government did not recognize picture marriages as being legal; therefore, the picture brides would meet their soon-to-be husbands {{for the first time and}} attend a mass wedding ceremony on the docks. Many of these women were <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> they found upon arrival. [...] Most of what the women knew about their husbands before meeting them was based on the photos they had sent. However, the images presented did not always represent the men's real lives. Men would send photos back to Japan and Korea that were retouched, old, or of different men completely. Men often wore borrowed suits and chose to pose with luxury items, such as cars and houses, that they did not actually own.|$|E
60|$|Ronald was {{accordingly}} led {{back to the}} cell, the bailie {{being too}} much overwhelmed with <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he had heard to utter any remonstrance.|$|R
5000|$|... 1984: Dennis and Gnasher are {{chasing a}} pair of cats through the snow (and past a Dennis-like snowman). On the back cover, one of the cats pushes the snowman's head onto Gnasher, as the other one laughs at him, and Dennis looks <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what's</b> happened. Price £2 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Treachery!" [...] she breathed, in {{an awful}} voice, {{that was no}} louder than a whisper, and again her eyes {{travelled}} round the company, and suddenly they fastened upon Fortunio, standing six paces from her to the right, pulling thoughtfully at his mustachios, and manifesting no <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> had taken place.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> the {{sun will}} do in two hours," [...] Kelley said, encouragingly. [...] "You'll peel afterward, but you'll {{get rid of the}} bleach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really! You don't {{mean to say}} so! Chug-a-rum! You don't mean to say so, Peter!" [...] {{interrupted}} Grandfather Frog, {{pretending to}} be very much <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> Peter said.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was much}} <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he saw. The {{order of the}} troops, the {{systematic}} and regular arrangement of guards and sentinels, and the regularity of the whole encampment, excited his admiration.[K] ...|$|E
60|$|Neither of us spoke when we {{were finally}} come to where {{we could have a}} fairly good view of the scene of confusion. The <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> we saw, and the perplexity because of it, was so great that we could do no more or no less than stare in bewilderment at this army, every member of which {{appeared}} to have suddenly been deprived of his reason.|$|R
60|$|The {{astonished}} Bonnet did {{not finish}} his sentence, for his power of speech left {{him when he}} saw Ben Greenway hurry up to {{the captain of the}} merchantman, who was standing unarmed, with his crew about him, and warmly shake that dumfounded skipper by the hand. In their <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> they beheld the pirates had not thrown their grapnels at the proper moment, and now the two vessels had drifted still farther apart.|$|R
6000|$|What {{made it all}} {{the easier}} to keep--I mean the resolution--was that Powell's {{sentiment}} of amused <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> struck him <b>at</b> first as mere absurdity was not unmingled with indignation. And his years were too few, his position too novel, his reliance on his own opinion not yet firm enough to allow him to express it with any effect. And then--what would have been the use, anyhow--and where was the necessity? ...|$|R
60|$|The Knight of the Glen, greatly <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he {{had heard}} the old woman tell, and knowing he wanted his finger from his childhood, began to {{understand}} that the story was true enough.|$|E
60|$|If Martin Rattler {{was amazed}} at the {{treatment}} he experienced {{at the hands of}} his new acquaintances on arriving, he had occasion to be very much more <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> occurred three hours after his incarceration.|$|E
6000|$|... "There I am {{not much}} of a judge. I never had any young ladyhood, but I own that the few times I went out with Anna I have been surprised, and more <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> I heard from her sister Emily." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "Oh, {{you poor}} boy! Here--anywhere--on the floor--on the sofa--on the table." [...] She clears several spaces and helps Watkins unload. [...] "Clarence! I'm <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> you. <b>What</b> are you {{thinking}} of?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{girl in the}} {{fruitful}} hat quickly seized {{her companion}} {{by the arm and}} whispered in his ear. That young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly. Crouching low, he slid {{over the edge of the}} car, hung lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming it prudent not to express <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city. The truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist's delivery wagon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Nan," [...] said Lee angrily, [...] "if you're {{going to}} the picnic with John Osborne I'm <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> you. <b>What</b> {{do you mean by}} {{encouraging}} him so? He's as poor as Job's turkey. I suppose you've heard that I've been compelled to foreclose the mortgage on his farm." ...|$|R
60|$|Bradley {{knew nothing}} of the {{disappearance}} of Bowen Tyler and Miss La Rue, nor of the perfidy of the Germans in shelling the fort and attempting to escape in the U-33; {{but he was in}} no way <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he saw before him.|$|E
60|$|Eagerly Pierre {{did as he}} was bid; {{but somehow}} felt disappointed, and yet <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he saw. He saw the word Isabel, quite legibly but still fadedly gilded upon a part of one side of the interior, where it made a {{projecting}} curve.|$|E
60|$|Marietta sat {{and looked}} at him. She had {{a good sense of}} humor, and, while she was {{naturally}} <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> had been said to her, she was greatly amused by it, and really wished to hear what else Thomas Rooper had to say to her.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 1990s, Moya {{suffered}} a lengthy illness, with prompted him and his wife to leave Mexico City for Cuernavaca. The move caused him to reexamine his photographic archive, which remained in good condition, along with his graphic designer wife and some photographic experts. The quality of the archive prompted Moya to organize and promote the archive, selling and exhibiting works, making his current living off of them. [...] He says he has been <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> sells, with much of the sales in the United States, to collections such as the Wittliff Collections at the Texas State University. Many of his better known photographs are republished today in books, magazines and newspapers.|$|R
60|$|To the {{momentary}} relief of the Spaniards their assailant instead of imitating their maneuvers kept straight upon her course before the wind, {{and instead of}} the wild cries of the beggars a hearty English cheer was raised. As Captain Martin had expected, the guns {{on the port side}} had not been reloaded after the last discharge, and the Good Venture was two or three hundred yards away before the Spaniards recovered from their <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> seemed the incomprehensible maneuver of their foes, and awoke {{to the fact that they}} had been tricked, and that instead of a ship crowded with beggars of the sea their supposed assailant had been an English trader that was trying to escape from them.|$|R
5|$|Kulesza {{left his}} job soon afterwards; {{according}} to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder {{some of the}} blame. Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> they saw as excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{the less}} <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> has happened," [...] replied Sir William, [...] "from that {{knowledge}} of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life {{has allowed me to}} acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What does Polly say? I {{understand}} {{him when he}} talks, but not when he scolds and chatters {{to himself as he}} is doing now," [...] said the Princess, looking much <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> she heard; for she thought her birds must be happy in such fine cages.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{hardly have}} fancied Thurston {{was an old}} friend of--yours," [...] Shackleby remarked with a {{carelessness}} which almost blunted the sneer. [...] "I'm also a little <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> you tell me, because I saw Mrs. Leslie hurrying along to the Atlantic express. She couldn't book that way to Victoria." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was no {{more the}} pale, patient face! The cheeks were rounded, the brown eyes smiled, the haggard air, that even as a bride Cecily had worn, was entirely gone, and Mervyn watched exultingly Phoebe's <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he had made of the wan, worn girl they had met at Hyeres. The only {{disappointment}} was Bertha's absence, and there was much regret that the new-comers had not heard of her cold so as to have seen her at the Underwood on their way. They had spent the previous day in town in going over the distillery, by Cecily's particular wish, and had afterwards assisted at a grand impromptu entertainment of all the workpeople, at their own expense and Robert's trouble. Mervyn did certainly seem carried {{out of his own}} knowledge of himself, and his wife had transgressed every precedent left by his mother, who had never beheld Whittingtonia in her life! ...|$|R
60|$|But if fear had no {{influence}} over our giant, the same cannot {{be said of}} his companions. Oolichuk, indeed, was almost as bold, though he exhibited {{a considerable amount of}} caution in his looks and movements; but Eemerk, and one or two of his friends, betrayed their craven spirits in frequent startled looks and changing colour. Ivitchuk was a strange compound of nervousness and courage, while Akeetolik appeared to have lost the power of expressing every feeling but one--that of blank amazement. Indeed, <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> they saw on board the steam yacht was the predominant feeling amongst these children of nature. Their eyebrows seemed to have gone up and fixed themselves {{in the middle of their}} foreheads, and their eyes and mouths to have opened wide permanently. None of the women accepted the invitation to go aboard except Tekkona, and Oblooria followed her, not because she was courageous, but because she seemed to cling to the stronger nature as a protection from undefined and mysterious dangers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that one ought to be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> anything. Perhaps <b>what</b> <b>surprised</b> me most was that he should have looked so high. There seemed to be so little to justify it. But now I will accept that as courage which I before {{regarded}} as arrogance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charles in the meantime, {{still more}} <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he beheld, called {{out on his}} part--"What! Doctor Rochecliffe become {{literally}} one of the church militant, and tilting with my friend cavalier Wildrake? May I use the freedom {{to ask him to}} withdraw, as Colonel Everard and I have some private business to settle?" ...|$|E
60|$|The general {{having left}} the room, the {{officers}} crowded round Terence. But few words were said, {{for they were}} still so <b>surprised,</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> they had heard, as to be incapable of doing more than shake him warmly by the hand, and pat him on the shoulder. Ryan came in for a share in this demonstration.|$|E
60|$|One gentleman {{did come}} to our {{assistance}} a little while ago, but his explanations only made the matter more confusing to our minds than it was before. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he called our density, and said the thing was all clear and simple to him. But we discovered afterward {{that he was an}} escaped lunatic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{method is}} to take a {{well-known}} poem [...] [...] [...] without reference to the author or to his other work, analyse it stanza by stanza and line by line, and extract, squeeze, tease, press every drop of meaning out of it that one can. It might be called the lemon-squeezer school of criticism[...] [...] [...] I imagine that some of the poets (they are all dead except myself) would be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> learning <b>what</b> their poems mean [...] [...] [...] (113) ...|$|R
5000|$|Thedude35 from Bitch Stole my Remote gave a good {{review to}} the episode stating: [...] "After a season {{that has been}} {{surprisingly}} mediocre so far, ‘The Cell’ reminds me why I {{fell in love with}} this show in the first place. There’s suspense, torture, some sexual tension and <b>surprises</b> <b>at</b> every turn. <b>What</b> more could we ask for?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{writers were}} often <b>surprised</b> not <b>at</b> <b>what</b> the censors took out, {{but what they}} left in—for example, a sketch (written and {{submitted}} as a joke) in which Baby and Papa Boolie commit suicide after listening to one too many of Fred Huggins' songs was being seriously considered by the network for use on the show. (The sketch was later rewritten to have Papa Boolie call a mental hospital to take Fred away.) The unused script of the unedited Fred Huggins sequence is role-played in an audio commentary for an episode on the DVD.|$|R
