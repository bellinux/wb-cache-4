500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} of yesterday, & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of the thing we desired. I am <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return, to afford you every facility in my power. I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled you. That in small writing is the production of my daughter in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{described}} [...] "Love Me" [...] as a song [...] "about loving {{yourself the}} way you want to be loved". Gundersen called it [...] "irresistibly catchy and energetic". The song was produced by Bloodshy. Sarkesian called it [...] "an interesting mix – the lyrics are dark, but the music is very dance-centric. At the very least, it'll do well in clubs". Montgomery stated that [...] "Love Me" [...] and [...] "International Smile" [...] both [...] "seem destined for the dance floors". The latter was inspired by Perry's friend Mia Moretti, and was compared to the songs on Perry's previous album. Lipshutz called it a [...] "straightforward pop-rock offering" [...] and described its guitar hook as [...] "kicky", adding that the song also includes a [...] "Melting Daft Punk-esque vocoder breakdown". Halperin stated that in the song, Perry sings the [...] "hooky" [...] line: [...] "Please fasten your seat belts and make <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> champagne glasses are empty".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2006, {{speaking}} to GameSpot, De Martini {{said of the}} delay, [...] "When {{you are dealing with}} a property like The Godfather, you have to take special care in making <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> work meets the level fans have come to expect from the franchise. With this fiction in our game, we had to hit a home run. I am tremendously thankful that EA gave our team the time we needed to get it right. I think it turned a good game into a great one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Savage {{was living}} in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a manager at a local video store that {{specialized}} in independent film titles. He befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of The Onion, who {{announced that he was}} moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled The Stranger. Savage [...] "made the offhand comment that forever altered [...] life: 'Make <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> paper has an advice column—everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'." [...] Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gilliam, {{there was}} no firm budget in place when filming started. Cinematographer Gilliam {{felt that it was}} not a well-organized film and said, [...] "Certain people didn't... I'm not going to name names but it was a strange film, like one leg was shorter than the other. There was all sorts of chaos." [...] While Depp was on {{location}} in Los Angeles, he got a phone call from comedian Bill Murray who had played Thompson in Where the Buffalo Roam. He warned Depp, [...] "Be careful or you'll find yourself ten years from now still doing him… Make <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> next role is some drastically different guy." ...|$|E

Whatever happens I never can forget, my dearest Fitz, that you are the friend in the world whom I most esteem, for whom I would sacrifice every thing that one man ought to sacrifice to another. I know that the properest conduct in such a situation would be to say nothing, nor to inquire any thing from any of my old friends, and so I shall do in regard to all others, but I feel you to be an exception with respect to me to all general rules, I am <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> friendship has been so. God bless you, my dear Fitz.|$|E
2500|$|Following the draft, Quinn {{was criticized}} by fellow Notre Dame quarterback Joe Theismann {{in a radio}} interview, {{claiming}} that Quinn looked [...] "unprofessional" [...] {{when he was on}} stage following his name being called. Theismann was bothered by the appearance of Quinn's hair {{and the fact that he}} was chewing gum. Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, when you finally get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> shirt and everything looked good. I was just trying to get on stage as fast as possible and get that Browns jersey in my hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Susan Owen's {{letter to}} Rabindranath Tagore marked, Shrewsbury, 1 August 1920, reads: [...] "I {{have been trying}} to find courage to write to you ever since I heard that you were in London ~ but the desire to tell you {{something}} is finding its way into this letter today. The letter may never reach you, for I {{do not know how to}} address it, tho’ I feel <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> name upon the envelope will be sufficient. It is nearly two years ago, that my dear eldest son went out to the War for the last time and the day he said goodbye to me ~ we were looking together across the sun-glorified sea ~ looking towards France, with breaking hearts ~ when he, my poet son, said those wonderful words of yours ~ beginning at ‘When I go from hence, let this be my parting word’ ~ and when his pocket book came back to me ~ I found these words written in his dear writing ~ with your name beneath." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{their trip}} to Miami, Sloan and Thompson began {{assembling}} their ideas. They organized a powerpoint project, titled, The Miami Project, {{and began a}} series of presentations in their local offices at the Poynter Institute. Their colleagues were interested yet unenthusiastic about the project. In the spring of 2004, while preparing for an annual Online Leaders seminar at the Institute, they were asked to present it again. This time, they decided to present the story {{from the perspective of the}} future, as if it had already happened. They assembled the first version of the film late one night in Poynter's visual journalism lab, on an iMac G4 running Final Cut Pro. The narrative was met with enthusiasm by the conference participants, and they soon began revising and polishing their presentation, this time using Macromedia Flash. They kept presenting it, introducing the film dramatically – gliding into rooms wearing tin foil hats. They always followed the movie with the question: [...] "If this is what the year 2014 looks like, what are you going to do today to make <b>sure</b> <b>your</b> news organization doesn't get sidelined? How do you make sure you can play in this environment?" ...|$|E
