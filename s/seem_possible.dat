5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the bailout is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout, with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if the bailout fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not <b>seem</b> <b>possible</b> during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E

25|$|Steyn {{grew up in}} {{the small}} town of Phalaborwa on the border of the world-famous {{wildlife}} haven, the Kruger National Park. Active and energetic, Steyn was naturally drawn to sports. His love of being outdoors led him also to more solitary activities such as bass fishing and skateboarding. Steyn began playing cricket when he was around 11 years old and he received a Hansie Cronje cricket set as a Christmas gift. Family games on the lawn soon led to a place in the school cricket team. During his high school years at Merensky High School in the town of Tzaneen, Steyn had exceptional pace and a raw talent, but a career in cricket didn’t <b>seem</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to the Constitution of Denmark, Denmark {{is governed}} {{according}} {{to the principle of}} negative parliamentarism, meaning that while a government doesn't need the majority of seats in parliament, it must never have a majority of seats against it in a vote of no confidence. Before the ongoing elections, this was relevant since the government, consisting of the Conservative People's Party and the Liberals did not have a majority of seats, but depended on the support of the Danish People's Party. Early opinion polls showed that neither a right-wing or a left-wing government could gather enough seats to be in government without the support of the newly established New Alliance. This caused a lot of interest, since New Alliance had stated that they would first give the government the opportunity to propose a programme for government, but that they would not definitely support a right-wing government prior to seeing how many of their political agendas they could work together on. Many people were unsure how this would be possible, since New Alliance was originally formed to limit the influence of the Danish People's Party, without whom a right-wing government did not <b>seem</b> <b>possible</b> in opinion polls. After the elections, however, it was clear that New Alliance did not get enough seats in parliament to break the previous right-wing majority.|$|E
500|$|Congressional {{hearings}} on appropriations emphasized that all schools—regardless of location or size—should {{be allowed to}} participate in the cadet nurse program. However, when the educational consultants Division of Nurse Education tested the standards against actual conditions, they did not <b>seem</b> <b>possible</b> for some schools to achieve. Adjustments were made for certain schools, setting lower standards for them. They would be judged by criteria included the qualifications and number of instructional personnel, their clinical facilities, the curricula, the weekly schedule of hours, and the health and guidance programs. [...] Borderline schools produced {{a small percentage of the}} total cadet force.|$|E

500|$|In 415 BC, {{delegates from}} the Sicilian city of Segesta (...) arrived at Athens to plead {{for the support}} of the Athenians in their war against Selinus. During the debates on the undertaking, Nicias was vehemently opposed to Athenian intervention, {{explaining}} that the campaign would be very costly and attacking the character and motives of Alcibiades, who had emerged as a major supporter of the expedition. On the other hand, Alcibiades argued that a campaign in this new theatre would bring riches to the city and expand the empire, just as the Persian Wars had. In his speech Alcibiades predicted (over-optimistically, in the opinion of most historians) that the Athenians would be able to recruit allies in the region and impose their rule on Syracuse, the most powerful city of Sicily. In spite of Alcibiades's enthusiastic advocacy for the plan, it was Nicias, not he, who turned a modest undertaking into a massive campaign and made the conquest of Sicily <b>seem</b> <b>possible</b> and safe. It was at his suggestion that the size of the fleet was significantly increased from 60 ships to [...] "140 galleys, 5,100 men at arms, and about 1300 archers, slingers, and light armed men". Philosopher Leo Strauss underscores that the Sicilian expedition surpassed everything undertaken by Pericles. Almost certainly Nicias's intention was to shock the assembly with his high estimate of the forces required, but, instead of dissuading his fellow citizens, his analysis made them all the more eager. [...] Against his wishes Nicias was appointed General along with Alcibiades and Lamachus, all three of whom were given full powers to do whatever was {{in the best interests of}} Athens while in Sicily.|$|E
