5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult fare is charged for {{passengers}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers between ages 6 & 18, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. Up to two children under 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full or reduced fare for themselves. Fares also change based on <b>service</b> <b>level,</b> with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County. The last fare increase occurred on July 1, 2015, raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents.|$|E

The first one gives an overview of concepts such as Electronic commerce, Brokerage, Multimedia applications and Quality of service, including the definition of <b>Service</b> <b>levels</b> for different Electronic brokerage applications. The second part {{presents the}} specification of all the facilities supported by the different <b>Service</b> <b>levels</b> defined in the first part. The third part presents the MULTIMEDIATOR system, {{as a case study}} of Electronic brokerage application, in which the different <b>Service</b> <b>levels</b> are identified. The main conclusions are that four different <b>Service</b> <b>levels</b> reflecting different levels of user requirements can be defined: for Searching brokerage, Products brokerage, Services brokerage and Complex brokerage. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a general}} on-line service environment, a service {{provider}} (SP) offers {{a set of}} <b>service</b> <b>levels</b> to customers at various prices. Higher priced <b>service</b> <b>levels</b> typically include a guarantee for faster response/completion times. The problem that an SP faces is pricing different <b>service</b> <b>levels.</b> Such a price schedule greatly impacts the rate of incoming requests, the mix of their <b>service</b> <b>levels,</b> and consequently the revenue of the SP. In this work we propose a data driven method for estimating the rate and the mix for any given price schedule. The data exclusively consist of the observed rate of request submissions and the actual choices that customers have made when presented with previously used price schedule(s). Given this characterization, the SP is able to provision resources and optimize scheduling for a given price schedule and ultimately choose the price schedule that optimizes the revenue. The problem is motivated by network service and utility computing environment applications...|$|R
