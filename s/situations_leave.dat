They {{play out in}} the interval, in the blank space that occurs between two words (Black (Mette Edvardsen, 2011)), between a {{performance}} and a score (Opening (Mette Edvardsen, 2005)), between a book and a listener (Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine (Mette Edvardsen, 2010)), between a live and a recorded action (Time will show (Mette Edvardsen, 2004)), coffee & cigarette (2006 and 2008)). In her work, she uses repetition as a strategy, {{as a way of}} making things visible, of activating them. She is more interested {{in the interest of the}} audience in things than in the things themselves. She is also interested in how <b>situations</b> <b>leave</b> traces in memory, and how memory becomes an active part of reading something. Her work is both profound and witty, sober and rich in detail. By using a playful approach to thoughts and references Mette Edvardsen examines how language can be used to form pictures in the heads of the audience.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the process of}} complaint redressal {{from the perspectives of}} consumers through their lived experiences. It also attempts to highlight the peculiarities in behaviour exhibited by Malaysian consumers when their complaints/grievances have been sorted out. Based on phenomenological interviews conducted with the consumers, the complaint redressal process is discussed {{on the basis of their}} experiences in situations involving dissatisfaction arising from the usage of a product or service. The findings reveal that consumers in certain <b>situations</b> <b>leave</b> no stone unturned in gaining the support from different sources when they face a problem related to a product or service. They may also make use of different consumer associations/forums for having their problems voiced and tackled through. However, as soon as their issue is sorted out by the concerned product/service provider, they may just disappear without taking the pain to inform back the consumer associations which made all possible efforts to take forward the complaints with the concerned organization. In such situations, the consumer associations might have to face several difficulties and challenges which might further hamper their abilities, strengths and motivation to offer support to the aggrieved consumers in future...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} characteristics of impressive scenes for nursing students during clinical training. We asked 70 nursing {{students to write}} a reflective journal (RJ) on the most impressive scenes during nursing practice. The obtained data were qualitatively analyzed using the Qualitative Synthesis Method (KJ method). As most impressive scenes during clinical practice, [difficulty in dealing with needs of patients : embarrassment of unexpected true needs of patients], [difficulty in dealing with patients who does not get communication : embarrassment of difficulty in dealing with patients who ask questions repeatedly and uncooperative patients], [experience that put burdens on patients : burden in patients that was caused by insufficient understanding of patient's health status], [experience that care was refused by patient's : patient's unexpected negative response to thoughtful care],,[confusion and participation {{in the treatment of}} patients : pleasure that was able to participate in care by the advice of nurse], and [acceptance by the patients : a good response to the care and acceptance by the patients] were extracted from RJs of 36 nursing students (valid responses: 35). The nursing students encounter various unexpected events during the training that they have never experienced before. The results showed that such unseen <b>situations</b> <b>leave</b> a deep impression on students, and contribute to new learning...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} food in Indian tribal {{societies}} merits more attention than it has received. The example given here concerns the Gadaba of Highland Orissa (India), and particularly two contexts are compared: sacrifice and hospitality. Sacrificial commensality during annual festivals stresses agnatic relationships, unchanging hierarchical group relations, and strictly prescribes social action. Hospitality, by contrast, mainly involves affinal relations and highlights equivalence while also expressing temporary status difference. The hospitality <b>situation</b> <b>leaves</b> room for idiosyncratic behaviour and rivalry that are expressed in competitive feasting and force feeding. Hospitality also entails the notion of "shame" that is absent in sacrificial contexts...|$|R

50|$|Recently, a {{movement}} supporting an additional prenuptial agreement {{has emerged in}} some Modern Orthodox circles.

The first relates to the direct financial exposure between European creditor countries and CEECs {{and the risk of}} sudden withdrawal of capital. The second, which is indirect, is associated with the risk of regional contagion via spill-over effects and the common creditor channel. Based on a synthetic measure of these risks, we show that the degree of vulnerability of each country to the recent financial crisis could have been anticipated...|$|R

And that she indeed lives in Sweden, but is not born into “Swedishness” [5].

It’s between the Hungarian and the Swedish that a balance must be found. The Roma enters constantly in the background.

Aim of the paper is to propose some alternative combination strategies and compare their performances in forecasting high dimensional multivariate conditional covariance matrices for a portfolio of US stock returns. In particular, we will consider the combination of volatility predictions generated by multivariate GARCH models, based on daily returns, and dynamic models for realized covariance matrices, built from intra-daily returns...|$|R
