60|$|It {{will not}} need, when {{the mind is}} {{prepared}} for study, to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>objects.</b> The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. What is a day? What is a year? What is summer? What is woman? What is a child? What is sleep? To our blindness, these things seem unaffecting. We make fables to hide the baldness of the fact and conform it, as we say, to the higher law of the mind. But when the fact is seen under the light of an idea, the gaudy fable fades and shrivels. We behold the real higher law. To the wise, therefore, a fact is true poetry, and the most beautiful of fables. These wonders are brought to our own door. You also are a man. Man and woman, and their social life, poverty, labor, sleep, fear, fortune, are known to you. Learn {{that none of these}} things is superficial, but that each phenomenon {{has its roots in the}} faculties and affections of the mind. Whilst the abstract question occupies your intellect, nature brings it in the concrete to be solved by your hands. It were a wise inquiry for the closet, to compare, point by point, especially at remarkable crises in life, our daily history, with the rise and progress of ideas in the mind.|$|E

Similar to the well known frontier-based exploration in 2 d, the problem is to determine a minimal sequence of sensor viewpoints until the entire search space has been explored. We introduce a novel approach that combines the two concepts of voids, which are unexplored volumes in 3 d, and frontiers, which are regions on the boundary between voids and explored space. Our approach has been evaluated on a mobile platform using a 5 -DOF manipulator <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> victims in a simulated USAR setup.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the Armenian Virtual Observatory is to develop {{efficient}} methods for science projects based on the digitized famous Markarian survey (Digitized First Byurakan Survey, DFBS) and other large astronomical databases, both Armenian and international. Two groups of projects are especially productive: <b>search</b> <b>for</b> new interesting <b>objects</b> of definite types by low-dispersion template spectra, and optical identifications of new gamma, X-ray, IR and radio sources. The first one is based on modeling of spectra {{for a number of}} types of objects: QSOs, Seyfert galaxies, white dwarfs, subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables, planetary nebulae, C stars, etc. Each kind of object appears in the DFBS with its typical SED and spectral lines (<b>for</b> <b>objects</b> having broad lines only). The search criteria define how many objects will be found for further study, and may restrict these numbers leaving with the best candidates. At present, a number of science projects of <b>search</b> <b>for</b> new <b>objects</b> have been started: <b>search</b> <b>for</b> blue stellar <b>objects,</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> extremely red <b>objects,</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> variable <b>objects,</b> etc. Optical identifications have been proven to be rather efficient for IR sources from IRAS PSC and FSC.

The current studies controlled such incidental differences between search tasks, so that they could be directly compared. Sixand-a-half-month-olds received four types of test events, in which either a toy or no toy was presented and then hidden in the dark or under a cloth in the light. Infants searched more often on toy than no-toy trials in the dark than with a cloth. The advantage in searching for hidden objects in the dark thus appears to be genuine.

40|$|While <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>objects,</b> we combine {{information}} from multiple visual modalities. Classical theories of visual search assume that features are processed independently prior to an integration stage.
