Typically made of PVC or Polyurethane film formed into a flexible tube, sleeving can cover pipes, hoses, and cables to provide a protective layer. To handle odd-sized objects, adequately <b>sized</b> <b>sleeving</b> is opened so an object can be inserted into the tube which is then twisted to enclose the item at both ends. Tape can be used to secure the twists in place, and then cut free for handling. This is commonly referred to as “horsetailing”.|$|R

In this study, {{a total of}} nine specimens with different configurations, <b>sizes</b> of <b>sleeves,</b> reinforcement bars’ surface conditions and also grouting materials were tested under direct tensile tests. This paper presents further discussion {{on the study of}} performance of CSSleeves, particularly on the load-displacement graphs and load-strain graphs of the specimens in order to acquire the structural performance of the specimens. The test data indicates that threads on reinforcement bar had significantly deteriorated the bonding mechanism between reinforcement bars and grout.

Equipment development and related applications are also reviewed. Furthermore, numerical simulation is used to analyze the three fundamental characteristics of HSC: slow cavity filling, squeeze feeding and slow sleeve filling. From this, a selection principle is given based on the three related critical casting parameters: cavity filling velocity, gate <b>size</b> and <b>sleeve</b> filling velocity.

The shirt also received a button cuff at the wrist. The buttons were changed to the [...] "standard" [...] dull plastic button as used on jungle fatigues (and later BDU's). Another change to the trousers was the removal of the waist adjustment tab.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Huskers wore full shoulder stripes reminiscent of those worn by the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts of the NFL. These were gradually phased out when mesh and tearaway jerseys became popular. For the 1974 Cotton Bowl Classic, the jersey has the script [...] "Nebraska" [...] embroidered onto the front. From 1980–83, Nebraska's jerseys featured just a simple block [...] "N" [...] on the sleeves. In 1984, two sleeve stripes and sleeve numbers were added back to the uniform, where they essentially remain today, although the stripes and numbers have decreased in <b>size</b> as jersey <b>sleeves</b> have shortened over the years.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Colts made a minor {{striping}} {{pattern change}} on their jerseys, having the stripes only {{on top of}} the shoulders then stop completely. Previously, the stripes used to go around to underneath the jersey sleeves. This was done because the Colts, like many other football teams, were beginning to manufacture the jerseys to be tighter to reduce holding calls and reduce the <b>size</b> of the <b>sleeves.</b> Although the white jerseys of the Minnesota Vikings at the time also had a similar striping pattern and continued as such (as well as the throwbacks the New England Patriots wore in the Thanksgiving game against the Detroit Lions in 2002, though the Patriots later wore the same throwbacks in 2009 with truncated stripes and in 2010 became their official alternate uniform), the Colts and most college teams with this striping pattern did not make this adjustment.|$|R

Considerable {{progress has been made in}} research and development of supportive welfare devices and barrier-free homes, but little has been done to solve the problems associated with ready-made nightwear, such as the limited number of <b>sizes,</b> inappropriate <b>sleeve</b> and trouser lengths and crotch depth, and lack of pockets. In the present study, we therefore conducted market research and a questionnaire survey, and based on the results, made three pairs of pajamas considered acceptable for elderly women. An additional pair was also made taking into consideration the most common grievance items. The visual appearance and fit of a total of 6 pajamas, the above and 2 ready-made pajamas made of different material and with different button features, were evaluated. Our evaluation produced the following results : 1. Cotton fabric with a light colored floral pattern was most appropriate. 2. Pajama tops with buttons on the front, no collar and an adequately long body, short raglan, elasticated sleeves, and bilateral pockets were preferred. 3. Pajamas trousers with a short inner leg and unnelasticated hems, and pockets to identify the front from the rear were preferred, 4. The collar, which often appears cramped in ready-made pajamas, should be widened. The results indicated that a slight difference in length and width affected the comfort of pajamas, Taking this into consideration, appropriately designed pajamas should be made available...|$|R
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{building system}} has gained its popularity in Malaysia {{because of the}} many advantages such as high quality of structural components, less labour intensive at the construction site, and shorter completion time of a project. One of the constraints in precast concrete structures {{is to ensure that}} the connections are strong enough to ensure the structural integrity and robustness of the overall frames. In this study, a total of nine rectangular steel splice-sleeve connections were tested experimentally under incremental tensile loads. Two steel plates were inserted and welded to each end of the steel splice-sleeve. The steel plates act as shear key to provide the interlocking mechanism to the grout and to enhance the bond property between the grout and the splice. These plates were adopted to prevent the grout slippage from the sleeve. The grout strength, embedded steel bar lengths {{and the size of the}} steel sleeve splice were varied among the specimens to study their effect on the tensile performance of the connection. The results showed that the higher strength of grout, longer embedded length of steel bar and smaller <b>size</b> of the <b>sleeve</b> contributes to a higher ultimate tensile load...|$|R
40|$|Based on rock compression-shear damage theory, the {{mechanical}} characteristics of an arc blade wedged hob were analyzed {{to study the}} rock fragmentation mechanism of hob during excavation, and rock fragmentation forecasting model of the arc blade wedged hob was improved. A spoke type cutter model {{which is similar to}} the tunnel boring machine (TBM) cutter head was designed to study the rock fragmentation efficiency in different cutter spacing by adjusting the bearing <b>sleeve</b> <b>size</b> to obtain different distances between the hobs. The results show that the hob-breaking rock force mainly comes from three directions. The vertical force along the direction of the tunnel excavation, which is associated with uniaxial compressive strength of rock mass, {{plays a key role in}} the process of rock fragmentation. Field project data shows that the prediction model’s results of rock fragmentation in this paper are closer to the measured results than the results of the traditional linear cutting model. The optimal cutter spacing exists among different cutter spacings to get higher rock fragmentation rate and lower energy consumption during rock fragmentation. It is of great reference significance to design the arc blade wedged hob and enhance the efficiency of rock fragmentation in rock strata...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Perry Li, Thomas Chase. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 182 pages. The research {{described in this}} dissertation focuses {{on the development of}} innovative on/off valves for high performance, high efficiency control of fixed displacement hydraulic pumps and motors. On/off valves, the hydro-mechanical equivalent of transistors, enable the application of digital control techniques found in electrical systems to hydraulics. These techniques, such as pulse-width-modulation (PWM), have the potential of combining the low cost, high bandwidth characteristics of valve control with the efficiency of variable displacement machines. Effective control of hydraulic systems using PWM requires that the on/off valve simultaneously exhibits fast switching speed, large flow area, and low actuation power. The valves developed in this dissertation exploit continuous rotary motion to achieve the desired, and traditionally competing, operating characteristics. A helical land is used to mechanically embed the desired PWM functionality into the valve spool. The rotary motion of the valve performs the switching functionality while its axial motion determines the PWM duty ratio. Several unique rotary valve concepts are presented in this dissertation for switched-mode pump and pump/motor circuits. An analysis framework is developed that predicts valve performance and typical losses which can be used for design and optimization. Physics based dynamic models of switched-mode pump and motor circuits are also developed for simulating system pressures and flow rates and for validating the analytical models. In addition, guidelines for <b>sizing</b> the valve <b>sleeve</b> based on fatigue considerations are formulated to aid prototype design. Prototype hardware is fabricated and extensively tested to validate the analysis, performance, and predicted efficiency of the proposed valves. The research in this dissertation verifies that helical land rotary valves used in switched-mode hydraulic circuits are capable of exceeding the efficiency of comparable metering valve circuits at moderate PWM frequencies. In two comparable systems, the switched-mode circuit achieved 84 % efficiency at 50 % output flow compared to 50 % efficiency in the bleed off circuit. Analysis also shows that substantial gains in efficiency and switching frequency can be attained with improvements in valve configuration, circuit configuration, and valve geometry. Additional suggestions for further improving efficiency in switched-mode hydraulic systems are also discussed...|$|R
