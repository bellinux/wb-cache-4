25|$|Six of the Cázares men, Rodolfo Cázares Garza, Manuel Alberto Cázares Garza, Héctor Cázares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio Cázares Solís, Rubén Luna Mendoza, and Rodolfo Garza Solís, {{were kept}} together. The women and children, {{along with one}} of the grandfathers, were kept in a <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{throughout}} most of the first day. After leaving the house, the captors drove them around the city for several hours and switched them into different vehicles on busy streets in broad daylight. The kidnappers drove several of the vehicles they took from the family's homes. According to one family member, the kidnappers even stopped for gas and did not pay for the service. In their portable radio conversations while driving, the family heard them speaking about avoiding Los Zetas, the rival crime syndicate of the Gulf Cartel. That evening, the women were taken to a hostage safe house where at least twenty other men were drinking and smoking cannabis. The windows in this disclosed location were covered. A shootout broke out near the premises and the victims were transported to another location in another SUV (while in the vehicle, the family was blindfolded and placed next to a corpse). The Cázares had the impression that they kidnappers were looking where to hide their victims. The family believes that the kidnappers moved them around Matamoros for hours because they did not expect to find {{a lot of people in}} the houses where they carried out the abductions.|$|E
500|$|Pitted {{against another}} team of players (riding on a <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle),</b> the {{recruits}} board their training {{vehicles equipped with}} laser guns, called S4 Alienators ("Jumbo Judy") and proceed into the training room, blasting at cardboard cutouts and crudely drawn images of aliens amid flashing red lights. Soon, however, MIB Director Zed (played by Rip Torn) informs the trainees that an alien prison ship has crash landed {{in the middle of}} New York City. The guns are then [...] "set to full power" [...] as the trainees are instantly launched into the heart of New York, attempting to score as many points as they can by shooting the aliens in their vulnerable areas (the eyes and shoulders). Aliens vary from large, plain-in-sight creatures to small ones hiding in windows and bushes. Certain aliens will fire back causing the cart to spin out of control.|$|E

2500|$|In the 9th and 10th centuries deity yoga was contextualized in Dzogchen {{in terms}} of nonconceptuality, nonduality and the {{spontaneous}} presence of the enlightened state. Some Dunhuang texts dated at the 10th century show {{the first signs of}} a developing nine vehicles system. Nevertheless, Anuyoga and Atiyoga are still regarded then as modes of Mahāyoga practice. Only in the 11th century came Atiyoga to be threatened as a <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle,</b> at least in the newly emerging Nyingma tradition. Nevertheless, even in the 13th century (and later) the idea of Atiyoga as a vehicle was controversial in other Buddhist schools.

50|$|Finland also {{operates}} {{a system which}} charges a <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle</b> tax in addition to VAT. This system has also attracted controversy. This due to a heavy car tax. Finnish cars are the oldest in Europe and the death rate is highest in Scandinavia. The government also saturates the writing of car taxes. The system is illegal in the EU.|$|E

These were assembled in <b>separate</b> <b>vehicles</b> for the transmitter and receiver.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{highway traffic}} is an {{important}} application of computer vision research. In this paper, we analyze congested highway situations where {{it is difficult to}} track individual vehicles in heavy traffic because vehicles either occlude each other or are connected together by shadow. Moreover, scenes from traffic monitoring videos are usually noisy due to weather conditions and/or video compression. We present a method that can <b>separate</b> occluded <b>vehicles</b> by tracking movements of feature points and assigning over-segmented image fragments to the motion vector that best represents the fragment’s movement. Experiments were conducted on traffic videos taken from highways in Turkey, and the proposed method can successfully <b>separate</b> <b>vehicles</b> in overpopulated and cluttered scenes. 1...|$|R
50|$|The R1200RT {{has been}} {{affected}} {{by a number of}} safety issues since its launch. The UK Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) has issued six <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle</b> recalls covering the front brakes, anti-lock braking system,throttle cable, and clutch. This compares with just two for its R1150RT predecessor. Similar recalls have been issued by vehicle safety authorities in other countries.|$|E

50|$|There {{was no room}} to stow any {{ammunition}} so it had to {{be carried}} by a <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle.</b> When mounted, the sIG 33 had a total 25° of traverse and could elevate from -4° to +75°. It used a Rblf36 sight. The chassis was overloaded and breakdowns were frequent. The vehicle's extreme height and lack of on-board ammunition were severe tactical drawbacks.|$|E
50|$|All {{trailers}} in Ontario {{are considered}} <b>separate</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{and must have}} a permit and be plated. New owners of a trailer must register with MTO within six days of purchase. They are then issued with a permit and a plate. Trailer plates are not renewed annually, but may be replaced if lost, damaged or stolen. Plates are affixed {{to the rear of}} the trailer. There is no front plate.|$|R
50|$|To {{create a}} four-door Bronco, Centurion mated the {{bodywork}} of two <b>separate</b> <b>vehicles.</b> An F-Series chassis (shortened to a 140-inch wheelbase) with a crew-cab body was mated {{to the rear}} body of a Ford Bronco (aft of the door openings). The use of the Bronco bodyshell gave the Classic three rows of seating, as in a Suburban; depending on the design configuration, a Classic could seat up to nine.|$|R

50|$|The machine, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} 1920s, remains similar in function and design to the combine harvester. Essentially a storage vessel on a truck with a mechanical extension, the machine cuts the stalks at the base, strips the leaves off, and then cuts the cane into segments. These are then deposited into either the on-board container, or a <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle</b> traveling alongside. Waste material is then ejected back onto the field, where it acts as fertilizer.|$|E
5000|$|The Lunar Module was a <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{designed}} {{to land on}} the Moon and return to lunar orbit, and was the first true [...] "spaceship" [...] since it flew solely in the vacuum of space. It consisted of a descent stage and an ascent stage. It supplied life support systems for two astronauts for up to four to five days on the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 missions. The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by the Grumman Aircraft Company.|$|E
50|$|In New Zealand the Segway PT is classed as a {{mobility}} device, in {{the same}} category as a mobility scooter or electric wheelchair. Mobility Devices must be ridden on footpaths where possible, at a speed that does not endanger others, and give way to pedestrians. This ruling might not be consistently applied: in 2011, police in Taupo had to stop using Segways because there is no <b>separate</b> <b>vehicle</b> classification that applies to them, requiring their registration as roadworthy {{in the same}} manner as cars.|$|E
50|$|Acrobanch was an anime {{pushed out}} to {{capitalise}} on the archeological adventure craze that was occurring in Hollywood at the time. The art for this series was impressive {{and the combination}} sequence of Acrobunch still remains exceptional to this day, setting the benchmark {{for the rest of}} the 1980s. Five <b>separate</b> <b>vehicles</b> combine to form the super robot Acrobunch. The parts contain 2 motorcycles which form the arm, 2 racecars form the legs, 1 plane form the body.|$|R
