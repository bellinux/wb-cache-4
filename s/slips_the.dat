5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare, the shortened single reel adaption of the play. The film opens with {{the meeting of the}} kings of Bohemia and Sicilia. Hermione, the queen of Sicilia, entertains Polixenes, king of Bohemia. This arouses jealousy in Leontes, the king of Sicilia. Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task. The courtier <b>slips</b> <b>the</b> poison into the cup, but he changes his mind and confesses to the murderous plot. Polixenes and the courtier depart safely, but this enrages the Leontes, who has his wife imprisoned. In prison, Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband, Hoping to quell his anger. This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child to be taken out to the wilderness to die. Hermione is then brought before a tribunal, swoons, and is pronounced dead by Paulina.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift <b>slips</b> <b>the</b> letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E
5|$|With Keith Miller {{injured and}} playing purely as a batsman, Johnston took the new ball, {{sharing it with}} Lindwall. He was unable to take a wicket initially, but the English openers were uncomfortable when he and Lindwall were taking the new ball. Following the tea break, he {{returned}} with the second new ball after Compton and Yardley had put on an 87-run partnership to stabilise the middle-order. Johnston took Compton's outside edge and Miller completed the catch in <b>slips.</b> <b>The</b> left armer then claimed Evans, caught by a diving Miller after the Englishman had taken a swing of the bat wide outside off stump; this left the hosts at 7/145. Johnston ended with 2/43 from 22 overs as England were bowled for at 215 early on the third morning. After Australia declared at 7/460 on the fourth afternoon to leave the home side a target of 596, Johnston troubled the English openers with the new ball, but did not take a wicket.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the very}} large fault area, the Cascadia {{subduction}} zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally <b>slips,</b> <b>the</b> 500years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. It also made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The earthquake-generated tsunami ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing {{all the people that}} lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E
25|$|On 2 February 2008, Darchinyan fought Z Gorres to a {{controversial}} split draw at the Waterfront Hotel in Cebu City, Philippines in an IBF Super Flyweight Eliminator where the winner would challenge the champion Dimitri Kirilov. The bout {{began with a}} knockdown for Darchinyan in the first round, which {{appeared to be a}} slip by Gorres when replayed. The crowd was upset with the referee calling the slip a knockdown and began to pelt the ring with bottles of water, coins and other objects. Gorres came back in the second round to floor Darchinyan with a left hand, but Darchinyan beat the count, which again prompted some arena fans to pelt the ring with objects. Gorres was knocked down in the fifth round, but the referee ruled it a slip. A clash of heads in the sixth round opened up a bad gash on Gorres. In the ninth round, Darchinyan connected with a right hand, sending Gorres down {{for the second time in}} the fight. Gorres would fall to the canvas on at least three other occasions in the final three rounds, with the referee ruling all of them <b>slips.</b> <b>The</b> final scores were 113-112 for Gorres, 114-112 for Darchinyan, and 113-113 for the draw.|$|E
25|$|The ruling dynastic {{family of}} the Han dynasty was the Liu family, founded by Liu Bang, whose career ranged from being a minor {{official}} (sort of like a local sheriff during the rapid disintegration and chaos of {{the final years of}} the Qin dynasty) to being an outlaw and a rebel hiding out in the hills, to being the King of Chu during the Division of Qin into 18 states, or kingdoms. He was posthumously honored as Han High Founder or Han Great Ancestor (Gaozu) Emperor. Despite his folksy background, general lack of literacy, and what were considered generally vulgar ways, Liu Bang had a great regard for literature and learning. His patronage of literature and the arts, as well as his connections with the unique culture of Chu would set a precedent {{for the rest of the}} dynasty which he founded, and which managed to keep much of the political power in the hands of the Liu family: often this was implemented by allowing Liu family princes a great deal of autonomy in their local areas, thus encouraging the development of subsidiary royal courts, besides the main imperial court; and, in some cases, this encouraged princely patronage of literature and the arts, with some greater diversity and cross-fertilization of artistic genres and styles. Other important features of the Han era include the location of the capital in Chang'an during Western Han, and its move to Luoyang in Eastern Han, the extension of the Han empire into new regions, and contact with new peoples and cultures, a development which was extended by the further explorations by people such as Zhang Qian of the Silk Roads fame who in the 2nd century BC got as far as Bactria and Dayuan (Ferghana, in modern eastern Uzbekistan), and among other things brought back alfalfa and grapes to China. Also important in the history of the Han dynasty is the method of recording words, such as poems. Brushing characters with ink is archeologically attested to during the Han period, including on silk, hemp paper, and bamboo <b>slips.</b> <b>The</b> bamboo (or wood) slips were tied together carefully with delicate string cords. When these rotted and broke, the individual slips would become mixed up, and the text which was written upon them thus have often become scrambled. Methods such as stamping or marking on clay or engraving on stone were also used; and, though relatively durable required fairly elaborate craftsmanship to produce. Little poetry from the Han dynasty survives as originally recorded or published, instead most of the preserved poems exist as passed on to the future by the Six Dynasties poetry era anthologies.|$|E

25|$|Fred Trueman {{opened the}} bowling and soon had Bill Lawry writhing {{as he made}} the ball lift off the rain-freshed wicket, but it was Brian Statham who struck first. He had Bobby Simpson out first ball, caught behind by wicket-keeper Alan Smith for a first ball duck to match Alec Bedser's record of 236 Test wickets. Ted Dexter crowded close fielders round the batsmen as Trueman and Statham {{continued}} their attack, but he noticed that their footmarks were indenting the soft pitch and after 45 minutes he replaced Trueman with Ray Illingworth and Statham with Fred Titmus. They failed to turn the ball, it wouldn't turn throughout the match, but the Yorkshireman almost had 3 wickets for 1 run. Lawry was bowled for 10, Illingworth (1/85) coming round the wicket with a straight ball to remove his off-stump. Neil Harvey had just made 231 not out against South Australia, his last innings in the Sheffield Shield, and was full of confidence. On 11 he snicked the ball to slip where Colin Cowdrey dropped a sharp chance and swung the following ball was to square-leg, where David Sheppard dropped an easy chance. On 26 he gave Cowdrey another chance in the <b>slips,</b> <b>the</b> waist-high ball dropped {{with his left hand}} off Dexter. Cowdrey finally took a catch to remove Brian Booth (34) off Titmus (2/88) after lunch for 101/3, but England failed to dismiss the out of form Norm O'Neill when he pushed a ball from Titmus close to Dexter's left hand at square-leg. Having survived Harvey and O'Neill set about the English bowling in the most attractive batting of the entire series. They added 194 for the fourth-wicket in 171 minutes and at five runs an over. O'Neill swept Titmus to the boundary, followed by two drives to either side of the wicket, and more from cuts through gully and point. Harvey danced down the wicket to hit Titmus for four three times in an over, and became the fourth batsman to pass 6,000 Test runs after Wally Hammond, Don Bradman and Len Hutton. He drove Illingworth through the covers in the last over before tea to bring up his 21st Test century, his 6th against England. But Dexter kept the suffering spinners on until the new ball arrived after tea. Trueman and Statham were exhausted and made no impression with the new ball, so Dexter bowled himself with Illingworth chipping in with medium-paced seamers from his youth. At {{the end of the day}} the tired batsmen gave themselves out to the tired fieldsmen, O'Neill reached his century in 169 minutes, the fastest of the series, with 14 boundaries, but was caught for 100 by Cowdrey off Dexter (3/94). Harvey cut the ball to Cowdrey off the England captain for 154 with 18 boundaries to leave Australia 302/5. Alan Davidson and Barry Shepherd took them to 322/5 overnight, but the England bowlers recovered in the morning and Australia crashed to 393 all out, losing their last 5 wickets for 71 runs. Brian Statham (3/66) had Shepherd caught in the gully by Trueman for his record 237th wicket to become the biggest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Trueman (1/54) had Ken Mackay caught behind by an agile Smith, Richie Benaud was bowled by Dexter, Davidson (46) was bowled by Statham and the unsafe hands of David Sheppard held onto a long, high skier from Garth McKenzie in the deep.|$|E

500|$|All {{tickets for}} the Wonder World Tour were sold {{exclusively}} through paperless ticket delivery, meaning that fans did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card {{used to make the}} purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry. All groups were to enter the concert together, and ushers issued seat locator <b>slips.</b> <b>The</b> method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008–10). However, it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing. This was done in response to the extensive ticket scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour and in order to give fans the opportunity to purchase good tickets at face value. Cyrus' manager and president of Morey Management Group, Jason Morey, stated, [...] "The focus was, 'How do we take all the information we gathered last time out and {{do a better job of}} it?'
