Also featured were other locations in and near the village, including exterior shots of the Blacksmiths Arms combined with interior views of the nearby Ringlestone Inn.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional <b>street</b> <b>lamp,</b> a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E

25|$|As {{the column}} passed the {{municipal}} swimming pool, a particularly dark {{part of the}} street (since a <b>street</b> <b>lamp</b> had failed), it was hit from behind by a bus belonging to the Chatham & District Traction Company. The bus was allegedly travelling at 15–20 miles per hour, although Carter and another witness estimated its speed as 40–45 miles per hour. The bus driver, John William George Samson, 57, {{had worked for the}} company for forty years, twenty-five of them as a driver. He was very familiar with the route. He had his sidelights on, but not his headlights; this was perfectly legal and considered to be normal practice at the time. Other bus drivers said that they were using headlights that night and in that location as it was particularly dark. Other drivers defended Samson's decision not to use his headlights.|$|E

It was pulled down on 17 June 1925, when electric lighting was introduced. During the 1970s, the junction was redeveloped to accommodate the new Crompton Way bypass. A large roundabout was built, and a scaled-down replica of the original Big Lamp was erected in its centre. The new Big Lamp is electrically powered and stands about [...] high.|$|E

When inquiring about her abilities, Elle was able to learn from Noah Bennet that the Company had wanted to record the extent of her abilities (whether she could power a flashlight, a <b>street</b> <b>lamp,</b> or an entire city block) and Bob had often prompted to continue the tests further, even after Elle had passed out.|$|E
500|$|Deakins {{described}} {{the look of}} the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, [...] "it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty" [...] with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue <b>street</b> <b>lamp</b> look, he used an orange sodium-light effect. The Coen brothers shot a lot of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.|$|E

500|$|After its airing, [...] "Borderline" [...] {{attracted}} early {{attention from}} academics. They noted {{the symbolism of}} power in the two contrasting scenes of the video. The British photographer's studio is decorated with classical sculptures and nude statues holding spears, a phallic symbol. In contrast, phallic symbols portrayed in the Hispanic neighborhood include a <b>street</b> <b>lamp</b> which Madonna embraces and a pool cue held erect by Madonna's boyfriend. Author Andrew Metz commented that with these scenes, Madonna displayed her sophisticated views on the fabrications of feminity as a supreme power rather than the normal views of oppression. Author Carol Clerk said that the videos of [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star" [...] established Madonna not as the girl-next-door, but as a sassy and smart, tough funny woman. Professor Douglas Kellner in his book Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern commented that the video depicted motifs and strategies which helped Madonna in her journey to become a star. The clothes Madonna wore in the video were later used by designers like Karl Lagerfeld and Christian Lacroix in Paris Fashion week of the same year.|$|E

He came to Singapore {{at the age of}} four years with his mother and sister to join his father, who was already {{employed}} there as a night watchman in a godown near Boat Quay by the Singapore River. He attended Pearl's Hill Primary School and Outram Road School, at various stages walking [...] to school, sleeping along a five foot way, bathing at a roadside pump and studying at night under a <b>street</b> <b>lamp.</b> He completed his secondary education and took the Senior Cambridge examination at Raffles Institution in the top class in 1929. There, he was a classmate of David Marshall, the first Chief Minister of Singapore; they became good friends. Initially unemployed between 1930 and 1934 due to the Great Depression, he subsequently worked for three years as a clerk in the law firm of Mallal & Namazie for a monthly salary of 20 Straits dollars. Thereafter, he joined the Government Clerical Services for 60 Straits dollars a month and was posted to the Official Assignee's office, which was in charge of administering the estates of bankrupt persons.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{criticism}} of the Tamil Nadu government's mishandling of the crisis, many notable personalities and other people helped those affected by floods. In Chennai, people across the city offered aid, shelter and food through social media channels like Twitter, Whatsapp, and Facebook. Social media sites were also used extensively to relay information about flooded areas, rescue agencies and food and relief centers. Chennai residents set up a temporary website to crowd source information about people needing help and about those who were ready to help. Celebrities such as RJ Balaji, actor Siddharth and Chinmayi actively participated in the relief process by using social media to coordinate aid and gather information. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members distributed food and relief materials in various rain-hit areas of Chennai, districts of Cuddalore and Kancheepuram. RSS workers swung into action immediately, involved in rescuing operations wading through neck-deep water. Swayamsevaks cleared <b>street</b> <b>lamp</b> post, cleared traffic, distributed food and relief materials. Around 5500 RSS-Sevabharati volunteers served the affected areas. [...] Food was distributed to 21 lakh people in 118 relief centres; family kit was distributed with 20 essential items to 63000 families. [...] Around 133 medical camps were conducted with 160 Doctors benefitting 23000 people. Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu visited and distributed relief materials to the flood victims at Tambaram.|$|E

The village flourished after the fire, eventually reaching a population peak of around 600 following World War II. On September 7, 1903 the first phone service reached Ransom, and AT&T opened a telegraph office in 1905. Between 1905-1910 the village constructed a sidewalk system. The first electric <b>street</b> <b>lamps</b> appeared on May 7, 1910 with the acquisition of a dozen electric <b>street</b> <b>lamps</b> from Illinois Valley Gas and Electric.

500|$|In William Faulkner's novel, Sanctuary, a [...] "heaven-tree" [...] {{stands outside}} the Jefferson jail, where Lee Goodwin and a [...] "negro murderer" [...] are incarcerated. The tree is {{associated}} with the black prisoner's despair in the face of his impending execution and the spirituals that he sings in chorus with other black people who keep a sort of vigil in the street below:...they sang spirituals while white people slowed and stopped in the leafed darkness that was almost summer, to listen to those who were sure to die and him who was already dead singing about heaven and being tired; or perhaps in the interval between songs a rich, sourceless voice coming out of the high darkness where the ragged shadow of the heaven-tree which snooded the <b>street</b> <b>lamp</b> at the corner fretted and mourned: [...] "Fo days mo! Den dey ghy stroy de bes ba'yton singer in nawth Mississippi!"Upon the barred and slitted wall the splotched shadow of the heaven-tree shuddered and pulsed monstrously in scarce any wind; rich and sad, the singing fell behind.Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-nicknamed [...] "tree from hell" [...] due to its prolific invasiveness and the difficulty in eradicating it. In certain parts of the United States, the species has been nicknamed the [...] "ghetto palm" [...] because of its propensity for growing in the inhospitable conditions of urban areas, or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties, such as in war-torn Afghanistan.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the inner}} London suburbs {{and away from}} town centres, there was no {{disturbance}} by moving traffic to thin out the dense fog in the back streets. The result was that visibility could be down to a metre or so in the daytime. Walking out of doors became a matter of shuffling one's feet to feel for potential obstacles such as road kerbs. This was made even worse at night since each back <b>street</b> <b>lamp</b> {{at the time was}} fitted with an incandescent light-bulb, which gave no penetrating light onto the pavement for pedestrians to see their feet, or even the lamp post. Fog-penetrating fluorescent lamps did not become widely available until later on in the 1950s. [...] "Smog masks" [...] were worn by those who were able to purchase them from chemists.|$|E

2500|$|Every year on 19 April, {{which is}} Holocaust Remembrance Day in Poland, pupils and {{citizens}} of Lublin {{are asked to}} send letters addressed to Henio Zytomirski at 11th Kowalska Street, the last known address of Henio in Lublin. Thousands of letters were sent to Henio, including paintings, personal letters and exciting stories of 12- to 13-year-old children. At {{the entrance to the}} PKO Bank, the place where Henio's last picture was taken, a special mailbox is placed every year for sending the letters to Henio. Lublin postal Authorities have to deal with full sacks of letters which are sent back to senders with the post seal: [...] "Unknown Addressee". Later in the day, participants follow a walking tour by foot and visit the addresses where Henio had lived at: 3 Szewska Street, 11 Kowalska Street (in the Ghetto). The walk ends with a silent prayer {{at the foot of a}} <b>street</b> <b>lamp,</b> which is the last remnant of the pre-war Jewish town of Lublin serving as a memorial candle. In 2007 the passengers by the bank were asked to write letters to Henio on the spot. The response was extraordinary. The national Polish press dedicates a lot of reportages to this project. Since 2005 Henio Zytomirski has become an icon of the Holocaust, not only in Lublin but all over Poland. Today his life story is a part of the curriculum which is learnt in the general education system in Poland. School newspapers tell about him and try to understand the meaning of the Holocaust through his short life story.|$|E
