5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as the {{participants}} were introduced. The match <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10-minute period where {{no one would be}} allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to climb up the cage and over the top, escaping while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Último Guerrero and Averno climbed out of the cage. This left El Satánico to fight Máscara Mágica where the only way to win was to pin their opponent or force them to submit. In the end, the veteran Satánico forced his masked opponent to submit to win the match and the Los Infernales name. Afterwards Máscara Mágica removed his mask per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulations and revealed his birth name, Antonio Gómez Medina, formerly known as Talismán Jr.|$|E
5|$|Wilkins {{returned}} {{the second half}} kickoff 26yards to the Colts's 38-yard line. On the ensuing possession, Addai rushed five times for 25yards and caught four passes for 19yards as the Colts drove 56yards in 13 plays and scored with a 29-yard field goal from Vinatieri, increasing their lead to 19–14. On the Bears' next drive, Jones <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up second down {{and one on the}} Colts' 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by Anthony McFarland. Then, on third down, he fumbled the snap. Grossman recovered the fumble himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins {{returned the}} ball 12yards to the Colts' 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52yards on four carries, with a facemask penalty adding another 10. Chicago managed to halt the drive at their own 2-yard line, but Vinatieri kicked his third field goal to make the score 22–14.|$|E

25|$|According to the myth-ritual theory, myth {{is tied to}} ritual. In {{its most}} extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals. This claim was first put forward by Smith, who claimed that people begin {{performing}} rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth. Frazer claimed that humans <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods.|$|E
25|$|For the 1979 season, {{he joined}} the staff of Iowa State, again as a wide {{receivers}} coach, before a promotion to offensive coordinator. In 1980, after going 3–8 the year prior, Iowa State improved their record to 6–5 in large part due to running back Dwayne Crutchfield (1,312 yards with 11 TD) {{and the rest of}} Brown's offense. The team scored 108 more points that year than they had in 1979. In 1981, despite finishing with a 5–5–1 record, the team <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> record of 5–1–1. RB Dwayne Crutchfield was again a key focal point in Brown's offense and ran for 1,189 yards with 17 TD.|$|E

25|$|While psychiatrically {{oriented}} authors, {{when dealing}} with Hitler, were primarily endeavoring to diagnose him with a specific clinical disorder, some of their colleagues who follow a depth psychological doctrine as the psychoanalytic school of Sigmund Freud, were first and foremost interested in explaining his monstrously destructive behavior. In accordance to these doctrines, they assumed that Hitler’s behavior {{and the development of}} his character were propelled by unconscious processes that were rooted in his earliest years. Pathographies that are inspired by depth psychology, typically attempt to reconstruct the scenario of Hitler's childhood and youth. Occasionally, authors such as Gerhard Vinnai <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> depth psychological analysis, but then advanced far beyond the initial approach.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, {{the fossil}} record only {{contains}} mineralised exoskeletons, since these {{are by far the}} most durable. Since most lineages with exoskeletons are thought to have <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-mineralised exoskeleton which they later mineralised, this makes it difficult to comment on the very early evolution of each lineage's exoskeleton. It is known, however, that in a very short course of time, just before the Cambrian period, exoskeletons made of various materials – silica, calcium phosphate, calcite, aragonite, and even glued-together mineral flakes – sprang up in a range of different environments. Most lineages adopted the form of calcium carbonate which was stable in the ocean at the time they first mineralised, and did not change from this mineral morph - even when it became the less favorable.|$|E
25|$|The club's colors {{at first}} were not cream. They <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white kit {{which had the}} badge on the chest. During one of their early seasons, Universitario could not {{participate}} in an upcoming match because their uniforms {{had been sent to}} the laundry to be washed. The managers pleaded that they hurry with the laundry and they quickly washed them. However, when the club received the jerseys, they found that they were no longer white, but yellow. The laundry workers had forgotten to remove the badges from the jerseys and consequently the red color from the badges mixed with the white jerseys giving it a yellow tint. The club {{had no choice but to}} use the jersey to play. They managed to win that game and a few others as well and thus the club kept the new-colored kit as a good-luck charm.|$|E

In game five, Buffalo was up 3–0 {{at the end of}} the first period, but Philadelphia scored three goals to send the game to {{overtime}}. However, Tyler Ennis of Buffalo would score the overtime winner. In game six, Buffalo looked in good position to win after being up 3–1 after the first period, but Philadelphia rallied back, winning the game 5–4 on Ville Leino's overtime winner. In game seven, Philadelphia went up 4–0 about two minutes into the third period on a goal by Leino. Philadelphia ended up winning the game by a score of 5–2, winning the series four games to three.|$|E

In game three, San Jose became the fifth team in NHL playoff history to win a game after facing a 4–0 deficit, where Devin Setoguchi of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime, to make the final score 6-5. Still, at home, Los Angeles lost game four by a score of 6–3. In game five, at San Jose, Los Angeles would win by a score of 3–1. However, {{that would not be}} enough, as Joe Thornton of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime of game six to eliminate Los Angeles from the playoffs, in a 4-2 series win.|$|E
25|$|VanDerveer was {{the head}} coach of the team {{representing}} the USA at the World University Games held in Sheffield, England in July 1991. The USA team <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very strong offense, scoring over 100 points in each of the first four games. The fourth game was against the USSR, a team often challenging the USA for the top spot, but the USA won 106–80 this time. The team fell short of 100 points in the game against Canada, but still won by 18 points. In the quarterfinal game, the USA won easily against Romania 135–53, with Ruthie Bolton scoring 40 points. The game against China was more of a challenge. The USA team shot poorly, hitting only 36% of their shots, but the defense held China to 35% shooting, and won a three-point game, 79–76. The gold medal match was against Spain, but the USA had a 13-point lead at halftime and won 88–62. Bolton was the highest scorer for the USA team with 14 points per game, but Lisa Leslie and Carolyn Jones were close behind with 13 points per game.|$|E

25|$|The {{largest group}} of artists came from France. Between the years 1693 and 1699, sixteen French masons, {{painters}} and foundrymen arrived at Stockholm. At Tessin's initiative, the craftsmen had received an invitation through the Swedish diplomatic envoy in Paris, Daniel Cronström, to come and work for the Swedish king. They were offered yearly wages and accommodations. The sculptor René Chauveau <b>started</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> salary of 1,000 riksdaler (Approximately equal to US$49,550 in 2014) per year; {{he was among the}} highest paid in the group. Some artists had brought their families with them and they formed a French artists' colony. The family members often participated in the construction work. The whole group is referred to as de fransöske hantwerkarne (the French craftsmen). Most of them had received their education at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris and had worked at King Louis XIV's large palace construction at Versailles. Most of the craftsmen were catholic and they lived and worked in a very tight-knit community close by the French embassy in Stockholm. They could practice their catholic faith within the colony, but this was strictly forbidden in the rest of Sweden at that time. When to building of the palace came to a halt in 1709, the colony was dissolved. Some craftsmen, such as René Chauveau and his family, returned to France, but most of them remained in Sweden until they died during {{the first part of the}} 18th century.|$|E

The USA hit {{a high percentage of}} their shots from the free throw line, 16 of 19, but the Yugoslav team earned 43 shots from the line, of which they made 34. With a home crowd behind them, the game came down to the wire, and was tied at the end of regulation. In overtime, Yugoslavia out scored the USA and won the game 93–89. The USA still had a chance {{to make it to the}} medal round, but to do so had to win their next game against China, and do so by at least five points. The USA fell behind, and were down 16 points at halftime. They fell behind by 20 at one point, but made up the deficit and more in the second half. They went on to win the game, but by only a single point 84–83. They won their final game against Canada, but this left them in fifth place, the first time ever the USA team did not win a medal at the World University Games.|$|E
