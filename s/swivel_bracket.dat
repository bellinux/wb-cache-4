40|$|The De Havilland DH- 4 rear {{cockpit control}} stick {{is the subject}} of the {{photograph}} at a Dayton-Wright Airplane Company factory, circa 1918. When the stick moves forward and backward it pivots the horizontal bar. The elevators are connected to the bar by cables that run to the arms at the ends of the bar. If the stick moves side to side pivoting on the assembly attached to the bar it twists the bar connected to it. This bar is attached to a <b>swivel</b> <b>bracket</b> on the front stick and moves the front stick in the same direction. The front stick is connected to the ailerons and the elevators through the rear stick. [URL]...|$|E
50|$|The {{furniture}} reputedly {{dates from}} the church's establishment. The altar, lectern, pulpit and pews are of stained pine. To {{the west end of}} the aisle is the movable stone baptism font. The altar has been moved away from the apse to face the congregation. The original timber screen from the altar is presently stored in the vestry. To the rear of the altar there are now stained glass windows. To the side walls of the chancel are gas lamps on <b>swivelling</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Macfie Monoplane's {{undercarriage}} {{consisted of}} two main wheels (diameter approx. 26 in. (0.66m)) mounted below the engine, and a rear skid mounted on the sixth triangular brace {{from the front of}} the main body frame, i.e. about two-thirds of the distance back from front to tail. The two main wheels were attached, by two forked brackets, to the vertical members of a transverse rectangular chassis made of steel tubing, which transferred the weight of the engine at rest through the wheels to the ground. Each wheel was mounted behind its respective vertical member via two <b>swivelling</b> forked <b>brackets,</b> one horizontal and one sloping upwards at approximately 30 degrees, so that the two brackets and the vertical frame member formed a right-angled triangle. A helical compression spring on the vertical tube above the diagonal bracket provided a degree of sprung suspension while allowing the wheels, which were not steerable, to swivel independently.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and <b>swivel</b> <b>brackets,</b> a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R
