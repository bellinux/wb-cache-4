Therefore, color stability of dental ceramic systems needs to be thoroughly investigated. Purpose: This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the color changes of two dental ceramic systems after being subjected to <b>staining</b> <b>solutions.</b> Material and Methods: Two dental ceramic systems (veneered IPS e. max and conventional porcelain fused to metal) were used. Fifty four specimens 15 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were fabricated for each material (Total 108). Disks from each material were divided into three groups (18 disks each) according to the surface finishing technique applied (autoglazing, overglazing, polishing). Color measurement of disks was performed by using a spectrophotometer. Each group was then divided into three subgroups (6 disks each). Each subgroup was immersed for 24 hours at 37 °C in one of the two staining drinks: (coffee, strawberry juice) as test groups and distilled water as a control. Color measurements were recorded after immersion. Color differences were characterized using the CIE l*a*b* color space. The total color difference (ΔE) was statistically compared between groups of the same ceramic material and between the two ceramic materials using Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, α = 0. 05) between-unit factors (two materials, three surface finishing techniques, and three <b>staining</b> <b>solutions)</b> to verify the main effects and possible interactions between factors. Where significant differences were found, one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were applied to each betweenunit factor. Results: Porcelain fused to metal group showed no significant difference between <b>staining</b> <b>solutions</b> or surface finishing techniques used (p= 0. 05), except for the autoglazed group which was more affected than overglazed and polished ones with coffee stain.
