The National <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Technology Policy of 2002 envisaged {{the establishment of}} a National Commission for <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders on <b>science</b> <b>and</b> technology-led development. Although the <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Technology and the National Research Council. The <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Technology Act of 2003 also established a <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, as of 2014, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> Technology has reviewed the Strategic Plan for <b>Science,</b> Technology <b>and</b> Innovation (2011–2015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.|$|R

This paper analyzes county <b>science</b> <b>and</b> technology worker Internet use and the determinants based on the Second National Survey data of county <b>science</b> <b>and</b> technology workers. The results show that, among all Chinese <b>science</b> <b>and</b> technology workers in counties, there are only 51 % were proficient in Internet use while computer configuration, education, age, length of service are the crucial factors affecting their proficiency. Hence, three recommendations are proposed to improve the skills for internet use of county <b>science</b> <b>and</b> technology workers...|$|R
