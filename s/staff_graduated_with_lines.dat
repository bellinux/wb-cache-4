40|$|Mental health {{services}} have developed transition programs to attract <b>staff,</b> including new <b>graduates,</b> <b>staff</b> <b>with</b> mental health nursing experience without formal qualifications, experienced nurses wishing {{to move into}} mental health, and nurses returning to the workforce. Transition to psychiatric/mental health programs {{are considered to be}} particularly significant in the mental health field because of the relative under-representation of mental health content in undergraduate curricula. Unfortunately, transition programs have received only minor attention in the literature and there is a paucity of published evaluations to determine their effectiveness. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine transition programs and consider how they meet the expectations of stakeholders, such as consumersof mental {{health services}}, and program participants’ expectations. It is concluded that published systematic evaluations are lacking, particularly those considered from the perspective of stakeholders. Consideration of these expectations should be reflected in the design and delivery of mental health nursing transition programs...|$|R
50|$|The Sassanid dynasty fell to Muslim Arab armies in 638 CE. The academy {{survived the}} change of rulers and persisted for several centuries as a Muslim {{institute}} of higher learning.

There the methods of Gundeshapur were emulated; indeed, the House of Wisdom was <b>staffed</b> <b>with</b> <b>graduates</b> of the older Academy of Gundeshapur.

The method, supported by the MEDIA tool, has been used to design a specific decision making game for a course for senior project engineers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to expand on existing understandings of graduate employability through exploring the lived experiences and perceptions of key informants, in this case, those <b>with</b> direct <b>line</b> management responsibilities for graduates. The context {{of this research is}} focused on Human Resources (HR) graduates, a discipline that has seen little qualitative inquiry across the Higher Education (HE), employability and HR literature, and which is currently dominated by skills-led approaches. This paper will outline the theoretical and conceptual standpoint on ‘graduate employability’ underpinning this study, and will proceed to provide an overview of key findings from five semi-structured initial interviews <b>with</b> direct <b>line</b> managers of HR graduates. Exploring the experiences and perceptions of these individuals is aimed at providing a platform for understanding individual constructs of ‘HR graduate employability’ and ‘skills’. Moreover, this research works towards developing a more in-depth ‘picture’ of HR graduate employability through gaining insight into the nature of the interactions between managers and <b>graduates,</b> in <b>line</b> <b>with</b> Holmes’s <b>Graduate</b> Identity Approach (GIA). Ultimately, a re-conceptualisation of graduate employability in the context of HR graduates will act as a contribution to knowledge...|$|R
50|$|By the 1940s {{the war in}} Europe and the {{improving}} {{economic situation}} in the United States would find Western again at capacity enrollment. Colonel R.L. Jackson (WMA'06) had succeeded his father as superintendent in 1919. He had guided the school through the difficulties of the 1930s and would continue to hold the post into the 1950s. Western would have a waiting list of applicants from the 1940s through the 1960s. The academy could and did attract the best students. Part {{of the appeal of}} Western Military Academy was the quality of the academic and military staff. The Military Department was regularly led by graduates of the United States Military Academy. Several members of that department would have a record of distinguished service in the World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Academically, Western boasted a <b>staff</b> <b>with</b> <b>graduates</b> from the most exclusive colleges and universities. Colonel R.L. Jackson, like his father, was a Princeton graduate and had continued his education at Harvard. The 1940 school annual, The Recall, listed instructors who had attended Harvard, Colgate, Yale, Dartmouth, Northwestern, University of Grenoble-France, Columbia, Washington University and Albion College Conservatory. During the thirty-year span from 1940 to the beginning of 1970 Western's enrollment remained in the 300 to 325 range. The academic and military areas of cadet life were supplemented by extensive extra-curricular opportunities.|$|R
