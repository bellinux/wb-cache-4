25|$|Hemiarthroplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure which replaces {{one half of}} the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a <b>subcapital</b> (just below the head) fracture of the neck of the femur (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level.

30|$|<b>Subcapital</b> {{correction}} osteotomy {{has gained}} attention recently because it permits correction {{of both the}} varus and retroversion deformity of the proximal femur without creating other deformities. Numerous studies have discussed the use of <b>subcapital</b> cuneiform osteotomies to correct SCFE deformities in skeletally immature patients with concerning rates of AVN and chondrolysis [19, 20, 21, 22]. Ziebarth and Huber each reported {{on a series of}} modified Dunn osteotomies and Slongo reported on open reductions in acute SCFE’s, each utilizing the surgical dislocation technique described by Ganz with minimal risk of AVN and chondrolysis [10, 23]. However, a recent series on the <b>subcapital</b> correction osteotomy for SCFE deformities in patients with closed physes utilizing the surgical dislocation technique reported a concerning rate of AVN despite good results in the majority of patients [24].|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of displaced <b>subcapital</b> femoral fractures (Garden grade 3 or 4) remains controversial. Current methods of treatment, such as reduction and internal fixation, or primary prosthetic {{replacement of the}} femoral head, have a high complication rate on long term follow-up. In view {{of the success of}} total hip arthroplasty in osteo-arthritis, we believe that this procedure may be indicated in young and active patients with displaced <b>subcapital</b> fractures. 46 consecutive patients (mean age 63. 5 years) so treated were followed-up for an average of 35. 5 months.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the clinical and radiographic outcomes, {{as well as the}} complications of arthroscopic <b>subcapital</b> realignment osteotomy in chronic and stable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). As indicated by the literature review, {{this is the first time}} this type of arthroscopic osteotomy was described. METHODS: Between June 2012 and December 2014, seven patients were submitted to arthroscopic <b>subcapital</b> realignment osteotomy in chronic and stable SCFE. The mean age was 11 years and 4 months, and the mean follow-up period was 16. 5 months (6 - 36). Clinical results were evaluated using the Modified Harris Hip Score (MHHS), which was measured pre- and postoperatively. Radiographs were evaluated using the Southwick quantitative classification and the epiphysis-diaphysis angle (pre- and postoperatively). Complications were assessed. RESULTS: The mean preoperative MHHS was 35. 8 points, and 97. 5 points post-operatively (p < 0. 05). Radiographically, five patients were classified as Southwick classification grade II and two as grade III. The mean correction of the epiphysis-diaphysis angle was 40 °. No immediate postoperatively complications were observed. One patient presented femoral head avascular necrosis, without collapse or chondrolysis at the most recent follow-up (22 months). CONCLUSION: The arthroscopic technique presented for <b>subcapital</b> realignment osteotomy in chronic and stable SCFE showed satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes in a 16. 5 months follow-up period...|$|E
40|$|Five hundred <b>subcapital</b> {{fractures}} of the femur {{have been}} subjected to close analysis, and follow-up has been continued {{for as long as possible}} during the past fifteen years (Table I). In the course of this review, the quality of reduction has clearly emerged as the factor most commonly affecting both the early and late results of treatment. Accurate apposition of the fragments is already known to be conducive to union, but it also seems that the fate of the femoral head is determined by the degree of reduction. It has been found that <b>subcapital</b> fractures uniting in good position escape the radiological changes attributed to avascular necrosis, whereas these changes are regularly seen when union occurs after malreduction. These findings throw some doubt on the belief that ischaemia is the cause of breakdown in the capital fragment, and suggest that a biomechanical factor is involved...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} rater {{agreement for}} a simple 2 -category classification of <b>subcapital</b> hip fractures versus the 4 -category Garden classification and {{to determine the effect}} of clinician experience on the level Of agreement. Setting: Sunnybrook and Women's Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, a level 1 trauma centre. Method: Eleven raters, with varying levels of clinical experience (3 fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons, 4 clinical fellows and 4 residents), classified 34 pairs of anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of patients with <b>subcapital</b> hip fractures according to whether the fracture was stable (the fragments move as a unit) or unstable (the fragments move independently), and according to Garden's original 4 -category classification. The exercise was repeated 1 month later. The radiographs were obtained from a fracture database to represent a wide spectrum of injury severity. Outcome measures: The level of agreement beyond chance, quantified by use of the SAV statistic of O'Connell and Dobson. Results: The most experienced raters demonstrated almost perfect inter- and intrarater agreement with respect to stable and unstable fractures (SAV > 0. 80). The raters demonstrated only fair agreement for the Garden classification (mean SAV 0. 64). Even junior clinicians demonstrated substantial agreement regarding fracture stability, with much lower scores for the Garden classification. Collapsing the Garden classification responses into 2 categories (stages I and II v. III and IV) was not synonymous with rater categorization of stable versus unstable. Conclusion: The Garden classification for <b>subcapital</b> hip fractures is unreliable and should be abandoned in favour of categorizing fractures as stable versus unstable...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Subcapital</b> femoral neck {{fracture}} in young adults has many complications, and the incidence is increasing year-by-year. The {{selection of the}} proper operation method to avoid them is an ambiguous matter. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment effect of <b>subcapital</b> femoral neck fracture by the capsulotomy and internal fixation with iliac bone grafting or closed reduction and internal fixation in young adults. Methods: From March 2003 to February 2010, 65 young patients with <b>subcapital</b> femoral neck fractures were treated, including 39 males and 26 females with average age of 34. 5 years (range, 19 - 50 years); 29 cases of the left side and 36 cases of the right side. They were randomly divided into Group A with 34 cases treated by closed reduction and internal fixation and Group B with 31 cases treated by the capsulotomy and internal fixation with iliac bone grafting. The two groups had {{no significant differences in}} sex, age, body mass index and preoperative Harris Hip Score. The observation criteria involved the length of the incision, blood loss, operation time, nonunion rate, avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) rate and Harris Hip Score. Results: Four of 65 patients were lost follow-up, and the follow-up rate was 93. 8 %, the average follow-up time was 38. 7 months (range, 33 - 47 months). In Group A, the incision length was 5. 1 ± 2. 2 cm, blood loss was 84. 0 ± 13. 2 ml, and operation time was 52. 9 ± 10. 2 min. In Group B, the incision length was 15. 4 ± 4. 6 cm, blood loss was 396. 0 ± 21. 3 ml, and operation time was 116. 5 ± 15. 3 min. Nonunion occurred in 8 patients (25. 2 %) in Group A and 1 patient (3. 3 %) in Group B. ANFH occurred in 9 patients (29. 1 %) in Group A and 2 patients (6. 7 %) in Group B. Postoperative Harris Hip Score was 89. 0 ± 5. 6 in Group A and 95. 0 ± 4. 5 in Group B. The above index of two groups was considered statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Capsulotomy and internal fixation with iliac bone grafting can improve fracture healing, reduce ANFH in young adults.

The goal {{of this study was to}} elucidate the necessary dissection to expose and potentially repair the lesions of the plantar plate through a dorsal approach. Materials and Methods: Sequential dorsal dissection {{of the second}} MTP joint was carried out in eight cadaveric specimens. After each step, measurements were obtained using fluoroscopic imaging and digital photography to determine the amount of exposure of the plantar plate gained by each step. Results: Dorsal capsulotomy of the second MTP joint with collateral ligament release off of the proximal phalanx base, then combined with a <b>subcapital</b> oblique metatarsal osteotomy provided on average 8 and 8. 5 mm of exposure of the plantar plate as measured by digital photography and fluoroscopy, respectively.
