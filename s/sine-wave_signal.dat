40|$|It is {{inevitable}} that the torque of an induction motor {{driven by a}} voltage source inverter contains many harmonic components. The instantaneous torque of the induction motor pulsates with six times the fundamental frequency in the sine-wave PWM system {{as compared to the}} fundamental <b>sine-wave</b> <b>signals</b> with a triangular carrier signal. This phenomenon is similar to an optimal PWM system using a sine-wave pattern. This pulsation is based upon a voltage vector pattern. A 6 th harmonic signal of fundamental frequency is added to <b>sine-wave</b> <b>signals</b> of the <b>sine-wave</b> PWM system, in order to eliminate this pulsation. The instantaneous torque and current of the induction motor were computed by the state variable method. As a result of computation, the 6 th harmonic pulsation of torque vanishes as compared with the sine-wave PWM system, or the optimal PWM system. In the same manner as the sine-wave PWM system, however, the inner small ripple remains in the waveform. It does not appear in the optimal PWM system. On the other hand, such a waveform as an instantaneous maximum torque constant is shown by the use of a modification of the optimal pattern. In this case, the bottom of the torque waveform varies by six times to the fundamental frequency. The motor current is a sinusoidal waveform as is the sine-wave PWM system in all the patterns. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{their natural}} environment, cells need to extract useful {{information}} from complex temporal signals that vary {{over a wide}} range of intensities and time scales. Here, we study how such signals are processed by Escherichia coli during chemotaxis by developing a general theoretical model based on receptor adaptation and receptor–receptor cooperativity. Measured responses to various monotonic, oscillatory, and impulsive stimuli are all explained consistently by the underlying adaptation kinetics within this model. For exponential ramp signals, an analytical solution is discovered that reveals a remarkable connection between the dependence of kinase activity on the exponential ramp rate and the receptor methylation rate function. For exponentiated <b>sine-wave</b> <b>signals,</b> spectral analysis shows that the chemotaxis pathway acts as a lowpass filter for the derivative of the signal with the cutoff frequency determined by an intrinsic adaptation time scale. For large step stimuli, we find that the recovery time is determined by the constant maximum methylation rate, which provides a natural explanation for the observed recovery time additivity. Our model provides a quantitative system-level description of the chemotaxis signaling pathway and can be used to predict E. coli chemotaxis responses to arbitrary temporal signals. This model of the receptor system reveals the molecular origin of Weber's law in bacterial chemotaxis. We further identify additional constraints required to account for the related observation that the output of this pathway is constant under exponential ramp stimuli, a feature that we call “logarithmic tracking. ...|$|R

40|$|Integrated path {{differential}} absorption (IPDA) lidar {{can be used}} to remotely measure the column density of gases in the path to a scattering target [1]. The total column gas molecular density can be derived from the ratio of the laser echo signal power with the laser wavelength on the gas absorption line (on-line) to that off the line (off-line). 80 th coherent detection and direct detection IPDA lidar have been used successfully in the past in horizontal path and airborne remote sensing measurements. However, for space based measurements, the signal propagation losses are often orders of magnitude higher and it is important to use the most efficient laser modulation and detection technique to minimize the average laser power and the electrical power from the spacecraft. This paper gives an analysis the receiver signal to noise ratio (SNR) of several laser modulation and detection techniques versus the average received laser power under similar operation environments. Coherent detection [2] can give the best receiver performance when the local oscillator laser is relatively strong and the heterodyne mixing losses are negligible. Coherent detection has a high signal gain and a very narrow bandwidth for the background light and detector dark noise. However, coherent detection must maintain a high degree of coherence between the local oscillator laser and the received signal in both temporal and spatial modes. This often results in a high system complexity and low overall measurement efficiency. For measurements through atmosphere the coherence diameter of the received signal also limits the useful size of the receiver telescope. Direct detection IPDA lidars are simpler to build and have fewer constraints on the transmitter and receiver components. They can use much larger size 'photon-bucket' type telescopes to reduce the demands on the laser transmitter. Here we consider the two most widely used direct detection IPDA lidar techniques. The first technique uses two CW seeder lasers, one on-line and one offline that are intensity modulated by two different frequency <b>sine-waves</b> <b>signals</b> before being amplified by a common laser amplifier. The receiver uses narrowband amplitude demodulation, or lock-in, Signal processing at the given laser modulation frequencies [3, 4]. The laser transmitter operates in a quasi CW mode with the peak power equal to twice the average power. The on-line and off-line lasers can be transmitted at the same time without interference. Another direct detection technique uses a low duty cycle pulsed laser modulation [5, 6] with the laser wavelengths alternating between on-line and off-line on successive pulses. The receiver uses time resolved detection and can also provide simultaneous target range measurement. With a lower laser duty cycle it requires a much higher peak laser power for the same average power...|$|R

Since the signal purity of commercial generators particularly at MHz frequencies has not essentially increased in the same period, {{the problem of how}} to test ADCs has rose. This fact initiated the research of alternative methods based on either the application of special signals or posteriori correction of the measured <b>sine-wave</b> <b>signal</b> [1].

There are several challenges to enable a successful design, however. First, the time-interleaved architecture is required in order to achieve over 10 GS/s sampling rate, with the trade-off of the number of the channels and the sampling rate in each channel. Phase misalignment and channel mismatch must be considered too. Second, timing accuracy, especially dynamic jitter of sampling clock becomes a major concern at ultra-high frequency, and certain techniques must be taken to address it. Finally, to achieve low power consumption, Flash architecture is not suitable to serve as the sub-ADC, and a low-power sub-ADC that can work at relatively high speed need to be designed. A single channel, asynchronous successive approximation (SA) ADC with improved feedback delay has been fabricated in 40 nm CMOS. Compared with a conventional SA structure that employs a single quantizer controlled by a digital feedback logic loop, the proposed SA-ADC employs multiple quantizers for each conversion bit, clocked by an asynchronous ripple clock that is generated after each quantization. Hence, the sampling rate of the 6 -bit ADC is limited only by the six delays of the Capacitive-DAC settling and each comparator’s quantization delay, as the digital logic delay is eliminated. Measurement results of the 40 nm-CMOS SA-ADC achieves peak SNDR of 32. 9 dB at 1 GS/s and 30. 5 dB at 1. 25 GS/s, consuming 5. 28 mW and 6. 08 mW respectively, leading to FoM of 148 fJ/conversion-step and 178 fJ/conversion-step, in a core area less than 170 µm by 85 µm. Based on the previous work of sub-ADC, a 12 -GS/s 5 -b 50 -mW ADC is designed in 40 nm CMOS with 8 time-interleaved channels of Flash-SA hybrid structure each running at 1. 5 GS/s. A modified bootstrapped switch is used in the track-and-hold circuit, introducing a global clock signal to synchronize the sampling instants of each individual channel, therefore improve the phase alignment and reduce distortion. The global clock is provided by a CML buffer which is injected by off-chip low-noise <b>sine-wave</b> <b>signal,</b> so that the RMS dynamic jitter is low for better ENOB performance. Measurement results show that the 12 GS/s ADC can achieve a SNDR of 25. 8 dB with the input signal frequency around DC and 22. 8 dB around 2 GHz, consuming 32. 1 mW, leading to FoM of 237. 3 fJ/conversion-step, in a core area less than 800 µm by 500 µm...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the effects of low frequency switching with a non-linear step size DC-to-AC direct conversion on systems that employ photovoltaic (PV) power as an input source. These techniques exhibit dramatic reductions in circuit complexity and power dissipation compared to traditional pure sine-wave inverters. However, designing multilevel DC-to-AC inverter-less systems with maximum efficiency and reduced circuit complexity is challenging. This project has produced two novel multilevel DC-to-AC inverter-less systems for PV applications that reduces the power dissipation and circuit complexity to minimum. First, a DC-to-AC direct conversion system based on two ladders of switches structured as in the Golomb ruler is implemented at 600 Hz switching frequency. The technique has been evaluated analytically, experimentally and by simulation. The evaluation prove the reduction in series resistance loss of Golomb structure over the conventional contiguous block arrangement. It is also shown that Golomb structure can cause uneven PV panel utilization. In order to ensure even panel utilization and produce a good-quality <b>sine-wave</b> output <b>signal,</b> a novel cyclic selection multilevel inverter-less system is developed. The need for the magnetic materials is removed by selecting series and parallel combinations of PV cells. Closed-form cyclic selection expressions are derived and analytically investigated. Calculations prove that this system has exactly the same performance as a conventional magnetic core-based inverter. Laboratory and simulation results prove the efficiency of the system in PV applications. The task of determining the timing steps of the multilevel signal of known amplitude is resolved using a completely new mathematical method to minimize harmonic distortion. Closed-form expressions for the timing steps method are derived for three levels signal and the methodology is extended to an unlimited number of levels. This method gives the same results as the well-known Fourier series method but requires no carefully-chosen optimization starting point. Finally, a multiple step, forward-backward algorithm is employed to maximize the power into a given load.

40|$|When {{designing}} an ADC it {{is desirable}} to test its performance at two different points in the development process. The first is characterization and verification testing when a chip containing the ADC has been taped-out for the first time, {{and the second is}} production testing when the chip is manufactured in large scale. It is important to have a good correlation between the results of characterization and the results of production testing. This thesis project investigates the feasibility of using a built-in self-test to evaluate the performance of embedded ADCs in FPGAs, by using the FPGA fabric to run necessary test algorithms. The idea is to have a common base of C code for both characterization and production testing. The code can be compiled and run on a computer for a characterization test setup, {{but it can also be}} synthesized using a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool, and written to FPGA fabric as part of a built-in self-test for production testing. By using the same code base, it is easier to get a good correlation between the results, since any difference due to algorithm implementation can be ruled out. The algorithms include a static test where differential nonlinearity (DNL), integral nonlinearity (INL), offset and gain error are calculated using a sine-wave based histogram approach. A dynamic test with an FFT algorithm, that for example calculates signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and total harmonic distortion (THD), is also included. All algorithms are based on the IEEE Standard for Terminology and Test Meth- ods for Analog-to-Digital Converters (IEEE Std 1241).

40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) spacecraft, a {{joint mission}} between the U. S. and Japan, {{launched}} onboard an HI 1 rocket on November 27, 1997 and transitioned in August, 2001 {{from an average}} operating altitude of 350 kilometers to 402. 5 kilometers. Due to problems using the Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA) at the higher altitude, TRMM switched to a backup attitude control mode. Prior to the orbit boost TRMM controlled pitch and roll to the local vertical using ESA measurements while using gyro data to propagate yaw attitude between yaw updates from the Sun sensors. After the orbit boost, a Kalman filter used 3 -axis gyro data with Sun sensor and magnetometers to estimate onboard attitude. While originally intended to meet a degraded attitude accuracy of 0. 7 degrees, the new control mode met the original 0. 2 degree attitude accuracy requirement after improving onboard ephemeris prediction and adjusting the magnetometer calibration onboard. Independent roll attitude checks using a science instrument, the Precipitation Radar (PR) which was built in Japan, provided a novel insight into the pointing performance. The PR data helped identify the pointing errors after the orbit boost, track the performance improvements, and show subtle effects from ephemeris errors and gyro bias errors. It also helped identify average bias trends throughout the mission. Roll errors tracked by the PR from sample orbits pre-boost and post-boost are shown in Figure 1. Prior to the orbit boost the largest attitude errors were due to occasional interference in the ESA. These errors were sometime larger than 0. 2 degrees in pitch and roll, but usually less, as estimated from {{a comprehensive review of}} the attitude excursions using gyro data. Sudden jumps in the onboard roll show up as spikes in the reported attitude since the control responds within tens of seconds to null the pointing error. The PR estimated roll tracks well with an estimate of the roll history propagated using gyro data. After the orbit boost, the attitude errors shown by the PR roll have a smooth <b>sine-wave</b> type <b>signal</b> because of the way that attitude errors propagate with the use of gyro data. Yaw errors couple at orbit period to roll with '/ 4 orbit lag. By tracking the amplitude, phase, and bias of the sinusoidal PR roll error signal, it was shown that the average pitch rotation axis tends to be offset from orbit normal in a direction perpendicular to the Sun direction, as shown in Figure 2 for a 200 day period following the orbit boost. This {{is a result of the}} higher accuracy and stability of the Sun sensor measurements relative to the magnetometer measurements used in the Kalman filter. In November, 2001 a magnetometer calibration adjustment was uploaded which improved the pointing performance, keeping the roll and yaw amplitudes within about 0. 1 degrees. After the boost, onboard ephemeris errors had a direct effect on the pitch pointing, being used to compute the Earth pointing reference frame. Improvements after the orbit boost have kept the the onboard ephemeris errors generally below 20 kilometers. Ephemeris errors have secondary effects on roll and yaw, especially during high beta angle when pitch effects can couple into roll and yaw. This is illustrated in figure 3. The onboard roll bias trends as measured by PR data show correlations with the Kalman filter's gyro bias error. This particularly shows up after yaw turns (every 2 to 4 weeks) as shown in Figure 3, when a slight roll bias is observed while the onboard computed gyro biases settle to new values. As for longer term trends, the PR data shows that the roll bias was influenced by Earth horizon radiance effects prior to the boost, changing values at yaw turns, and indicated a long term drift as shown in Figure 4. After the boost, the bias variations were smaller and showed some possible correlation with solar beta angle, probably due to sun sensor misalignment effects...|$|R
