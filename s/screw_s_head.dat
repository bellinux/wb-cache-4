40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{stability}} of lengthened sacroiliac screw and standard sacroiliac screw {{for the treatment of}} unilateral vertical sacral fractures; to provide reference for clinical applications. MethodsA finite element model of Tile type C pelvic ring injury (unilateral Denis type II fracture of the sacrum) was produced. The unilateral sacral fractures were fixed with lengthened sacroiliac screw and sacroiliac screw in six different types of models respectively. The translation and angle displacement of the superior surface of the sacrum (in standing position on both feet) were measured and compared. ResultsThe stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 or S 2 segment is superior to that of one sacroiliac screw fixation in the same sacral segment. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 segments respectively is superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 segments respectively. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 segments respectively is superior to that of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 or S 2 segment. The stability of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 segments respectively is markedly superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 or S 2 segment. The vertical and rotational stability of lengthened sacroiliac screw fixation and sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 2 is superior to that of S 1. ConclusionIn a finite element model of type C pelvic ring disruption, S 1 and S 2 lengthened sacroiliac screws should be utilized for the fixation as regularly as possible and the most stable fixation is the combination of the lengthened sacroiliac <b>screws</b> of <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 segments. Even if lengthened sacroiliac screws cannot be systematically used due to specific conditions, one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> fixation in <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 segments respectively is recommended. No matter which kind of sacroiliac screw is used, if only one screw can be implanted, the fixation in S 2 segment is more recommended than that in S 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous iliosacral screw {{placement}} {{allows for}} minimally invasive fixation of posterior pelvic ring instabilities. The {{objective of this}} study was to describe the technique for <b>screws</b> in <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 using conventional C-arm and to evaluate perioperative complications. METHODS: Thirty-eight consecutive patients after percutaneous pelvic ring fixation with cannulated <b>screws</b> in <b>S</b> 1 and S 2 using conventional C-arm fluoroscopy were analysed. Accuracy of screw placement, nerval lesions, need for second surgery, operation time, and time to full weight bearing were assessed postoperatively and during regular follow-up examinations. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent unilateral screw fixation and 17 patients underwent bilateral screw fixation. In total, 83 screws were placed. Mean age of the patients was 52  ±  19  years. Mean operation time was 16  ±  7  min/screw. Mean follow-up was 5  ±  3  months. Time to full weight bearing in 28 patients was 9  ±  4  weeks. Eight patients were still not able to support full weight bearing, partially due to concomitant injuries. Patients without concomitant injuries that affected walking were able to bear full weight after 8  ±  4  weeks (n =  17). Two patients had persistent postoperative hypaesthesia. No motor weakness was apparent and no postoperative bleeding was observed. Secondary surgery due to screw malpositioning or loosening had to be performed in four patients. The presence of a <b>screw</b> in <b>S</b> 2 was not indicated for perioperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation is a rapid and definitive treatment for posterior pelvic ring injuries with a low risk of secondary bleeding during posterior pelvic stabilization.

40|$|AbstractThe ribosomal {{translocation}} involves both intersubunit rotations {{between the}} small 30 S and large 50 S subunits and the intrasubunit rotations of the 30 <b>S</b> <b>head</b> {{relative to the}} 30 S body.

Here, based on available structural data a model is proposed for the ribosomal translocation, into which both the intersubunit and intrasubunit rotations are incorporated. With the model, we provide quantitative explanations of in vitro experimental data showing the biphasic character in the fluorescence change associated with the mRNA translocation and the character of a rapid increase that is followed by a slow single-exponential decrease in the fluorescence change associated with the 30 <b>S</b> <b>head</b> rotation. The calculated translation rate is also consistent with the in vitro single-molecule experimental data...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the stiffness {{and strength of}} various sacroiliac screw fixations to compare different sacroiliac screw techniques. DESIGN: Randomized comparative study on embalmed human pelvises. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 12 specimens, we created a symphysiolysis and sacral fractures on both sides. Each of these 24 sacral fractures was fixed with 1 of the following methods: 1 sacroiliac screw in the vertebral body of <b>S</b> 1, 2 <b>screws</b> convergingly in <b>S</b> 1, or 1 <b>screw</b> in <b>S</b> 1 and 1 in S 2. On {{the left and right}} side of a pelvis, different techniques were used. The pubic symphysis was not stabilized. We measured the translation and rotation stiffness of the fixations and the load to failure using a 3 -dimensional video system. RESULTS: The stiffness of the intact posterior pelvic ring was superior to any screw technique. Significant differences were found for the load to failure and rotation stiffness between the techniques with 2 screws and a single <b>screw</b> in <b>S</b> 1. The techniques utilizing 2 screws showed no differences. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, we can conclude that a second sacroiliac screw in completely unstable pelvic fractures increases rotation stiffness and improves the load to failure...|$|R
