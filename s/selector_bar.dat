5000|$|The R4 is hammer-fired {{and uses}} a trigger {{mechanism}} with a 3-position fire selector and safety switch. The stamped sheet steel <b>selector</b> <b>bar</b> is present {{on both sides of}} the receiver and its positions are marked with letters: [...] "S"— indicating the weapon is safe, [...] "R"—single-fire mode ("R" [...] is an abbreviation for [...] "repetition"), and [...] "A"—fully automatic fire. The [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and secures the weapon from being charged.|$|E
50|$|The {{graphical}} {{user interface}} of HotJava Views was quite novel in that it dispensed {{with some of the}} common features of GUIs in order to simplify the interface. Menu bars and overlapping, resizable windows were eliminated and a simple <b>Selector</b> icon <b>bar</b> was used to switch between applications. Other third-party Java applications could be added to the Selector.|$|R
2500|$|When the {{interposer}} is depressed, it engages a {{metal bar}} (cycle clutch latch link) {{that connects the}} clutch on the cycle shaft for one cycle, providing power to the filter shaft, whose lobes thrust the interposer towards the front (operator end) of the machine. When the interposer moves, each of its lugs engages one {{of a set of}} <b>bars</b> (<b>selector</b> bails) that run from left to right across the keyboard mechanism. In a machine with a North American keyboard, there are five [...] "negative logic" [...] selector bails (two for tilt and three for rotation), and one [...] "positive logic" [...] bail (called [...] "minus five") for accessing characters in the opposite direction of rotation.|$|R
