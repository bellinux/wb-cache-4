She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{doctrine}} {{more precisely}} {{the reverse of}} the Volitional theory of [...] causation can not well be imagined. The Volitional theory is, that [...] we know by intuition or by direct experience the action of our own [...] mental volitions on matter; that we may hence infer all other [...] action upon matter {{to be that of}} volition, and might thus know, [...] without any other evidence, that matter is under the government of [...] a Divine Mind. Leibnitz and the Cartesians, on the contrary, [...] maintain that our volitions do not and can not act upon matter, [...] and that it is only the existence of an all-governing Being, and [...] that Being omnipotent, which can account for the sequence between [...] our volitions and our bodily actions. When we consider that each [...] of these two theories, which, as theories of causation, stand at [...] the opposite extremes of possible divergence from one another, [...] invokes not only as its evidence, but as its sole evidence, the [...] absolute inconceivability of any theory but itself, we are enabled [...] to measure the worth of this kind of evidence: and when we find [...] the Volitional theory entirely built upon the assertion that by [...] our mental constitution we are compelled to recognize our [...] volitions as efficient causes, and then find other thinkers [...] maintaining that we know that they are not and can not be such [...] causes, and can not conceive them to be <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a [...] right to say that this supposed law of our mental constitution [...] does not exist.|$|E

And yet it's been an accepted concept in our culture today. Nowhere does it say, 'Well, {{he was a good}} and faithful servant, so he went to the beach... The example I think of is Noah. How old was Noah when he built the ark? 600. He wasn't like, cashing Social Security checks, he wasn't hanging out, he was working. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an obligation to work. The role we have in work may change over time, but the concept of retirement is not biblical." ...|$|E

We'll be exploring them a lot more." [...] —Producer Emma Smithwick on Callum and Ash (2011) Callum was the first member of the Kane family to arrive on-screen. His older sister, Ash (Holly Weston), was introduced a couple of weeks later. Duncan stated that Callum loved his sister and although he would not admit it, she was probably his best friend. He added that Ash had helped him out a lot over the years. Series producer, Emma Smithwick, commented that Callum and Ash both had [...] "a mysterious quality" [...] about them and she was interested in exploring their history and backstory. Smithwick explained that this involved expanding the family, by bringing in some [...] "satellite family members" [...] and characters to facilitate it.|$|E

5000|$|Pregame media {{attention}} focused {{on the ability of}} Arizona State's defense to stop Navy's triple-option offense. ESPN.com analyst Kevin Gemmell wrote, [...] "Watching Sutton ... {{and the rest of the}} Sun Devils defense square off with the Navy offense is going to be one of the more fascinating chess matches of the postseason". Terese Karmel wrote for SportsPageMagazine.com, [...] "The key to the game could be the match-up between the Sun Devils' defense (second in the nation in sacks with 48) against the Naval Academy's young quarterback, Keenan Reynolds". After the Sun Devils accepted the invitation, head coach Todd Graham began to prepare the team to face Navy's run-heavy offense. Graham spoke about preparing defensively for Navy's triple-option offense: Obviously it's completely different and defensively it's tough. You can't underestimate their abilities. We've been working on it for a couple of days and it will take us a while, but it's hard to simulate it in any way, and much more difficult this week. I've spent a lot of time defending that type of offense, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a pretty god idea of how to do it. It's still not very easy because of the blocking and how they go about it, it's a very difficult scheme to defend. We're preparing for it - it's not easy, but we'll get it done. Sun Devils head coach Todd Graham Defensive coordinator Paul Randolph said the team would not focus solely on stopping the run, citing Reynolds' recent passing performance as reasons for emphasizing discipline in the team's defensive secondary.|$|E

[...] Two {{teams from}} the University of Georgia will advance to the {{national}} finals of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) Mock Trial Competition in Denver, Colorado, March 21 - 23. The teams won the berth by sweeping the regional championship over the weekend in Savannah. UGA will now compete in a national field of 24 teams, comprised of the two finalists from each of 12 regions. 2 ̆ 2 The ATLA tournament {{is one of the}} most respected and competitive mock trial tournaments in the country, 2 ̆ 2 said Ralph Powell, mock trial coach. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s rare for a school to send two {{teams from the}} regional, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a particularly good shot on the national level. We know every round will be close, but our students realize that this is the time to push even harder in their preparation. 2 ̆ 2 Both UGA teams were undefeated in the regional tournament. One team, consisting of second-year student Kriste Richardson and third-year student Blaine Norris, defeated teams from Brigham Young and Howard University in the preliminary rounds; John Marshall in the semifinals; and Alabama in the final. The Richardson/Norris team received every judge 2 ̆ 7 s vote but one in the entire tournament. Second-year student Andy Childers and first-year student Marcy Hanks served as witnesses for the team. UGA 2 ̆ 7 s second team, consisting of third-year students Kevin Gonzalez, Christy Calbos, Chandler Mason, and second-year student Sean Hynes, who alternated the roles of witness and attorney depending on the side of the case drawn in each match-up, defeated teams from George Washington University, William and Mary, and John Marshall in the prelims; Howard University in the semifinals; and Alabama in the finals. The hypothetical case dealt with a sexual harassment charge brought by a young woman who had attempted suicide and claimed a technician had raped her in the psychiatric hospital where she had been sent for treatment. - 30...|$|E
