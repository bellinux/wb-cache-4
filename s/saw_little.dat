5|$|In December 1944 Fleming {{was posted}} on an {{intelligence}} fact-finding {{trip to the}} Far East {{on behalf of the}} Director of Naval Intelligence.

5|$|Nonetheless, the Labrador Battery guns {{had limited}} effect {{during the battle}} and the rounds {{allocated}} to it were more armour-piercing cartridges rather than high explosive rounds which were more effective against the infantry. As a result, these guns were ineffective and <b>saw</b> <b>little</b> action during the Battle of Singapore.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{was looking}} up, and <b>saw</b> a <b>little</b> twinkle in Mr. Bale's eye.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{commissioning}} on 25 August 1917, Nairana {{was assigned}} to the Battle Cruiser Force of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow, carrying four Short Type 184 floatplanes and four Beardmore W.B.III aircraft.

5|$|For {{most of the}} Cold War, the AFL <b>saw</b> <b>little</b> action, {{apart from}} a {{reinforced}} company group which was sent to ONUC in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1960s. This changed {{with the advent of}} the First Liberian Civil War in 1989. The AFL became entangled in the conflict, which lasted from 1989 to 1996–97, and then the Second Liberian Civil War, which lasted from 1999 to 2003.|$|E

These proposal were never taken further, and Charest's successor, Pauline Marois, made regular {{use of the}} apartment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a number}} of other Australians were {{subsequently}} involved in the Malleson Mission under Major General (Sir) Wilfrid Malleson in Turkestan during 1918–1919, but they also <b>saw</b> <b>little</b> fighting. Malleson's aim was to block possible German-Turkish thrusts towards India and Afghanistan, but instead his soldiers became involved in fighting the Bolsheviks around Merv. The force withdrew by April 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Britain {{began in}} July 1940 with the Luftwaffe making attacks on British {{shipping}} in the English Channel and Britain's East Coast.

With {{the last of the}} Pittman Act silver struck into coins in 1928, the Mint ceased production of Peace dollars.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{costs of the}} war were high {{in some of the}} southern English colonies, including those that <b>saw</b> <b>little</b> military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.|$|E
5|$|The two Texas schools quickly {{began to}} {{battle over the}} limited funds that the state {{legislature}} made available for higher education. In 1887, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was established at Texas A.M.C., enabling the college to gain more funding. Many residents of the state <b>saw</b> <b>little</b> need for two colleges in Texas, and some wanted to close the agricultural and mechanical school.|$|E
