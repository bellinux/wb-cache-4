25|$|Maxwell {{approached}} her agent for ideas. The agent suggested that <b>she</b> <b>look</b> into thrillers, romance novels and horror fiction, as {{all three were}} becoming very popular. After reading several horror novels, Maxwell realized {{that she would not}} enjoy writing that type of fiction. Her husband brought her five Silhouette novels, three of which were for a brand-new line, Sihouette Desire. Although Maxwell thought the novels were well written, she did not really enjoy the first four stories. The last one that she read, Corporate Affair by Stephanie James (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz) made her {{fall in love with the}} genre. Because she had never read romance novels before, Maxwell picked up over fifty additional category romances to familiarize herself with the expected format and then set out to write her own romance. The resulting novel, Summer Thunder, published in 1982, was the debut of her romance career. This novel, and the more than thirty that have followed, are published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Lowell, a combination of Ann's middle name (Elizabeth) and Evan's middle name (Lowell), even though the books are written solely by Ann.|$|E
500|$|Amy Adams as Giselle [...] A princess-to-be who ends {{up almost}} having {{her dream of}} meeting her prince a reality. Adams was {{announced}} to have been cast {{in the role of}} Giselle on November 14, 2005. Although the studio was looking for a film star in the role, director Kevin Lima insisted on casting a lesser-known actress. Out of the 300 or so actresses who auditioned for the role, Adams stood out to Lima because not only did <b>she</b> <b>look</b> like [...] "a Disney princess" [...] but her [...] "commitment to the character, her ability to escape into the character's being without ever judging the character was overwhelming." [...] Hailing from Andalasia, Giselle displays similar traits to the Disney Princesses; Lima describes her as [...] "about 80% Snow White, with some traits borrowed from Cinderella and Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty... although her spunkiness comes from Princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid." [...] She is [...] "eternally optimistic and romantic" [...] but is also [...] "very independent and true to her convictions". Over the course of the film, she becomes more mature but maintains her innocence and optimism.|$|E
2500|$|There's a word {{we used to}} use in Jamaica called 'streggae'. If a girl {{is walking}} and the guys {{look at her and}} say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, <b>she</b> <b>look</b> raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. [...] Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.|$|E

2500|$|In Steubenville, the Stantons welcomed two children, a {{daughter}} in March 1840 whom they named Lucy Lamson, {{and a son}} they called Edwin Lamson in August 1842. Within months of Lucy's birth, she was stricken with an unknown illness. Stanton put aside his work and spent the summer at baby Lucy's bedside. She died in late 1841. Edwin, however, was healthy and active. The boy's birth refreshed the spirits in the Stanton household after baby Lucy's death. However, grief would return once again to the Stanton household in 1844. Mary Stanton was left bedridden by a bilious fever. Her condition continued to worsen until she died in March 1844. Stanton's sorrow [...] "verged on insanity", say historians Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman. He had Mary's burial attire redone repeatedly, as he demanded <b>she</b> <b>look</b> {{just as she had}} when they were wed seven years prior. In the evenings, Stanton would emerge from his room with his eyes filled with tears and search the house frantically with a lamp, all the while asking, [...] "Where is Mary?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In early July 2006, {{when asked}} if he would debate Owens, he said he [...] "wouldn't debate her on how to bake a {{chocolate}} cake." [...] Franchot campaigned strongly as the [...] "only real Democrat in the race." [...] On September 5, 2006, Schaefer told Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher that Janet Owens is a [...] "prissy little miss" [...] who wears [...] "long dresses, looks like Mother Hubbardit's sort of like she was a man." [...] He made additional comments that she was [...] "getting fat." [...] Later, in an on-air interview with reporter Tyler Evans of local news station News Channel 8, he further commented: [...] "She's got these long clothes on and an old-fashioned hairdo. [...] You know it sort of makes you real mad." [...] On September 8, 2006, another local news station, WUSA9, showed an off-screen reporter asking him, [...] "Did you call her an Old Mother Hubbard?" [...] to which he responded, [...] "Well, what does <b>she</b> <b>look</b> like? ... Old-fashioned hairdo; long dress ... If I lose or win – whatever I do – I'm gonna send her some Style magazines." [...] His campaign called a press conference, but he failed to show. [...] Owens commented that perhaps Schaefer had become too old to run, saying that running against him was like a granddaughter [...] "taking the keys away from grandpa." [...] In response, Schaefer and his campaign hinted that Owens was lashing out at him in an act of age discrimination. [...] One viewer wrote in, suggesting that perhaps Schaefer was showing signs of dementia. [...] The anchor responded that the caller had pointed out [...] "the elephant in the room" [...] that, until then, the media was hesitant to suggest. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments regarding Owens' appearance, saying, [...] "An apology? An apology for what? I can't help it how she looks." [...] Asked about his heated exchanges with Owens, Schaefer said, [...] "This was started not by me." [...] He added, [...] "There's dirty politics, and then there's filthy politics." ...|$|E
