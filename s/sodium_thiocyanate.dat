When dissociation was incomplete, two additional peaks were present, peak Ia eluting at the same volume as the whole hemoglobin and peak Ib (200 kDa). Scanning transmission electron micrographs of peak Ia showed it to consist of whole molecules and of incomplete hexagonal bilayer structures, missing an apparent 1 / 12 th. Peak Ib contained all four subunits but was usually deficient in subunits D 1 and D 2, was not always in equilibrium with the whole molecule, and could be dissociated further into II and III. The patterns of dissociation observed at neutral pH were very similar to those observed previously at alkaline pH and at acid pH and appear to be incompatible with the generally accepted multimeric model of Lumbricus hemoglobin subunit structure. A model is proposed in which it is postulated that the stoichiometries of some of the subunits need not be constant and that subunits D 1 and D 2 either form a "bracelet" decorated with complexes of T and M subunits or serve as "linkers" between the latter, to provide the appearance of a two-tiered hexagonal structure. Additional support for the proposed model comes from observations that the fragment II obtained subsequent to dissociation at pH 4, in sodium phosphotungstate, in sodium perchlorate, and in potassium thiocyanate was found to be in equilibrium with a hexagonal bilayer structure IaR(II), whose dimensions were approximately equal to 20 % smaller than those of the native hemoglobin...|$|R

40|$|The {{finding of}} Lilly and Thoday that {{potassium}} cyanide produces structural chromosome changes in root tips of Vicia faba was confirmed. Like mustards, diepoxides, and maleic hydrazide, potassium cyanide seems {{to act on}} cells at early interphase. A tendency of cyanide breaks to be concentrated in heterochromatic segments of the chromosomes was evident. The production of chromosome aberrations by cyanide proved to be practically unaffected by the temperature during treatment. In agreement with Lilly and Thoday, the effect of potassium cyanide {{was found to be}} dependent on oxygen tension during treatment. The effect of potassium cyanide increases with increasing oxygen concentration up to 100 per cent oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, potassium cyanide was not completely inactive, but produced a low, though significant frequency of aberrations. Pretreatments with 2. 4 -dinitrophenol did not influence the effect of potassium cyanide. When bean roots were treated with potassium cyanide before a treatment with 8 -ethoxycaffeine, or {{at the same time as}} they were treated with 8 -ethoxycaffeine, the effect of 8 -ethoxycaffeine was almost completely suppressed. The effects of a number of other heavy metal complexing agents were also tested. <b>Sodium</b> fluoride, potassium <b>thiocyanate,</b> carbon monoxide, o-phenanthroline, 2. 2 -bipyridine, and sodium azide were without radiomimetic effect under the conditions employed, and so was a mixture of sodium azide and sodium fluoride. A low, but quite significant, radiomimetic effect was obtained after treatments with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, cupferron, and 8 -hydroxyquinoline. Under anaerobic conditions, the effects of cyanide and cupferron were both quantitatively and qualitatively indistinguishable. Unlike the effect of cyanide, the effect of cupferron was not enhanced by the presence of oxygen. The effects of the same heavy metal complexing agents were tested on the activities of the enzymes catalase and peroxidase. The activities of both of these enzymes were found to be totally inhibited only by potassium cyanide. In the other cases, little correlation was found between ability to inhibit the activities of these enzymes and ability to produce chromosome aberrations. In a number of experiments, hydrogen peroxide was found to be without radiomimetic effect, whether alone or in combination with potassium cyanide. t-Butyl hydroperoxide proved to be active. The effect of t-butyl hydroperoxide was substantially increased by pretreatments with 2. 4. -dinitrophenol. The results are discussed, and it is concluded that the observations made do not support the hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide is involved in the production of chromosome aberrations by potassium cyanide. The possibility that organic peroxides are involved cannot be excluded on the bases of the experimental results. As an alternative hypothesis, it is suggested that iron or other heavy metals are present in the chromosomes and that cyanide and other heavy metal complexing agents produce chromosome aberrations by reacting with these metals...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{structure}} and composition of aqueous interfaces {{is one of the}} most important current problems in modern science. Aqueous interfaces are ubiquitous in Nature, ranging from aerosols to cellular structures. Aerosol chemistry is presently the most significant unknown factor in predicting climate change, and an understanding of the chemistry that occurs at aerosol interfaces would significantly improve climate models. Similarly, the nature of aqueous biological interfaces has a profound effect on {{the structure}} and function of proteins and other biological structures. Despite the importance of these problems, aqueous interfaces remain incompletely understood due to the challenges of experimentally probing them. Recent experimental and theoretical results have firmly established the existence of enhanced concentrations of selected ions at the air/water interface. In this dissertation, I use an interface-specific technique, UV second harmonic generation (SHG), to further investigate the adsorption of ions to the air/water interface and to extend the study of ion adsorption towards more biologically relevant systems, alcohol/water interfaces. 	In Chapter 2, I describe resonant UV-SHG studies of the strongly chaotropic thiocyanate ion adsorbed to the interface formed by water and a monolayer of dodecanol, wherein the Gibbs free energy of adsorption was determined to be - 6. 7 ± 1. 1 and - 6. 3 ± 1. 8 kJ/mol for <b>sodium</b> and potassium <b>thiocyanate,</b> respectively, coincident with the value determined for thiocyanate at the air/water interface. Interestingly, at concentrations near and above 4 M, the resonant SHG signal increases discontinuously, indicating a structural change in the interfacial region. Recent experimental and theoretical work has demonstrated that the adsorption of bromide is particularly important for chemical reactions on atmospheric aerosols, including the depletion of ozone. In Chapter 3, UV-SHG resonant with the bromide charge-transfer-to-solvent band and a Langmuir adsorption model are used to determine the affinity of bromide for both the air/water and dodecanol/water interfaces in the molar concentration regime. The Gibbs free energy of adsorption for the former is determined to be - 1. 4 kJ/mol with a lower 90 % confidence limit of - 4. 1 kJ/mol. For the dodecanol/water interface the data are best fit with a Gibbs free energy of + 8 kJ/mol with an estimated a lower limit of - 4 kJ/mol. 	Adsorption of ions to the air/water interface in the millimolar regime is a particularly interesting phenomenon. In Chapter 4, the affinity of sodium chloride and sodium bromide to the air/water interface is probed by UV-SHG. Both salts exhibit a strong adsorption, with free energies greater than - 20 kJ/mol. Interestingly, sodium chloride exhibits a stronger affinity for the interface than does sodium iodide, which was previously studied by Poul Peterson. This is counter to both experimental and theoretical results for higher concentrations. It has been predicted that ion adsorption is dictated by strong and opposing electrostatic and entropic forces. The change in order of ion interfacial affinity can be explained by relatively small changes in these forces at different concentrations and ionic strengths. 	In Chapters 5 and 6, other work using nonlinear optical techniques is described. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy is a promising tool for chemically selective imaging based on molecular vibrations. While CARS is currently used as a biological imaging tool, many variations are still being developed, perhaps the most important being multiplex CARS microscopy. Multiplex CARS has the advantage of comparing images based on different molecular vibrations without changing the excitation wavelengths. In Chapter 5, I demonstrate both high spectral and spatial resolution multiplex CARS imaging of polymer films using a simple scheme for chirped CARS with a spectral bandwidth of 300 cm- 1. 	In Chapter 6, the nonlinear optical properties of KNbO 3 nanowires are studied. Using SHG and sum frequency generation, efficient nonlinear optical frequency conversion is demonstrated in single KNbO 3 nanowires that act as optical waveguides, yielding a coherent tunable subwavelength light source...|$|R

The reaction of sodium cyanate and 1, 4 -naphthoquinone epoxide in a microwave reactor at 65 ˚C in both acidic and non-acidic conditions produces 2 -amino- 3 -methyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (5). When an excess of acid was used (10 : 1), 2 -chloro- 3 -methyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (6) was formed, with hydrochloric acid acting as a nucleophile (50 % yield).

Bacteriolysis was achieved by sequential treatment of the cells with either hen egg white lysozyme and <b>sodium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> {{or a combination of}} hen egg white lysozyme and a proteolytic enzyme followed by addition of the thiocyanate. In the absence of <b>sodium</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> {{a small percentage of the}} total macromolecular thymidine was released in control reaction mixtures during incubation. This amount of released DNA more than doubled in trypsin-treated cells, but the inclusion of lysozyme in reaction mixtures prevented assay of the DNA. Lysis was found to be optimal in the late log phase of growth and was dependent on the concentrations of both lysozyme and protease. Concentrations of trypsin or chymotrypsin as low as 0. 01 microgram/ml were found to be effective in enhancing the lytic process. The addition of protease to lysozyme-inorganic salt reaction mixtures altered both the pH and ionic strength profiles of cell lysis. At pHs of 5. 5 or lower, both the lysozyme-NaSCN and the lysozyme-trypsin-NaSCN systems were inactive in mediating lysis. The loss of insoluble cell wall peptidoglycan by lysozyme treatment was pH independent and did not appear to be affected by the addition of protease. Either diluted whole saliva or neutrophil extracts could replace trypsin to enhance cell lysis further...|$|E
