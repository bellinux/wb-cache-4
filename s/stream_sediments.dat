In 1968, at Bakers urging, a U.S. Geological Survey {{geologist}} sampled rocks and <b>stream</b> <b>sediments</b> in the region, including samples from the future site of the Red Dog mine, and named Red Dog Creek after Bob Baker's dog, an Irish Terrier (Tailleur; USGS Open File 70-319). [...] In the mid 1970s, after investigations by BLM-contracted geologists confirmed significant mineralization, interest in the region from major mining companies and NANA intensified. Significant exploration, soon including drilling, of deposits in the region began in 1975 (Alaska Minerals Yearbook 1978-1979). In 1980 the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) became law and NANA officially selected the land underlying Red Dog. Drill exploration of the Red Dog deposit began in 1980, by Cominco American. In 1982 NANA and Cominco American (a mining company that had staked the land, and later became Teck Cominco) signed an agreement to develop the deposit. In 1986 the State of Alaska agreed to fund and take ownership of a road (DeLong Mts. Transportation System) from Red Dog to the coast, and a shallow-water port site. Also in 1986, residents of Kotzebue and 10 other area villages voted to form the Northwest Arctic Borough, to be economically based on taxing the Red Dog mine. Construction of the road, port site, and mine began in July 1987. Mine operations commenced in December 1989.|$|E

However, this SCB modeling, like contour mapping, of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical anomalies depends on sampling locations and sampling density. These arbitrary aspects of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> sampling can render SCB or contour mapping of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> anomalies inefficient. In this paper, instead of evaluating the relative exploration importance of each sample per SCB, we evaluated the relative exploration importance of samples per natural drainage catchment basin (DCB). Accordingly, we developed a new fuzzy weighting scheme for each DCB based on the distribution of anomalous and background samples in each DCB. In this new approach of weighted drainage catchment basin (WDCB) mapping of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical anomalies, individual DCBs are given fuzzy weights representing their relative importance for prospecting the deposit-type sought. Hence, a map of WDCB can be used directly as a geochemical evidence layer in fuzzy-based mineral prospectivity mapping. In this regard, we demonstrated that the prediction rate of prospectivity map obtained by using WDCB approach with respect to known mineral deposit occurrences is higher than that of prospectivity map obtained by using a SCB or contour map...|$|R

This study aimed to: (1) compare and contrast anomaly maps derived from continuous and discrete field models of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical landscapes; and (2) determine which empirical frequency distributions – those of original point data or those of pixels values in models of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical landscapes – are more useful in mapping of anomalies in such geochemical landscapes. Anomalies were mapped by using the mean+ 2 SDEV (standard deviation), median+ 2 MAD (median absolute deviation) and concentration–area (C–A) fractal methods of identifying threshold values in a geochemical data set. The {{results of the study}} in the Aroroy gold district (Philippines) highlight the following findings. In mapping of anomalies in either continuous or discrete field models of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical landscapes, the C–A fractal method performs best, followed by the median+ 2 MAD method and then by the mean+ 2 SDEV method. Anomalies mapped in discrete field models, compared to anomalies mapped in continuous field models, of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical landscapes mostly have stronger positive spatial associations with the known epithermal Au deposit occurrences in the study area. Empirical frequency distributions of either the original point data or the pixels values in the models of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical landscapes are similarly useful in applying the C–A fractal method, but not in applying either the median+ 2 MAD or mean+ 2 SDEV method, to map anomalies in either continuous or discrete field models of such geochemical landscapes...|$|R

Copper, lead, and iron have frequently been detected throughout Indiana freshwaters based on historical samples. Since microbial activity is a holistic measure of ecosystem function, changes in microbial activity in response to metals may indicate potential areas of concern. Metal concentrations in seven streams of the Upper White River watershed of central Indiana were measured during spring (May) and summer (August) in conjunction with measurement of sediment nitrification rates using the nitrapyrin-inhibition technique. Additionally, the influence of copper, lead, and iron on microbial nitrification was studied using in vitro mesocosms inoculated with <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> from selected sites. Copper, lead, and iron concentrations in <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> and water varied among sites with sediment concentrations ranging 654 – 1985 mg Fe/kg sediment and 1. 00 - 2. 91 mg Cu/kg sediment. Water concentrations ranged from below detection to 0. 10 mg Fe /L, and 0. 01 – 0. 02 mg Cu/L. Lead concentrations were below detection at all sites except in May at one site (Pleasant Run Creek 0. 47 mg Pb/kg sediment) and in August at one site (Mud Creek 0. 38 mg Pb/ kg <b>sediment).</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>sediment</b> nitrification rates were positively correlated to <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> copper concentration (r = 0. 78, p = 0. 001).

Positive correlations were found between nitrification response rates and total Fe (r = 0. 61, p = 0. 02) and Cu (r = 0. 74, p = 0. 002) concentrations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{requirements}} for quantitative data in geological surveillance are ever increasing; traditional geological maps and 3 D models are evolving into quantitative conceptual models {{based on a}} broad range of analytical measurements of surface and subsurface properties. The British Geological Survey's Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) project provides one such source of data: national coverage of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment,</b> <b>stream</b> water and soil geochemistry. While this geochemical data is of obvious benefit {{to our understanding of the}} present day surface environment, the rich geological diversity of south west England provides an ideal setting in which to showcase the potential of such data to enhance our understanding of the underlying bedrock. In this paper we use compositional data analysis to extract lithostratigraphic information from G-BASE <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> data. We find that variations in G-BASE <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemistry correspond very closely to mapped variations in bedrock geology. Geochemical variations between the 16 lithostratigraphic domains into which we classify the region provide insight into the distinct geological histories of the lithologies within each domain, particularly in relation to depositional environments and sediment provenance...|$|R

40|$|Integration of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical {{data with}} {{other types of}} mineral {{exploration}} data, especially in knowledge-driven mineral potential mapping (MPM), is a challenging issue. In this regard, multivariate analyses (e. g., factor analysis) are generally used to extract significant anomalous geochemical signature of the mineral deposit-type sought. In this study, we used stepwise factor analysis to generate a geochemical mineralization probability index (GMPI) through a new approach to create <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical evidential maps. GMPI is a weight that can be mapped, and hence, can be used as an evidential map in MPM. Using stepwise factor analysis enhances recognition of anomalous geochemical signatures, increases geochemical anomaly intensity and increases the percentage of the total explained variability of data. With the GMPI, we developed a new data-driven fuzzification technique for (a) effective assignment of weights to <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical anomaly classes, and (b) improving the prediction rate of mineral potential maps and consequently increasing exploration success. Furthermore, the predictive capacity of each <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical sample for prospecting the deposit-type sought upstream of its location can be evaluated individually using GMPI. In addition, the GMPI can be used efficiently in knowledge-driven MPMas a new exploratory data analysis tool to generate a weighted evidential map in less explored areas. In this paper, we successfully demonstrated the application of GMPI to generate a reliable geochemical evidential map for porphyry-Cu potential mapping in an area in Kerman province, southeast of Iran...|$|R

40|$|Geographic {{information}} about the levels of toxics in environmental media is commonly used in regional environmental health studies when direct measurements of personal exposure is limited or unavailable. In this article, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing the spatial distribution of topsoil geochemical properties, including the concentrations of various toxicants. Due to the small-scale heterogeneity of most geochemical topsoil processes, direct measurements of the processes themselves only provide highly localized information; it is thus financially prohibitive to study the spatial patterns of these processes across a large region using traditional geostatistical analyses of point-referenced topsoil data. Instead, it is standard practice to assess geochemical patterns at a regional scale using point-referenced measurements collected in <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> because, unlike topsoil data, individual <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical measurements {{are representative of the}} surrounding area. We propose a novel multiscale soils (MSS) model that formally synthesizes data collected in topsoil and <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> and allows the richer <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> information to inform about the topsoil process, which in environmental health studies is typically more relevant. Our model accommodates the small-scale heterogeneity of topsoil geochemical processes by modeling spatial dependence at an aggregate resolution corresponding to hydrologically similar regions known as watersheds. We present an analysis of the levels of arsenic, a toxic heavy metal, in topsoil across the midwestern United States using the MSS model and show that this model has better predictive abilities than alternative approaches using more conventional statistical models for point-referenced spatial data...|$|R

40|$|There {{is lack of}} {{research}} and documentation of actual (as opposed to theoretical) benefits (e. g., mineral deposit discovery) of developments in compositional data analysis and imputation of censored values to mineral exploration geochemistry. In the present study, analyses of logratio- and ln-transformed <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical data containing ca. 30 % of samples with censored values of a pathfinder element for the mineral deposit-type of interest yielded the following findings. Exclusion of those samples supports interpretation of multi-element anomalies reflecting the presence of mineralization. However, the multielement anomaly maps obtained by exclusion of those samples are barely better than the multi-element anomaly maps derived by inclusion of those samples after replacing the censored values with 1 / 2 of detection limit or with imputed values. Logratio (i. e., alr, clr, or ilr) transformation, compared to ln-transformation, of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical data does not improve mapping of pathfinder element anomalies reflecting the presence of mineralization. However, <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical data, excluding or including censored values (replaced with 1 / 2 of detection limit or with imputed values), should be clr- or ilr-transformed to enhance recognition of anomalous multi-element associations reflecting the presence of mineralization. The anomaly maps of multi-element associations derived from ilr-transformed data are better, albeit slightly, than the anomaly maps of multi-element associations derived from clr-transformed data. In the present study, the main benefit of either clr- or ilr-transformation, compared to either ln- or alr-transformation, of <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical data is the enhancement of anomalous multi-element associations reflecting the presence of mineralization. This is an important benefit because variations in trace element concentrations in regional-scale <b>stream</b> <b>sediment</b> geochemical data are mostly due to lithology and other factors (or processes) unrelated to mineralization.
