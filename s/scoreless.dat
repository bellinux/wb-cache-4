5|$|Feldman {{underwent}} reconstructive elbow {{surgery for}} a torn ulnar collateral ligament in October 2003. In his four appearances in 2004 for the Arizona League Rangers in the Arizona League, he pitched seven <b>scoreless</b> innings. He began the 2005 {{season with the}} Single-A Bakersfield Blaze, but after nine <b>scoreless</b> innings in relief was quickly promoted to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders.|$|E
5|$|After Quantrill {{became a}} free agent, Mota became the setup man for Gagné in 2004. He started {{the season with}} eight {{straight}} <b>scoreless</b> games. From June 27 to July 16, he did not allow a run in 10 straight games. On July 29, he started a career-high five-game winning streak {{when he got a}} win by pitching two <b>scoreless</b> innings in a 2–1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. He was the winning pitcher when he pitched two <b>scoreless</b> innings in an 8–5 victory over the Anaheim Angels on July 3 in a game notable for Gagné getting the final save of his 84 straight converted save chances. On July 30, a day before the trade deadline, Mota had a 2.14 ERA in 52 games. That day, he was traded to the Florida Marlins with Juan Encarnación and Paul Lo Duca for Hee-seop Choi, Brad Penny, and Bill Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he had a}} solid {{performance}} in spring training, Hughes began the 2009 season in Triple-A. He was called up to the majors in April after Chien-Ming Wang {{was placed on the}} disabled list. Hughes made his first start of the season on April 28 against the Detroit Tigers and pitched six <b>scoreless</b> innings, earning his first win since 2007 in an 11–0 victory. On May 25, Hughes threw eight <b>scoreless</b> innings, earning the win in an 11–1 victory over the Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Arizona later made {{an attempt}} to drive towards a score, but Centre intercepted an Arizona pass to keep the game <b>scoreless.</b> Herb Covington scored on a punt return and a sweep to seal the victory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} quarter, Kansas had kept Virginia Tech <b>scoreless</b> while capitalizing on a 60-yard {{interception}} return by Aqib Talib for the game's only points, a 70 lead.|$|E
5|$|During the streak, the Elias Sports Bureau {{changed its}} {{criteria}} for the official consecutive <b>scoreless</b> innings record for starting pitchers from including fractional innings in which one or two outs had been recorded to counting only complete <b>scoreless</b> innings. Since the streak was active {{at the end of}} the 1988 season, it would have spanned two separate seasons if Hershiser had pitched any additional <b>scoreless</b> innings to begin the next year. However, he yielded a run in his first inning of the 1989 season, thus ending the streak. The streak only includes innings pitched in the regular season, excluding eight <b>scoreless</b> innings Hershiser pitched to start Game 1 of the 1988 National League Championship Series on October 4 (unofficially extending his streak to 67 combined innings). Although he completed the ninth inning in each start, the streak's final game lasted 16 innings, of which he only pitched the first ten. Thus, Hershiser did not match Drysdale's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts. Like Drysdale's streak, the penultimate game of Hershiser's streak was a Dodgers–Giants game that featured a controversial umpire's ruling that saved the streak.|$|E
5|$|For its {{impressive}} {{average of}} 50 {{points per game}} on offense and eleven games of <b>scoreless</b> defense, the 1901 team has been {{recognized as one of}} the greatest college football teams of all time.|$|E
5|$|Greinke {{recorded}} his first career win on June 8, when he pitched seven <b>scoreless</b> innings against the Montreal Expos. In 24 starts, Grienke finished the 2004 year with an 8-11 {{record and a}} 3.97 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Hershiser had {{pitched a}} -inning <b>scoreless</b> streak in 1984, {{eventually}} joining Gaylord Perry and Luis Tiant {{as the only}} pitchers between 1963 and 2014 {{with at least two}} streaks of this length. Hershiser's 1984 streak, which was the longest <b>scoreless</b> inning streak of the year, was broken up on July 24 by a home run by two-time NL Most Valuable Player Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves. His streak included a blown save on July 8 against the St. Louis Cardinals and a nine-inning shutout against the Cardinals on July 19.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 Vanderbilt {{defeated}} Carlisle 4–0, {{the result}} of a Bob Blake field goal. In 1907 Vanderbilt fought Navy to a 6–6 tie. In 1910 Vanderbilt held defending national champion Yale to a <b>scoreless</b> tie.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{dominated}} Buffalo statistically in {{the first}} half, gaining 225yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208yardsrushing. Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20points off UConn turnovers {{in the first}} half, but were held <b>scoreless</b> {{in the second half}} when the Huskies stopped turning the ball over.|$|E
5|$|During spring training, the Twins {{assigned}} Humber to Santana's former {{place in}} the Twins' clubhouse. While trying to earn {{a spot in the}} rotation, Humber compiled 11 consecutive <b>scoreless</b> innings in the Grapefruit League. By late March, Humber had a spring training ERA of 1.29.|$|E
5|$|Hacker {{made his}} major league debut on September 22, {{allowing}} two runs in an inning in a 10–4 {{loss to the}} Cincinnati Reds. He pitched a <b>scoreless</b> inning in a 6–0 loss to the Chicago Cubs in his next game on September 29. In his {{final game of the}} year on October 4, he pitched a <b>scoreless</b> inning in a 6–0 loss to Cincinnati. Hacker had no record, a 6.00 ERA, one strikeout, two walks, and three innings pitched in his three games with the Pirates.

Hamels threw a total of 35 innings during the postseason, and held opponents <b>scoreless</b> in 28 of them; he never allowed more than one run in any of the seven innings in which he did not hold opponents <b>scoreless.</b> Hamels was named the 2008 World Series MVP.|$|E
5|$|Hughes was {{included}} on the Yankees' postseason roster as a relief pitcher. He had <b>scoreless</b> outings in Games 4 and 5 of the ALDS as the Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers in five games.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw pitched 41 {{consecutive}} <b>scoreless</b> innings, {{before giving}} up a solo home run to Padres' Chase Headley on July 10. In 2015 another Dodger, Zack Greinke, maintained a streak of 45 consecutive innings without allowing a run. It ended on July 26.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Brashear {{stepped out}} of {{retirement}} and {{signed a contract with}} Modo Hockey of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) {{for the remainder of the}} season.

5|$|On November 9, 1901, undefeated Michigan {{faced an}} undefeated Ohio State {{team that had}} allowed opponents to score only five points in its five {{previous}} games. The 1901 game was the third meeting in {{what would become the}} Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry, with the two teams having played to a <b>scoreless</b> tie in their prior match in 1900.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, Mota was {{the winning}} pitcher when he pitched a <b>scoreless</b> inning in an 8–7 victory over Houston. He got another win by {{pitching}} a <b>scoreless</b> inning on September 12 in a 6–4 victory over Florida. With the Mets, {{he had a}} 3–0 record with a 1.00 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 18 games to finish the season 4–3 with a 4.53 ERA in 52 games. He made {{the playoffs for the}} first time in his career as the Mets won the NL East. In the first game of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Dodgers, Mota was the winning pitcher when he pitched two innings, although he blew a 4–1 lead by giving up three runs and allowing the Dodgers to tie the game. Mota pitched two <b>scoreless</b> innings in the Mets' series-winning 9–5 victory over the Dodgers in Game 3. In the 2006 National League Championship Series, Mota appeared in five of the seven games in the series. He blew a lead in an eventual Game 2 loss, but he did not give up a run in the other four games as the Mets lost to St. Louis in seven games. On October 30, he filed for free agency.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg set a {{franchise}} record on September 10 for consecutive innings pitched without allowing a run with 34 innings, including a nine-inning complete game shutout performance on August 30 {{in which he}} {{hit a home run}} to break the <b>scoreless</b> tie against Miami Marlins starter Adam Conley.|$|E
5|$|The Astros {{exercised}} their $5.2million club {{option on}} Gattis' {{contract for the}} 2017 season. In Game 7 of the 2017 American League Championship Series, Gattis hit a solo {{home run in the}} fourth inning of a <b>scoreless</b> game.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight <b>scoreless</b> innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive <b>scoreless</b> innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive <b>scoreless</b> innings in relief. Howell's <b>scoreless</b> streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's <b>scoreless</b> inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{returned}} to the Royals on July 7. Through July 27, he had a 2.18 ERA. He did not give up more than one earned run until August 5, when {{he got his first}} loss of the year against the Oakland Athletics. However, Affeldt had a 12.71 ERA in his next eighteen appearances, which raised his ERA to 6.93. He held opposing batters <b>scoreless</b> for the final nine games of the season to bring it down to a seasonending 5.26.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>scoreless</b> first quarter, Alabama took a 3–0 lead {{early in}} the second quarter on a 25-yard Cade Foster field goal. On their next possession, the Crimson Tide scored their first {{touchdown}} on a two-play drive that saw a 42-yard Kevin Norwood reception and a one-yard Drake touchdown run for a 10–0 lead. Alabama then extended their lead to 24–0 at halftime after touchdown runs of 24-yards from Yeldon and one-yard from Drake on their final two possessions of the half.|$|E
5|$|After {{ending the}} 2008 season with 15 <b>scoreless</b> innings, Greinke started off 2009 by not {{allowing}} {{a run in}} his first 24 innings, which meant that for 39 innings in a row, he had not given up a run. Greinke was named American League(AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all tops in the Majors. On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game. On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game. After a <b>scoreless</b> first quarter in which Alabama missed two field goals, both teams scored field goals in the second; Alabama also had another attempt blocked {{early in the second}} quarter, that left the score tied 3–3 at halftime. Alabama took a 6–3 lead in the third, but LSU tied the game at 6–6 in the fourth quarter to send the game into overtime. In the overtime period, Alabama missed a 52-yard field goal. LSU then connected on a 25-yard field goal to win the game 9–6.|$|E
5|$|Alston {{joined the}} Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL in 2005, {{remaining}} {{with the team}} for three years. He played in 22 regular season games, recording 37 tackles, five sacks, and four forced fumbles. In the 93rd Grey Cup, Alston sacked the opposing quarterback in overtime, leading to a <b>scoreless</b> drive for the Montreal Alouettes and a 38–35 win for the Eskimos. Alston had several stints as a starting player for the Eskimos, but {{his role as a}} starter was never consistent, partially due to injuries. He was released by the Eskimos after the 2007 season.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was once}} again {{expected}} to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004. He was subsequently banned until the semi-finals, but never {{made it back to}} action and finished the competition <b>scoreless</b> due to Italy's elimination in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
