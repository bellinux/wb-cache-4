40|$|PVDF-TrFE {{films with}} {{thickness}} of 200 nm were produced by spin coating with solution concentration of 30 g/L and spinning rate of 1500 rpm. <b>Surface</b> of <b>treated</b> PVDF-TrFE <b>film</b> with pressure of 0. 6 mbar at 9 minutes exposure time showed large elongated crystallite with increased average surface roughness from 3. 51 nm to 9. 12 nm. Meanwhile <b>surface</b> of PVDF-TrFE <b>film</b> <b>treated</b> with pressure of 0. 3 mbar at 9 minutes exposure time showed {{a very fine}} crystal growth with average surface roughness of 5. 60 nm. Contact angle dropped significantly after plasma treatment. Exposure time of 9 minutes showed high reduction of contact angle (33 %). Contact angle measurement returned to its original state after 5 days of treatment indicating that the surface with high surface energy was less stable. The FTIR spectrum indicated peaks at 1292, 848 and 885 cm" 1, which showed significant increased in intensity. These peaks represented all trans (TTTT) configurations. These showed that surface treatment had increased the presence of Pphase crystals on the <b>surface</b> of the <b>treated</b> PVDF-TrFE <b>films.</b> These P-phase crystals contributed to increment in the dielectric constant measurements. Dielectric constant at frequency of 10 ᶟ Hz showed high increment from 10. 5 to 17. 0 with very low tan 5 of 0. 15. Elemental composition on <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> PVDF- TrFE <b>film</b> detected group of fluorine at 695. 3 eV, oxygen group at 540. 8 eV and carbon group at range from 313 ev to 263 ev. Reduction of F/C ratio indicated dehydrofluorination on the surface, whilst the increased in O/C ratio suggested that plasma <b>treated</b> PVDF-TrFE <b>film</b> <b>surface</b> had interacted with oxygen in the environment. Thus, it is concluded that plasma <b>treated</b> PVDF-TrFE <b>film</b> with pressure of 0. 6 mbar and exposure time of 9 minute was the optimized film required for producing film surface with high surface energy, high surface roughness and high dielectric properties. However, immediate application after plasma treatment is highly recommended {{in order to prevent}} any surface oxidation...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to verify}} the {{effectiveness}} of a biodegradable PLA coating on biaxially oriented poly ethylene terephthalate (BOPET) films substrates in order to develop a biodegradable sealant layer for improving the functional properties of polyester films. In particular, this work focuses on the evaluation of different <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> BOPET <b>films</b> to understand the effect of typical polyester substrate treatments on the adhesion of the PLA coating. At this purpose the film's surface properties and topography have been characterized respectively by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and by atomic force microscopy (AFM); while their surface tension has been analyzed by contact angle tests. Furthermore, the PLA coating adhesion to different BOPET webs has been assessed by delamination tests and dynamical mechanical analysis. In addition, to evaluate the optical properties haze and transparency measures have been performed. It was found that corona treatment proves to be more effective in increasing surface energy and roughness of substrate with respect to a chemical treatment. The coating adhesion to corona treated BOPET was higher compared to the neat and the chemical <b>treated</b> BOPET <b>films.</b> Improvement in adhesion of PLA on corona treated BOPET was interpreted on the basis of surface oxidation due to the electrical discharge as showed by AFM and ATR-FTIR analyses. Indeed the increase of both contact surface and functional groups able to form hydrogen bonds and other molecular interactions, allow to a better interface interaction between the two layers.

40|$|Graphene-based {{materials}} have generated tremendous {{interest in the}} past decade. Manipulating their characteristics using wet-chemistry methods holds distinctive value, as it provides a means towards scaling up, while not being limited by yield. The majority of this thesis focuses on the surface functionalization of graphene oxide (GO), which has drawn tremendous attention as a tunable precursor due to its readily chemically manipulable surface and richly functionalized basal plane. Firstly, a room-temperature based method is presented to reduce GO stepwise, with each organic moiety being removed sequentially. Characterization confirms the carbonyl group to be reduced first, while the tertiary alcohol is reduced last, as the optical gap decrease from 3. 5 eV down to 1 eV. This provides greater control over GO, which is an inhomogeneous system, and is the first study to elucidate the order of removal of each functional group. In addition to organically manipulating GO, this thesis also reports a chemical methodology to inorganically functionalize GO and tune its wetting characteristics. A chemical method to covalently attach fluorine atoms {{in the form of}} tertiary alkyl fluorides is reported, and confirmed by MAS 13 C NMR, as two forms of fluorinated graphene oxide (FGO) with varying C/F and C/O ratios are synthesized. Introducing C-F bonds decreases the overall surface free energy, which drastically reduces GO’s wetting behavior, especially in its highly fluorinated form. Ease of solution processing leads to development of sprayable inks that are deposited on a range of porous and non-porous surfaces to impart amphiphobicity. This is the first report that tunes the wetting characteristics of GO. Lastly {{as a part of a}} collaboration with ConocoPhillips, another class of carbon nanomaterials - carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have been inorganically functionalized to repel 30 wt% MEA, a critical solvent in CO 2 recovery. In addition to improving the solution processability of CNTs, composite, homogeneous solutions are created with polysulfones and polyimides to fabricate CNT-polymer nanocomposites that display contact angles greater than 150 o with 30 wt% MEA. This yields materials that are inherently supersolvophobic, instead of simply <b>surface</b> <b>treating</b> polymeric <b>films,</b> while the low density of fluorinated CNTs makes them a better alternative to superhydrophobic polymer materials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{separator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts in PEM fuel cells. Stainless steels are widely used as separator for its good mechanical properties and mass production. However, for a good chemical compatibility, stainless steels need to have high chromium content or surface treatment, which makes separator high cost. Low cost of separator is important for commercial use. In this study, conventional low carbon steel is used as base metal of separator. Low carbon steel is low at cost, but has poor chemical properties for separator. For a good corrosion resistance, low carbon steel needs to be <b>surface</b> <b>treated.</b> To make a uniform <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> layer on low carbon steel, chromium is conventionally electroplated on the steel and thermally nitrided. <b>Surface</b> <b>treated</b> low carbon steel is investigated using microstructure and element analysis tools.

40|$|Surface {{treatment}} of wood {{can be done}} with different coatings, and the choice of the appropriate system of processing depends on several factors, such as technological, aesthetic, economic and ecological. Raising awareness of the need to preserve the living and working environment has had a crucial impact on the increase in the use of natural materials for surface {{treatment of}} wood - oil and wax. The application of oils and waxes allows <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> wood to keep the natural look, while protecting it from different influences, which can cause degradation and deterioration of the final product.

40|$|Abstract Fly ash, an {{inorganic}} alumino silicate {{has been}} used as filler in epoxy matrix, but it reduces the mechanical properties due to its poor dispersion and interfacial bonding with the epoxy matrix. To improve its interfacial bonding with epoxy matrix, surface treatment of fly ash was done using surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate and silane coupling agent glycidoxy propyl trimethoxy silane. An attempt is also made to reduce the particle size of fly ash using high pressure pulverizer. To improve fly ash dispersion in epoxy matrix, the epoxy was modified by mixing with amine containing liquid silicone rubber (ACS). The effect of <b>surface</b> <b>treated</b> fly ash with varying filler loadings from 10 to 40 % weight on the mechanical, morphological and thermal properties of modified epoxy composites was investigated.

For adding urea solution the energy efficiency of NOx removal by DBD is better than without the adding by more than 10 times at Vac ~ 7. 2 kV. The adding water only also shows good result.
