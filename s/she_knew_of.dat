25|$|Madri, {{the second}} wife of Pandu, immolates herself. She {{believes}} she {{is responsible for}} his death, {{as he had been}} cursed with death if he ever had intercourse. He died while performing the forbidden act with Madri; she blamed herself for not rejecting him, as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the curse. Also, in the case of Madri the entire assembly of sages sought to dissuade her from the act, and no religious merit is attached to the fate she chooses against all advice. In the Musala-parvan of the Mahabharata, the four wives of Vasudeva are said to commit sati. Furthermore, as news of Krishna's death reaches Hastinapur, five of his wives choose to burn themselves.|$|E

500|$|The {{species is}} {{referred}} to in Christopher Marlowe's play The Jew of Malta. Iathamore proclaims: [...] "The hat he wears, Judas left under the elder when he hanged himself". Later, the species was probably partially the inspiration for Emily Dickinson's poem beginning [...] "The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants", which depicts a mushroom as the [...] "ultimate betrayer". Dickinson had both a religious and naturalistic background, {{and so it is}} more than likely that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the common name of A.auricula-judae, and of the folklore surrounding Judas's suicide.|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{began to}} {{hitchhike}} on weekends to New York City, {{dressed as a}} man, to visit gay bars since <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> none in Philadelphia, and knew of no other places to go to get [...] "plugged into the gay community." [...] In a 1975 interview, she recalled, [...] "I wore drag because I {{thought that was a}} way to show I was gay. It's changed now, but in the early 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called butch ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!" [...] However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1943, Davis' husband, Arthur Farnsworth, {{collapsed}} {{while walking}} along a Hollywood street and died two days later. An autopsy revealed that his fall had {{been caused by}} a skull fracture he had suffered two weeks earlier. Davis testified before an inquest that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> no event that might have caused the injury. A finding of accidental death was reached. [...] Highly distraught, Davis attempted to withdraw from her next film Mr. Skeffington (1944), but Jack Warner, who had halted production following Farnsworth's death, convinced her to continue.|$|E
2500|$|By January 1953, Franklin had {{reconciled}} her conflicting data, {{concluding that}} both DNA forms had two helices, and {{had started to}} write {{a series of three}} draft manuscripts, two of which included a double helical DNA backbone (see below). Her two A-DNA manuscripts reached Acta Crystallographica in Copenhagen on 6 March 1953, one day before Crick and Watson had completed their model on B-DNA. She must have mailed them while the Cambridge team was building their model, and certainly had written them before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> their work. On 8 July 1953 she modified one of these [...] "in proof" [...] Acta articles, [...] "in light of recent work" [...] by the King's and Cambridge research teams.|$|E
2500|$|Writing with Laura Freider of Purdue University, in 2008 Zittrain {{published}} Spam Works: Evidence from Stock Touts and Corresponding Market Activity, in the Hastings Communications and Entertainment Law Journal {{to document}} the manipulation of stock prices via spam e-mail. They found evidence that [...] "stocks experience a significantly positive return on days prior to heavy touting via spam" [...] and that [...] "prolific spamming greatly affects the trading volume of a targeted stock". Apart from transaction costs, in some circumstances the spammer earned over 4% while the average investor who bought {{on the day of}} receipt of the spam would lose more than 5% if they sold two days later. Frieder said in 2006 that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> no other explanation for their results, but that people do follow the stock tips in their spam e-mail.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 August 1952, Lawrence fainted {{backstage}} {{immediately after}} finishing a Saturday matinee of The King and I. After [...] "a few days at home," [...] wrote Aldrich, she {{was admitted to}} New York-Presbyterian Hospital for tests. Doctors said she was suffering from hepatitis, and she was admitted to a room on the 16th floor. Her former son-in-law, Dr. William G. Cahan, recalled in his 1992 memoir (by then he was a globally recognised medical expert on cancer) what happened next in 1952:She was admitted to New York Hospital [...] Her doctors were puzzled by what was described in the press as [...] "a liver problem," [...] and suspected {{that she might have}} cancer. Hearing this, and without Gertrude's knowledge, her husband consulted me. Not wanting to alarm her by appearing in person (<b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>of</b> course, that by now I was a cancer specialist), I sent some of my colleagues as consultants. They, too, were puzzled, and ordered an exploratory laparotomy (abdominal operation).|$|E
2500|$|Reavis {{claimed to}} have heard rumors of a Peralta {{descendant}} as early as his 1875 arrival in California. [...] It was not until 1877 however that he met the heiress. [...] While traveling on a train, he spotted a young lady who bore {{a striking resemblance to}} the second baroness. [...] After inquiring about her identity and background, and learning <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> the name Maso, Reavis told her that she was most likely the heiress to a large fortune. [...] As the young lady had no papers establishing her identity, it was left to Reavis to find them. [...] The pair exchanged letters with each other until the end of 1882. [...] At that time Reavis visited her in Knights Landing, California, where she worked as a house servant, and proposed marriage. [...] The couple were married in a civil ceremony dated December 31, 1882. [...] Following their marriage, Reavis enrolled his new bride in a convent school to train her in the skills expected of a well-born lady.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were also}} {{multiple}} occurrences of individual Volksdeutsche turning in, chasing down, or blackmailing Jews; such people were condemned as collaborators and {{under threat of}} execution by the Polish resistance. Emmanuel Ringelblum wrote that he saw Polish Blue Police beating Jews and that they participated in street rounds up. But according to Raul Hilberg, [...] "Of all the native police forces in occupied Eastern Europe, those of Poland were least involved in anti-Jewish actions.... They [...] could not join the Germans in major operations against Jews or Polish resistors, lest they be considered traitors by virtually every Polish onlooker." [...] The Poles never surrendered to the Germans {{so there was no}} collaboration on a national governmental level as took place elsewhere in occupied Europe. There also were no Polish SS battalions, though there were SS volunteer battalions from almost all of the Nazi-occupied countries. [...] Attempts to organize Polish SS battalions resulted in immediate, large-scale desertions, and so these attempts were abandoned. Polish Jew, Nechama Tec, an expert on the Holocaust who herself was saved by Polish Catholics, writes that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> no Polish concentration camp guards. In general the machinery of the Holocaust ran with little Polish collaboration, though collaboration did take place on occasion as Yisrael Gutman and Shmuel Krakowski reported in their work, Unequal Victims that a notable number of Poles turned their backs on the Jews, extorted them, and in the rural parts of Poland, peasants joined the Germans in hunting down and killing Jews who escaped from ghettos. They also claim that there were more bystander crimes than those willing to aide the Jews. Nonetheless, Polish citizens (along with Denmark) have the world's highest count of individuals recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem; a list consisting of Gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews from extermination during the Holocaust.|$|E
