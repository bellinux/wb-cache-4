30|$|Finally, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between Colombian cocaine <b>seizures</b> and <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> opium and marijuana by Mexican authorities, using data obtained from the Mexican Ministry of Defense (SEDENA). The results of this analysis are shown in panel C in Table 10 in Appendix. We find no significant correlation between Colombian cocaine <b>seizures</b> and <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> either opium or marijuana. This suggests a reduction in cocaine arriving in Mexico did not coincide with increased <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> other drug cartel transport.|$|R

5|$|A {{few months}} after the Nazi <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> power in Germany in January 1933, Eichmann lost his job due to {{staffing}} cutbacks at Vacuum Oil. The Nazi Party was banned in Austria around the same time. These events were factors in Eichmann's decision to return to Germany.|$|E

From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{aimed to}} assess the localizing value of the initial semiological element in {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy (TLE). Video-EEG-documented <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> 97 adult TLE patients were studied in relation to seizure origin (left versus right; mesial versus extra-mesial). Strikingly, seizures with mesial onset started with very few ictal phenomena, while <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> extra-mesial origin began with a larger variety of ictal elements. Furthermore, following noticeable distributions were observed for the mesial group: (i) aura {{was the most common}} initial ictal phenomenon in the total patient collective, occurring significantly more frequently in mesial than in extra-mesial seizure onset. Aura appeared most often in <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> left mesial origin. (ii) Vocalization presented a trend towards mesial left seizure origin. (iii) Oral automatisms showed a trend towards mesial seizure origin. Following noticeable distribution was observed for the extra-mesial group: In patients without aura, restlessness as initial ictal phenomenon appeared exclusively in <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> extra-mesial right origin. Finally, behavioral arrest showed a trend towards left-sided seizure origin. In conclusion, the initial ictal element may add useful information concerning differentiation <b>of</b> <b>seizure</b> onset in TLE...|$|R
