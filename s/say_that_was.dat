500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E
500|$|In the 35–3 win, {{three of}} England's tries were scored by Chris Oti, {{a player who}} had made a {{reputation}} for himself that season as a speedster on the left wing. A group of boys from the Benedictine school Douai following a tradition at their school games sang the song on his final try, and other spectators around the ground joined in. Since then [...] "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" [...] became a song to sing at England home games, {{in the same way}} that [...] "The Fields of Athenry" [...] is sung in Dublin and [...] "Cwm Rhondda" [...] is sung at Cardiff. It has since become the anthem of the team as in 1991 the result of a plan of the then RFU marketing director Mike Coley for the team to launch a song leading up to that year's Rugby World Cup. He had wanted to use Jerusalem but it was used in the Rugby League cup final that year so the song was changed at short notice to [...] "Swing Low". There were a number of versions recorded including a 'rap' version with Jerry Guscott doing a solo. Needless to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> never released but the version released did reach the top 40 in the UK singles chart during the competition and was then adopted as the England rugby song.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Sophia Peletier {{is a major}} {{incident}} in [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already", largely affecting the themes of the episode. After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears from the barn as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going {{to look back on}} and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, you have to go with it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around {{as it is in the}} comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories." [...] Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence, Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set. Referred to as [...] "Barnageddon" [...] by the writers, Kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating the scene.|$|E

2500|$|According to analysts, the UK government's {{decision}} to finally {{go ahead with}} the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute.

6000|$|Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{a pretty}} serious statement--Trumbull forges his {{evidence}} {{from beginning to}} end. Now, upon my own authority I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> not true. What is a forgery? Consider the evidence that Trumbull has brought forward. When you come to read the speech, as {{you will be able}} to, examine whether the evidence is a forgery from beginning to end. He had the bill or document in his hand like that [holding up a paper]. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a copy of the Toomb's bill,--the amendment offered by Toomb's. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a copy of the bill as it was introduced and went into Judge Douglas's hands. Now, does Judge Douglas <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a forgery? <b>That</b> <b>is</b> one thing Trumbull brought forward. Judge Douglas says he forged it from beginning to end! <b>That</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "beginning," [...] we will say. Does Douglas <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a forgery? Let him say it to-day, and we will have a subsequent examination upon this subject. Trumbull then holds up another document like this, and <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an exact copy of the bill as it came back in the amended form out of Judge Douglas's hands. Does Judge Douglas <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a forgery? Does he say it in his general sweeping charge? Does he say so now? If he does not, then take this Toomb's bill and the bill in the amended form, and it only needs to compare them to see <b>that</b> the provision <b>is</b> in the one and not in the other; it leaves the inference inevitable <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> taken out.|$|R

2500|$|Absent from Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 are {{top-down}} levels, {{which in}} its predecessor symbolized an enemy attack while {{en route to}} a location. [...] When the game's producer Rey Jimenez was asked why they are being excluded, Jimenez responded “People liked them because they were in the original, but I don’t remember hearing anyone <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> their favorite part of the game. It doesn’t have the swinging, you know?” Jimenez also revealed that with Rearmed 2 level progression will be linear instead of allowing the player to pick and choose their path. [...] Players will, however, be able to return to previous levels using newly acquired abilities and weaponry to access areas they were previously unable to.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal called Radwańska [...] "the most tactically sound, subtle {{tennis player}} in the world." [...] Over the years she has been given the nicknames [...] "The Magician", [...] "Ninja" [...] and [...] "The Professor", {{due to the fact}} that she can pull off the most {{difficult}} shots in the game with ease. Radwańska's game is founded on variety, mobility, and a tendency to anticipate her opponent's actions. She often uses this style to construct rallies—either opening the court up for a winner, or prompting a surprised opponent to hit a misplaced return. Her primary weapons include a mixture of slices and lobs, along with her ability to hit the ball at a variety of angles. She also makes use of a disguised drop shot, often swung with the same motion as a normal stroke during a rally. She is also noted for her crouching shots, during which she quickly drops in place to return or redirect a low ball, along with her use of an overhead backhand while on defense. In fact, she is known for having invented her distinctive squat position shot, where she sits so low on her haunches that she can play half-volleys with a horizontal racket. “I’m not sure if I invented it,” says Radwanska, “but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my shot, even if someone else is playing, so it’s nice to hear I can put something new into tennis”.|$|E
