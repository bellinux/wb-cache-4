Hence the short-styled form of the cowslip, when self-fertilised, does not transmit the same form nearly so truly as does that of P. Sinensis. From the long-styled form, always fertilised with its own-form pollen, I raised in the first generation three long-styled plants,--from their seed 53 long-styled grandchildren,--from their seed 4 long-styled great-grandchildren,--from their seed 20 long-styled great-great-grandchildren,--and lastly, from their seed 8 long-styled and 2 short-styled great-great-great-grandchildren. In this last generation short-styled plants appeared {{for the first time}} in the course of the six generations,--the parent long-styled plant which was fertilised with pollen from another plant of the same form being counted as the first generation. Their appearance may be attributed to atavism. From two other long-styled plants, fertilised with their own-form pollen, 72 plants were raised, which consisted of 68 long-styled and 4 short-styled. So that altogether 162 plants were raised from illegitimately fertilised long-styled cowslips, and these consisted of 156 long-styled and 6 short-styled plants.|$|E

Thus, we agreed to include in a new database the remaining questionnaires and construct a sample with 113 observations. Concerning the organisational change we make a distinction of three categories of change. First we analyse changes taking place at the inter-firm level (outsourcing, subcontracting, geographic relocation), followed by changes at the organisational level (deconcentration/decentralisation, reduction of hierarchical levels, introduction of cost and profit centres). The third kind of changes analysed will be those taking place at the workplace level (job enlargement/enrichment, changing character of work, work load). The Portuguese studied companies presents a relative uniform pattern considering the variables social competencies, practical knowledge, responsibility and specialized professional qualifications. ...|$|R
40|$|The results {{presented}} in this article are related to the field of investigation defined inside the European TSER project on "Information Society, Work and Generation of New Forms of Social Exclusion " (<b>SOWING).</b> The thematic center of the project is connected with the question of the relations that exist between the introduction of information technologies (IT) and the changes in the waged labour {{as well as in the}} organisation of work systems. The introduction of these technologies transformed specially the activities on services as well as certain branches, where great changes of the organization of work for the next future assume, which are discussed within the margin of the debate on future forms of work. The tendencies within the occupational structures indicate an individualisation of the insecurities and an opening of the occupational carreers. For these reasons, the development of the occupational carreers is more and more bound to the biographical planning. The institutionalised occupational model is changing very strongly, which in the long term will take to social and cultural changes, not only in the professional life, but also in the private life. ...|$|R
40|$|If {{we take a}} look at {{developments}} on the labour market, we find that the rate of employment stands in a close relationship to the introduction of new technologies and their social and cultural consequences. The immediate effects of new technologies on new forms of work-structures are, in fact, difficult to determine empirically. In order to avoid a strong technological bias in the scientific perspective, it seems important to consider carefully the normative objectives and goals, which are connected with the introduction of IC-technologies. But nevertheless it is difficult to define clearly the causes and the effects of new technologies as well as the technical changes and its social consequences. The intention of the article is to present the concept of social exclusion within the SOWING-project. Of course this concept is embedded in the scientific debate of the Information Society, which has a strong technological focus and represents the discussion of the Western, highly industrialized societies. But nevertheless the empirical findings of the <b>SOWING</b> project come to the general conclusion, that the rise of new forms of social exclusion cannot be considered as the result of the introduction of ICT, but as the result of the normative idea of a more effective and global organized economy. The social consequences of this development depend strongly on the establishment of a democratic procedure, which integrates the concerning social groups. ...|$|R
6000|$|Ludwig junior, Kaiser Ludwig the Bavarian's eldest son, {{was still}} under age when {{appointed}} Kurfurst of Brandenburg in 1323: {{of course he had}} a [...] "STATEHOLDER" [...] (Viceregent, STATTHALTER); then, and afterwards in occasional absences of his, a series of such, Kaiser's Councillors, Burggraf Friedrich IV. among them, had to take some thought of Brandenburg in its new posture.

A difficult problem he, like the other regents and viceregents, must have had; little dreaming that it was intrinsically for a grandson of his own, and long line of grandsons. The name of this temporary Statthalter, the first Hohenzollern who had ever the least concern with Brandenburg, is Burggraf Johann II., eldest Son of our distinguished Muhldorf friend Friedrich IV.; and Grandfather (through another Friedrich) of Burggraf Friedrich VI.,--which last gentleman, as will be seen, did doubtless reap the <b>sowings,</b> good and bad, of all manner of men in Brandenburg. The same Johann II. it was who purchased Plassenburg Castle and Territory (cheap, for money down), where the Family afterwards had its chief residence.

Згідно з загальноприйнятою токсикологічною класифікацією речовин ЕТЛП при внутрішньошлунковому введенні належить до V класу токсичності – практично нешкідливих речовин (ЛД 50 > 5000 мг/кг). Результати макро- та мікроскопічних досліджень внутрішніх органів через 14 днів після одноразового внутрішньошлункового введення ЕТЛП у дозі 5000 мг/кг показали відсутність будь-яких анатомічних та морфологічних порушень у тканинних структурах щурів самців та самок. Розраховане значення ТІ, яке лежить за межами 200, свідчить про високий ступінь безпечності ЕТЛП та його перспективність для медичної практики як ефективного та безпечного коректора білкового обміну з анаболічною дією.

Abstrakt In this study there was determined the absence of toxic effect after a single intragastric administration of EGMS at a dose of 5000 mg / kg to male and female rats. According to the conventional toxicological classification of substances, under the intragastric administration EGMS belongs to class V of toxicity – practically harmless substances (LD 50 > 5000 mg / kg). The results of macro- and microscopic studies of internal organs in 14 days after a single intragastric administration of EGMS at a dose of 5000 mg / kg showed the absence of any anatomical and morphological disorders in tissue structures of male and female rats. The calculated value of TI, which lies beyond 200, indicates a high level of safety of EGMS and its prospectivity for medical practice as an effective and safe corrector of protein metabolism with an anabolic action.

The reason for the rebellion was the coercive introduction of potato cultivation. The government selected the best fertile sections for potatoes from peasant lands. Authorities enforced brutal punishments for the non-fulfillment of the orders and assessed different requisitions. In 1834 unrest flared up in Vyatsky and Vladimir provinces, but it reached its height among the state peasants in 1840-44. Riots appeared simultaneously and they were partly in response to Pavel Kiselyov's reforms of state villages (1837-41). In the provinces of Ural and the lower Volga Region more than 500,000 peasants rose up destroying <b>sowings</b> of potatoes, and thrashing officials. They arbitrarily re-elected wardens, and attacked punitive detachments with weapons. Aside from ethnic Russians, participants in the riots included the Mari population, Chuvashes, Udmurts, Tatars, and Komi. The government sent troops to suppress the riots. In a number of places, peasants were shot. Thousands of rebels were convicted, and exiled into Siberia or forcibly drafted as soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|Overall {{figures for}} the extent of zvenya first appear in the late 1930s. This is presumably because fixed zvenya were then {{becoming}} more widely established. Shorter-lived zvenya {{would have been more}} difficult to keep track of. In 1938 there were 542,200 (fixed) zvenya in the USSR as a whole, to which were attached 12.9 million hectares of <b>sowings,</b> including 5.4 million hectares of grain. [...] Thus fixed zvenya were limited in extent at this stage, especially in grain. In March 1939 a Party congress resolution called for the [...] "wide adoption of zvenya in collective farms". Zvenya thereafter spread rapidly. A survey of mid 1939 showed that 65.6% of investigated collective farms had zvenya, and that 37.4% of their cropped ploughland was assigned to zvenya. [...] In 1945 there were 984,000 in the USSR (but slightly fewer at the beginning of 1950). (These figures, however, greatly overstate the effective numbers of zvenya. They presumably apply to zvenya when set up {{at the beginning of a}} year, but many subsequently disintegrated. In 1949, for example, only 48.8% of zvenya set up in the USSR survived to the end of the harvest.) ...|$|E
50|$|Fully {{fixed or}} {{permanent}} zvenya (of one year's duration or more) were first {{set up in}} individual specialist crops. In May 1933 a central Communist-Party and government resolution recommended that zvenya of 5-7 workers, responsible for all agricultural operations in the year, be widely adopted for sugar-beet. A similar resolution was issued for potatoes and vegetables in June 1933. In cotton, it was argued, the continuous and continually-fluctuating labour demand during the year necessitated a zveno both stable and flexible throughout the year. Labour demand for a 10-hectare plot of cotton varied between 1 and 14 workers in the year. For the sake of stability {{there should be a}} basic skeleton of zvene'voi and skilled workers, and the plot should be fixed for the year. Some cotton zvenya were set up in 1934, and a central resolution for their proliferation was issued in June 1935. Fixed zvenya in flax also began to be set up, for example in Leningrad oblast, where there were in 1937 19,458 flax zvenya, covering 105,000 hectares or about three-quarters of all flax crops. In 1938 about 50,000 flax zvenya were organized in Smolensk oblast {*including 7,500 Stakhanovite}; over two-thirds of all flax <b>sowings</b> were attached to them. A central decree for their promulgation was issued in April 1938.|$|E
5000|$|The {{benefits}} {{derived from}} turnip husbandry are of great magnitude; light soils are cultivated with profit and facility; abundance of food is provided for man and beast; {{the earth is}} turned to the uses {{for which it is}} physically calculated, and by being suitably cleaned with this preparatory crop, a bed is provided for grass seeds, wherein they flourish and prosper with greater vigor than after any other preparation.The first ploughing is given immediately after harvest, or as soon as the wheat seed is finished, either in length or across the field, as circumstances may seem to require. In this state the ground remains till the oat seed is finished, when a second ploughing is given to it, usually in a contrary direction to the first. It is then repeatedly harrowed, often rolled between the harrowings and every particle of root-weeds carefully picked off with the hand; a third ploughing is then bestowed, and the other operations are repeated. In this stage, if the ground has not been very foul, the seed process.The next part of the process is the sowing of the seed; this may be performed by drilling machines of different sizes and constructions, through all acting on the same principle. A machine drawn by a horse in a pair of shafts, sows two drills at a time and answers extremely well, where the ground is flat, and the drills properly made up. The weight of the machine ensures a regularity of sowing hardly to be gained by those of a different size and construction. From two to three pounds of seed are sown upon the acre (2 to 3 kg/hectare), though the smallest of these quantities will give many more plants in ordinary seasons than are necessary; but as the seed is not an expensive article the greater part of farmers incline to sow thick, which both provides against the danger of part of the seed perishing, and gives the young plants an advantage at the outset.Turnips are sown from the beginning to the end of June, but the second and third weeks of the month are, by judicious farmers, accounted the most proper time. Some people have sown as early as May, and with advantage, but these early fields are apt to run to seed before winter, especially if the autumn be favorable to vegetation. As a general rule it may be laid down that the earliest <b>sowings</b> should be on the latest soils; plants on such soils are often long before they make any great progress, and, in the end, may be far behind those in other situations, which were much later sown. The hot turnip plant, indeed, does not thrive rapidly till its roots reach the dung, and the previous nourishment afforded them is often so scanty as to stunt them altogether before they get so far.The first thing to be done in this process is to run a horse-hoe, called a scraper, along the intervals, keeping at such a distance from the young plants that they shall not be injured; this operation destroys all the annual weeds which have sprung up, and leaves the plants standing in regular stripes or rows. The hand hoeing then commences, by which the turnips are all singled out at a distance of from 8-12 inches, and the redundant ones drawn into the spaces between the rows. The singling out of the young plants is an operation of great importance, for an error committed in this process can hardly be afterward rectified. Boys and girls are always employed as hoers; but a steady and trusty man-servant is usually set over them to see that the work is properly executed.In eight or ten days, or such a length of time as circumstances may require, a horse-hoe of a different construction from the scraper is used. This, in fact, is generally a small plough, of the same kind with that commonly wrought, but of smaller dimensions. By this implement, the earth is pared away from the sides of the drills, and a sort of new ridge formed {{in the middle of the}} former interval. The hand-hoers are again set to work, and every weed and superfluous turnip is cut up; afterward the horse-hoe is employed to separate the earth, which it formerly threw into the furrows, and lay it back to the sides of the drills. On dry lands this is done by the scraper, but where the least tendency to moisture prevails, the small plough is used, in order that the furrows may be perfectly cleaned out. This latter mode, indeed, is very generally practiced.|$|E
