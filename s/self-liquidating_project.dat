By employing people directly, public works put purchasing power {{into the hands of}} those who will spend money and stimulate business. A third way is by reducing the cost of living and making money buy more, a fourth way is by offsetting the lack of purchasing power caused by over-saving. The fifth way lies in the curtailment of public construction in time of boom so that the height of the boom will be lowered and the amount of adjustment needed in the ensuing depression lessened. Before public works can effectively bring recovery certain conditions are necessary: Projects must consist of regular public work and not "made" or "relief" work. Heavy construction is generally recommended although some lighter construction work and non- construction work is permitted. Financing of the public works programs must be of borrowing or a reserve fund, and Federal aid to cities and states is necessary; <b>self-liquidating</b> <b>projects</b> are to be avoided. Conditions of employment must be favorable. Wages must be standard; hours sufficient to enable workers to earn almost as much as in normal private employment, workers should be hired through public employment exchanges, work should be adapted to the aptitudes of previous training of tax seekers of employment. Efficiency of the workers is necessary. The proper timing of the expansion or curtailment of public works is essential. The proper time to begin construction seems to be just after a certain amount of liquidation has occurred and before the cumulative forces of depression have grown {{to such an extent that}} there is widespread unemployment. Contraction of public construction should come when prices have risen too high in comparison with other years, credit conditions are stringent, overtime prevails in industry, and costs are high. To be able to effect proper timing there must be advance planning of public works programs, the coordination of public construction agencies, a single public works agency, and international cooperation. The main criticisms of the theory relate to the diversion of money from private business, increased taxes, waste in public work, and the question of occupational shifts. Such criticisms have been answered by public works theorists. Public works expansion in time of depression is desirable for reasons not related to the recovery of business. Idle men, machinery, plants, and money mean waste if not utilized. Savings in construction costs arise from lower prices of materials, lower borrowing charges, lower contractors' bids, and tne greater efficiency of workers. Moreover, public work is preferable to the dole. The New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt gave the theory of public works as a recovery measure a real chance to operate. In the Public Works Administration program the theory was almost embodied in its entirety. In the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Civil Works Administration, the Emergency Work Relief program and the Works Progress Administration programs some of the conditions considered essential to the successful working of the theory were present but several were absent. The FERA improved the public works programs of the cities and states and rendered financial assistance. The program as a whole, however, aimed too much at "relief". Projects were sometimes of questionable value. Earnings of workers were inadequate. The decentralized administrative organization was weak in many respects. The EWR improved the nature of the early FERA. The CWA was a better program than the FERA and EWR. Projects were of a more permanent and useful nature and were more diversified. Earnings at first were higher. The centralized administrative organization worked well, A great number of the unemployed were absorbed and business was stimulated to a noticeable degree. The program was less of the "relief" type as employees did not need to have relief status, and it aimed decidedly at stimulating business as well as relieving distress from unemployment. The WPA was in general a better program than the CWA. It profited from the mistakes of the latter, the FERA, and the EWR, The projects were planned better and more permanent as well as greatly diversified. Earnings, however, were inadequate, and this fact, along with the requirement of relief status for employees, placed the program in the glorified "relief" class. The PWA stood in marked contrast to the other New Deal public works programs. In it was embodied the closest approximation to the ideal public works program advocated by public works theorists that this country ever witnessed. The goal of the program was the recovery of business through the {{stimulation of}} the capital goods industries. The projects were of the heavy construction type which involved a lot of indirect employment - for every two men employed at the construction site five were employed providing materials and transporting them. Moreover, these projects were permanent and useful. The loans and grants met a great need of cities and states. The conditions of employment were excellent. Public employment exchanges were utilized, wages were standard. Hours were almost those prevailing in private industry. Workers were efficient and there was no relief status requirement. The administrative organization, at first too centralized, later represented a good balance between extreme centralization and extreme decentralization. If the PWA had only been put into operation on a larger scale, the recovery of business might have come sooner than it did. It is difficult to state with any great accuracy the relation of government spending to the recovery and recession of business 1933 - 1937. Studies by the economist Arthur D. Gayer have led to the conclusion that the rise in national income 1934 - 1937 could be imputed almost entirely to government spending. This conclusion has been reached by the economist Joseph Schumpeter and also by the seven Harvard and Tufts economists. It does not seem illogical to connect the increase in national income with the recovery of business. The increase in business deposits has been taken by Dr. Lauchlin Currie as indication of the importance of government spending in the recovery of business. Dr. Currie saw that the income of business from the sale of its products exceeded the outgo in the form of wages, dividends, and other payments to factors of production, and concluded that the source must have been the net-income-increasing expenditures of the government. The seven Harvard and Tufts economists stressed a valuable contribution of government spending to recovery. They said that such spending stimulated expenditures by manufacturing and mining concerns. The recession of the fall of 1937 was caused immediately by the curtailment of government spending early in 1937, The basic cause, however, was the failure of business spending to occur in a sufficient enough degree to offset the drop in government spending. The causes for the failure of business to spend have been attributed by eminent economists to the undermining of business confidence oy the Federal Government, and the lack of outlet for investment funds. Facts have pointed to an excess of savings so that the income of business does not equal the outgo. This recession brought a change in the theory of public works as a recovery measure. If it is a fact that private business spending is necessary for the maintenance of the economic good health of the United States and forces prevail which deter such spending, the Federal Government with the aid of the city and state governments must spend. The role of public works changes from an intermittent one to a permanent one. If, however, private business spending again occurs so as to make unnecessary permanent government spending, the role of public works can again be as it was when Shillady, Hard, Mallery and other public works theorists of the 20 's wrote - an instrument in stimulating recovery from depressions. Our present economic system seems to be inherently unstable and private business is subject to periodic depressions from the morass of waich government spending must rescue it. [URL]...|$|R
