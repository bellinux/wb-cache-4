Now only one of the two modules is operational and has a capacity of 4.5 million tonnes/year or , 1 million tonnes larger due to an investment program from 1999 - 2000. The facility is connected by pipeline to virtually all of the oil fields in Romania by an extensive pipe network and to the Port of Constanţa by a pipeline with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes/day.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} about <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> from {{the construction industry}} which are {{being used by the}} company Bostads AB Mimer (Mimer), owned by the municipality Västerås in Sweden. The company owns apartments and houses around the city. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to do a simplified risk assessment of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> from a health and  environmental point. The report also gives suggestions of substitutional products. The thesis work consists of a literature study, an analysis of how other companies within the housing sector are working with <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> and a case study, in addition to the simplified risk assessment. The case study contains a selection of Mimer's <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> In order to succeed with the simplified risk assessment, the <b>chemical</b> <b>product’s</b> risks and hazards has been identified through safety data sheets (SDS). Different aspects have been taken into account in the simplified risk assessment. The selection of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> were made after existence frequency and legislative product labeling. The report's results gave 16 selected <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> that are risk assessed. Of the 16 <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> eight products have a high risk score from a heath point. Suggestions of less hazardous <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> are given to nine <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> The essay's conclusions are that some of the selected <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> are hazardous to the health and the environment, due to their chemical substances. The staff at Mimer's has a high frequency of use of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> in general. Most of the other companies in the housing sector that  were investigated in the analysis, had a systematic work on chemicals...|$|R

The use of the other single <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> is also correlated to the performance of the treatment process, where, for example the better the quality of the final product (i.e. treated/filtered water), the lower the cost with the rest of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> namely hexafluorosilicic acid, chlorine and calcium oxide.|$|R
