The control allocator uses the combustion engine and the four mechanical disc brakes to compensate any understeering or oversteering behaviour.

40|$|Active front {{steering}} (AFS) is an emerging technology {{to improve the}} vehicle cornering stability by introducing an additional small steering angle to the driver’s input. This paper proposes an AFS system with a variable gear ratio steering (VGRS) actuator which is controlled by using the sliding mode control (SMC) strategy to improve the cornering stability of vehicles. In the design of an AFS system, different sensors are considered to measure the vehicle state, and the mechanism of the AFS system is also modelled in detail. Moreover, {{in order to improve}} the cornering stability of vehicles, two dependent objectives, namely sideslip angle and yaw rate, are considered together in the design of SMC strategy. By evaluating the cornering performance, <b>Sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dwell</b> and accident avoidance tests are conducted, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed SMC strategy is capable of improving the cornering stability of vehicles in practice...|$|E

This manoeuvre is used in a test developed by the NHTSA, designed to certificate electronic stability control systems in light vehicles. The test is used in legislations as well as in consumer tests all over the globe. The SWD manoeuvre was designed using test vehicles on a test track and experimentally validated. The paper at hand uses optimal control theory to theoretically justify the use of the SWD manoeuvre to produce a severe lateral motion and over-steering based on steering input. It is shown that a manoeuvre similar to the SWD manoeuvre can be obtained from an optimal control problem using simple vehicle dynamics models. The optimal control method is further used to analyse the manoeuvre's robustness with respect to vehicle dimensions and tyre properties. It is shown that the manoeuvre is robust in dimensions, which theoretically motivates its application for various sizes of vehicles...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} {{vibration}} experiments {{have been conducted}} {{in the field of}} automotive, railway transportation, aerospace and other applications where electronics face dynamic mechanical loads. The tests were used to either qualify components or systems, analyse interconnect reliability or to research the fatigue behaviour of the involved interconnect materials. Dominant investigation has been in solder alloys. Field conditions of the named applications usually introduce coupled mechanical and thermal loads to electronics systems. Great efforts have been made to enable these conditions in the experimental environment and extract reasonable reliability results. However, experimental methodologies considering coupled vibration and temperature loads for qualification purpose, accelerated reliability testing or fatigue analysis lack for well-defined load conditions, ability of in-situ load measurement or unwanted behaviour of the experimental setup (e. g. deflection change or rigging due to temperature changes). In recent work we introduce an experimental setup which overcomes these drawbacks. A test vehicle and an associated mount as well as an in-situ measurement approach were developed and tested. This novel setup offers test vehicle clamping options which represent system conditions including rigging for qualification purposes or enable fatigue research which rely on constant rigging-free load conditions. The specimen is a standard PCB with mounted SMT components. Typically vibration will be done as a <b>sine</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>with</b> frequencies in the range of 50 Hz… 1 kHz. The setup may be used for isothermal vibration experiments at room, lower or higher temperatures (e. g. - 40 °C or 125 °C) but it enables vibrations experiments at temperature cycling conditions as well. A low weight mount and PCB design targeting temperature cycling with reasonable gradients of about 1 K/min. Combined with integrated PCB heaters even local component heating is enabled. Dependent on the temperature condition either optical or capacitive contact-free in-situ displacement or deflection measurements can be utilised. The latter is very important for small or low weight specimens since acceleration sensors usually add to much mass and strain gages are difficult to mount.

40|$|The leading {{automotive}} {{manufacturers have}} attempted to apply active brake systems to passenger and commercial vehicles. The ESC (electronic stability control) system helps drivers to maintain directional stability and control over steering and under steering. Previous studies on passenger vehicle ESC systems have mainly dealt with the control algorithm and evaluation results. In addition, few papers have considered bus and commercial ESC systems. Therefore, this study proposed a method for estimating the desired yaw rate using the already developed ESC system. The desired yaw rate is estimated from the steering wheel angle, vehicle speed, and vehicle parameters. This paper {{presents the results of}} a <b>sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>dwell</b> evaluation analysis of a large bus equipped with an ESC system.

The control synthesis is conducted on a nonlinear model in which tire-road interactions are modeled using Pacejka's magic formula. Using sector approximation, a TS fuzzy model is obtained. It is able to handle explicitly the nonlinear Pacejka lateral tire forces including the decreasing or saturated region. The controller acts through the steering of the front wheels and the differential braking torque generation. The computation of the controller {{takes into account the}} constraints that the trajectories of the controlled vehicle remain inside an invariant set. This is achieved using quadratic boundedness theory and Lyapunov stability. Some design parameters can be adjusted to handle the trade-off between safety constraints and comfort specifications. The solution to the associated problem is obtained using Linear and Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (LMI-BMI) methods.

40|$|Abstract: The current {{test methods}} are {{insufficient}} {{to evaluate and}} ensure the safety and reliability of vehicle system for all possible dynamic situation including the worst case such as rollover, spin-out and so on. Although the known NHTSA <b>Sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>dwell</b> steering maneuvers are applied for the vehicle performance assessment, they aren't enough to estimate other possible worst case scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial for us to verify the various worst cases including the existing severe steering maneuvers. This paper includes useful worst case based upon the existing worst case scenarios mentioned above and worst case evaluation for vehicle dynamic controller in simulation basis and UCC HILS. The only human steering angle is selected as a design parameter here and optimized to maximize the index function to be {{expressed in terms of}} both yaw rate and side slip angle. The obtained scenarios were enough to generate the worst case to meet NHTSA worst case definition. It has been concluded that the new procedure in this paper is adequate to create other feasible worst case scenarios for a vehicle dynamic control system...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes how {{the test}} case <b>Sine</b> <b>With</b> <b>Dwell</b> could be {{modified}} {{for the evaluation}} of yaw stability of heavy vehicles. The test case was originally proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for evaluation of Electronic Stability Programs (ESP) performance during an oversteer situation on high friction. The modified test case presented here accounts for the heavy vehicle dynamics through three main modifications of the original test case. Firstly, to avoid rollover, the test case is performed on low friction. Secondly, to avoid excess understeer behaviour, the steering input frequency is lowered compared to the original test. Thirdly, to account for response times, the responsiveness and stability criteria are modified. These modifications are derived from hardware in the loop simulations and field tests for different tractor/truck and trailer combinations. By using the modified responsiveness and stability criteria it was shown that the tested ESP system could be objectively evaluated. A clear improvement on vehicle stability was seen in the results when ESP was used...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{hazardous}} motions of heavy trucks is lateral instability {{which can be}} defined as deviation from driver intended path due to skidding of the vehicle. Lateral instability is associated with 9 % of heavy trucks involved in traffic accidents, which represents a considerable figure when translated to real accidents. For instance in the US, this can be translated into about 36000 traffic accidents each year which could have been mitigated or even prevented. The objective of the research presented in this thesis is to develop reality-based lateral stability control strategies for heavy trucks. By reality-based it is meant that the control strategy should be designed to reduce heavy trucks accidents due to lateral instability and should be evaluated in the same scope. To fulfill this objective, an analysis of heavy truck accidents based on the Large Truck Crash Causation Study database was conducted. Accident scenarios were studied and a category of critical maneuvers causing loss of control was identified. Based on the accident analysis results, relevant existing test maneuvers were adapted for trucks and compared; the <b>sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>dwell</b> maneuver was selected as the most suitable test for evaluation of lateral stability of heavy trucks. Furthermore, some performance measures were proposed based on a series of field tests. As the first insight into the development of lateral stability control strategies for heavy trucks, Rear Axle Steering (RAS) for a single unit truck was investigated. It was shown that by RAS, considerable safety benefits and enhancement in driver comfort can be gained...|$|E
40|$|Active {{anti-roll}} bars have recently found greater acceptance among premium car manufacturers and optimal {{application of this}} technology has emerged as an important field of research. This thesis investigates the potential of implementing active {{anti-roll bars}} in a passenger vehicle {{with the purpose of}} increasing customer value. For active anti-roll bars, customer value is defined in terms of vehicle’s ride comfort and handling performance. The objective with this thesis is to demonstrate this value through development of a control algorithm that can reflect the potential improvement in ride comfort and handling. A vehicle with passive anti-roll bars is simulated for different manoeuvres to identify the potential and establish a reference {{for the development of a}} control algorithm and for the performance of active anti-roll bars. While ride is evaluated using single-sided cosine wave and single-sided ramps, handling is evaluated using standardized constant radius, frequency response and <b>sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>dwell</b> manoeuvres. The control strategy developed implements a combination of sliding mode control, feed forward and PI-controllers. Simulations with active anti-roll bars showed significant improvement in ride and handling performance in comparison to passive anti-roll bars. In ride comfort, the biggest benefit was seen in the ability to increase roll damping and isolating low frequency road excitations. For handling, most significant benefits are through the system’s ability of changing the understeer behaviour of the vehicle and improving the handling stability in transient manoeuvres. Improvement in the roll reduction capability during steady state cornering is also substantial. In conclusion, active anti-roll bars are undoubtedly capable of improving both ride comfort and handling performance of a vehicle. Although the trade-off between ride and handling performance is significantly less, balance in requirements is critical to utilise the full potential of active anti-roll bars. With a more comprehensive control strategy, they also enable the vehicle to exhibit different driving characteristics without the need for changing any additional hardware...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to compare}} the {{potential}} in handling and performance between a brake based Electronic Stability Control system (ESC) with a system that integrates an active differential with ESC. Two control strategies that integrate an active differential and ESC are presented for two types of active differentials. The differentials are the Electronic Limited Slip Differential (eLSD) and the Direction Sensitive Locking Differential (DSLD). The control strategies are developed {{and the results are}} evaluated using a simulation model that is implemented in Simulink. They tested for one driving case, the open loop <b>sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>dwell</b> maneuver. The different solutions are evaluated mainly with regard to three criteria that are specified in the American National Highway Traffic Safety Administration FMVSS 126 law requirement (NTHSA, 2007). They are also evaluated with respect to the yaw rate vs. steering wheel angle response, vehicle speed during the maneuver and vehicle trajectory. All tests were performed without any time delays simulated for any actuator. The results show only a small difference between a normal ESC and the integrated solutions. The integrated system with an eLSD however does perform better than ESC overall but by a small margin. Because of the small difference in results from the first simulations time delays are implemented for a second round of simulations that only compare the best integrated solution (ESC + eLSD) to only ESC. This is done to evaluate how much of an effect the time delays have on the end results. After the second round of simulations the results do indeed differ more in favor of the integrated system with the eLSD compared to only ESC. The yaw rate respond better to steering wheel inputs with smaller overshoots and more speed is conserved through the maneuver. This shows that the simulation model might not be complete enough to evaluate the performance difference between those systems and implementing time delays more extensively for all actuators is a recommendation for future work...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master's Thesis was to, through simulations, {{evaluate}} {{the advantages of the}} Direction Sensitive Locking Differential, DSLD, in various driving situations. The purpose was also to simulate situations that indicates possible risks of a mechanically locked differential. A vehicle model with chassis and drivetrain and a driver model that can follow a predefined path and given speed curves were developed in MATLAB/Simulink. Then a number of driving situations were simulated in MATLAB/Simulink showing different effects of the DSLD and how it affected the performance and maneuverability of the vehicle. The results of the simulations show that the DSLD preferably is positioned on the front axle in a four wheel driven vehicle and the DSLD makes the largest dierence in cornering ability and acceleration in a front wheel driven vehicle. The DSLD will both contribute to produce more power/grip/yaw when accelerating in corners as well as it will reduce yaw motion when in oversteered situations, such as the <b>Sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dwell.</b> No problems has been shown with the DSLD remaining locked in the a prefered direction. It has followed the quickest reactions of the driver and the fastest movements of the vehicle without any problems. The worst case simulation showed that even when the DSLD was forced to lock in the wrong direction, it wasn't any notable loss in cornering ability when unlocking it with a short brake activation. What needs to be developed further is the interactions and cooperation between the DSLD and the brake, chassis and powertrain/engine control and the other systems that already exists in a vehicle. By developing these interactions the maximum effect of the differential can be achieved and the risk that the systems will work against each other will be reduced. The main thing that is needed is a signal from the DSLD to the other systems with the information whether and how the differential is locked and then the other systems will have to take that into account...|$|E

40|$|Vehicle {{handling}} {{evaluation is}} {{a crucial part of}} the vehicle development process. The evaluation can be done in two ways, subjectively; by expert test drivers or objectively; by performing repeatable standard manoeuvres usually by steering robots. Subjective testing is resource intensive as prototypes need to be built. Objective testing is less so, as it can be performed in a virtual environment in conjunction with physical testing. In an e˙ort to reduce resources and time used in vehicle development, manufacturers are looking to objective testing to assess vehicle behaviour. Vehicle handling testing in winter strongly relies on subjective testing. This thesis aims to investigate into the usage of objective test strategy to assess vehicle handling behaviour in winter conditions. Manoeuvres and metrics are defined for summer con-ditions, but not for winter. Hence the goal was to define new or modified metrics and manoeuvres custom to winter testing. Data from an objective winter test was obtained and analysed. The manoeuvres used were constant radius (CR), frequency response (FR), <b>sine</b> <b>with</b> <b>dwell</b> (SWD) and throt-tle release in turn (TRIT). The manoeuvres were compared to public standards from the International Organization for Standards (ISO) and National Highway Traÿc Safety Administration (NHTSA) as well as the vehicle manufacturer standards. The data from a reference vehicle is compared to that from three configuration vehicles, one without anti-roll bar in the front, one without rear anti-roll bar and a standard. The di˙erence in the signals between reference and configuration vehicles is compared to the spread in data of the reference vehicle to determine the signal-to-noise ratio in the manoeuvres. The spread of reference data is analysed to determine the distribu-tion and to di˙erentiate between the two test days. To replicate vehicle behaviour in simulation, winter tyre models using brush and Magic Formula model equations were investigated. These were used in a bicycle and a VI-CarRealTime model. The perfor-mance of these are checked and compared. The bicycle model is used in an unscented Kalman filter, to investigate potential improvements in signal processing. The metrics obtained from the study of standards are checked for robustness in winter conditions by analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. The procedure of selection of metrics from the ANOVA results is explained. Further, the manoeuvres are modified virtually in VI-CarRealTime, from the results of a sensitivity analysis. The di˙erence in metrics between reference and configuration vehicles is maximized. The final results of the thesis were; a test plan with modified manoeuvres and a set of robust metrics. Also containing important information to aid in the execution of the tests. The conclusions drawn were that the noise in winter testing is high, but the di˙erence between vehicles is statistically significant for some robust metrics. The metrics related to yaw rate were in general more robust. Open-loop throttle and steering control in manoeuvres should be avoided as far as possible. A bicycle model is not complex enough to represent vehicle behaviour at high slip angles. Performance increase of a UKF is not justified as to the e˙ort involved...|$|E

40|$|The European {{aircraft}} industry is constantly {{calling for a}} reduction in the testing time of new aircraft without diminishing the accuracy of the data. As a consequence, substantial changes in the testing strategy of ground vibration tests (GVTs), were proposed and applied during {{the last couple of years}} (Fargette et al., Tasks for improvements in ground vibration testing of large aircraft, in: Proc. of IFASD, CASA/AIAE, 2001, pp. 121 - 133; G. Gloth, et al., Sound and Vibration 35 (11) (2001) 14 - 18). The basic idea is to combine the benefits of the very reliable but time-consuming phase resonance method (<b>sine</b> <b>dwell)</b> <b>with</b> the application of phase separation techniques to data stemming from broad-band excitation at various excitation points. The authors recommend the use of swept-sine excitation which provides a high excitation level compared to random excitation and a short testing time compared to stepped-sine excitation. The modes of the structure are identified from the resulting frequency response functions (FRFs) by means of phase separation techniques in parallel to the on-going measurement. In the practice of modal testing it is often observed that structures do not behave in a perfectly linear manner. This article investigates the influence of non-linear structural dynamics behaviour on the measurement results. An expansion of the test concept of swept-sine excitation is proposed which introduces a combined approach for linearity checks as well. The plotting of modal parameters like the eigenfrequency as a function of the excitation level is the manner in which non-linear phenomena in GVTs are presently explored. Traditionally these linearity functions are produced by harmonically exciting one single normal mode on different levels of excitation. The goal to extract as much information as possible from the FRF data can be complemented by computing plots of amplitude-dependent modal parameters for modes which have been identified at various excitation levels during the swept-sine testing, depending on the excitation point and the exciter force. The article expounds how the excitation level can be determined in the case of swept-sine excitation. It gives examples of linearity plots from numerical simulations and complex, large aerospace structures. The plots are compared with curves that stem from the phase resonance testing...|$|R
