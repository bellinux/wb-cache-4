500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime tax increase in American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, <b>standard</b> <b>deduction,</b> and earned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} {{sometimes}} partial deduction produces poor program specializations {{because of its}} limited ability in (i) dealing with conjunctions of recursively defined predicates, (ii) combining partial evaluations of alternative computations, and (iii) taking into account unification failures. We propose to extend the <b>standard</b> partial <b>deduction</b> technique by using versions of the definition rule and the folding rule which allow us to specialize predicates defined by disjunctions of conjunctions of goals. We also consider a case split rule {{to take into account}} unification failures. Moreover, in order to perform program specialization via partial deduction in an automatic way, we propose a transformation strategy which takes as parameters suitable substrategies for directing the application of every transformation rule. Finally, we show through two examples that our partial deduction technique is superior to <b>standard</b> partial <b>deduction,</b> The first example refers to the automatic derivation of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching algorithm, and the second example refers to the construction of a parser for a given regular expression. In both examples, the specialized programs are derived starting from naive, non-deterministic initial programs, whereas <b>standard</b> partial <b>deduction</b> can derive similar specialized programs only when complex, deterministic initial programs are provided...|$|R
40|$|In many African countries, {{the amount}} of {{personal}} deduction for income tax purposes increases with the taxpayer's income. At first glance, this appears to give larger tax breaks to the rich than to the poor. On closer examination, this notion {{turns out to be}} false. As this paper shows, each tax system with"income dependent tax deductions"(IDTDs) is fully equivalent to a particular conventional progressive tax system with <b>standard</b> <b>deductions.</b> One implication for comparative tax research is that the tax schedule of a country that uses IDTDs should not be compared directly with a conventional tax schedule in another country. Existing cross-country work on tax deductions and marginal tax rates generally fails to recognize that IDTDs invalidate a straightforward comparison. To make the two systems comparable, a transformation like the one suggested in this paper is needed.

Ernest Dumas of the Arkansas Times, a consistent Huckabee critic, responded most of the tax cuts were small deductions and exemptions initiated by the state legislature, that the broad-based tax cut was proposed by his predecessor and Huckabee was [...] "the biggest taxer and spender in Arkansas history."

2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{there have been}} two major tax reforms in Norway. The first, the tax reform of 1992, was a {{pervasive}} and principle based reform, inline with the international trend of broader tax base and lower rates. Corporate taxation was designed so that the taxable profit should correspond to the actual budget surplus. [...] This meant, among other things that different industries, forms of ownership, financing methods and investment were treated equally (neutrality) and that revenues and related expenditures were subject to the same tax rate. In the personal income tax, a clearer distinction between labour income and investment income was introduced (split - a dual income tax system). Ordinary income, income less <b>standard</b> <b>deductions</b> and deductible expenses, was taxes at a flat rate of 28%. On personal income, income from work and pensions, there were in addition levied social security contributions and surtax. To avoid that income that was taxed at the corporate level also were taxed at the individual level (double taxation), the imputation tax credit for dividends and treasury system gains was introduced.|$|R

Not for profit organisations will find their taxation environment will change. Governments are reluctant to permit exemptions to a GST style arrangements.
