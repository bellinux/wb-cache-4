5000|$|Most Laserdisc {{players were}} {{required}} {{the user to}} manually turn the disc over to play the other side. A number of players (all diode laser based) were made that were capable of playing both <b>sides</b> of the <b>disc</b> automatically; {{at the end of}} the first side, or at the viewer's command, the machine would reverse the direction of the disc's rotation, simultaneously moving the laser pickup head to the other <b>side</b> of the <b>disc,</b> and then initiate playback. Since LD's are made up of two single <b>sided</b> <b>discs</b> glued together, the auto-reverse player would center each <b>disc</b> <b>side</b> individually. Laserdisc players used either a simple U-shaped reversing mechanism, known as [...] "Epsilon Turn", or technique known as [...] "Gamma Turn", where the player physically rotated the laser reading head ° as it moved from one <b>side</b> of the <b>disc</b> to the other, ensuring that the laser retained the same playback orientation on both <b>sides</b> of the <b>disc.</b> Some players even had twin laser reading circuits to eliminate excessive servos.|$|R

25|$|There are {{two types}} of hybrid formats which contain {{standard}} DVD-Video format video for playback in regular DVD players, and HD DVD video for playback in high definition on HD DVD players. The Combo disc is a dual <b>sided</b> <b>disc</b> with one <b>side</b> DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a single <b>sided</b> <b>disc</b> that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf space management easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. The average consumer does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home DVD player can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD DVD player can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|R

5000|$|Ferredoxin-Thioredoxin Reductase is an α-β {{heterodimer}} {{of approximately}} 30 kDa. FTR structure across different plant species include a conserved catalytic β subunit and a variable α subunit. The structure of FTR from Synechocystis sp.

One side of the cluster center contains redox-active disulfide bonds that reduce Thioredoxin while the opposite docks with reduced Ferredoxin. This two <b>sided</b> <b>disc</b> structure allows FTR to simultaneously interact with Thioredoxin and Ferredoxin.|$|R

40|$|Photospheric radius {{expansion}} (PRE) bursts {{have already}} been used to constrain the masses and radii of neutron stars. RXTE observed three PRE bursts in 4 U 1746 - 37, all with low touchdown fluxes. We discuss here the possibility of low mass neutron star in 4 U 1746 - 37 because the Eddington luminosity depends on stellar mass. With typical values of hydrogen mass fraction and color correction factor, a Monte-Carlo simulation was applied to constrain the mass and radius of neutron star in 4 U 1746 - 37. 4 U 1746 - 37 has a high inclination angle. Two geometric effects, {{the reflection of the}} far <b>side</b> accretion <b>disc</b> and the obscuration of the near <b>side</b> accretion <b>disc</b> have also been included in the mass and radius constraints of 4 U 1746 - 37.
