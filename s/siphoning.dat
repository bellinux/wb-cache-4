40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>siphon</b> browsing on the feeding behaviour {{and growth of}} Macoma balthica, a deposit-feeding bivalve, was studied in three manipulative experiments. Browsing was simulated by removing part of the inhalant <b>siphon</b> with scissors, or studied by exposing the bivalves to shrimps (Crangon crangon). Smaller <b>siphons</b> resulted in a reduction of the sediment surface area that could be grazed, {{and a decrease in}} <b>siphon</b> activity in M. balthica. Disturbance of the <b>siphons</b> by shrimps also reduced <b>siphon</b> activity. <b>Siphons</b> were reduced in size in the presence of shrimps. Immunological analyses of the stomachs of C. crangon identified this species as a consumer of <b>siphon</b> tips. Growth of M. balthica was negatively influenced by <b>siphon</b> browsing, probably due to three interactive factors: extra energy needed for <b>siphon</b> regeneration, less time available for feeding, and a smaller area from which to collect food. Burying depth was reduced in M. balthica with smaller <b>siphons.</b> However, individuals with similar <b>siphon</b> size were buried less deep in the sediment when not exposed to <b>siphon</b> browsing, suggesting an immediate response to absence of browsers...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>siphon</b> weight {{limits the}} {{elongation}} of the <b>siphon</b> of deposit-feeding benthic bivalves under natural conditions. Were {{this to be}} so, it would imply that foraging and predator avoidance place conflicting demands on these animals, since {{an increase in the}} feeding radius on the surface would be associated with a decrease in the burying depth, and vice versa. The paper presents methods with which to measure <b>siphon</b> length and equations to transform <b>siphon</b> weight to <b>siphon</b> length in two benthic bivalves, Scrobicularia plana and Macoma balthica. Relatively heavy <b>siphons</b> are longer, but also thicker, than lightweight ones. We conclude that most individual bivalves stretch their <b>siphons</b> fully while feeding. However, bivalves with heavy <b>siphons</b> keep part of the <b>siphon</b> in reserve within the shell. <b>Siphon</b> cropping therefore results in an immediate reduction in <b>siphon</b> length, unless the <b>siphon</b> is heavy and a reserve is available. The feeding radius of M. balthica and S. plana is a linear function of shell size. S. plana use half of their <b>siphon</b> length to feed on the surface and the other half to bury themselves, but if the <b>siphon</b> weight is below average, the proportion extended over the surface decreases with <b>siphon</b> size. However, among the animals with a short <b>siphon,</b> those with a good body condition take no risks and live as deeply as possible. A comparison between species reveals that the weight of the extended inhalant <b>siphon</b> per cm amounts, on average, to 0. 6 % of the total body weight...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{numerical}} simulation study for water conveyance of inverted <b>siphon</b> on water security {{is of great}} significance. The inverted <b>siphon</b> is thin-walled concrete structure, and cracks will appear according to temperature loads. Generally speaking, the temperature difference between {{the internal and external}} and the basic difference of temperature are considered as the main factors influencing the cracks. Static analysis of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure is the foundation of design and construction, includes the calculation and analysis of stress and strain of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure. The stress and strain of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure not only are the index of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure rigidity, but also are the basis of identifying whether the inverted <b>siphon</b> structural damage occur. Using the basic theories of temperature and stress field of concrete, this paper adopts 3 d finite element to simulate and calculate Shaba inverted <b>siphon,</b> and gets stress and deformation distribution of inverted <b>siphon</b> during operation period. The results show that inverted <b>siphon</b> structure is economic and reasonable, can meet the stiffness requirement, and can provide beneficial reference to the design and construction for other inverted <b>siphon</b> structure.

50|$|A <b>siphon</b> {{spillway}} in a dam {{is usually}} not technically a <b>siphon</b> as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels.

In operation, a <b>siphon</b> spillway is considered to be 'pipe flow' or 'closed duct flow'. A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway whereas a <b>siphon</b> flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet.

40|$|AbstractAscidians have {{powerful}} capacities for regeneration but {{the underlying}} mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examine oral <b>siphon</b> regeneration in the solitary ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Following amputation, the oral <b>siphon</b> rapidly reforms oral pigment organs (OPO) at its distal margin prior to slower regeneration of proximal <b>siphon</b> parts. The early stages of oral <b>siphon</b> reformation include cell proliferation and re-growth of the <b>siphon</b> nerves, although the neural complex (adult brain and associated organs) is not required for regeneration. Young animals reform OPO more rapidly after amputation than old animals indicating that regeneration is age dependent. UV irradiation, microcautery, and cultured <b>siphon</b> explant experiments indicate that OPOs are replaced as independent units based on local differentiation of progenitor cells within the <b>siphon,</b> rather than by cell migration from a distant source in the body. The typical pattern of eight OPOs and <b>siphon</b> lobes is restored with fidelity after distal amputation of the oral <b>siphon,</b> but as many as 16 OPOs and lobes can be reformed following proximal amputation near the <b>siphon</b> base. Thus, the pattern of OPO regeneration is determined by cues positioned along the proximal distal axis of the oral <b>siphon.</b> A model is presented in which columns of <b>siphon</b> tissue along the proximal–distal axis below pre-existing OPO are responsible for reproducing the normal OPO pattern during regeneration. This study reveals previously unknown principles of oral <b>siphon</b> and OPO regeneration that will be important for developing Ciona as a regeneration model in urochordates, {{which may be the}} closest living relatives of vertebrates...|$|R

5000|$|Potter and Barnes at the University of Edinburgh {{revisited}} <b>siphons</b> in 1971.

50|$|There are {{two leading}} {{theories}} about how <b>siphons</b> cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid {{down on the}} exit side of the <b>siphon</b> resulted in reduced pressure {{at the top of}} the <b>siphon.</b> Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure {{at the top of the}} <b>siphon,</b> like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over. However, it has been demonstrated that <b>siphons</b> can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid. Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of <b>siphon</b> operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the <b>siphon</b> in a way similar to the chain model. It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure. The atmospheric pressure with gravity theory obviously cannot explain <b>siphons</b> in vacuum, where there is no significant atmospheric pressure. But the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain CO2 gas <b>siphons,</b> <b>siphons</b> working despite bubbles, and the flying droplet <b>siphon,</b> where gases do not exert significant pulling forces, and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force.|$|R
