5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though <b>she</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> suit two months later.|$|E

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also gave the album three out of five stars, saying, [...] "It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like 'Honey' and 'For Once in Your Life'. The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date... the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim." [...] Love and the band toured internationally from 2010 into late 2012 promoting the record, after which <b>she</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>the</b> Hole name and returned to a solo career.|$|E
