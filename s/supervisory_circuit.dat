The driver of a light engine running on an adjacent track saw the collision and contacted the signalbox. The signalling equipment had been damaged in the collision and alarms had been raised in the box. The signalmen in the box spoke to railway control at Waterloo, but due to confusion about the location of the trains police in East Sussex were first contacted.

40|$|The CAT 8801 is a <b>supervisory</b> <b>circuit</b> that {{monitors}} power supplies in digital systems {{and provides a}} reset signal whenever the system’s input voltage is below a prescribed minimum level. The CAT 8801 replaces popular voltage supervisors such as MAX 809 in applications where operating current is a primary consideration. CAT 8801 generates a reset signal, which is asserted while the power supply voltage is below a preset threshold level and remains asserted for at least 140 ms after the power supply level has risen above that level. Nine industry standard threshold levels are offered to support + 5. 0 V, + 3. 3 V, + 3. 0 V, + 2. 5 V and + 1. 8 V systems.

40|$|Miniature sensor nodes have {{recently}} opened new markets in VLSI design. In {{the continuation of}} Bell's Law, computing systems have been shrunk down to cubic-millimeter scale (e. g. Michigan micro-mote). Especially, since the concept of "Smart Dust" was proposed, rapid advances in low-power wireless sensor nodes are driving the realization of Internet of Things. With unique features such as wireless communication, energy harvesting, hard-to-reach location, and no-invasive and secure placement, the sensor nodes {{have been developed for}} a number of applications such as medical, infrastructure, and surveillance. There are many challenges to realize a miniature sensing system. One of the most critical challenges is the small battery storage capacity. Since the battery size is severely limited, battery storage capacity is also reduced. As a result, low-power circuit design and energy harvesting techniques need to be investigated to allow operation on extremely small power budgets. In miniature sensing systems, there are four different energy flows: 1) energy harvester from a source to a battery, 2) power delivery circuits from a battery to loading circuits, 3) always-on circuits, 4) duty-cycled circuits. Available energy from an energy source changes depending on the environmental condition. Load current also changes considerably due to duty-cycle operation. In this dynamic system, a smart way to optimize an energy harvester and a power converter are required. To minimize average power consumption for longer lifetime, always-on circuits should be designed with lower power than the extremely low system standby power budget. Also, duty-cycled circuits need to be turned off to maintain low standby power. In this dissertation, to satisfy these requirements, circuits such as a constant energy-per-cycle ring oscillator over wide frequency range and a low power maximum power point tracking circuit are discussed. Also, a low power battery <b>supervisory</b> <b>circuit</b> and a battery health monitoring circuit are covered...|$|E

The LED {{was selected for}} this test because {{it is one of}} the most widely used electronic devices in many electronic appliances used in everyday life. This is a booming technology nowadays. Test known as “overstress life” was selected, in this test, LED's are subject to maximum energy values to determine their reliability degree, i. e. find the life-time of the LED. The applied methodology uses the chi-square distribution, in order to obtain the number of devices to be used and test duration. A <b>supervisory</b> failure electronic <b>circuit</b> was constructed to determine life-time of the LED devices. The circuit is a multiplexer and PIC microcontroller based.

40|$|Gyro {{is one of}} {{the major}} parts of the space vehicle. Gyro is used to measure the {{rotational}} rate of the space vehicle. One of the Laser technologies is used in the gyro. The laser beam must be incident on the photo diode without any abstraction. If any magnetic field is present, the laser beam is bending. But it must be avoided. But sometimes due to external influences gyro will effect by the magnetic field. So, we need to demagnetize the gyro. To demagnetizing the gyro, one method is used namely known as degaussing. Degaussing is the process of decreasing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field. But it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small "known " field referred to as bias. The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into system, known simply as coiling. The paper is how to degauss the gyro using microcontroller AT 90 S 2313. To degaussing the gyro, applied voltage time must be controlled. This is achieved by pulse width modulation by changing the duty cycle. In PWM, the period remains Constant, but the duty cycle changes. For PWM wave generation, the count for the total period is calculated and the ON time is subtracted from it to get the off time, this is given by T=Ton +Toff. Once pwm wave is generated it must be amplified by the power amplifier because the magnetic coil has a low resistance. Due to this it draws more power; if we connect the coils directly to the microcontroller it cannot supply such amount of power. For this purpose L 6203 full bridge power amplifier is used. Power on reset is a process of reset the micro controller before functioning. Generally every micro controller has a prescribed voltage level. If voltage fallen below the prescribed level it must be shut down. For this purpose ADM 706 <b>supervisory</b> <b>circuit</b> is used...|$|E
40|$|A {{cornerstone}} of the United States Constitution is its separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the national government. The Framers of the Constitution reasoned that separated powers would guard against tyranny by blocking the undue concentration of authority in any single governmental department. In crafting the Constitution, however, the Framers could not anticipate every dispute their scheme of separated powers might engender. One modern separation-of-powers conflict not specifically anticipated by the constitutional text involves so-called 2 ̆ 2 intracircuit nonacquiescence. ” Intracircuit nonacquiescence occurs when executive-branch decision makers refuse to follow a circuit court 2 ̆ 7 s precedents even when acting subject to that circuit 2 ̆ 7 s, and no other circuit 2 ̆ 7 s, power of judicial review. The Social Security Administration (SSA), for example, long has insisted that it may direct agency adjudicators to apply SSA national standards, rather than local circuit court interpretations of governing statutes, absent a contrary court order in a particular claimant 2 ̆ 7 s case. Judges have chafed at this practice, decrying agency disregard of a <b>supervisory</b> <b>circuit</b> court 2 ̆ 7 s precedent as defiance of the judicial power 2 ̆ 2 {{to say what the}} law is. 2 ̆ 2 Executive officials, on the other hand, have defended the practice. They say that the judicial power focuses on issuing judgments in discrete cases, rather than declaring principles that invariably bind a 2 ̆ 2 co-equal branch. 2 ̆ 2 They argue further that nationwide adherence to agency rules, even if contrary to some circuit court precedent, (1) creates a salutary uniformity in agency administration of national programs; (2) produces optimum 2 ̆ 2 percolation 2 ̆ 2 of legal issues by facilitating circuit court reconsideration of controversial rulings; and (3) comports with Congress 2 ̆ 7 s design that agencies operate as expert administrators of the statutes they are charged to enforce. This clash between executive and judicial decisionmakers has spawned {{one of the most important}} modern issues in constitutional and administrative law - and an issue that the Supreme Court has yet to visit. This Article comprises seven parts. Part I defines intracircuit nonacquiescence, while Part II comments on secondary challenges to the practice based on the fifth amendment 2 ̆ 7 s due process clause. Part III then turns to the primary line of attack, rooted in the separation of powers, and criticizes existing analyses that apply this constitutional principle. On the heels of this critique, Part IV proposes a fresh approach by urging courts to evaluate intracircuit nonacquiescence pursuant to the 2 ̆ 2 means/ends 2 ̆ 2 methodology widely used in other constitutional settings. Building on this discussion, Part V advocates so-called 2 ̆ 2 heightened scrutiny 2 ̆ 2 of intracircuit nonacquiescence in light of the demonstrably grave intrusion that practice makes on important separation-of-powers values. Part VI then considers the many justifications offered for intracircuit nonacquiescence and finds each of them wanting under even the less-exacting 2 ̆ 2 intermediate 2 ̆ 2 brand of heightened scrutiny. Finally, Part VII explores whether particular forms of intracircuit on acquiescence - such as nonacquiescence limited to preliminary agency decision makers or during the pendency of Supreme Court review - merit protection even if the practice is otherwise unconstitutional...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{energy and}} energy {{harvesting}} {{has become a}} hot research area due to the shortage of fossil energy resources and burning fossil fuels release greenhouse gases in our environment, which is partaking in gradually increasing of surrounding temperature of our environment. Therefore, the penetration of various types of renewable/ distributed sources, onsite storage devices and DC powered appliances has recently focused attention towards DC power distribution in consumer grids to achieve the target of zero/positive energy buildings and communities. As compared to AC micro grid, many recent studies revealed that DC distribution has many advantages over the convectional AC distribution in term of high efficiency, integration of renewable/ distributed sources and storage locally. The objective of this dissertation is to propose reliable, cost-effective, sustainable, scalable DC consumer grid architecture which can integrate not only renewable/ distributed sources and storage, but also fully compatible with the convectional AC distribution network without any significant change or upgrade. In order to achieve this goal, we proposed the DC Transformer (DCT) enabled consumer grid model. The DC Transformer has been {{regarded as one of}} the most emerging technologies and it has many advantages over the convectional low frequency AC transformers such as high power density in small area, voltage regulation, reactive power compensation, fault detection and isolation etc. Apart from advantages, DCT required intelligent control algorithm and additional <b>supervisory</b> <b>circuit</b> makes it complicated and expensive. Therefore, in our proposed model we discussed the pros and cons of typical Solid-State transformer topologies already proposed and explained the topology used in the DCT transformer. Furthermore, in state of the art models, authors used three stages of grid operational modes, which is usually based on different factors such as the status of grid connections, State of charge of Battery storage and output power from locally available sources. However, we introduced four stages excluding buffering stage. All stages are depended upon the practical situations consumer grid may face during normal grid operations such as, DCT Isolation mode, if main grid and local generators are not available then how our proposed model would manage the locally available storage. Main grid interactive mode, we discussed the existing or convectional grid operational condition. In case of no local generator available and the AC main is the only source of power. Self-reliance grid operation, when the renewable energy sources are generating enough energy to fulfil demand side power requirements. Moreover, we explain the safest transition technique from grid connected mode to self-reliance mode without effecting overall grid stability and reliability, called buffer state. Power sharing mode, in this mode we discussed how the locally consumer grid would share surplus energy with adjacent consumer grids without effecting or compromising its own stability. The purpose of proposing critical operational modes and defining the rigid criteria between transitions of each mode is to operate whole grid flawlessly in any real time condition. Moreover, we introduced “Buffer stage” in between the grid connected and self-reliance mode to take into account that renewable sources are stochastic in nature and to avoid any grid stability issue. The operational modes are among key techniques of our proposed architecture and the detail contribution of our proposed model is mentioned in section $ 1. 7. 3 $. Some practical issues related to the DC micro grid are also examined in detail, such as overall grid control algorithm, power management strategy, demand side management, fault isolation and rectification are highlighted and the solution of these issues also presented with detail simulation results. Furthermore, the state of art DC grid models are proposed for specific type of renewable source(s) such as PV, wind or combination of both. In our proposed architecture, we are not depending on any specific type of renewable and distributed source or storage. We proposed the standard interfaces for possible type of renewable /distributed sources, storage and grid connection. Therefore, by using the standard interface any type of the source and storage can be plug-n-play in PCmRC model. However, the main objectives are to maximize the exploitation of renewable-sources, to decrease reliance on fossil-fuel, to boost the overall efficiency of the grid by reducing the power-conversion losses and full management of end user demand in all possible forms. The simulation platform is designed in MATLAB/Simulink. Several types of case studies and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed power distribution and management model...|$|E
