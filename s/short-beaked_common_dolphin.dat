[...] The <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphin</b> is generally smaller than the long-beaked common dolphin and has a shorter rostrum. Differentiation among the short-beaked variety can be attributed to ocean temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and ocean turbidity, rather than zoogeographical distribution.|$|E

Nematode burdens were light to heavy and, in many cases, would have compromised the dolphins’ health. The number of dolphins infected was related to species, year, season, age class, and geographic region. Nematodes were found in all three species but were more prevalent in <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> (mean annual prevalence= 26 %) than in bottlenose dolphins (12 %). There was {{a significant increase in}} prevalence of nematodes in <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> in 2005 – 06 (63 %) compared to 1990 – 2004 (14 %), with a peak in April–June. More young <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> were infected than subadults and adults and, during the unusual infection event, there were more dependent calves (< 130 cm) than juveniles. There were also more infections in dependent bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops spp.) calves but no increase in overall prevalence was detected during 2005 – 06. Because neonates of both <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> and bottlenose dolphins were infected, mother-to-calf transmission is suspected for these species in South Australia.

50|$|<b>Short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> are {{commonly}} found in warm tropical waters, they are known to live {{in areas of the}} Atlantic, Pacific, and Southeast Indian Ocean. They are believed to have originated in the eastern Indo-Pacific Ocean during the Pleistocene and expanded into the Atlantic Ocean through the Indian Ocean due to climate oscillations. <b>Short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> have been shown to reside in the Gulf of Corinth of the Ionian Sea. They were found in groups of Striped dolphin; their numbers were very small and believed to be unsuitable for survival. Traces of hybridization were found on Striped dolphins, leading further credence to their inability to survive in such groups. The number of <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> has declined elsewhere in Western Greece, specifically the island of Kalamos.

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach of using strandings and bycatch data may provide {{an indicator of}} long-term trends for data-limited cetaceans. Strandings programs can give a faithful representation of the species composition of cetacean assemblages, while standardised bycatch rates can provide a measure of relative abundance. Comparing the two datasets may also facilitate managing impacts by understanding which species, sex or sizes are the most vulnerable to interactions with fisheries gear. Here we apply this approach to two long-term datasets in East Australia, bycatch in the Queensland Shark Control Program QSCP, 1992 – 2012) and strandings in the Queensland Marine Wildlife Strandings and Mortality Program StrandNet, 1996 – 2012). <b>Short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Delphinus delphis, were markedly more frequent in bycatch than in the strandings dataset, suggesting {{that they are more}} prone to being incidentally caught than other cetacean species in the region. The reverse was true for humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops spp.; and species predominantly found in offshore waters. QSCP bycatch was strongly skewed towards females for <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and towards smaller sizes for Australian humpback dolphins, Sousa sahulensis. Overall, both datasets demonstrated similar seasonality and a similar long-term increase from 1996 until 2008. Analysis on a species-by-species basis was then used to explore potential explanations for long-term trends, which ranged from a recovering stock (humpback whales) to a shift in habitat use (<b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Since 1991 Tethys {{has been}} {{committed}} to cetacean research and conservation in Ionian Greece through {{the implementation of the}} Ionian Dolphin Project (IDP). The IDP was conducted first from a research vessel (1991-1994), then based on the island of Ithaca (1995), and subsequently transferred to the island of Kalamos (1996-2008). The project field base is currently located in Vonitsa (2006 - present), on the southern shore of the Ambracian Gulf. IDP studies focused on a population of endangered <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> living in the Inner Ionian Archipelago, and a population of <b>common</b> bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> residing in the semi-enclosed Ambracian Gulf. Research on Ionian dolphins in Greece allowed to document the almost total disappearance of <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> from the area, attributed to reckless overfishing of the dolphins’ main prey, sardines and anchovies, and the precarious state of conservation of the small, genetically distinct <b>common</b> bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> population confined in the highly degraded Gulf of Ambracia.|$|R
5000|$|The long-beaked {{common dolphin}} {{is a member}} of common dolphin genus, Delphinus within the dolphin family, Delphinidae in the {{cetaceans}} order.

40|$|<b>Short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Delphinus delphis) are {{typically}} considered highly mobile, offshore delphinids. This study assessed the residency {{of a small}} community of <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> in the shallow, urbanized Port Phillip Bay, south-eastern Australia. The ability to identify <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> by their dorsal fin markings and coloration using photo-identification was also investigated. Systematic and non-systematic boat surveys were undertaken between 2007 and 2014. Results showed that 13 adult <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> and their offspring inhabit Port Phillip Bay, of which 10 adults exhibit residency to the bay. The majority of these adults are reproductively active females, suggesting that female philopatry may occur in the community.

The shallow, urbanized habitat of this resident <b>common</b> <b>dolphin</b> community is atypical for this species. As a result, these <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> face threats usually associated with inshore bottlenose dolphin communities.

40|$|Climatic {{oscillations}} {{during the}} Pleistocene have greatly influenced {{the distribution and}} connectivity of many organisms, leading to extinctions but also generating biodiversity. While the effects of such changes have been extensively studied in the terrestrial environment, studies focusing on the marine realm are still scarce. Here we used sequence data from one mitochondrial and five nuclear loci to assess the potential influence of Pleistocene climatic changes on the phylogeography and demographic history of a cosmopolitan marine predator, the <b>common</b> <b>dolphin</b> (genus Delphinus). Population samples representing the three major morphotypes of Delphinus were obtained from 10 oceanic regions. Our results suggest that <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are likely to have}} originated in the eastern Indo-Pacific Ocean during the Pleistocene and expanded into the Atlantic Ocean through the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, long-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> appear to have evolved more recently and independently in several oceans. Our results also suggest that <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> had recurrent demographic expansions concomitant with changes in sea surface temperature during the Pleistocene and its associated increases in resource availability, which differed between the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins. By proposing how past environmental changes had an effect on the demography and speciation of a widely distributed marine mammal, we highlight the impacts that climate change may have on the distribution and abundance of marine predators and its ecological consequences for marine ecosystems. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} experiment {{was carried out}} in 19961997 to determine whether acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) reduce marine mammal bycatch in the California drift gill net fishery for swordfish and sharks. Using Fisher’s exact test, bycatch rates with pingers were significantly less for all cetacean species combined (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and for all pinniped species combined (P = 0. 003). For species tested separately with this test, bycatch reduction was statistically significant for shortbeaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> (P = 0. 001) and California sea lions (P = 0. 02). Bycatch reduction is not statistically significant for the other species tested separately, but sample sizes and statistical power were low, and bycatch rates were lower in pingered nets for six of the eight other cetacean and pinniped species. A log-linear model relating the mean rate of entanglement to the number of pingers deployed was fit to the data for three groups: <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins,</b> other cetaceans, and pinnipeds. For a net with 40 pingers, the models predict approximately a 12 - fold decrease in entanglement for <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins,</b> a 4 -fold decrease for other cetaceans, and a 3 -fold decrease for pinnipeds.

40|$|Delphinids show a {{wide range}} of social structures. However, studies {{investigating}} the influence of genetic relatedness and maternal kinship on school associations are limited to a small number of relatively well-studied delphinid species. This study investigated biparental genetic relatedness and potential maternal kinship structure in schools of <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> Delphinus delphis from southern Australian waters. A total of 128 biopsy samples were obtained from free-ranging individuals within 62 schools of <b>common</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Each sample was genotyped at 13 nuclear microsatellite markers, sequenced at 438 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region, and used for genetic sexing. Pairwise analyses within and between schools showed that the average genetic relatedness between males was greater within schools than between schools.

40|$|Interactions between <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> Delphinus delphis and {{the fishing}} {{industry}} of South Australia (SA) have lead to serious concerns over the long-term viability of the local <b>dolphin</b> population. <b>Common</b> <b>dolphins</b> are gregarious animals with high vagility {{and are expected to}} display limited genetic differentiation over large spatial scales. Here, we investigate population genetic structure of southern Australian <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and seven microsatellite markers. We found unexpected levels of genetic differentiation for <b>short-beaked</b> <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> over a distance of ~ 1500 km. Although no genetic structure was observed in <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> along the coast of SA, we detected marked differentiation between dolphins from SA and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting a minimum of two genetic populations in southern Australia. We hypothesize that the ephemeral distribution of small pelagic fish enhances movement and dispersal between dolphin groups at a local level. However, clear differences in water temperature, habitat features and fish abundance between SA and Tasmania may contribute to the contemporary isolation observed between dolphin populations. Our findings have important consequences for developing conservation management strategies, because SA has the largest purse-seine fishery by weight in Australia, and substantial numbers of fatal <b>common</b> <b>dolphin</b> interactions have occurred. In 2004 / 2005 alone, an estimated 1728 <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> were encircled and 377 died over a 7 -month period. If these impacts lead to a reduction in population size, it is unlikely that dolphins from the adjacent south-eastern Tasmanian population will replace the lost individuals. Recommendations for assessing the impacts of the fishery are presented. The information herein may also have implications for fisheries-marine mammal interactions in coastal and neritic habitats {{in other areas of the}} world.
