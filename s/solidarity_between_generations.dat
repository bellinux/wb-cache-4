40|$|In {{this first}} {{instalment}} of our Soundings series on critical terms, {{we look at}} the idea of ‘generation’, a term which has become highly prevalent within political discourse since the financial crisis. As with all the concepts in this series, the idea of generation is differently mobilised by different political actors. Right-wing thinkers use generation in a sense that {{can be traced back to}} Edmund Burke to mean the transmission of property and culture through time, while other commentators draw on meanings derived from Mannheim to refer to the experiences of particular cohorts at times of rapid political change. For activists on the left, it is important to distinguish between these different connotations of generation. The Burkean approach has regressive implications, for example in the justification of austerity as a way of protecting future generations from debt; and the Mannheimian understanding, although not as conservative, needs to be connected to an intersectional analysis that looks at other identity markers alongside those of age - such as class, race, gender and sexuality - so as to avoid flattening differences within cohorts and impeding <b>solidarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{begins with}} the issue of pension security, {{referencing}} the desired predictability, stability, long-lived nature of benefits, and coverage of retirement incomes. Also considered is the issue of pension security in the light of global financial market performance and integration. Having discussed issues of nation-state fiscal capacity and the consequences of the technology, media, and telecommunications speculative bubble for stock market returns it is suggested that pension security is also a matter of institutional integrity. This is illustrated with reference to debate in US Congress over the proper response to the Enron debacle. It is argued that no public or private institutions (including the nation-state and large corporations) can now guarantee the final value of pension benefits. As the baby boom generation comes to retirement across the Western world, pension security in the form of guaranteed pension benefit value is a hollow ideal; a chimera on the horizon of nation-state politics that cannot be sustained, notwithstanding the commitment of many to social justice and social <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> the <b>generations.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The European Citizen's Prize was {{launched}} by the European Parliament in 2008 to recognise exceptional achievements by Europeans. In that year, 37 people from 19 member states were selected for the prize in honour of their good work. They received their medals in national award ceremonies {{and they had the}} chance to showcase their work and meet MEPs at the European Parliament in Brussels on 7-8 November. This year's winners worked in a variety of areas. Some of their projects were linked to theme of the European year, which this year is about active ageing and <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations.</b> The Citizens' Prize can be given for activities that either facilitate cross-border cooperation within the EU or promote better mutual understanding and closer integration between citizens and member states. It can also be awarded for day-to-day activities reflecting the values enshrined in the EU's charter of fundamental rights. The laureates can be citizens, groups, associations or organisations. Every year each MEP has the right to nominate one candidate.|$|E
50|$|The first conference {{concerning}} {{environmental education}} (EE) {{was held in}} Tblisi in 1977 and it resulted in the Tblisi declaration. The document focuses on EE and maintains among others {{that it should be}} interdisciplinary, be a lifelong process and develop critical thinking and problem - solving skills. The declaration has had a large effect on curriculums, for example in the Uganda strategy to implementing education for sustainable development The term SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT got an international breakthrough in 1987 with the Bruntland Commissions final report. Our Common Future. The definition of sustainable development was stated in this report and it is still ubiquitous.“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”Sustainable development is about a global responsibility and <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations,</b> between women and men and between different cultures and countries. It is about safeguarding and efficient use of existing nature resources. Investment in management of human, social and physiological resources is also crucial parts of sustainable development. Democratic values permeate the society and the citizens feel that they can influence the development, and that they have the will of taking that responsibility for doing so.|$|E
5000|$|All the schemes {{of basic}} and {{supplementary}} pensions in France {{work on the}} method of distribution. The schemes redistribute every year, {{in the form of}} pensions paid to retirees, contributions received that year from the assets. If the rules of the various pension plans in France correspond to different concepts, however they are based on common principles. All schemes incorporate mechanisms of solidarity: <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations</b> (principle of distribution) and solidarity within a single generation (large redistributions between different occupational groups and gender). These principles of solidarity occurs both in the regimes, between the regimes and beyond regimes at the national level. There are transfers between the schemes, and therefore solidarity between the basic schemes, as well as mechanisms for schemes coordination. Solidarity at the national level consists of the minimum old-age pension assigned to all seniors who have limited resources, paid by the solidarity fund retirement (which also pay some family benefits), but also of state subsidies granted to certain regimes (farmers, SNCF, RATP, mining, marine ...), and finally of various taxes allocated to pensions. The retirement system in France is organized into three levels: a compulsory system, a scheme often mandatory, and optional arrangements.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{covenant}} <b>between</b> the <b>generations</b> was proposed by Pope John Paul II in the document “Evangelium vitae” paragraph 94 {{as a means of}} expressing love and solidarity for the elderly in the family and in the community against the growing treat of marginalisation and the acceptance of euthanasia. The aim of the thesis is to affirm the love and responsibility of adults for their parents and the parental generation in the community and to provide for a renewal of the bonds of love and solidarity that begin in the family <b>between</b> the <b>generations,</b> especially for its weak and vulnerable members such as the young and the elderly. The research brings to light the rich theology of the covenant <b>between</b> the <b>generations</b> based upon Karol Wojtyla’s key philosophical and theological ideas. Wojtyla’s perspective of the human person is covenantal, one of being-in-relationship that is founded on love of God and love of neighbour which begins in the family. Finally, in the thesis this is contrasted with Peter Singer’s utilitarian ethics which is based upon independence, personal preference, the minimisation of suffering, exclusion and the acceptance of euthanasia. The {{concept of the}} covenant <b>between</b> the <b>generations</b> can lead to an understanding of intergenerational solidarity beginning in the family. It has implications for policy development in healthcare, pastoral care, and ethics for healthcare professionals. Also, the concept can contribute to the promotion of intergenerational solidarity in politics and government legislation, {{in order to protect the}} human person, especially the elderly as a subject of rights and the just allocation of healthcare resources.

40|$|The {{issue of}} intergenerational {{relationships}} {{has been gaining}} greater and greater relevance within the present national and international contexts. The same is happening at academic/scientific and social levels, bringing up huge challenges to communication and <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> the different <b>generations</b> and to the social, educational and health policies for the 21 st Century. In the discussions on intergenerationality its relevance stands out, namely in terms of: the conveyance of individual, family and collective memories, and conveyance of values, and {{in the construction of}} new individual and group identities and trajectories; the education, communication and well-being of the younger and older generations, for instance of grandparents and grandsons, and in the development of new relationships and forms of intergenerational solidarity within the family and within society at large; the promoting of active aging, health and quality of life for individuals, families and communities; intergenerational social and educational projects aimed at the inclusion and empowerment of older generations, lesser stereotypes and prejudice based on age, the promotion of dialogue and socialization <b>between</b> <b>generations,</b> as well as the construction of a society for all ages, where different generations may contribute towards a culture of solidarity, inclusiveness and citizenship...|$|R
40|$|Demographic {{change has}} affected, and {{continues}} to affect, all age groups and generations, {{as well as their}} interdependencies and mutual relationships. The long term, sweeping demographic trend in Europe and {{in other parts of the}} world is population ageing. As pointed out in a Green Paper by the European Commission, population ageing calls for new and enhanced forms of <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> the <b>generations</b> (European Commission 2005). This need for solidarity does not only apply to the needs of the elderly and of young, dependent children; the needs for solidarity is also felt by adults who, for example, try to combine paid work with family roles. At the same time, there are a number of socio-demographic trends that are often perceived as posing a potential threat to intergenerational solidarity (Daatland, Slagsvold & Lima 2009). These trends include increasing divorce rates, rising unmarried cohabitation, and a growing number of births out of wedlock. Within the theoretical framework of the so-called Second Demographic Transition, these trends are interpreted to reflect growing individualism, as opposed to the familialistic altruism supposedly driving the so-called First Demographic Transition (Lesthaeghe 1995; van de Kaa 1987; 2003). If the recent demographic trends are indeed a reflection of people becoming more individualistic and less altruistic, then all sorts o...|$|R
5000|$|Individually {{purchased}} {{private insurance}} generally must be fully funded. Full funding is a desirable goal for private pension plans as well, but {{is often not}} achieved. Social insurance programs are often not fully funded, and some argue that full funding is not economically desirable. Most international systems of social insurance are funded {{on an ongoing basis}} without reference to future liabilities. That is seen as a matter of <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations</b> and between the sick and the healthy {{as a part of the}} social contract. The current generation of healthy working people pay something now to meet the health care and living costs of those who are currently temporarily incapacitated through sickness or who have ceased work through old age or disability. The main exception is in the United States, where the two largest programs, Medicare and Social Security programs, the administrators have historically collected more in social premiums than they have paid out as social benefits. The difference is retained in a trust fund. In both programs, US government actuaries periodically attempt to predict up to 70 years in advance the longevity of the fund and must estimate the future rates of contributions and pensions, the types of health care needs of the beneficiaries, and what that might cost. No other country in the world does so. Despite the US programs being in considerable surplus, the political argument is often that these programs are [...] "going bankrupt" [...] or that politicians have spent the money on other things.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to ascertain the importance of intergenerational solidarity in communication within the family and childrearing among the Russians living in Estonia. Generations see the world differently enough. One of the reasons for that is individualistic worldview which characterizes not only the younger generation, but individualistic tendencies have percolated into other generationsas well. All generations admit the presence of a generation gap, but they disclaim presence of intergenerational conflict. At the same time respondents affirm that there is <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations</b> in their families and it is based on love and respect. <b>Solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations</b> in families is revealed both on spiritual level (communicating, love, trust, mutual understanding, common interests) as well as in real help given by generations to each other as far as homework, children's upbringing, and economical aid are concerned...|$|E
40|$|About the book: Specifically {{shall be}} {{described}} with the planned publication more exactly how care is possible <b>between</b> the <b>generations,</b> how relationships and relations outside the market can be ensured, how welfare performances can be secured {{and how the}} different countries solve their specific problems in a society, which is becoming older. In the family not only the bases of the human fortune in a society are created but also the base of lifelong <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> the <b>generations</b> and the readiness {{for taking care of}} others. In the context of this book the broad perspective of William S. Goode and Talcott Parson is picked up and regions like Europe, Japan, China, Africa, Near East and the United States of America are examined regarding the recognizable developments of family, family life forms and the conditions of children’s lives. Other than in Parson’s and William S. Goode’s model the views on future developments base on the thoughts of authors who work and research in these countries. The book’s concept opens up two prospects. On the one hand different and corresponding developmental stages of family life-forms are worked out {{on the basis of these}} cooperation and analyses, simultaneously the attempt is made to motivate the colleagues in these countries to render their future ideas more precisely with respect to their respective cultural context. This way the possibility arises to work out the cultural distinctions of the respective development besides possible commonalities...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} key {{findings from}} the Changing Generations study – a collaborative research project undertaken between 2011 and 2013 by the Social Policy and Ageing Research Centre (SPARC), Trinity College Dublin, and the Irish Centre for Social Gerontology (ICSG), NUI Galway. Changing Generations addresses important issues concerning the relationships <b>between</b> different <b>generations</b> in Ireland. Against a backdrop marked by economic recession and demographic change, the focus is not only on how people of different generations live together, help each other and depend on one another in their daily lives, but also on how they perceive the social policies that support individuals {{at different stages of}} the life course. These are important features of what is termed in the scientific literature ‘intergenerational solidarity’. Practical examples of such solidarity include making provision to meet costs of health care, pensions and social welfare, and family members, friends or neighbours of different ages helping each other with everyday tasks. In some countries, there is a growing concern about the nature of intergenerational relations. Some commentators question the status of <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> the <b>generations,</b> increasingly pitting young against old. Understanding how people think about and practice intergenerational solidarity at individual and societal levels can provide an important foundation for a constructive dialogue about intergenerational relations in Ireland. By reporting on selected findings from a unique study, the Changing Generations team hopes {{to play a role in}} shaping such a dialogue...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the Italian framework for research with human tissues. There are some main ethical {{and legal issues}} that should be considered: {{the definition of the}} biological samples, object of the collection and storage; the way through which these samples are collected; the content of information and the consent form; privacy and confidentiality; and the owner of the biological sample. Due to the lack of specific rules and regulations concerning this field of research in Italy, biobanks have been outlined by national committee, such as the National Committee for the Biosafety and Biotechnologies. The need for deeper reflection on this aspect, is particularly necessary because of the different ways of regulating privacy — with dissimilar standards of safety in each country — but also in the light of promoting a new way of <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> groups and <b>generations</b> based on the voluntary sharing of sample and information for a common resource...|$|R
40|$|Ireland {{has gained}} a {{reputation}} for peaceable acceptance of austerity following a European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout in 2010. While proponents of austerity praise Ireland?s stoicism, critics of global capitalism argue that individuals and families are paying for mistakes made by elites. However, {{little is known about}} the strategies people adopt to cope with cutbacks to welfare entitlements. Drawing on a study of <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations</b> living in Ireland in 2011 - 12, this article explores the lived experience of economic crisis and austerity. One hundred interviews with people of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds are analysed using constructivist grounded theory. Data show how austerity impacts differentially according to socio-economic status. While <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> <b>generations</b> leads to re-distribution of resources within families, providing some security for people with access to family resources, it reinforces inequality at societal level. We conclude that reliance on family promotes ?coping? rather than ?protesting? responses to austerity...|$|E

40|$|Ageing and {{migration}} have become key issues in many European countries today, {{as a large}} number of first generation immigrants of the 1970 s are currently approaching retirement age. In this context, also questions regarding the intergenerational relations and intergenerational <b>solidarity</b> <b>between</b> first <b>generation</b> parents and their adult children - who have grown up in the host country - have gained high importance. Although the idea of return migration might often be well present in the lives of ageing migrants, an actual permanent return to the country of origin seems to be enacted more seldom, especially when the own children have settled down permanently in the receiving country. It is therefore of prime importance {{to learn more about the}} particular needs and resources of older migrants and their families. Ageing migrants face undoubtedly a special situation: The acculturation situation may result in an increased need for social support due to fewer sociocultural resources in the host country. Within migrant families, an acculturation gap between first and second generation might further lead to different expectations regarding intergenerational solidarity and support, and this can cause intergenerational strain and have negative effects on well-being of the different family members. The present training session will address issues of relationship quality (such as solidarity, conflict, ambivalence) as well as aspects of intergenerational value transmission <b>between</b> ageing first <b>generation</b> parents and their adult children in the context of migration. Both theoretical considerations as well as results from a recent study on Portuguese immigrant families in Luxembourg (IRMA – Intergenerational Relations in the Light of Migration and Ageing, funded by the Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg) will be presented and discussed...|$|R
