50|$|A fixture's {{primary purpose}} {{is to create a}} <b>secure</b> <b>mounting</b> point for a workpiece, {{allowing}} for support during operation and increased accuracy, precision, reliability, and interchangeability in the finished parts. It also serves to reduce working time by allowing quick set-up, and by smoothing the transition from part to part. It frequently reduces the complexity of a process, allowing for unskilled workers to perform it and effectively transferring the skill of the tool maker to the unskilled worker. Fixtures also allow for a higher degree of operator safety by reducing the concentration and effort required to hold a piece steady.|$|E

50|$|The Knights Armament Company LMG {{is listed}} as the lightest and most simple, rugged 5.56x45mm NATO machine gun. The Stoner LMG is an open bolt, belt-fed, gas operated, air-cooled, and fully automatic, firing {{at a rate of}} 550 rounds per minute. The belt feed has an unusual exposed lever hinged {{at the side of the}} receiver. The top cover above the feed tray is very short which allows quicker {{reloading}} and allowing the use of sights etc. Although it lacks a bipod, a grip pod is intended to be installed on the modular handguard. The KAC LMG lacks a bolt buffer as there is no impact on the bolt making the weapon controllable in full auto. The KAC LMG is extremely accurate due to the <b>secure</b> <b>mounting</b> of the “quick change” hammer forged chrome lined barrel.|$|E
50|$|Though in the USA tank {{containers}} {{are typically}} the same dimensions (20 * 8 * 8.5 ft). {{as a standard}} ISO ocean container, tank chassis are much longer than the typical 20 ft container chassis. Tank chassis typically measure 40 - 43 ft in length by 8 x 4 ft wide x tall. This chassis has a standard drop-frame design providing a lower center of gravity than conventional trailers and an overall length suitable to legally scale most tanks. Twistlocks provide a <b>secure</b> <b>mounting</b> mechanism for the tanks and {{eliminate the need for}} straps or chains. The lower center of gravity is crucial for reducing the chances of a roll over with the constant shifting weight of the liquid cargo. These chassis can also be fitted with additional accessories including: lift kits to facilitate product discharge, hose tubes, and hi/lo kits to carry two empty tanks.|$|E

40|$|An accelerometer, {{mounted to}} a {{structure}} near an explosion to measure elasto-plastic deformation, can be excited at its resonant frequency by impulsive stresses transmitted within the structure. This results in spurious high peak acceleration levels {{that can be}} much higher than acceleration levels from the explosion itself. The spurious signals also have higher frequencies than the underlying signal from the explosion and can be removed by a low pass filter. This report assesses the performance of four accelerometer and filter assemblies. The assessment involves measurements of the response of a mild steel cylinder to an underwater explosion, in which each assembly is mounted onto the interior surface of the cylinder. Three assemblies utilise a piezoresistive accelerometer in which isolation is provided mechanically. In the fourth assembly, a piezoelectric accelerometer, with a built-in filter, incorporates both mechanical and electronic filtering. This assembly {{is found to be}} more suitable because of its <b>secure</b> <b>mounting</b> arrangement, ease of use, robustness and noise free results...|$|E
30|$|Different {{types of}} small cell BSs may require {{different}} types of backhaul designs and architectures since they can be deployed at very different locations 1. Therefore, the physical design and architecture is a critical difference between various backhaul solutions, which impacts the possibility of different deployment locations and the associated backhaul costs. Three physical structures are generally considered, which {{are referred to as}} full separation, moderate separation and full integration. In the first case, the small cell and backhaul units are two entirely separated structures with separate enclosures, while in the second case, they are placed within a single enclosure which better protects the interconnections between the small cell and backhaul units against weather, accidental damages and tampering. As an alternative, the backhaul unit may be completely integrated into the small cell BS. This reduces the size and eases the deployment of the solution. In all cases, electrical surge protection, <b>secure</b> <b>mounting</b> and safety cable connector locks have to be used to minimise the probability of physical contact with the general public [3].|$|E

50|$|In 1919, {{following}} {{some years}} of financial difficulties, the Trust was disbanded and the Reserve {{was transferred to}} the Toowong Town Council. In 1925, the Queensland Parliament passed the City of Brisbane Act 1924 to set up a single local government in Brisbane. This led to control of Mount Coot-tha passing to the newly formed Brisbane City Council. The first elected mayor was Sir William Jolly and part of his election promise was the extension and improvement of the park system, including the securing of vantage points like Mount Coot-tha. Therefore, under the Jolly administration, the area of the Reserve expanded dramatically, acquiring more than 1000 acres. On his retirement Jolly stated that he felt that <b>securing</b> <b>Mount</b> Coot-tha Reserve was one of his administration's most important achievements.|$|R
50|$|The fall of Wireless Ridge and {{the heavy}} {{expenditure}} of artillery, mortar and machine-gun ammunition {{in support of the}} 7th Infantry Regiment (RI7) on the ridgeline overlooking Moody Brook rendered the situation of the Marines tenuous. Using armour-infantry-co-operation the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment had advanced through the RI7 companies. O Company, BIM-5 (O/BIM5) had been sent up to the Moody Brook area and moved into blocking positions to the south and east of Moody Brook. In due course firing broke out in the direction of Battalion HQ at Moody Brook, indicating that the British had outflanked their position. At 7 a.m., the Commanding Officer of the 5th Marines reported his command post near Moody Brook had come under enemy fire from Wireless Ridge.

5000|$|The Fifth Amendment {{includes}} the Public Use Clause and the Takings Clause. Some historians {{have suggested that}} these limitations on the taking power were inspired {{by the need to}} permit the army to <b>secure</b> <b>mounts,</b> fodder and provisions from local ranchers and the perceived need to assure them compensation for such takings. Similarly, soldiers forcibly sought housing in whatever homes were near their military assignments. To address the latter problem, the Third Amendment was enacted in 1791 as part of the US Constitution's Bill of Rights. It provided that the quartering of soldiers on private property could not take place in peacetime without the landowner's consent. It also required that, in wartime, established law had to be followed in housing troops on private property. Presumably, this would mandate [...] "just compensation," [...] a requirement for the exercise of eminent domain in general per the Fifth Amendment. All U.S. states have legislation specifying eminent domain procedures within their respective territories.|$|R
50|$|After {{the failed}} attempt to {{breakout}} in the south, the nationalist 74th Reorganized Division withdrew to the Menglianggu mountains. The three regiments of the 58th Reorganized Brigade of the nationalist 74th Reorganized Division was tasked respectively to secure the main peak of the Menglianggu mountains, Eagle’s Nest and Lu Mountain. The 51st Reorganized Brigade of the nationalist 74th Reorganized Division was to <b>secure</b> <b>Mount</b> 520 and Mount 540, while the 57th Reorganized Brigade of the nationalist 74th Reorganized Division was to <b>secure</b> <b>Mount</b> 570 (also designated as Mount 600 in other historical records). Zhang Lingfu setup his headquarters of the nationalist 74th Reorganized Division was on {{the eastern half of}} Mount 540, and repeatedly asked the nationalist high command for reinforcements. Chiang Kai-shek believed that this was an excellent opportunity to annihilate the communist East China Field Army in a decisive campaign, so he ordered RoCAF to airdrop supplies to the besieged nationalists, and also ordered a total of ten army-sized nationalist reorganized divisions spearheaded by the 25th Reorganized Division and 83rd Reorganized Division to reinforce the besieged nationalists. As a result, the strategies of both sides became obvious to the opposing forces: the communists intended to destroy the besieged nationalist 74th Reorganized Division while avoiding being attacked and wiped out from both fronts, while the nationalists intended to attack their enemy from both fronts, using their besieged force as a bait, which would held out long enough for the reinforcement to arrive. However, besieged nationalists could not hold {{as long as they were}} hoped to, because of the difficult landscape: the vegetation was sparse and there was not any water source. The rugged terrain meant that it was nearly impossible for the nationalist defenders to build any fortification and thus they were directly exposed to the enemy fire, suffering huge casualties. To compound the problem, most if not all heavy weaponries had to be abandoned because they could not be carried to the mountain tops. Furthermore, due to the lack of water, the water-cool machine guns could not function properly even after they were carried up to the mountain tops. The airdrop was completely insufficient to fulfill the daily need of the besieged force either.|$|R
