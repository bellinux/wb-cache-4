Materials and methods: We developed a surgical filter suction system that we call the VY <b>suction</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> assembly consists of a tube filter within a housing assembly. The filter pore size was designed to prevent tissue or bone debris from passing through the filter, though it allows fluid to pass through. A simulated total hip replacement operation was performed to test the efficacy of this new suction device when compared with two other types of <b>tube</b> <b>suction</b> devices. Results: The VY <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> showed that the mean duration to remove all fluid from a simulated field was significantly shorter than the Pool <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P= 0. 0009) and Frazier <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P= 0. 0012). The study also showed that the VY <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> has a lower rate of occlusion when compared with the Pool <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P≤ 0. 0001) and Frazier <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> (P≤ 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our new <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> design shows good efficacy when removing fluid and debris from a simulated operative field. However, further studies in real clinical settings are needed. Keywords: total hip replacement, filter suction, occlusio...|$|R

50|$|The {{significance}} of the direct <b>suction</b> tracheotomy <b>tube</b> {{is found in the}} way it addressed a persistent complication in tracheotomy operations; where the mucous secretions within a patient's trachea block a portion of the inner cannula tube and attempting to remedy the situation by inserting <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> further blocks a patient's airways. As a result, the patient feels insecure and has trouble breathing. Fountain's patent for the direct <b>suction</b> tracheotomy <b>tube</b> answered this issue. The invention also was an improved tracheotomy tube that allowed introduction of gases other than air without reducing the diameter of the tube.|$|R

40|$|Transsphenoidal surgery {{carries the}} risk of carotid artery injury even for very {{experienced}} neurosurgeons. The computer-assisted neurosurgical (CANS) navigational system was used to obtain more precise guidance, based on the axial and coronal images during the transsphenoidal approach for nine pituitary adenomas. The CANS navigator consists of a three-dimensional digitizer, a computer, and a graphic unit, which utilizes electromagnetic coupling technology to detect the spatial position of a <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> attached to a magnetic sensor. Preoperatively, the magnetic resonance images are transferred and stored in the computer and {{the tip of the}} <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> is shown on a real-time basis superimposed on the preoperative images. The CANS navigation system correctly displayed the surgical orientation and provided localization in all nine patients. No intraoperative complications were {{associated with the use of}} this system. However, outflow of cerebrospinal fluid during tumor removal may affect the accuracy, so the position of the probe when the tumor is removed must be accurately determined. The CANS navigator enables precise localization of the <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> during the transsphenoidal approach and allows safer and less-invasive surgery...|$|R

40|$|This device {{allows for}} expeditious and {{repeated}} changeovers between pressure and force testing and {{which uses a}} minimum internal volume of a wind tunnel test structure. A matrix configuration of holes {{is located on the}} outer surface of the structure. Pressure tubes lead through the internal cavity of the structure from test sites to this outer surface matrix configuration. A pressure <b>tube</b> <b>connector</b> with a corresponding matrix of holes is connected {{to the surface of the}} structure. Pressure tubes leading from remotely located transducers are joined to the connector, thus forming pressure passageways from the test sites to the transducers to allow for pressure testing. When force testing is required, the pressure <b>tube</b> <b>connector</b> is disconnected and a cover plate is connected. The cover plate seals the exposed internal pressure tubes. Also, the outer surface of the cover plate conforms to the exterior of the structure, providing the necessary smooth surface for force testing.

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{portion of}} the cooling capacity losses on a household compressor occurs due to heating of the gas entering through the <b>suction</b> <b>tube,</b> which is called as superheating. A {{better understanding of the}} flow and heat transfer phenomena involved is crucial to improve compressor efficiency. In this work, it is presented a numerical simulation study using a commercial code to analyze a transient three-dimensional, compressible and non-isothermal flow, which has been used for modeling the problem. The computational domain considered the <b>suction</b> <b>tube,</b> a {{portion of the}} compressor cavity and the suction muffler. Prescribed transient mass flow rates obtained by simpler 0 D/ 1 D models have been used as boundary conditions while the cavity gas and wall temperatures were prescribed based on experimental methods.

40|$|Abstract. A aerosol {{sampling}} inlet {{has been}} designed from high-speed aircraft. The objective of the design is to achieving isokinetic and minimizing disturbance for the sampling system. This study was conducted using the CFD code to perform a turbulent simulation of the airflow on the aerosol sampling inlet. The inlet is flown regularly on board an aircraft of Yun- 12. The flow rate through the sampling <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> is a constant value of 100 L/min. The shroud diameter is 150 mm. The diffusion tube inlet and outlet diameter is 35. 3 mm. The <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> diameter is 20. 6 mm, which act as transferring aerosol at the velocity of 5 m/s. Results are presented graphically, showing the suction bending radius take 50 mm is more appropriate. It is shown that the diffusion tube slows the sample flow from 40 m/s of the airspeed of the aircraft to approximately 5 m/s. It is suggested that CFD simulation can be useful for improving the optimum aircraft-carried aerosol sampling inlet...|$|R

30|$|A male infant with polyhydramnios {{was born}} via Caesarean section at 34  weeks gestational age, birth weight of 2135  g. The infant {{received}} positive pressure ventilation followed by continuous positive airway pressure. A chest radiograph demonstrated a gasless abdomen, and an attempted nasogastric tube insertion showed the tube tip {{seated at the}} T 1 -T 2 vertebral level. A Repogle <b>suction</b> <b>tube</b> was inserted, and the diagnosis of esophageal atresia was made. Screening investigations ruled out VACTERL anomalies. The infant underwent open gastrostomy tube insertion of a 12 French gastrostomy tube on day 7 of life. During the same anaesthetic, a flexible bronchoscopy was performed (2.4 millimetre bronchoscope) via endotracheal tube. The bronchoscopy was technically challenging considering the small instrument size and copious airway secretions, however, no tracheoesophageal fistulae were identified. The infant tolerated the procedures and was stable until 11  days post-operatively, when cough and persistent tachypnea developed. Chest radiograph documented right lower lobe atelectasis. Despite replacement of his Repogle <b>suction</b> <b>tube,</b> the tachypnea continued. A capillary blood gas measurement showed evidence of hypercarbia (pCO 2 54  mm Hg) and he was transferred into the pediatric intensive care unit and stabilized with continuous positive airway pressure. His tachypnea improved and he was placed on low flow oxygen by nasal cannulae. One week later, he had episodes of oxygen desaturations associated with tachypnea. Chest radiograph revealed partial atelectasis of his right lower and right upper lobes. Despite replacement and flushing of his Repogle <b>suction</b> <b>tube,</b> he remained tachypneic for several days but gradually returned to baseline. At 6  weeks of age, a contrast study via his gastrostomy tube was done to determine the gap between his proximal and distal esophagus to evaluate suitability for repair. A gap of three vertebral bodies was seen and the decision to delay primary anastomosis was made.|$|R
