5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 and then an expressway <b>standard</b> <b>extension</b> to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E

40|$|STScI {{has adopted}} FITS with Image Extensions as the native disk and archive format {{for the two}} new {{instruments}} being installed into HST during the planned servicing mission in 1997. In order to use these data conveniently within IRAF, STScI has implemented an IRAF image kernel that can access FITS with image extensions as a native image format; eventually this prototype kernel will be adapted for inclusion into IRAF 2. 11 by NOAO. This paper describes the advantages of this format and the design issues faced during its implementation. 1. What are FITS Image <b>Extensions?</b> The FITS <b>standard</b> (see NASA 1995) allows the appending of any number of optional <b>Standard</b> <b>Extensions</b> to a simple FITS file which consists of the usual Header and Data Unit (HDU). These <b>Standard</b> <b>Extensions</b> also consist of Header and Data Units. These <b>Standard</b> <b>Extensions</b> may be of different types; the type is specified by {{the value of the}} XTENSION keyword in the extension header (e. g., IMAGE or TABLE).
