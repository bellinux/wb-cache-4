25|$|The {{trend for}} broad skirts slowly {{disappeared}} during the 1870s, as women started to prefer an even slimmer silhouette. Bodices {{remained at the}} natural waistline, necklines varied, while sleeves began under the <b>shoulder</b> <b>line.</b> An overskirt was commonly worn over the bodice, and secured into a large bow behind. Over time though, the overskirt shortened into a detached basque, resulting in an elongation of the bodice over the hips. As the bodices grew longer in 1873, the polonaise was thus introduced into the Victorian dress styles. A polonaise is a garment featuring both an overskirt and bodice together. The tournure was also introduced, and along with the polonaise, it created an illusion of an exaggerated rear end.|$|E
25|$|The black-figure {{technique}} was first {{applied in the}} middle of the 7th century BC, during the period of Proto-Attic vase painting. Influenced by pottery from Corinth, which offered the highest quality at the time, Attic vase painters switched to the new technology between about 635 BC and the end of the century. At first they closely followed the methods and subjects of the Corinthian models. The Painter of Berlin A 34 at the beginning of this period is the first identified individual painter. The first artist with a unique style was the Nessos Painter. With his Nessos amphora he created the first outstanding piece in the Attic black-figure style. At the same time he was an early master of the Attic animal frieze style. One of his vases was also the first known Attic vase exported to Etruria. He was also responsible for the first representations of harpies and Sirens in Attic art. In contrast to the Corinthian painters he used double and even triple incised lines to better depict animal anatomy. A double-scored <b>shoulder</b> <b>line</b> became a characteristic of Attic vases. The possibilities inherent in large pieces of pottery such as belly amphoras as carriers for images were also recognized at an early date. Other important painters of this pioneer time were the Piraeus Painter, the Bellerophon Painter and the Lion Painter.|$|E

50|$|The crimson-crested {{woodpecker}} somewhat {{resembles the}} pileated woodpecker of North America, {{but may be}} confused in its own range with the lineated woodpecker. The lineated woodpecker is the only bird of similar plumage and size. In that species, the white face line is narrower, and the white <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> do not meet on the back.|$|R

5000|$|In {{most of its}} range, it is {{most likely}} {{confused}} with the crimson-crested woodpecker (Campephilus melanoleucos), which is similar in plumage and size. In the female of that species, the light face line is far broader, and the white <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> meet on the back lower back (forming a [...] "V"). The male crimson-crested woodpecker is quite different with its almost entirely red head.|$|R
50|$|The {{highways}} {{were originally}} marked with yellow-colour hard <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> {{and some of}} these remain in place, they are however slowly being phased out and replaced with white. The motorway roadsigns maintain their green colour background, a feature shared with Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Greece, Lithuania and the United States {{as well as the other}} former Yugoslav republics. The roads are on the whole straight with good surfacing, and better maintained than the national roads.|$|R
2500|$|... 1840s {{fashion in}} European and European-influenced {{clothing}} {{is characterized by}} a narrow, natural <b>shoulder</b> <b>line</b> following the exaggerated puffed sleeves of the later 1820s and 1830s.

50|$|A kepenek is a Turkish {{traditional}} shepherd's outer garment. It is a sleeveless, buttonless garment made of felt worn on {{the shoulders}} and covering the whole body from shoulders down. It is made of three parts: one for back and two (the same as the back, cut in half along the length) for the front. The parts are stitched together along the <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> {{and all the way}} down. Usually white, a copenek may have some adornments.|$|R
50|$|The {{shoulder}} pad fashion carried {{over from the}} late 1980s with some popularity in the early 1990s, but the wearer's tastes were changing due to the backlash against 1980s culture. Some designers continued to produce ranges featuring {{shoulder pad}}s into the mid-1990s, as shoulder pads were prominent in women's formal suits, and matching top-bottom attire, highly exampled in The Nanny. But as the decade wore on, the styles were outdated and were shunned by young and fashion-conscious wearers. Appearances were reduced to smaller, subtler versions augmenting the <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> of jackets and coats.|$|R
5000|$|Castillo, {{together}} with Pierre Balmain, Cristóbal Balenciaga, and Christian Dior, was {{considered one of}} the most promising of the new generation of Paris designers to emerge after World War II. In 1945, Elizabeth Arden persuaded him to join her salon in New York and he worked there till 1950. He produced collections based on natural <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> and slim silhouettes, topped with samell hats. He was also in demand during the 40's as a costume designer for the New York Metropolitan Opera Company and for several Broadway shows.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1940s to about 1951, some dresses {{featured}} a soft, smaller shoulder pad {{with so little}} padding as to be barely noticeable. Its function {{seems to have been}} to slightly shape the <b>shoulder</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

On the northwest is a large island (Carghill Island) or peninsula that fills much of the torso. The Hayes Rivers enters from the southwest and exits from the 'head' southeast below the town and airport of Oxford House, Manitoba. The Carrot River enters on the northwest and allows a portage to Cross Lake, Manitoba on the Nelson River. Downstream is Knee Lake.|$|E

40|$|This NebGuide {{provides}} {{instructions on}} how to make and attach shoulder shapes and sleeve heads to give jackets and coats a smooth, professional look. Padding or shaping through the shoulder area gives a smooth appearance to a jacket or coat. It also helps to fill out the hollow just beneath the front shoulder and is useful to disguise such figure faults as round, thin, narrow or sloping shoulders. If one shoulder is higher than the other, one shoulder can be padded more than the other so that the garment <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> are the same when the garment is worn. Making your own shoulder shapes gives a more exact fit to your garment...|$|R
5000|$|Clothes {{transformed}} from boxy styles, with square shoulders, to feminine and luxurious, with soft <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines,</b> corseted waists, round padded hips, and long skirts, {{leading to the}} knee-length [...] "sack" [...] dress. The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s. The introduction of new fabrics, including Terylene, Orlon, Banlon, Acrilan and Poplin, allowed for new fashion styles to be both created and introduced. Among these were the [...] "wash-and-wear" [...] sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the [...] "drip-dry" [...] skirt. Skirts of this era known as circle skirts were supported by layers of petticoats, creating a circular look that accentuated the waist line. Essentially, the petticoat reinforced the femininity of this period.|$|R
50|$|In Norway, yellow {{lines are}} used to {{separate}} traffic moving in opposite directions and on the left shoulders of paved roads, and white lines {{are used to}} separate traffic moving in the same direction, and on the right shoulders of paved roads. On roads narrower than 6 m, the centerline is removed, and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> are broken. Short, broken lines means passing is allowed, long, broken lines means passing is allowed but dangerous, and a double yellow line means passing is forbidden. Roads with speed limits below 60 km/h that indicate that passing is allowed but dangerous, has a very short yellow line instead of a long one. On motorways, the left shoulder is a yellow line, like in the US. Most other European countries use white lines for all these types of lines.|$|R

5000|$|In International Standard, many skilled ballroom {{partners}} {{strive to}} keep their <b>shoulder</b> <b>lines</b> close to parallel throughout a promenade, {{by means of an}} internal rotational stretch {{which is one of the}} more elusive dance concepts. Some expansion of the hold may often be seen, in the form of the leader stretching diagonally forwards and the follower diagonally back, each of course retaining their own largely independent balance. Diagonal movement across the feet and placement of the step of the inside foot into Contra body movement position may reduce the amount of hip turnout required for free movement. With proper foot usage, no sacrifice of motion is required to maintain this position.
