A multitude of people still swarmed over these ruins, and the huge openwork stagings in the distance from which started in times <b>of</b> peace the <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> to the various great cities of Europe and America, were also black with the victors.

The study {{purpose is to}} present the scientifically explored technique of decision acception about the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> which operated according to the economic requirements {{under the condition that}} the airframe operation reliability will not become lesser than the standard reliability at any operation period. The assessment technique <b>of</b> gamma <b>service</b> life <b>of</b> <b>aeroplane</b> wing according to the cracking condition during the operation process and during the test process has been suggested. The equivalent between the rig loading conditions (the load aggregate) and one flight in the operation, the <b>service</b> life <b>of</b> wing zone according to the test results have been determined.
