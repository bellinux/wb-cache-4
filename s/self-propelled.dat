5|$|Holt also {{produced}} a 75mm <b>self-propelled</b> gun that could travel at , exceeding the military requirement of , and climb a 45-degree slope. Before the work could be completed, the Armistice was signed {{and the war}} ended. <b>Self-propelled</b> artillery however did not garner attention again {{until the end of}} the 1930s, just before World War II.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 21/22 October 1944, Private Ernest Alvia ("Smokey") Smith used a PIAT to destroy a German Mark V Panther tank, one of three Panthers and two <b>self-propelled</b> guns attacking his small group. The <b>self-propelled</b> {{vehicles}} were also knocked out. He then used a Thompson submachine gun to kill or repel about 30 enemy soldiers. His actions secured a bridgehead on the Savio River in Italy.|$|E

5|$|The Panzer IV was {{the most}} widely {{manufactured}} German tank of the Second World War, with some 8,500 built. The Panzer IV {{was used as the}} base for many other fighting vehicles, including the Sturmgeschütz IV assault gun, Jagdpanzer IV tank destroyer, the Wirbelwind <b>self-propelled</b> anti-aircraft gun, and the Brummbär <b>self-propelled</b> gun.|$|E
5|$|By 25 September, {{the area}} {{occupied}} by the Lonsdale Force saw heavy fighting against <b>self-propelled</b> guns, flamethrower tanks, and infantry. There were no PIATs available to the force by now; instead Cain armed himself with a two-inch mortar. Mortars are muzzle-loading indirect fire weapons but Cain was forced to fire it on an almost horizontal plane due to the enemy's proximity. His citation states that his leadership ensured that the South Staffordshire gave no ground and drove the enemy off in complete disorder. By {{the end of the}} battle, Cain had been reportedly responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks, four of which were Tigers, {{as well as a number}} of <b>self-propelled</b> guns.|$|E
5|$|German {{industry}} produced 2,816 {{tanks and}} <b>self-propelled</b> guns between April and June, of which 156 were Tigers and 484 Panthers. At Kursk, {{a total of}} 259 Panthers, about 211 Tigers, and 90 Ferdinands were used.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, his {{regiment}} {{was withdrawn}} from the front and converted into the 395th Guards Heavy <b>Self-Propelled</b> Artillery Regiment. It was also reequipped with the updated ISU-152 <b>self-propelled</b> gun, one of which Snetkov became commander of. Snetkov and his regiment {{did not return to}} the front until June 1944, where they became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. He was promoted to lieutenant around this time, and from late June, he fought in Operation Bagration, the Soviet strategic offensive that recaptured Belarus and eastern Poland. Between 22 and 27 June, during fighting in the Bogushevsk area, Snetkov's crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a <b>self-propelled</b> gun, two bunkers, and two anti-tank guns. For this he received a second Order of the Red Star on 10 July. The regiment, as part of the front, fought in the Baltic Offensive and the Gumbinnen Operation during the fall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} week of March, the {{battalion}} finally withdrew to refit with the M18 Hellcat <b>self-propelled</b> tank destroyer. In so doing, it reverted to the old <b>self-propelled</b> battalion organisation; three companies of twelve tank destroyers, plus a fourth reconnaissance company with a platoon of pioneers. The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men were needed for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March, the 824th finished the month with a complement of 646 all ranks, down from 750.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all artillery, {{including}} howitzers, guns, anti-aircraft and rockets, were {{tasked with}} anti-tank defence. Dug-in tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns further strengthened the anti-tank defences. Anti-tank forces {{were incorporated into}} every level of command, mostly as anti-tank strong points with the majority concentrated on likely attack routes and the remainder amply spread out elsewhere. Each anti-tank strong-point typically consisted of four to six anti-tank guns, six to nine anti-tank rifles, and five to seven heavy and light machine guns. They were supported by mobile obstacle detachments {{as well as by}} infantry with automatic firearms. Independent tank and <b>self-propelled</b> gun brigades and regiments were tasked with cooperating with the infantry during counterattacks.|$|E

5|$|Soviet {{equipment}} losses {{during the}} German offensive came to 1,614tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns destroyed or damaged of the 3,925 vehicles {{committed to the}} battle. The Soviet losses were roughly three {{times larger than the}} German losses. During Operation Kutuzov, 2,349tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns were lost out of an initial strength of 2,308; a loss of over 100percent. During Polkovodets Rumyantsev 1,864tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns were lost out of the 2,439 employed. The loss ratio suffered by the Soviets was roughly 5:1 in favour of the German military. However, large Soviet reserves of equipment and their high rate of tank production enabled the Soviet tank armies to soon replace lost equipment and maintain their fighting strength. The Red Army repaired many of its damaged tanks; many Soviet tanks were rebuilt up to four times to keep them in the fight. Soviet tank strength went back up to 2,750 tanks by 3 August due to the repair of damaged vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} the T48 along the Eastern Front, mainly in Operation Bagration. The Soviet 16th Separate Tank Destroyer Brigade used {{a large number}} of T48s in 1943 during the offensive across the Dnieper River, and with the 19th Brigade during the Baranow bridgehead battle in August 1944. The T48 also served with the Soviet 22nd <b>Self-Propelled</b> Artillery Brigade. Some of these units also took part in the Berlin and Prague offensives. The Polish People's Army used T48s assigned to the 7th <b>Self-Propelled</b> Artillery Battery to support Soviet attacks into Germany and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger II {{served as}} the basis for one {{production}} variant, the Jagdtiger casemated tank destroyer, and a proposed Grille 17/21/30/42 <b>self-propelled</b> mount for heavy guns which never reached production.|$|E
5|$|Trailer – In some {{instances}} a trailer, {{which can be}} towed behind a <b>self-propelled</b> vehicle can be used. This permits flexibility in areas with minimal access to vehicles, such as on small islands.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns, with another 212 tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|After a {{stubborn}} defence, {{in which a}} number of Commandos, including Pooley, were killed, they took the battery, however, shortly afterwards they were counterattacked by German force supported by <b>self-propelled</b> artillery. Casualties during this attack were high and eventually the Commandos were forced to withdraw back to La Plein.|$|E
5|$|Although {{an earlier}} {{organization}} included a divisional anti-tank battalion (two companies of 37mm guns and one company of 75 mm guns), in December 1941 these AT battalions {{were removed from}} the divisional structure and reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions; their towed guns were replaced with <b>self-propelled</b> ones as soon as the latter became available.|$|E
5|$|In total, about 500 {{tanks and}} <b>self-propelled</b> guns of the 5th Guards Tank Army {{attacked}} {{the positions of}} the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July, doing so in two waves, with 430 tanks in the first echelon and 70 more in the second.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{personnel}} {{losses at}} Prokhorovka for 12 July were {{estimated by the}} historian Christer Bergström to have been as high as 5,500 men. For equipment damaged or destroyed, David Glantz and Jonathan House estimate that the whole 5th Guards Tank Army lost at least 400 tanks in its attacks on 12 July. The Soviet historians Grigoriy Koltunov and Boris Soloviev estimate about 300 tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns of 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed on 12 July. The study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation reports that the 2nd Guards, 18th and 29th Tanks Corps altogether permanently lost 144 tanks on 12 July, not including <b>self-propelled</b> guns. George Nipe estimates that 600–650 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed while fighting both the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Tetrarchs {{did not see}} {{any further}} combat and were deemed {{obsolete}} by 1946; the last was retired in 1950. There were several variations on the Tetrarch design, including the Alecto <b>self-propelled</b> gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII, {{but none of these}} were ever used in active service with the British Army.|$|E
5|$|The 1867–1869 Roper velocipede, or {{one like}} it, was later {{given to the}} Smithsonian by John H. Bacon, and is {{currently}} in the America on the Move exhibit in the National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C. It is the oldest <b>self-propelled</b> road vehicle in the Smithsonian, and the second oldest in America, after the Dudgeon steamer.|$|E
5|$|The Electric Fire Engine Company of Seneca Falls, New York, {{was formed}} on June 25, 1890, to {{manufacture}} the fire engine apparatus and associated equipment. The Electric Fire Engine Company of America was formed December 1899 in Des Moines, Iowa. It was to manufacture <b>self-propelled</b> automobile electric fire engines and general equipment for fire departments.|$|E
5|$|The M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage, {{also known}} as the M16 Half-track, was an American <b>self-propelled</b> {{anti-aircraft}} weapon built during World War II. It was equipped with four 0.5inch (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns in a M45 Quadmount. 2700 were produced by White Motor Company from May 1943 to March 1944, with 568 M13 MGMCs and 109 T10 Half-tracks being converted into M16s as well.|$|E
5|$|The M21 Mortar Motor Carriage (MMC) was a <b>self-propelled</b> {{artillery}} mount on a half-track chassis {{used by the}} United States Army during World War II. It {{was equipped}} with an 81mm M1 mortar and an air-cooled M2 Browning machine gun. It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944. Only 110 examples were produced.|$|E
5|$|The M5 and M6 tank mounted {{variants}} {{were used}} in several models of armored vehicles most notably in the Stuart Light Tank M3/M5, the Lee Medium Tank M3, and Greyhound Light Armored Car M8. In addition, the M3 in its original version was mated {{to a number of}} other <b>self-propelled</b> carriages.|$|E
5|$|The Panzerbeobachtungswagen IV (Pz.Beob.Wg.IV) was an {{artillery}} observation vehicle {{built on the}} Panzer IV chassis. This, too, received new radio equipment and an electrical generator, installed in the left rear corner of the fighting compartment. Panzerbeobachtungswagens worked in cooperation with Wespe and Hummel <b>self-propelled</b> artillery batteries.|$|E
5|$|The T30 Howitzer Motor Carriage (HMC) was a United States Army <b>self-propelled</b> gun used in World War II. Its {{design was}} based on {{requirements}} for an assault gun issued by the Armored Force in 1941 and it was built as an interim solution until a fully tracked design was complete.|$|E
5|$|The T48 57mm Gun Motor Carriage was a <b>self-propelled</b> {{anti-tank}} gun {{produced by the}} Diamond T company in 1943 for the United States. The design incorporated a 57 mm gun M1, a US production of the British Ordnance QF 6 pounder, mounted on an M3 Half-track.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmed}} North Korean {{losses from}} August 18 to 25 included 13 T-34 tanks, five SU-76 <b>self-propelled</b> guns, and 23 trucks. The KPA 13th Division's troops suffered heavy casualties during the fight, {{with an estimated}} 3,000 killed, wounded and captured. The division withdrew to rebuild. The North Koreans' total casualties from August 12 to 25 were 5,690 killed.|$|E
5|$|The third {{component}} of the 17th Airborne Division {{to take part in}} the operation was the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR), under the command of Colonel James Pierce. Troopers of the 194th GIR landed accurately in landing zone S, but their gliders and tow aircraft took heavy casualties; 12 C-47 transports were lost due to anti-aircraft fire, and a further 140 were damaged by the same fire. The regiment landed in the midst of a number of German artillery batteries that were engaging Allied ground forces crossing the Rhine, and as such many of the gliders were engaged by German artillery pieces that had their barrels lowered for direct-fire. However, these artillery batteries and their crews were defeated by the glider-borne troops, and the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment was soon able to report that its objectives had been secured, having destroyed 42 artillery pieces, 10 tanks, 2 <b>self-propelled</b> anti-aircraft vehicles and 5 <b>self-propelled</b> guns.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the rest}} of January and February, the {{battalion}} remained in defensive positions, with crews rotating to the neighboring 776th Tank Destroyer Battalion {{in order to train}} on <b>self-propelled</b> tank destroyers. The 824th was prepared for conversion to the new equipment by early March, but this was delayed in order to support the 100th Division's attack on Bitche as part of Operation Undertone from 15–19 March.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be <b>self-propelled</b> and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E
5|$|After {{conversion}} to M18 Hellcat <b>self-propelled</b> tank destroyers, the battalion moved into Germany, helping force a bridgehead over the Neckar River at the Battle of Heilbronn. After reaching Stuttgart it was reassigned to the 103rd Infantry Division, {{and with them}} reached Innsbruck in Austria by VE Day. After two weeks of occupation duties it was ordered to prepare for service in the Pacific; however, while it was reforming in the United States, the Japanese surrender was announced, {{and the need for}} more combat units ended. The battalion was demobilized in September 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in Europe, the 395th Guards Heavy <b>Self-Propelled</b> Artillery Regiment was {{transferred}} to the Far East for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Snetkov became its chief of intelligence and assistant chief of staff for intelligence, and ended the war with the rank of captain. Between 8 August and 3 September, the regiment fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria attached to the 5th Army, and on 8 September he received a second Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, for providing crucial intelligence gained from reconnaissance to his unit.|$|E
5|$|As {{the column}} {{approached}} Villers-Bocage, an Sd.Kfz. 231 armoured car crew observed the British advance and escaped. At 08:30, having covered , the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered {{the town to}} be greeted by celebrating residents; two German soldiers were spotted leaving at high speed in a Volkswagen Kübelwagen. The two Hussar regiments made contact with German forces {{on either side of}} the 22nd Brigade group route and the 8th Hussars engaged German eight-wheeler armoured cars. The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage, but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably <b>self-propelled</b> guns.|$|E
5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, <b>self-propelled</b> mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E
