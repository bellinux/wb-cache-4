Real estate experts blamed {{the cost of}} heating and cooling the vast atrium, heavy tenant turnover, {{and the lack of}} a theater for a space below the East Atrium. Although the D.C. Convention and Visitors Association <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Post Office was the eighth most-visited attraction in the District of Columbia, retail experts believed it had never made money, and the East Atrium did not bring in enough rent to support the Old Post Office Pavilion.|$|E

The house, worth $10,000, could not be mortgaged based on the $1,100 in donations, $400 of which went for a horse and carriage, so {{in the winter of}} 1890-91, father-in-law John Headifen [...] "came to the rescue of his (Kelly's) [...] friends and subscribed $1800", the Boston Record <b>said.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> Colony Savings Bank in Plymouth then gave a matching $2,500 loan, and with that a mortgage was obtained.

2500|$|... "The {{southern}} tribal hinterland of Baha—home to {{especially the}} Al-Ghamdi and Al-Zahrani tribes—has been renowned for centuries for their tribal cemeteries {{that are now}} slowly vanishing, according to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper... One old villager explained how tribal cemeteries came about. “People used to die in large numbers and very rapidly {{one after the other}} because of diseases. So the villagers would dig graves close by burying members of the same family in one area. That was how the family and tribal burial grounds came about,” he <b>said.</b> <b>The</b> <b>old</b> man continued, “If the family ran out of space, they would open old graves where family members had been buried before and add more people to them. This process is known as khashf.” During famines and outbreaks of epidemics huge numbers of people would die and many tribes faced difficulties in digging new graves because of the difficult weather. Elderly people remember that in olden times, the winter used to stretch for more than six months and would be accompanied with lots of rain and fog making movement difficult. But due to tribal rivalries many families would guard their cemeteries and put restrictions on who got buried in them. Across Baha burial grounds are constructed in different ways. Some cemeteries consist of underground vaults or concrete burial chambers with the capacity of holding a large number of bodies at a time. Such vaults include windows for people to peer through and are usually decorated ornately with writings, drawings and patterns. Muhammad Saleh, a local resident, said, “One {{of the things that is}} so iconic about many of these graves is the fact that many of them are not directed toward the Kaaba. This tells us that some of these graves are from the pre-Islamic era. In Islam the face of a dead person should be toward the Kaaba.”" ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1770s, {{smallpox}} (variola major) eradicated {{at least}} 30 {{percent of the}} indigenous population on the Northwest coast of North America, including the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh.

During the 80-year period from the 1770s to 1850, smallpox, measles, influenza, and other diseases had killed many villages and communities.
