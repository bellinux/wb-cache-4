Mrs Warner was working in her garden when she died in 1955, and the Public Curator permitted Mrs Florence Richardson Handley to remain in the house.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second part}} of a {{binomial}} may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in gender. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The house sparrow has the binomial name Passer domesticus. Here domesticus ("domestic") simply means [...] "associated with the house". The <b>sacred</b> <b>bamboo</b> is Nandina domestica rather than Nandina domesticus, since Nandina is feminine whereas Passer is masculine. The tropical fruit langsat {{is a product of}} the plant Lansium parasiticum, since Lansium is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are -us, -a, -um (as in the previous example of domesticus); -is, -is, -e (e.g. tristis, meaning [...] "sad"); and -or, -or, -us (e.g. minor, meaning [...] "smaller"). For further information, see Latin declension: Adjectives.|$|E

It was introduced into cultivation in 1804 and more recently escaped. It is still commonly used in landscaping with many cultivars sold commercially. It is generally ob-served as an escape in forests, fence rows, or forest margins, although often cultivated in full sun.
