5000|$|The car was {{intended}} to replace the 850 Spider, another Bertone design, not the more expensive 124 Sport spider whose production continued {{for much of the}} X1/9's life. The car's monocoque body was produced at the Bertone factory in Grugliasco (Turin) and then transported to the Fiat's Lingotto factory for final assembly. As mentioned before, the X1/9's type 128 AS [...] single overhead cam inline-four engine was derived from the Fiat 128, specifically from the 128 Coupé 1300. Changes included a new cast aluminium oil sump, complementing the aluminium cylinder head. With a twin-choke Weber 32 DMTR carburettor and an 8.9:1 compression ratio, the engine produced [...] at 6,000 rpm and [...] Nm of torque at 3,400 rpm.The all-synchronized 4-speed transmission was also carried over from the 128, though with a taller fourth gear ratio to exploit the sports car's better aerodynamics. As a consequence the X1/9 had a top speed of over 170 km/h, 10 km/h higher than the similarly engined but 65 kg lighter 128 Coupé 1300.As standard the X1/9 came with 4.5J×13-inch stamped steel wheels fitted with 145 HR 13 tyres, while cast alloy wheels were an extra-cost option.Suspensions were all-independent, of the MacPherson type on both axles. The <b>split</b> <b>circuit</b> brake system used equally sized 227 mm discs all around. [...] Steering was rack and pinion.The interior, upholstered in leatherette, featured two bucket seats with integrated headrests and a four-spoke steering wheel (resembling the one fitted to the Lamborghini Marzal).|$|E
40|$|As {{thousands}} of individuals {{surf the internet}} daily, every image on every web page is saved automatically to their computer’s cache, absent user direction. Sections 2252 (a) (2) and 2252 (a) (4) (B) of Title 18 of the U. S. Code criminalize knowing possession and knowing receipt of child pornography images. For the defendant who intentionally saves illicit images to his computer, the cache simply verifies already-proven knowing possession or receipt. However, for the defendant who only views child pornography online, the presence of images in the cache {{may not be enough}} to prove knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. How can the prosecution prove a defendant knowingly received an image he has potentially never seen? How can a prosecutor prove a defendant knowingly possessed an image that may have been a pop-up? Questions like these have <b>split</b> <b>circuit</b> courts over the application of § 2252 (a) (2). Several circuit courts have confronted cases with defendants who undoubtedly viewed child pornography images online, but who only left one clue as to their “knowing” receipt—the presence of images in the cache. The Tenth Circuit found that absent direct proof that a defendant viewed the image, the presence of a file in the cache is not enough to meet the “knowing receipt” standard. The Eleventh and Fifth Circuits disagreed, holding that a pattern of seeking out images satisfies the knowledge requirement. This Note analyzes the split and concludes that the presence of images in the cache proves a defendant’s knowing receipt. The Tenth Circuit’s demand of “direct proof of viewership of the image in question” imposes impossible evidentiary requirements. Defendants who view child pornography online have satisfied § 2252 (a) (2) ’s mens rea requirement even without direct proof of viewership of the image in question...|$|E
40|$|Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wird die partitionierte Simulation elektrischer Schaltkreise untersucht. Hierbei handelt es sich um eine Technik, verschiedene Teile eines Schaltkreises auf unterschiedliche Weise numerisch zu behandeln um eine Simulation für den Gesamtkreis zu erhalten. Dabei wird besonderes Augenmerk auf zwei Dinge gelegt. Zum einen sollen sämtliche analytischen Resultate eine graphentheoretische Interpretation zulassen. Diese Bedingung resultiert daraus, dass Schaltkreisgleichungen häufig sehr hochdimensional und schlecht skaliert sind und eine Behandlung mit Standardmethoden der linearen Algebra sehr schwierig wird. Die zweite Bedingung ist, dass die erarbeiteten Methoden so formuliert werden, dass sie leicht in existierende Software zur Schaltungssimulation integriert werden können. In dieser Arbeit wird der weitverbreitete Schaltkreissimulator SPICE als Referenzprogramm verwendet. Zunächst werden die benötigten Grundlagen aus der Theorie der differentiell-algebraischen Gleichungen, der Graphentheorie und der Schaltungssimulation vorgestellt. Anschließend wird die Methode der dynamischen Iteration als Mittel zur gekoppelten Simulation partitionierter dynamischer Systeme präsentiert. Dabei wird insbesondere auf die fundamentalen Unterschiede im Konvergenzverhalten zwischen gewöhnlichen Differentialgleichungen und differentiell-algebraischen Gleichungen eingegangen. Es werden hinreichende Konvergenzkriterien für den Fall allgemeiner gekoppelter differentiell-algebraischer Gleichungen erörtert und diese dann für semi-explizite Systeme spezifiziert. Desweiteren werden für diese Systeme modifizierte dynamische Iterationsverfahren vorgeschlagen, welche die Konvergenz des Verfahrens erzwingen und beschleunigen können. Anschließend werden die erbrachten Resultate auf den Spezialfall von partitionierten Schaltungsgleichungen angewandt. Dazu wird zuerst eine Methode vorgestellt, die es ermöglicht, die Schaltkreisgleichungen so zu partitionieren, dass eine elementspezifische Trennung möglich ist und die entstehenden Teilsysteme weiterhin als Schaltkreise interpretiert werden können. Für die Klasse von partitionierten Widerstandsnetzwerken wurden Konvergenzkriterien hergeleitet, die zu großen Teilen auf graphentheoretischen Überlegungen basieren. Desweiteren werden die zuvor vorgestellten Methoden zur Konvergenzbeschleunigung erfolgreich auf Schaltkreise angewandt. Dabei können sämtliche notwendigen Gleichungstransformationen als Modifikationen des Schaltkreises selbst interpretiert werden. Die erhaltenen Resultate für Widerstandsnetzwerke werden dann auf den Fall von partitionierten RCL-Schaltkreisen verallgemeinert. Nach diesen analytischen Betrachtungen werden die Aspekte der numerischen Durchführung von dynamischen Iterationsverfahren erörtert. Dabei wird ein erweitertes Konvergenzkriterium vorgestellt, welches die bei der approximativen Lösung von dynamischen Systemen auftretenden Fehler mit einbezieht. Desweiteren wird der Einfluss von Makroschrittweiten auf die Effizienz des dynamischen Iterationsverfahrens erläutert und eine einfache Schrittweitensteuerung vorgeschlagen. Abschließend werden die gewonnenen theoretischen Erkenntnisse anhand von vier Beispielen verifiziert. The {{purpose of}} this thesis was the {{analysis}} of partitioned simulation of electrical circuits. Special emphasis {{has been put on}} two points. First, the analytical results should have graph theoretical interpretations. This requirement is {{based on the fact that}} the differential-algebraic equations arising in circuit simulation are often very large and badly scaled and do not allow an analysis with standard tools from linear algebra, such as SVD. And secondly, all developed methods shall work with standard circuit simulation tools, such that these methods can easily be included into existing software. The widely used circuit simulation tool SPICE and the corresponding netlist format have been used as reference. Some basic concepts from analysis and linear algebra, together with a brief introduction into the theory of DAEs, graph theory and circuit simulation were given in Chapter 2. The method of choice for the setup of circuit equations was the Modified Nodal Analysis. We have also presented concepts of expressing range, kernel and rank of circuit related matrices with the help of graph structures such as loops and cutsets. In Chapter 3, we have reviewed the basic concepts of Dynamic Iteration methods for the solution of partitioned ODEs and DAEs. For these two types of dynamic systems, the convergence behaviour of the Dynamic Iteration process is fundamentally different. Sufficient criteria for convergence have been presented. While for ODEs, under very weak assumptions, rapid convergence of the method can always be expected, the convergence behaviour of Dynamic Iteration for DAEs depends on the spectral properties of a problem specific matrix. We have mainly restricted our considerations to Dynamic Iteration methods for DAEs of differentiation index one that are coupled in a special way. The block Jacobi and block Gauss-Seidel methods, which are well-known from matrix iterative analysis can easily be extended to the problem of Dynamic Iteration for coupled systems of semi-explicit DAEs. In this case, the convergence criterion becomes easier to check. Also, some approaches for a modified Dynamic Iteration method to guarantee convergence for semi-explicit DAEs with the block Jacobi and block Gauss-Seidel methods have been proposed. In Chapter 4, these results were applied to the task of partitioned circuit simulation. We have first presented an overlap-free splitting technique that allows an interpretation of the <b>split</b> <b>circuit</b> equations as circuit netlist. For the analysis of Dynamic Iteration methods for circuits, we only allow resistive, capacitive and inductive elements as well as independent sources. This restriction was necessary for a concise characterization of convergence behaviour. We have first investigated the convergence behaviour for purely resistive circuits and shown how the freedom in the splitting of the circuit influences the speed of convergence. However, it was not possible to construct a convergent method for all cases in this way. We have then extended the obtained results to RCL circuits. It was possible to show that these circuits can be analyzed using the results from the resistive case for three specially constructed subcircuits of the RCL circuit. The results for resistive circuits then carry over to the more general RCL case. The problem of nonconvergence was addressed in Section 4. 4, where methods have been developed that force or accelerate convergence of the Dynamic Iteration method by extending certain parts of the circuit. The more numerical aspects of Dynamic Iteration were investigated in Chapter 5. For the previous results, it has been assumed that all equations were exactly solvable. In this chapter, we take errors from numerical integration and interpolation of previous solutions into account. We were able to state a convergence result for Dynamic Iteration methods that include these errors. Furthermore, we have investigated the influence of macro step sizes on work load and approximation errors and devised a simple but functional macro step size controller. The obtained results have been validated in Chapter 6 with the help of four examples. The used circuit simulation software is the freely available code SPICE. Concluding, we have shown that the Dynamic Iteration approach is an easy and effective way to simulate different parts of a circuit using different solvers. This may be less efficient than a SPICE simulation of the full circuit. However, in cases where this is not possible, e. g., for the simulation of circuits with PDE device models, Dynamic Iteration becomes very efficient and is easily implemented into existing simulation software environments...|$|E

40|$|Flotation {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{concentration}} processes being employed for many classes of minerals (sulfides, oxides, silicates, phosphates, for example) at different particle sizes. In the iron ore industry, reverse quartz flotation has been successfully employed for particle sizes below ISOfim after the desliming process. The high demand for iron ore products has made flotation the main process for concentration in this industry, thus a better understanding of its mechanisms and the effect of the particle sizes in the process has become imperative. Flotation tests were carried out with three different size fractions of an itabirite iron ore, obtained using cyclone classification after desliming. The results showed distinct behaviors of the different size ranges. Higher etheramine dosages are required when coarse and fine fractions are floated separately and also this procedure is more sensitive to variations in etheramine dosages and pH values. The differences in particle size distributions and the specific surface area may explain the different flotation behavior of the distinct size fractions. The <b>split</b> flotation <b>circuits</b> for coarse and fine particles indicated an increase of 3 % points in the metallurgical recovery with reduction of SiO 2 content in final concentrate, increase of etheramine dosage and reduction of corn starch dosage.
