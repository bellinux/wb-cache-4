40|$|This IPIN {{presents}} {{results from}} a time study of final overstorey harvesting in a Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) uniform shelterwood of Sitka spruce. This operation used mechanised harvesting in tree sizes with a mean dbh of 42 cm amongst well developed natural regeneration. Motor manual felling was required for trees beyond the capacity of harvester felling, due to diameter and/or coarse branching. <b>Shortwood</b> <b>harvesting</b> was carried out {{with the aim of}} removing the overstorey and releasing the well developed (natural regeneration) understorey. A John Deere 1270 D harvester was used for felling and timber extraction was carried out with a John Deere 1110 D forwarder. The mature overstorey included many large trees, consequently mechanised harvester outputs were high at 30. 15 m 3 OB/shr 1 at a cost of £ 2. 30 per m 3 OB. Motor manual felling and partial processing to assist the harvester produced an output of 8. 50 m 3 OB/shr at a cost of £ 3. 07 per m 3 OB (an addition of £ 0. 35 per m 3 OB proportionally across the study area). Forwarding outputs were also high at 18. 63 m 3 OB/ 100 m for extraction to roadside at a cost of £ 2. 88 per m 3 OB/ 100 m. Harvesting was carried out with good integration of motor manual and mechanised techniques. The total cost of harvesting and extraction to roadside using mechanised harvester and forwarder incorporating motor manual felling was £ 5. 70 per m 3 OB over an average extraction distance of 102 m fo...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in uneven-aged forestry {{has been increasing}} in Britain, particularly for sensitive areas such as recreation and amenity forests. Literature on the economics of uneven-aged forestry is scarce and few operational, uneven-aged forests are available for study. Therefore, in order to quantify the operating costs associated with uneven-aged forestry, a modelling approach was chosen. The resulting model is written in FORTRAN and uses a series of square two-dimensional arrays to represent a block of forest. The block may then be managed by clearfelling and replanting at a specified age, or by a system of group management {{with a choice of}} four group sizes. The resulting model was then used to investigate the effect of the following management strategies on operating times: 1. Varying the scale of working (i. e. the group size and forest size) in the uneven-aged forest. 2. Using <b>shortwood</b> or pole-length <b>harvesting</b> systems and a range of machine types within each harvesting system. 3. Varying the length of time taken to transform the structure of the forest from even-aged to uneven-aged. 4. Varying the age of the trees when the transformation from even-aged to uneven-aged structure begins. The results obtained from running the model show that the time taken to carry out an operation is influenced both by the absolute size of the group within the forest block and by the number of groups of that size within the forest block. This fragmentation effect explains why {{it is difficult to determine}} the absolute costs of working for a specific group size, because it is the combination of group size, number of groups and forest block size, which determines costs. Most of the results below are based on a range of group sizes from 1. 000 ha. to 0. 0625 ha., with a block size of 16 ha. Forwarders were penalized when the group size was decreased to 0. 0625 ha.
