5|$|On June5, 1908, Sebree {{was nearly}} killed during a speed {{trial of the}} Tennessee {{off the coast of}} California. He had just {{completed}} a tour of the starboard boiler room when a <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> burst, instantly killing two officers and wounding ten others, three fatally. Witnesses reported that Sebree and other officers had left the boiler room only 50 seconds earlier.|$|E
5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} while the two British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main <b>steam</b> <b>pipe.</b> The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|E
5|$|After {{destroying}} his workshop, Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot out the door, and then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E
50|$|The smokebox {{incorporates}} the main <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> from the regulator (or superheater header), one leading to each valve chest, {{a part of}} the cylinder casting. These may pass through the smokebox wall to join with the cylinder (outside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes)</b> or may stay within the profile of the smokebox (inside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes).</b> Inside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> do not require lagging as the smokebox keeps them warm, but outside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> are more common for locomotives with cylinders outside the frames. Some locomotive classes used both types depending on the date the batch was constructed (e.g. LNER Class V2).|$|R

50|$|These Yugoslav-built {{examples}} {{differ in}} minor details, but principally {{the use of}} plate frames instead of bar frames, resulting in a higher boiler pitch. This in turn leads to distinct shoulder on the <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> (the American-built examples having straight <b>steam</b> <b>pipes)</b> and smaller domes which have a flat top so they are not higher than the cab roof.|$|R
5|$|Dartmouth—faster than Bristol—closed to {{effective}} engagement range with the Austro-Hungarian ships, and opened fire. A shell from Dartmouth struck Novara, {{at which point}} the Austro-Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance. Dartmouth was struck several times, and by 11:00, Acton ordered the ship to reduce speed to allow Bristol to catch up. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> had been damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. At 11:05, Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E
5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from the precinct where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he saved his life by gunning down a homeless man, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> after escaping the bathroom and now uses a cane and prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E
5|$|Sebree's final mission {{before his}} {{retirement}} saw him lead the Pacific Fleet {{on a tour}} of ports in east Asia. The fleet left San Francisco on September5, 1909, sailing west to the Philippines, with only brief stops en route. Speed testing was a major goal of {{the early part of the}} voyage and he and his fleet of eight ships broke speed records by sailing to Honolulu in just over four days. Six of the eight ships were able to make the voyage in that time; the Colorado and West Virginia had mechanical failures which prevented them from completing the voyage on time. On the Colorado, those failures led to the deaths of two crewmen due to a <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> explosion. From Hawaii, the fleet moved on to Manila where the ships performed target practices and exercises, as well as being cleaned and repainted, before resuming their primary mission by sailing to Yokohama, Japan. In Japan, the fleet dispersed and small groups of cruisers were dispatched to the ports of British-controlled Hong Kong, Wusong in China, and Kobe, Japan. Afterwards, the fleet returned home. Just before Sebree's retirement the Pacific Fleet was split into two: a smaller Pacific Fleet and an Asiatic Fleet commanded by Rear Admiral John Hubbard. On February19, 1910, Sebree officially retired and was replaced as head of the Pacific Fleet by Rear Admiral Giles B. Harber.|$|E

25|$|For the Restaging, the {{replica of}} Novelty was {{too slow to}} meet the {{requirements}} of the original trials and did not complete the course. The maximum speed attained at any point was , possibly because the main <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> from the boiler was restricting the flow to the cylinders. The valve gear was also set incorrectly (indicated by the odd noise of the exhaust beats).|$|E
25|$|The Meyer {{design was}} {{modified}} {{by moving the}} rear power unit further back and allowed the firebox to be between the two power units (as in a Garratt), thus allowing a larger firebox. The length of engine was increased, with the extra length behind the cab being used for additional water tanks. Some designs had an auxiliary chimney at the rear to avoid {{the need for an}} exhaust <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> running the length of the engine.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the design}} is that the firebox is directly above the rear power unit, which limits its size. With two power bogies, flexible <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> must be provided to all cylinders. This was difficult to achieve with 19th Century technology. Early Mallet locomotives had compound cylinders, so high pressure steam was provided to the rigid power unit, while the front cylinders (requiring flexible <b>steam</b> <b>pipes)</b> received low pressure steam.|$|R
50|$|The most {{noticeable}} external {{difference from the}} experimental Class MD engine was the altered arrangement of the main <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> necessitated by the superheater. Instead of being led vertically down from the dome directly to the high-pressure cylinders, an internal pipe {{was taken from the}} regulator valve in the dome to the superheater in the smokebox, from where it was brought back to the high-pressure cylinders by external <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> arranged under the running boards.|$|R

25|$|Unlike in Garratt's patent, Tasmanian Railways {{insisted on}} a {{compound}} arrangement with cylinders facing inwards, {{in order to reduce}} the distances between both the main <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> and the high-pressure cylinders, and between the high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders. This made the locomotive unnecessarily complicated and placed the high-pressure cylinders directly underneath the cab, making it uncomfortably hot, especially in summer. The pattern was not repeated on later Garratt designs. Only one more Garratt locomotive, again built by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in 1927, was produced with compound propulsion for the Burma Railways.|$|E
25|$|The II {{torpedo boat}} {{flotilla}} encountered the II Light Cruiser Squadron commanded by William Goodenough and the XI destroyer flotilla commanded by Commodore Hawksley on HMS Castor. There was still enough light for the attackers to be spotted before getting sufficiently close, {{and they were}} forced to retreat to the west. The VI flotilla was also forced back west, receiving fire for 20 minutes at ranges of 3,300 to 5,500 yards. S50 was struck by a shell which severed a main <b>steam</b> <b>pipe,</b> reducing her speed to 25 knots, affecting her steering and electrical power so that she had to return to the main fleet. Lahs turned eastward again at 2110 and Schuur at 2140, but now found themselves too far north. The attack was abandoned and the destroyers headed for the Skaw and a return to Germany, together with the third flotilla which had also become left behind.|$|E
500|$|Columbus had {{at least}} three accidents. In June 1895 she {{suffered}} an explosion caused by a <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> becoming disconnected while she was underway. Accounts differ, but some claim that this happened during a race with her rival, Virginia. In July 1905, she collided with the schooner Ralph Campbell in the Chicago River. On June 30, 1917, {{she was involved in}} her most serious accident, a collision with a water tower. The collision happened in Milwaukee while she was being maneuvered by tugs away from her dock. The Milwaukee River current caught her, spinning her sideways, and her bow sheared off two legs of the Yahr-Lang Drug Company's water tower, toppling it and flooding Columbus decks with about [...] The collision killed 16passengers and severely damaged her pilot house, putting her out of service {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

500|$|On 1 January 1899 {{the ship}} was reassigned to the 1st Light Division and her most notable {{activities}} for the year were visits to the Balearic Islands and ports in the Aegean Sea and Middle East. Her main <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> fractured on 20 February and injured three crewmen. Chanzy was repaired in time {{to participate in the}} annual maneuvers and spent three weeks in September attached to the elderly gunnery ship [...] before making a cruise to French North Africa. The ship began a brief deployment to the Levant on 1 February 1901 and returned on 4 April for the annual maneuvers before returning to the Levant on 30 October. She arrived back at Toulon on 1 February 1902 and began a long period of relative inactivity that lasted until she was formally placed in reserve when the new armored cruiser [...] replaced her in the squadron in May 1904.|$|E
500|$|During the {{withdrawal}} from the battle {{on the night of}} 31 May at around 23:30, the battlecruisers Moltke and Seydlitz passed ahead of Stettin too closely, forcing her to slow down. The rest of the IV Scouting Group did not notice the reduction in speed, and so the ships became disorganized. Shortly thereafter, the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron came upon the German cruisers, which were joined by Hamburg, , and [...] A ferocious firefight at very close range ensued; Stettin was hit twice early in the engagement and was set on fire. A shell fragment punctured the <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> for the ship's siren, and the escaping steam impaired visibility and forced the ship to abandon an attempt to launch torpedoes. In the melee, [...] was hit by approximately eighteen 10.5cm shells, including some from Stettin. In the meantime, the German cruiser Frauenlob was set on fire and sunk; as the German cruisers turned to avoid colliding with the sinking wreck, the IV Scouting Group became dispersed.

By 09:00, the faster British cruisers had {{caught up to}} the Austro-Hungarian vessels, and both sides called for reinforcements; a flotilla centered on the armored cruiser [...] was sent to assist Horthy's cruisers. Dartmouth opened fire first and scored a hit on Novara, and the three Austro-Hungarian cruisers laid smoke screens and turned back toward their pursuers, scoring several hits on Dartmouth in the process. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> were damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. Horthy was badly injured as well, though he remained in command. At 11:05, the Entente commander, Admiral Alfredo Acton, turned away {{in an attempt to}} separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E
