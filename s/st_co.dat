40|$|Some {{reflections}} on the reform of the exequatur procedure in Italy. Legislative Decree 1 September 2011 n. 150 has changed the exequatur procedure in force in Italy stating that this procedure should be celebrated {{according to the rules}} of the "rite summary of cognition" under Chapter III bis of Title I of Book IV of the Civil Procedure Code. It remains, however, the competence in a single grade of the Court of Appeals with jurisdiction on the place of implementation of the foreign decision. This reform brings some obvious difficulties on which the author focuses both for the literal interpretation of the new regulations and to ensure proper systematic reconstruction of the general framework. This framework, in fact, is very complex because, in Italy, in the area of exequatur, should be duly taken into account, in addition to the common regulation, the various special regulations posed as implementation of international obligations and / or regulations - still binding for the Italian courts - posed by the European Union; all enjoying these regulations, although for different reasons, a force of privileged incidence on internal legislation in force of the principle of primacy of EU law over national law or {{as a result of the}} principles now (since 2001) consecrated in the art. 117, 1 <b>st</b> <b>co.,</b> Const.

The aim of {{the study}} reported here was to investigate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction between udenafil and dapoxetine in healthy male subjects. Methods: An open-label, three-treatment, six-sequence, three-period crossover study was performed in healthy male subjects. In varying sequences, each subjects received single oral doses of udenafil 200 mg, dapoxetine 60 mg, and both treatments. The periods were separated by a washout period of 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected up to 48 hours after dosing. The plasma concentrations of udenafil and dapoxetine were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by non-compartmental analysis. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study. Results: Twenty-three healthy subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratios of the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to last measurable time point and measured peak plasma concentration for udenafil were 0. 923 (90 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 863 – 0. 987) and 0. 864 (90 % CI: 0. 789 – 0. 947), respectively. The geometric mean ratios of the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to last measurable time point and measured peak plasma concentration for dapoxetine were 1. 125 (90 % CI: 1. 044 – 1. 213) and 0. 837 (90 % CI: 0. 758 – 0. 925), respectively. There were no serious adverse events reported, and none of the subjects dropped out due to adverse events.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and tolerability profiles of DA- 2802 were compared to those of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Viread®) in healthy subjects. A randomized, open-label, single-dose study was conducted in 36 healthy subjects using a two-treatment, two-period, and two-sequence crossover design. Subjects received a single oral dose of 319  mg DA- 2802 or 300 mg TDF, during each period, with a 7 -day washout. Serial blood samples were collected pre-dosing and up to 72 hours post-dosing in each period, for determination of serum tenofovir concentration, which was measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A non-compartmental method was used to obtain PK parameters of tenofovir. For comparison between the two tenofovir disoproxil salts, the 90 % confidence intervals (90 % CIs) of geometric mean ratios of DA- 2802 to TDF for the maximum concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration–time curve to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0 –t) were determined. The tolerability profiles of tenofovir were assessed by evaluation of adverse events and vital signs, physical examination, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. The serum tenofovir concentration–time profiles of DA- 2802 or TDF were comparable in 32 subjects who completed the study. In both profiles, a two-compartmental elimination with first-order elimination kinetics in the terminal phase was reported in a few subjects, showing a secondary peak in the initial phase of elimination. The geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of DA- 2802 to TDF was 0. 898 (0. 815 – 0. 990) for Cmax and 0. 904 (0. 836 – 0. 978) for AUC 0 –t.

We investigated the potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between evogliptin and metformin. A randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, six-sequence, three-period crossover study was conducted in 36 healthy male subjects. All subjects received three treatments, separated by 7 -day washout intervals: evogliptin, 5 mg od for 7 days (EVO); metformin IR, 1, 000 mg bid for 7 days (MET); and the combination of EVO and MET (EVO + MET). After the last dose in a period, serial blood samples were collected for 24 hours for pharmacokinetic assessments. During steady state, serial blood samples were collected for 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test, and DPP- 4, active glucagon-like peptide- 1, glucose, glucagon, insulin, and C-peptide were measured to assess pharmacodynamic properties. EVO + MET and EVO showed similar steady state maximum concentration and area under the concentration–time curve at steady state values for evogliptin; the geometric mean ratios (90 % confidence interval) were 1. 06 (1. 01 – 1. 12) and 1. 02 (0. 99 – 1. 06), respectively. EVO + MET slightly reduced steady state maximum concentration and area under the concentration–time curve at steady state values for metformin compared to MET, with geometric mean ratios (90 % confidence interval) of 0. 84 (0. 79 – 0. 89) and 0. 94 (0. 89 – 0. 98), respectively. EVO + MET and EVO had similar DPP- 4 inhibition efficacy, but EVO + MET increased active glucagon-like peptide- 1 and reduced glucose to larger extents than either EVO or MET alone. Our results suggested that EVO+MET could provide therapeutic benefits without clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions. Thus, the EVO + MET combination is a promising option for treating type  2 diabetes mellitus. Keywords: type 2 diabetes, drug interaction, DA- 1229, DPP- 4 inhibitor, OGT...|$|E

Subjects and methods: A randomized, double-blind, two-sequence, crossover study was conducted. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single dose, that is, 4, 000  IU, of the test or comparator epoetin alfa. After 4 weeks, all subjects received the alternative formulation. The primary PK parameters, maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), were calculated with the serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations from blood samples collected for 144 h after dosing. The reticulocyte, hematocrit, hemoglobin and red blood cell counts were measured up to 312 h as PD markers. The primary PD parameters, maximum observed effect (Emax) and area under the effect curve (AUEC), were obtained from the baseline-corrected reticulocyte count. The serum EPO concentration and the reticulocyte count were used to assess the concentration–response relationship. The tolerability and immunogenicity profiles were assessed together. Results: Forty-two subjects completed the study. The mean EPO concentration–time profiles were comparable between the two formulations. The geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) of the Cmax and AUCinf were 0. 908 (0. 843 – 0. 978) and 1. 049 (0. 999 – 1. 101), respectively, both of which were within the regulatory range of 0. 80 – 1. 25. Additionally, the PD and tolerability profiles were similar between the two formulations. The time-matched serum EPO concentration and PD markers presented a counterclockwise hysteresis, suggesting a time delay between the measured concentration and the response. Both formulations were well tolerated, and production of anti-drug antibodies was not observed. Conclusion: The two epoetin alfa formulations had similar PK, PD and tolerability profiles. Furthermore, both formulations had a similar time-matched serum EPO concentration and erythropoietic response profile. Thus, the two formulations are expected to be used interchangeably in clinical settings. Keywords: epoetin alfa, erythropoietin, anemia, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and tolerability of evogliptin after repeated oral administration in healthy subjects. Patients and methods: A block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study was performed in a total of 30 subjects. Repeated once-daily doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg evogliptin or the same doses of placebo were orally administered to ten subjects in each dosage group for 10 days. Subjects in each group were randomized to receive evogliptin or placebo with a ratio of 8 : 2. Pharmacokinetics of evogliptin were evaluated, with its concentrations in serial plasma and urine samples collected following the first and last administrations. DPP-IV activity and glucagon-like peptide- 1, glucose, and insulin levels were quantified to evaluate evogliptin&# 39;s pharmacodynamics on the first and last dosing days. Results: All participants completed the study without any serious or severe adverse event. The evogliptin plasma concentration reached its peak within 4 – 5 hours and decreased relatively slowly, with a terminal elimination half-life of 33 – 39 hours. Repeated administration resulted in a 1. 4 - to 1. 5 -fold accumulation. Evogliptin&# 39;s systemic exposure and inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity increased in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of DPP-IV activity > 80 % was sustained over 24 hours in all evogliptin dose groups and provided an increase in postprandial active glucagon-like peptide- 1 levels by 1. 5 - to 2. 4 -fold. Postprandial glucose levels in the evogliptin-treated groups were reduced 20 %– 35 % compared to placebo, but were not accompanied by increased insulin levels. Conclusion: Repeated administration of evogliptin in healthy subjects was well tolerated and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics within the 5 – 20 mg dose range. A once-daily regimen of 5 – 20 mg evogliptin effectively inhibited DPP-IV activity. Keywords: DPP-IV, GLP- 1, insulin, glucagon-like peptide- 1, glucos...|$|E
