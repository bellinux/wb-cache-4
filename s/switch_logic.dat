40|$|Abstract. For {{a system}} that can operate in {{multiple}} different modes, we define the <b>switching</b> <b>logic</b> synthesis problem as follows: given {{a description of the}} dynamics in each mode of the system, find the conditions for switching between the modes so that the resulting system satisfies some desired properties. In this paper, we present an approach for solving the <b>switching</b> <b>logic</b> synthesis problem in the case when (i) the dynamics in each mode of the system are given using differential equations and, hence, the synthesized system is a hybrid system, and (ii) the desired property is a safety property. Our approach for solving the <b>switching</b> <b>logic</b> synthesis problem, called the constraint-based approach, consists of two steps. In the first constraint generation step, the synthesis problem is reduced to satisfiability of a quantified formula over the theory of reals. In the second constraint solving step, the quantified formula is solved. This paper focuses on constraint generation. The constraint generation step is based on the concept of a controlled inductive invariant. The search for controlled inductive invariant is cast as a constraint solving problem. The controlled inductive invariant is then used to arrive at the maximally liberal <b>switching</b> <b>logic.</b> We prove that the synthesized <b>switching</b> <b>logic</b> always gives us a well-formed and safe hybrid system. When the system, the safety property, and the controlled inductive invariant are all expressed only using polynomials, the generated constraint is an ∃ ∀ formula in the theory of reals, whose satisfiability is decidable...|$|R

40|$|A high {{throughput}} scalable decoder architecture, a tiling {{approach to}} reduce {{the complexity of the}} scalable architecture, and two low power decoding schemes have been proposed in this research. The proposed scalable design is generated from a serial architecture by scaling the combinational logic; memory partitioning and constructing a novel H matrix to make parallelization possible. The scalable architecture achieves a high throughput for higher values of the parallelization factor M. The <b>switch</b> <b>logic</b> used to route the bit nodes to the appropriate checks is an important constituent of the scalable architecture and its complexity is high with higher M. The proposed tiling approach is applied to the scalable architecture to simplify the <b>switch</b> <b>logic</b> and reduce gate complexity. The tiling approach generates patterns that are used to construct the H matrix by repeating a fixed number of those generated patterns. The advantages of the proposed approach are two-fold. First, the information stored about the H matrix is reduced by onethird. Second, the <b>switch</b> <b>logic</b> of the scalable architecture is simplified. The H matrix information is also embedded in the switch and no external memory is needed to store the H matrix. Scalable architecture and tiling approach are proposed at the architectural level of the LDPC decoder. We propose two low power decoding schemes that take advantage of the distribution of errors in the received packets. Both schemes use a hard iteration after a fixed number of soft iterations. The dynamic scheme performs X soft iterations, then a parity checker cHT that computes the number of parity checks in error. Based on cHT value, the decoder decides on performing either soft iterations or a hard iteration. The advantage of the hard iteration is so significant that the second low power scheme performs a fixed number of iterations followed by a hard iteration. To compensate the bit error rate performance, the number of soft iterations in this case is higher than that of those performed before cHT in the first scheme...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Lyapunov-based <b>switching</b> <b>logic</b> within the {{framework}} of adaptive mixing control (AMC), where a weighted combination of a family of candidate controllers can be inserted in the loop to regulate the output of an uncertain plant. The proposed AMC scheme employs a bank of parallel estimators, or multiple estimators, together with a <b>switching</b> <b>logic</b> that orchestrates which estimate should be evaluated by the mixer. The <b>switching</b> <b>logic</b> is driven by input/output data and uses Lyapunov-based criteria to assess the best estimate among the bank of parallel estimates. The resulting scheme guarantees convergence of the switching signal in finite time to a controller that satisfies a Lyapunov inequality implying a prescribed stability margin. The problem of convergence to the desired controller is addressed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, most classes of continuous tuning adaptive control or switching adaptive control schemes do not guarantee that after the switching stops or the adaptation is switched off the resulting closed loop linear time-invariant (LTI) system is stable, unless there is sufficient plant excitation that guarantees convergence to the desired fixed parameter controller. The proposed scheme guarantees that if the desired controller is switched on, it will never be switched off thereafter. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate that while alternative adaptation methods can converge to an LTI unstable feedback loop, the proposed scheme consistently converges to the desired controller.
