The objective was to study the effect of Kalk Salpetcr (KS), ammonium sulphates (AS), and urea compositions and N-dosages on quality of Besuki cigar tobacco. The treatment consisted of two factors i. e. fertilizer composition and N dosages. The first factor was 5 levels of fertilizer composition, i. e.

The treatments were arranged in factorially randomized block design with 3 replications. Planting space was double row (100 + 70) cm x 40 cm wiUi a population of 168 plants per plot.

IPR Juriti and Pérola grown in plots (soil type = Dystrophic Red Latosol) using a no-tillage system under a thick mulch of millet residues at the Experimental Station of UNESP-Ilha Solteira campus, located in Selvíria, MS (Köppen climate type = Aw) during autumn (March/June) and winter (June/September) 2005. For each cultivar, a randomized block experimental design was used with four replicates and factorially arranged treatments equivalent to 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg. ha- 1 added nitrogen (as urea, containing 45 % of N) applied as a <b>side</b> <b>dressing</b> during the V 4 - 3 and V 4 - 6 phenological stage corresponding to the 3 rd and 6 th completely opened trifoliolate leaf on the main stem.

The length of spikes and the spikelets number for spikes increased significantly with N doses; the doses of N increased leaf N content, the spikes number for meter, the mass of 100 grains and the grain yield up to 77, 74, 68 and 70 kg ha- 1 of N, respectively. It is recommended, seeking the productivity of grains, the application of 70 kg ha- 1 of N, at <b>side</b> <b>dressing,</b> to any cultivar...|$|E
40|$|No ano agrícola 1983 / 84, conduziu-se um exerimento num Latossolo Vermelho-Escuro álico na Estação Experimental de Mococa, SP, plantando o sorgo {{cultivar}} Contigrão 111 em parcelas que receberam calagem em 1980 nas doses equivalentes a 1, 4, 7 e 10 t/ha de calcário dolomítico, e foram cultivadas por três anos com soja. Nas subparcelas, aplicaram-se 0, 40, 80 e 120 kg/ha de nitrogênio em cobertura 35 dias depois da germinação. Os resultados mostraram que a calagem elevou substancialmente a produção, mesmo com a drástica deficiência hídrica ocorrida na fase reprodutiva da cultura. A calagem eliminou as limitações impostas pela toxicidade de alumínio e aumentou a disponibilidade do nitrogênio proveniente dos restos da cultura de soja. Em todos os níveis de calagem, houve aumento linear de concentração de nitrogênio nas folhas de sorgo, em função das doses de nitrogênio em cobertura, mas as quantidades necessárias para atingir níveis adequados de N nas folhas foram substancialmente reduzidas nos níveis mais altos de calagem. An {{experiment was}} {{conducted during the}} summer of 1983 / 84 in a clay textured allic, dark red Latosol at Mococa Experimental Station, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Sorghum Contigrão 111 was planted in plots that had received the equivalent to 1, 4, 7 and 10 t/ ha of dolomitic limestone in 1980. These plots were cultivated continuously with soybeans during the three previous years. In the subplots, 0, 40, 80 and 120 of N were applied as <b>side</b> <b>dressing</b> 35 days after germination. The results showed that liming increased the yield of grain sorghum despite the drought at the seed filling stage. It also decreased the toxic effect of aluminum and increased the availability of N from the residues of previous soybean crops. At all the liming rates a linear increase was observed in the leaf N concentration {{as a function of the}} rates of nitrogen applied as <b>side</b> <b>dressing.</b> The quantity of N fertilizer required to attain adequate leaf N concentration was substancially reduced at the higher rates of lime applied...|$|E
50|$|The stage show {{featured}} Elhaida Dani {{dressed in}} a black costume with an attached cape that had embedded crystals. Dani delivered the song from the centre of the stage while three female backing vocalists were set to her <b>side,</b> <b>dressed</b> in black outfits. The stage lighting created a dark atmosphere with the background LED screens displaying moving rays and shapes in yellow and cream colours. The three backing vocalists that joined Elhaida Dani on stage were Gerona Hyska, Olsa Papandili and Erga Halilaj.|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge is}} a {{combined}} arch and beam bridge made of three reinforced concrete beams vaulted underneath and resting on two supports. Its vertical <b>sides</b> <b>dressed</b> in granite, {{the bridge is}} 11,1 metres wide with a 6,7 metres wide roadway. In contrast to the parallel bridge Malmskillnadsbron, the Bridge of Regeringsgatan is using three arches to cross Kungsgatan; the central span, 14,5 metres in length, passes over the roadway below; while the two spans on it sides, 5,5 metres in length, passes over the pavements of Kungsgatan. The unwieldy intermediate supports makes effective usage of the street width below impossible, and substituting the present construction have therefore been suggested.|$|R
