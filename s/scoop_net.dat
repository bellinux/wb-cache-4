Dal's commercial fisheries are particularly reliant on carp fish species, which were introduced into the lake in 1957.

Fishermen use a locally manufactured cast net which comprises six parts with a diameter of 6 metres. It is operated from a wooden fishing boat made out of deodar, typically 20ftx4ft in size.

Total annual average fish production in the estuary declined significantly to 908. 6 t with average yield of 5. 4 kg ha- 1 day- 1, when compared to earlier study; where 2747 t was reported. During the present study, 60 species of finfishes (belonging to 34 finfish families), 6 species of penaeid shrimps, 2 species of palaemonid prawns, 2 species of crabs (4 crustacean families), 6 species of bivalves (3 molluscan families) were noticed. Finfishes were the major group that contributed 69. 62 % of total fishery in the estuary and crustaceans (23. 47 %), bivalves (6. 84 %) and oysters (0. 07 %) also formed good fishery. Many of the fish species in the estuary were observed as threatened (Horabagrus brachysoma, Channa striatus, Channa marulius, Clarias batrachus, Heteropneustes fossilis and Wallago attu). The major fishing gears employed in the estuary were gillnets, cast <b>nets,</b> stake <b>nets,</b> <b>scoop</b> <b>nets,</b> ring nets, traps and Chinese dip nets. Gillnets contributed 45 % of the total fish catch. Gillnets also showed highest catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 6. 91 kg h- 1 followed by cast nets (1. 85 kg h- 1), Chinese dip nets (3. 20 kg h- 1), stake nets (3. 05 kg h- 1), ring nets (1. 27 kg h- 1), hooks and lines (1. 35 kg h- 1) and <b>scoop</b> <b>nets</b> (0. 92 kg h- 1).

Economic losses of juvenile bycatch were $ 1 – 331 /boat/trip. In Songkhla, the crisis problem area, economic losses from light luring falling net were as high as 0. 42 – 7. 64 times of the return from anchovy. The losses from light luring anchovy purse seine were 23 – 35 % of the return from anchovy. The losses from light luring <b>scoop</b> <b>net</b> varied around 2 – 7 %. Anchovy catch values in Thailand was $ 26 million in 1997. Value added from processing was $ 65 million, mainly from fish sauce. In spite of low value added, 59 % of the catches were processed as boiled-dried/dried anchovy mainly for export. 44 % of the anchovy value in the importing country were the trade margins, including tax, in importing country. Fishing cost was 20 %. This cost estimation did not include the economic loss from juvenile bycatch. Processing and marketing costs in Thailand amounted to 19 %. Profit margins for domestic fishermen, processors and traders added up to 17 %. Thailand might have been exporting anchovy at an underpaid resource value. The relatively better return from anchovy had led to rapid increase in anchovy fishing effort. If fishing effort exceeded carrying capacity especially in habitats of juvenile economic species, it could lead to decrease in fishing income due to resource depletion not only for artisanal fishermen but anchovy fishermen as well.
