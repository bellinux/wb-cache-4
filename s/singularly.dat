5|$|Columns {{that are}} often {{deployed}} <b>singularly,</b> supporting plain arches and thus displaying {{the influence of the}} earlier and much plainer Norman period (Illustration 3). Columns are rarely encountered, as elsewhere in Europe, in clustered groups acting as piers, especially in examples of early Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to basic troops, there are Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) who according to Bungie's mythology are collectives of worm-like aliens, <b>singularly</b> known as Lekgolo, encased in tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular shields and razor-sharp spines.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such as gold, copper, and iron {{may have been}} noticed in prehistory and, {{in light of their}} malleability, led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons. All metals discovered from then until 1809 had relatively high densities; their heaviness was regarded as a <b>singularly</b> distinguishing criterion.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Democratic foe of Bradley {{had begun}} his {{rise to power}} in the Kentucky Senate. Kenton County's William Goebel became {{the leader of a}} new group of young Democrats who were seen as enemies of large corporations, particularly the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and friends of the working man. Goebel was known as aloof and calculating. Unmarried and with few close friends of either gender, he was <b>singularly</b> driven by political power.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its original Famicom release, Final Fantasy II was re-released on the WonderSwan Color in 2001, and both <b>singularly</b> {{and as part of}} a collection with Final Fantasy I for the PlayStation in 2002. It was released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls, on the PlayStation Portable in 2007, and for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console on June 16, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing {{shift in the}} environmental movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused <b>singularly</b> on solely preserving {{the natural beauty of}} a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Alan Grant, {{a writer}} from Scotland, {{got his start}} on 2000 AD as an {{assistant}} writer for John Wagner. Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner's {{in the creation of}} Judge Dredd comic strips. These stories were noted favorably for their use of socio-political commentary and satire. Together, the duo acquired employment with DC Comics. Dennis O'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988, hoping they would bring their gritty, violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines. Soon after, Wagner left the company, leaving Grant to continue the run on his own. Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd, Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book, and avoided using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations. Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe. Anarky was conceived <b>singularly</b> by Grant {{as a result of these}} circumstances, and Grant's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years.|$|E
5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, their mates, and offspring. Such a group is called a pride. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition if more than one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either <b>singularly</b> or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrous may allow nomad males to approach them.|$|E
5|$|A diurnal species (active mainly {{during the}} day), the meat ant shows minimal {{interaction}} with nocturnal ant species when their territories overlap. The meat ant {{and other members}} of the I. purpureus species group are regarded as a dominant group of diurnal species in Australia, as they are highly active, aggressive, and have an enormous geographical range. During the day, the bulk of the workers attend and feed on honeydew secreted by insects that live on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees. These trees are connected by foraging trails formed by meat ants, which also connect to satellite nests that are a part of a single colony; these trails are easily visible due to the absence of vegetation and lead to important food and water sources. Other workers in smaller numbers will often scavenge around the nest area for dead insects, or other proteinaceous foods to bring back to their colony. Their dominance is clear when meat ants are capable of finding food sources more successfully than most ants, capable of displacing many ants and other insects. Food sources are also discovered more rapidly and greatly reduces the foraging efficiency of other ants, including those of Iridomyrmex. However, some ants such as the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) are not affected by the presence of meat ants and are still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are general predators and forage <b>singularly</b> and cannot recruit other nestmates, they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They heavily rely on any food source and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to its peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants. This means green-head ants avoid conflict with meat ants. Certain myrmicines, which are highly competitive, are capable of defending themselves from foraging workers; the rapid recruitment of nestmates and the use of chemicals for defence allows them to withstand attacks from meat ants. In particular, Monomorium ants have been observed occupying baits regardless of the presence or absence of the meat ant. This is not the case with mealworms, but they have moderate success with honey baits. In foraging areas where meat ants are excluded or not present, the number of other ants observed is far greater and activity dramatically increases. However, the presence of meats ants does not affect abundant species, and most of the time it is only Iridomyrmex ants that increase their foraging rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{new company}} {{developed}} the high-speed inline-two Phönix, for which Maybach invented a spray carburettor. This was fitted in a <b>singularly</b> ugly car, which entered production in 1895 after a {{cessation of hostilities}} between Daimler, Maybach, and the DMG board.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the racism issue, Ponting denied he had done {{anything}} wrong by <b>singularly</b> reporting Harbhajan. Ponting stated that he was obligated to refer any incidents of racism to officials, as it was widely agreed among the cricket community that racism is unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Giovanni's {{maternal}} {{family was}} <b>singularly</b> distinguished {{in the arts}} and scholarship of the Italian Renaissance. His cousin and contemporary was the poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, who grew up under the influence of his own uncle, the Florentine patron of the arts and scholar-poet Tito Vespasiano Strozzi.|$|E
25|$|The University of the Andes is {{not located}} in a single central campus, but in rather smaller campuses and branches; {{most of which are}} {{scattered}} across the andean and <b>singularly</b> university city of Mérida, while the others are located in different states of the country, with their respective library alongside.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission of}} the California Institute of Technology is to expand human {{knowledge}} and benefit society through research integrated with education. We investigate the most challenging, fundamental problems {{in science and technology}} in a <b>singularly</b> collegial, interdisciplinary atmosphere, while educating outstanding students to become creative members of society.|$|E
25|$|However, dancers with masks of old man {{can also}} have a comic function, {{as a kind of}} side show to the main event, {{performing}} <b>singularly</b> or in pairs. They often control crowds and sometimes have their own performances. This role of and old man/clown goes back before the Conquest.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet partisans in Latvia were Soviet partisans {{who were}} {{deployed}} to Latvia {{and attempted to}} wage guerrilla warfare against the German armed forces during the German occupation of Latvia. Partisan activity was <b>singularly</b> unsuccessful in Latvia due to the general resistance of the population to the Soviet regime that the partisans represented.|$|E
25|$|The Parsee tour of England in 1886 was {{the first}} cricket tour of England by a team from India. While the tour was <b>singularly</b> {{unsuccessful}} in terms of results, it {{paved the way for}} another trip by the Parsees two years later and more tours by English teams to India in the next decade.|$|E
25|$|He {{maintained}} daily diaries in Sanskrit {{which were}} used fully while writing his autobiography. In spite of profound scholarship, {{he wrote in}} very simple Hindi that a common person could follow. He wrote books of varied interest. He was aware of limitations of Hindi literature and <b>singularly</b> made up the loss in no small measure.|$|E
25|$|Although perhaps <b>singularly</b> most {{responsible}} {{for the destruction of}} pagan sites, including massacres, such as the Massacre of Verden and the subsequent dismantling of ancient tribal ruling systems, the Frankish emperor Charlemagne of The Holy Roman Empire is said to have acquired a substantial collection of Germanic songs, which was deliberately destroyed after his death by his successor, Louis the Pious.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006, Kervezee {{played his}} first List A matches, for Netherlands A against India A and Pakistan A cricket team at Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi. The Netherlands A team were badly beaten in both games, but Kervezee's scores of 26 and 25 {{were among the}} highest in each Dutch innings. His bowling was <b>singularly</b> unsuccessful, however, with his four overs going for 39 runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{more modern}} Psovaya Borzaya {{was founded on}} Stepnaya, Hortaya and the Ukrainian-Polish version of the old Hort. There were also imports of Western sighthound breeds {{to add to the}} height and weight. It was crossed as well with the Russian Laika {{specifically}} and <b>singularly</b> to add resistance against Northern cold and a longer and thicker coat than the Southern sighthounds were equipped with.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the early}} disciples was U Shwe Ngong, a teacher and leader {{of a group of}} intellectuals {{dissatisfied}} with Buddhism, who were attracted to the new faith. He was a Deist skeptic to whose mind the preaching of Judson, once a college skeptic himself, was <b>singularly</b> challenging. After consideration, he assured Judson that he was ready to believe in God, Jesus Christ, and the atonement.|$|E
25|$|After leaving college, Blount {{became known}} as the most <b>singularly</b> devoted {{musician}} in Birmingham. He rarely slept, citing Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and Napoleon as fellow highly productive cat-nappers. He transformed the first floor of his family's home into a conservatory-workshop, where he wrote songs, transcribed recordings, rehearsed with the many musicians who drifted in and out, and discussed Biblical and esoteric concepts with whoever was interested.|$|E
25|$|The {{institution}} for which Merion Station was <b>singularly</b> world-renowned was the Barnes Foundation, an important art collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings amassed by drug entrepreneur Albert C. Barnes {{that since the}} 1920s had been housed in a granite mansion with gardens on Latches Lane. The Barnes collection has been moved to a newly designed museum building on Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Center City Philadelphia that includes a replication of Barnes's original gallery in Merion.|$|E
25|$|Early the {{following}} morning, the destroyer suffered {{a series of}} shattering internal explosions. By 06:50, she took on a 16° starboard list; and explosions, mostly in the ammunition stowage areas, continued to stagger the stricken destroyer. Then, at about 07:50, a <b>singularly</b> violent explosion caused her to capsize and sink. The tip of her bow remained above water until about 08:27 when she disappeared completely taking with her 15 officers and 123 men.|$|E
25|$|Gütschow {{returned}} to Germany with Carl Zeiss Jena of the 2. Bundesliga, {{but had a}} <b>singularly</b> unsuccessful season, making only nine league appearances and failing to score. He left Jena after one year, and followed this with single-year spells at two other 2. Liga clubs – Hannover 96 and Chemnitzer FC. He had more personal success in both these seasons, scoring 16 and 15 goals respectively, but the latter ended in relegation for Chemnitz.|$|E
25|$|In East Asia, the {{swastika}} is {{prevalent in}} Buddhist monasteries and communities. It is {{commonly found in}} Buddhist temples, religious artefacts, texts related to Buddhism and schools founded by Buddhist religious groups. It also appears as a design or motif (<b>singularly</b> or woven into a pattern) on textiles, architecture and various decorative objects {{as a symbol of}} luck and good fortune. The icon is also found as a sacred symbol in the Bon tradition, but in the left facing mode.|$|E
25|$|The Herakleion Archaeological Museum {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most {{important}} museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. It houses representative artifacts from all the periods of Cretan prehistory and history, covering a chronological span of over 5,500 years from the Neolithic period to Roman times. The <b>singularly</b> important Minoan collection contains unique examples of Minoan art, many of them true masterpieces. The Heraklion Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Plastoglobuli {{were once}} thought to be {{free-floating}} in the stroma, but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid, a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network. In normal green chloroplasts, the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur <b>singularly,</b> attached directly to their parent thylakoid. In old or stressed chloroplasts, plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains, still always anchored to a thylakoid.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before he}} had propounded the atomic theory, Dalton had {{attained}} a considerable scientific reputation. In 1803, he was chosen to give a series of lectures on natural philosophy at the Royal Institution in London, and he delivered another series of lectures there in 1809–1810. Some witnesses reported that he was deficient in the qualities that make an attractive lecturer, being harsh and indistinct in voice, ineffective {{in the treatment of}} his subject, and <b>singularly</b> wanting in the language and power of illustration.|$|E
25|$|A radio {{telescope}} {{is a form}} of directional radio antenna used in radio astronomy. They differ from optical telescopes in that they operate in the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum where they can detect and collect data on radio sources. Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic or dish antenna used <b>singularly</b> or in an array. Karl Guthe Jansky started the field of radio astronomy serendipitous in 1932 when his directional antenna found radio static that he later identified as coming from the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|There are varying {{texts in}} the Sephardic version; in some traditions the hymn {{comprises}} six stanzas of two verses each, but the fourth (which is but an amplification of the third) is omitted by the Ashkenazim, in others it has 15 lines, in yet others it has 16 lines. For so widespread and beloved a hymn, the traditional tunes are <b>singularly</b> few. Only {{four or five}} of them deserve to be called traditional. Of these the oldest appears to be a short melody of Spanish origin.|$|E
25|$|Like Antonescu and Potopeanu, Pântea faced {{trial in}} front of the newly created People's Tribunal. In the end, he was acquitted, since Yelena Rudenko and Tolbukhin {{informed}} the Romanian state about Pântea's honorable conduct, and since the Allied Commission recommended his release. Pântea was arrested on several other occasions, but, <b>singularly</b> among Romanians prosecuted for war crimes, he was acquitted each time. Although his rivals in the Transnistrian administration were by then destroying evidence of his more positive role in the affairs of state, Pântea preserved certified copies as a precautionary measure.|$|E
25|$|The AIF played {{many of its}} {{first-class}} {{matches in}} England over three days although the County Championship that year consisted (for the only time ever {{as it was a}} <b>singularly</b> unsuccessful venture) of two-day matches. AIF's first match against a county team started on 17 May at the County Ground, Leyton, against Essex and skipper Charlie Kelleway with 126 made the team's first century. Gregory with seven wickets in the match gave notice of his potential. AIF won inside two days by an innings and 114 runs against a team led by England captain Johnny Douglas who could only contribute 0 and 14.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Hutus—who {{comprised}} a significant {{majority of the}} Rwandan population—were being manipulated as political tools by President Juvénal Habyarimana’s regime. Under an imposed order to democratize, Habyarimana rallied the majority Hutus against what he depicted as their racial enemy—the Tutsis—in a measure to prevent both regional and class division from becoming politically relevant issues. Thus, this political climate ensured that national identity would be defined <b>singularly</b> across ethnic lines—a dangerous prelude to the ensuing genocide. The tense situation became inflamed with Habyarimana’s mysterious death in 1994. Quickly, Hutu administration implemented a policy to kill any and all Tutsi—a process believed to be simplified by identity cards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, World War I erupted in Europe. European socialists were <b>singularly</b> unable to stop the march of their various {{national}} governments to a particularly bloody conflagration. Algie Simons made the effort to write to both Ramsay MacDonald and Keir Hardie, leaders of the British Independent Labour Party, urging them to {{make every effort to}} keep the Second International alive, thereby preserving lines of communication with the socialists of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Though both parties agreed in the desirability of the policy which Simons advocated, they proved incapable of its implementation, as the belligerent national governments of both sides shut down all means of contact.|$|E
