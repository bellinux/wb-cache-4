5000|$|Chain stitch is {{a sewing}} and {{embroidery}} technique {{in which a}} series of looped stitches form a chain-like pattern. Chain stitch is an ancient craft - examples of surviving Chinese chain stitch embroidery worked in silk thread have been dated to the Warring States period (5th - 3rd century BC). Handmade chain stitch embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric. For this reason the stitch is an effective surface embellishment near <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> <b>finished</b> fabric. Because chain stitches can form flowing, curved lines, they are used in many surface embroidery styles that mimic [...] "drawing" [...] in thread.|$|R

30|$|The lignites of the Barmer basin are chiefly {{composed}} of the huminite group of macerals while the liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in low concentrations. There is not much variation in the maceral composition from Seam-I to Seam-VIII. Huminite (85.9  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis) is comprised mainly of telohuminite and detrohuminite. Telohuminite is mainly contributed by ulminite-A (24.4  %) and ulminite-B (20.9  %). Detrohuminite consists of densinite (32.2  %) and attrinite (7.6  %). Gelohuminite is present in very small amounts. Among the liptinites (8.8  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis), resinite (5 – 40  µm) (5  %) sporinite (1.1  %), cutinite (0.5  %) are common. Few sections show megaspores and megacuticles. Few patches of suberinite are seen, showing clearly developed cortex cells. Among the inertinites (5.3  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis), fusinite (2.2  %) with bogen structure was observed especially in Seam-IV and VIII. Seam-I and Seam-VI from the Giral mine have shown good fungal bodies. Mineral matter (11.6  vol%, mean of all the seams) occurs in moderate concentration in all the seams of the Giral mine.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first use}} of this {{technique}} {{goes back to the}} 1920s, when leather, canvas and vinyl were sometimes used along with landau bars, to give a fairly accurate reproduction of a horse-drawn carriage's movable top.
