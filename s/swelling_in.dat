5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in his ankle. An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> a weight-bearing bone in his ankle. Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E
5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and <b>swelling.</b> <b>In</b> both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E

40|$|Dumbbell-shaped <b>swellings</b> <b>in</b> {{neurofibroma}} {{have been}} commonly {{described in the}} spine, thorax, cranial cavity, and pelvis; however, dumbbell-shaped <b>swellings</b> <b>in</b> the peripheries are rare. Here, we report a dumbbell-shaped neurofibroma over the pinna in an 18 -year-old female patient, its successful surgical management, and its association with Hashimoto thyroiditis. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first ever case to be reported of a dumbbell-shaped neurofibroma over the external ear and only the fourth case of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) to be associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis...|$|R
5|$|The spores are {{smooth and}} cylindrical, {{sometimes}} {{with a slight}} <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the middle, and sometimes slightly curved; they measure 59–65 by 4–5µm. G.glutinosum spores have between two and seven septa, although three is most typical in mature specimens. The thin-walled asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, eight-spored, and typically measure 200–265µm long by 12–16µm wide. Ascospores occupy about the upper two-thirds to three-quarters of the ascus, leaving a hyaline (transparent) base. The paraphyses, hyaline at the base and brown in the upper regions, are 4–11µm wide, and longer than the asci. Cells {{at the end of}} the paraphyses are pear-shaped (piriform) or spherical, brownish, and measure 8–10µm wide. The sticky material on the stipe is a gelatinous matrix made of a layer of paraphyses.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E

25|$|The ectospermalege is a <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the abdomen, often folded, {{filled with}} hemocytes. The ectospermalege is visible {{externally}} in most bed bug species, giving the male a target {{through which to}} impale the female with the paramere. In species without an externally visible ectospermalege, traumatic insemination takes place {{over a wide range}} of the body surface.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms vary {{according}} to the abnormality, but often feature poor muscle tone and motor function, seizures, developmental delays, mental retardation, failure to grow and thrive, difficulties with feeding, <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the extremities, and a smaller than normal head. Most infants with an NMD appear normal, but some disorders have characteristic facial or skull features that can be recognized by a neurologist.|$|E

25|$|The {{incubation}} period is 2 to 14 days, with most symptoms appearing between 4 and 6 days after infection. Rarely, gonorrhea may cause skin lesions and joint infection (pain and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the joints) after {{traveling through the}} blood stream (see below). Very rarely it may settle in the heart causing endocarditis or in the spinal column causing meningitis (both are more likely among individuals with suppressed immune systems, however).|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} whether {{prasterone}} is safe for long-term use. Some researchers believe prasterone supplements might actually raise {{the risk of breast}} cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Prasterone may stimulate tumor growth in types of cancer that are sensitive to hormones, such as some types of breast, uterine, and prostate cancer. Prasterone may increase prostate <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} signs of {{testicular}} cancer is often a lump or <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine testicular self-exams. However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they {{have a family history of}} cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self-examinations for all young men.|$|E
25|$|An {{atheroma}} is {{an accumulation}} of degenerative material in the inner layer of an artery wall. The material consists of mostly macrophage cells, or debris, containing lipids, calcium and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue. The accumulated material forms a <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the artery wall, which may intrude into the channel of the artery, narrowing it and restricting blood flow. Atheroma occurs in atherosclerosis, {{which is one of}} the three subtypes of arteriosclerosis (which are atherosclerosis, Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis).|$|E
25|$|Like other cancers arising in {{the head}} and neck region, HPV+OPC may be an {{asymptomatic}} incidental finding of an abnormality in the mouth, by the patient or a health professional, present with local symptoms such as difficulties with speech, swallowing, and breathing as well as pain and infection, or as a <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the neck if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes there. These may be accompanied by more general symptoms such as loss of appetite, weight loss and weakness.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} vary {{depending}} on the type of hernia. Symptoms may or may not be present in some inguinal hernias. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the groin or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt. When standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the scrotum around the testicular area.|$|E
25|$|At maximal doses, and {{sometimes}} at much lower doses, {{side effects of}} iodide used for medical reasons, in doses of 1000 times the normal nutritional need, may include: acne, loss of appetite, or upset stomach (especially during the first several days, as the body adjusts to the medication). More severe side effects which require notification of a physician are: fever, weakness, unusual tiredness, <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> the neck or throat, mouth sores, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, irregular heartbeat, numbness or tingling of the hands or feet, or a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
25|$|UNC beat Duke for an 8th {{straight}} year, {{the last}} lose coming in 2003. Dwight Jones broke the single season reception record with 79 receptions for the season.

In addition, Giovani Bernard ran for a season high 165 rushing yards. Duke quarterback, Sean Renfree, {{was taken out of}} the game during the third quarter due to numbness and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> his right hand.

50|$|The {{association}} {{found between}} female fertility and sexual <b>swelling</b> size <b>in</b> {{several species of}} macaque offers support for this hypothesis. Specifically, females of low fertility, such as adolescents, exhibited substantially larger swellings than adults of a higher fertility level. Research remains fairly consistent across animal species; female yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) who struggle to conceive are, on average, those that display the most prominent sexual <b>swellings.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, some {{have been critical of}} the sensory exploitation theory; they uphold the belief that, if female sexual swellings were not honest signals of female fertility, males would have evolved to identify differences in female quality or to have equal preference over females with different swelling sizes.|$|R
