A new in vivo bioassay has demonstrated the male determinant of the <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> system to be contained within the pollen coating, and this determinant to be a low molecular mass protein. A combination of data from interspecific studies and molecular analysis of PCP-A proteins indicates that the primary interaction between PCP-A 1 and the receptor complex may be involved in establishing compatibility, while other molecular interactions, perhaps involving other PCP-A class proteins, are responsible for regulating S-specific rejection of self grains.

The survey results have identified no additional trees to the P. cordata already known in Plymouth and have indicated a complete isolation (despite the abundance of suckers) of the known wild sites of P. cordata; located within the Site of Special Scientific Interest at Plymbridge Lane and Estover Road. This is due to the fragmentation of natural corridors in which P. cordata thrive (Devon Banks) and <b>self</b> – <b>incompatibility</b> as studies conducted by Jackson (1994) suggests.

40|$|Transition zones between morphologically {{different}} {{individuals of}} the same species provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of gene-flow barriers. Here we investigate Tritoniopsis revoluta, which has geographically variable tube lengths, thought to be adaptations to insects with different proboscis lengths. We found a narrow transition zone between plants differing by three-fold in perianth tube length. We determined whether strong gene-flow barriers result from assortative mating arising from different pollinators, a high prevalence of <b>selfing,</b> or post-pollination <b>incompatibilities</b> between plants with different tube lengths. We found that there was little evidence to support assortative mating through different pollinators. Both short- and long-tubed plants were mainly visited by bees with short proboscides. Selfing is unlikely to contribute significantly to seed set, plants with different tube lengths were interfertile and hybrid plants were fertile. We conclude that the contact zone is unstable because these ecotypes have not accrued enough allopatric differences to translate into strong gene-flow barriers, or, alternatively, bimodality is not a consequence of secondary contact but the result of a novel mutation for short tubes spreading through a long-tubed population. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R

30|$|Reproduction is {{the life}} process which ensures the perpetuation of life and genetic {{diversity}} is mainly generated through recombination processes in sexual reproduction, which is, hence, a process of fundamental importance for population and species biology (Maynard 1978). For successful cultivation and conservation of plants a detailed knowledge of their reproductive biology is required (Moza and Bhatnagar 2007). Reproductive biology mainly focuses on flowering phenology, floral biology, pollen-pollinator interaction, breeding systems and gene flow through pollen and seeds. The task of plant phenology is to observe and record the periodically recurring growth stages and to study the regularities and dependency of the yearly cycles of development on environmental conditions. In plants phenological events such as bud-burst, leaf-expansion, leaf-abscission, flowering, fertilisation, seed set, fruiting, seed dispersal and seed germination all take place in due season. Plant breeding systems extent from full self compatibility to full <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> <b>Self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> {{reduces the risk of}} inbreeding depression by limiting the number of compatible mating pairs, while self compatibility eliminates mate limitation by allowing each individual to self-fertilize. In some plants the fruit set in open pollinated flowers will be very low. This phenomenon is usually observed in hermaphroditic plants (Sutherland, 1986) which exhibit self-incompatibility. Low fruit set in nature may be largely due to a high incidence of self-pollination and a high level of selfincompatibility, but several other causes, such as resource limitation and position of fruit within inflorescences, may also be involved (Bawa and Webb, 1984).|$|E

40|$|This is a {{historical}} and philosophical investigation into western theatrical mask practice, looking at the mask in Greek tragedy, focusing on Euripides' Bacchae, at the commedia dell' arte, focusing on the mask of Arlecchino, and at the neutral mask, focusing on the masque neutre of Jacques Lecoq. This thesis explores the historical and philosophical conditions under which these masks emerged, and enquires into how attitudes {{to the concept of}} selfhood and theatrical mask practice are related. The methodology combines the apparently disparate theories ofCarl Jung and Michel Foucault in addressing the essential, archetypal factors informing mask practice alongside the historical and the epistemic. From a philosophical perspective, my central thesis is that the mask provides a "third thing" that allows a union of opposites, in this case the self and the other, particularly {{in the form of the}} conscious and unconscious self. From a Foucauldian perspective, I argue that the development of the modem concept of the self can be characterised by three historical moments of epistemic crisis that are accompanied by significant developments in the theatrical mask. The mask, at these moments, provides, in Jungian terms, compensation for the rupturing sense of <b>self.</b> The apparent <b>incompatibility</b> of Jung and Foucault belies their common Nietzschean heritage, and I argue for a degree of functional (though not ideological) complementarity between them. I elaborate my argument to maintain that the theatrical mask has played a previously unacknowledged yet important role in the development of the western psyche, and can provide a unique insight into the development of the self. Within this context, I argue that the mask is poised to make a return to the stage, but that it has yet to find a theatrical form that transcends novelty and revivalism. I argue for the fundamental vitality of the mask as a potential force in contemporary theatre. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The olive industry has emerged as an important industry in Australia with increasing demand for both olive oil and table olives. To meet the domestic demand for olive products, it is necessary to increase production. Studies have shown that only 1 - 2 % of olive flowers mature into fruits (Martin, 1990). Insufficient pollination due to <b>self</b> and cross <b>incompatibility</b> is a major factor affecting fruit set. The various methods used for studies on compatibility relationships have often shown conflicting results, with the same cultivar being found to be self-compatible in some studies, and self-incompatible in others (Sibbett et at., 1992; Caruso et al., 1993). Also, most of these studies have been conducted in the northern hemisphere where the environmental conditions and combination of cultivars growing nearby are expected to be different from Australia. It is therefore necessary to carry out studies on compatibility relationships under natural conditions in the Australian environment. The use of molecular markers {{has been found to be}} an effective and reliable method for paternity analysis studies. Using polymorphic and codominant markers, fingerprints of embryos may be compared to markers present in the mother plant, and therefore, the paternal contribution of alleles may be identified. By comparing these alleles with the genotype of all the potential pollen donors the pollinating genotype can be identified. The aim of this project was to identify the most compatible pollen donors for five olive cultivars (Barnea, Corregiola, Koroneiki, Kalamata, and Mission) and to observe the effect of morphological characters (bloom time, percentage pollen vitality, and percentage of complete flowers) and weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, and wind direction) on pollination. The study was conducted in a mixed olive orchard in Gumeracha, South Australia over the 2002 - 2003 and 2003 - 2004 growing seasons. Prior to the study, the genotypes of the trees were compared with the standards in the database (Guerin et al., 2002) and it was found that most of the trees matched with the standard cultivars. However, the trees considered to be Manaki by the grower did not match with the standard Manaki and were therefore referred to as atypical Manaki. Also, some Pendolino, Corregiola, and Kalamata trees did not match with the standard and were also referred to as atypical. The maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, and wind direction were recorded for the bloom period of both the years. The range of maximum temperature minimum temperatures during the bloom period was similar in both years. There was more rainfall in the bloom period during the first year than during the second year. Wind direction data during the bloom period showed that the wind direction was similar in both years. The winds were mainly easterly or westerly in the mornings and mainly westerly in the afternoon. However, there were winds of lower intensities blowing in the other directions as well, thus ensuring adequate wind movement for pollen dissemination. Dates of the start of bloom, full bloom and end of bloom for each cultivar were recorded for both years. It was observed that most of the cultivars overlapped in their bloom time, although some such as Kalamata flowered late in both years. Bloom time dates for replicate trees of a cultivar were similar, but there were differences in the dates between cultivars. The percentage of complete flowers was recorded for all cultivars in both years and it was observed that King Kalamata had the lowest value (42. 5 %) in the first year and Koroneiki had the lowest value (29 %) in the second year. Leccino, atypical Manaki, and Corregiola had high percentages of complete flowers in both years. Percentage pollen vitality observations ranged from 23. 5 % in King Kalamata to 72. 3 % in Koroneiki in the first year. In the following year, UC 13 A 6 had the lowest percentage pollen vitality (19. 7 %) and Leccino had the highest value (65. 5 %). The flowers sampled from Verdale and atypical Manaki did not contain pollen in both the years. Paternity analysis showed that: Barnea embryos were mainly fertilised by Pendolino and Mission; Corregiola embryos were mainly fertilised by Mission, Kalamata, and atypical Manaki; Koroneiki embryos were mainly fertilised by Mission; Kalamata embryos were mainly fertilised by Koroneiki; and Mission embryos were mainly fertilised by Koroneiki. There were also unidentified pollen donors pollinating a significant proportion of embryos. No apparent effect of direction of canopy and distance of pollen donors was observed and it was concluded that wind movement was not a limitation for movement of pollen in the orchard. Temperature and rainfall did not have any apparent effect on the overall bloom period. Pollen vitality, time of flowering, number of trees in the orchard, and tree age may have affected the effectiveness of some cultivars as pollen donors. The results highlighted the importance of cross-pollination for fruit set. Only two instances of self-pollination were observed suggesting that cross-pollination is more effective than selfing. The results also suggest that there is genetically controlled compatibility relationship operating among the cultivars and this determined which pollen type lead to successful fruit formation. However little is known about the mechanism of incompatibility operating in olives. There were differences in the effectiveness of some pollen donors over the two years which suggests that having more than one compatible pollen donor in the orchard is important. The results obtained in this study may be used as a basis for studying the mechanism of incompatibility in olives. The compatible pollen donors identified can be used to make recommendations to olive growers regarding the combinations of olive cultivars that will maximise yield and hence boost the production of olives in Australia. The method can also be extended to other cultivars to identify compatible pollen donors and also to compare the effect of different environmental conditions on pollination. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Direct and reciprocal pollinations were performed but only the direct pollinations were scored. After counting the seeds it was concluded that success rate was very low. There was no significant correlation between the seed set and plant morphotypes. A screening for resistance against two races (1 and 4) of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris was performed. Resistant plants were found for both races. Significant differences in resistance were found for the two races and between morphotypes.

40|$|A {{range of}} observational, {{experimental}} and simulated data are analysed {{to discover how}} <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility,</b> relative bloom phenology and dormancy alleviation affect fruit set on 'Sundrop' apricot in Hawkes Bay. The derivation of two mathematical models, one of cross pollination, the other of bud development, provides a unifying theme to the study. Controlled pollination experiments demonstrated that 'Sundrop' displays gametophytic <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> Pollen tubes from 'Sundrop' pollen generally fail to penetrate styles of 'Sundrop' flowers and this prevents fruit set under Hawkes Bay conditions. Study of apricot pollen tube growth at five constant temperatures between 5 ° and 25 °C suggested that the penetration failure was not due to adverse temperature conditions since self pollen tube penetration was strongest at 10 ° and 15 °C, temperatures typical of Hawkes Bay during apricot bloom. Field observations of honey bee foragers illustrated the strong influence that weather conditions have on honey bee foraging activity, but showed that activity on 'Sundrop' flowers is normally sufficient to achieve satisfactory cross pollination. Analysis of bloom records indicated that relative times of bloom of apricots in Hawkes Bay and other North Island sites vary considerably from year to year. A simple model of pollenizer pollen transfer was therefore derived to estimate the optimum pollenizer bloom divergence for 'Sundrop'. It indicated 'Sundrop' should bloom slightly before (1 - 2 days) a pollenizer. Optimum divergence was most sensitive to the durations of pollen release and floral receptivity. Delayed pollination experiments showed that the duration of receptivity of 'Sundrop' flowers {{was the same as}} petal lifespan. Significant opportunity for cross pollination was still predicted when the pollenizer bloomed as late as six days after 'Sundrop'. By this criteria, 'Trevatt' (the most commonly-used pollenizer) appeared satisfactory under most, though not all, conditions. The pollen transfer model indicated that relative bloom phenology needed consideration for selection of pollenizers for 'Sundrop'. However, the "Utah' chill unit index was a poor predictor of dormancy alleviation and bloom for apricots under Hawkes Bay conditions. Hence, a model of low temperature-mediated alleviation of dormancy incorporating a progressive shift in bud temperature response was established based on an analysis of dormancy as the depression of a 'thermal response window' and chilling as a twofold seasonal signal controlling window size. Initial evaluation confirmed that the resulting PHYSHIFT model was highly flexible and could reproduce many of the responses that dormant buds of Prunus species display to constant and cyclic temperature regimes. Hence, the results suggest that the PHYSHIFT model may offer more reliable prediction of relative bloom timing for the purpose of pollenizer selection than chill unit models...|$|E

40|$|Unfruitfulness is a {{major problem}} in many fruit crops and their {{varieties}} result in huge loss to growers and make fruit cultivation less profitable. Unfruitfulness in fruit crops refers to the state where the plant is not capable of flowering and bearing fruit. However, the causes of unfruitfulness can be broadly grouped into two categories: Internal and external factors. Among the internal factors, dichogamy prevents self pollination in perfect as well as monoecious flowers. The occurrence of flowers with variable style length (heterostyly) is common in Prunus fruits. The proportion of aborted pollen grains varied from 22. 5 to 48. 0 % in cashewnut. In apricot cv. ‘Trevatt Blue’, multiple ovules and anthers with degenerated microspores resulted in both female and male sterility and in ‘Tokaloglu’, the reason for unfruitfulness is <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> (Gulcan and Askin, 1991). External factors, like temperature that is above 32 °C, result in desiccation of stigmatic surface and more rapid deterioration of embryo sac occurrence.

40|$|Many {{flowering}} plants {{are unable to}} set seeds with their own pollen because a system known as gametophytic self-incompatibility is operating. The basis of this system is a single multiallelic locus S, and if the S allele carried by a pollen grain matches {{one of the two}} S alleles carried in the style, as it is certain to do upon self-pollination, then pollen tube growth is inhibited. Should one of the self-pollen grains carry a mutated S allele, however, it would not match either of those carried in the style and would therefore, not be inhibited. Gametophytic self-incompatibility thus provides a mechanism for discriminating between such mutant and nonmutant pollen grains. Knowing the numbers of pollen grains available to the stigma, and also the numbers of seeds produced, it becomes possible to estimate the frequency with which mutations occur at the S locus. Assay systems of mutagenesis which employ gametophytic <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> will allow very large numbers of pollen grains to be screened for S allele mutants, which should indicate the mutagenicity of the environment. These systems have the added benefit that screening is done by the stylar tissues, rather than technicians. Finally, they may be used to construct largely autonomous assay systems which would provide continuous monitoring of the environment.

40|$|Abstract Background Previously, a {{database}} characterizing examples of Embryophyte gene family lineages showing evidence of positive selection was reported. Of the gene family trees, 138 Embryophyte branches showed Ka/Ks>> 1 and are candidates for functional adaptation. The database and these examples {{have now been}} studied in further detail {{to better understand the}} molecular basis for plant genome evolution. Results Neutral modeling showed an excess of positive and/or negative selection in the database over a neutral expectation centered on the mean Ka/Ks ratio. Out of 673 families with assigned structures, 490 have at least one branch with Ka/Ks >> 1 in a region of the protein, enabling a picture of selective pressures delineated by protein structure. Most gene families allowed reconstruction back to the last common ancestor of flowering plants (Magnoliophytes) without saturation of 4 - fold degenerate codon position. Positive selection occurred {{in a wide variety of}} gene families with different functions, including in the <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> locus, in defense against pathogens, in embryogenesis, in cold acclimation, and in electrontransport. Structurally, selective pressures were similar between alpha-helices and beta- sheets, but were less negative and more variant on the surface and away from the hydrophobic core. Conclusion Positive selection was detected statistically significantly in a small and nonrandom minority of gene families in a systematic analysis of embryophyte gene families. More sensitive methods increased the level of positive selection that was detected and presented a structural basis for the role of positive selection in plant genomes. </p...|$|E

Lam.), por fecundações artificiais em condições de casa de vegetação, cultivando-se segmentos de ramas com botões florais em vasos com água. Os resultados evidenciaram diferença de comportamento dos genótipos quanto à capacidade de produção de sementes. O genótipo SRT 252 (Rama Grossa) foi o que melhor se comportou como planta feminina, com formação de 57, 40 % de cápsulas quando cruzado com outros genótipos e 40, 20 % quando autofecundado.

Palicourea rigida is a typically distylous species of the Rubiaceae widely distributed in the Brazilian Cerrados. This work aimed to study the floral biology and breeding system of P. rigida in order to verify if there wasasymmetry between floral morphs. The work was carried out at Fazenda Água Limpa, Brasília-DF, from 1993 to 1995; and at Serra Caldas Novas State Park-Goias and in Clube Caça e Pesca Itororó de Uberlândia-Minas Gerais in 2005 and 2006. Density, height and pin/thrum ratio were assessed for flowering individuals in all areas. Plants were investigated for differences in floral morphology, nectar production, reproductive success and site of <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> reactions. Blooming period was long and concentrated during the rains. Flowers were clearly distylous and with reciprocal herkogamy. They produced nectar and lasted for a single day. In spite of differences in density and height, populations were mostly isoplethic. Nectar production varied in volume and concentration but the differences could not be associated with floral morphs. The species is self-incompatible but reproductive success was always high and independent of floral morphs. There were differences in the site of incompatibility barriers between floral morphs, which were similar to those observed for other Rubiaceae. The main floral visitors and pollinators were the hummingbirds Colibri serrirostris and Eupetomena macroura. High fruit-set indicates that the pollinators transported enough compatible pollen grains between floral morphs, despite their territorial behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} sexual {{reproduction}} in plants involves (i) the proper {{formation of the}} plant gametophytes (pollen and embryo sac) containing the gametes, (ii) the accomplishment of specific interactions between pollen grains and the stigma, which subsequently lead to (iii) the fusion of the gametes and eventually to (iv) the seed setting. Owing {{to the lack of}} mobility, plants have developed specific regulatory mechanisms to control all developmental events underlying the sexual plant reproduction according to environmental challenges. Over the last decade, redox regulation and signaling have come into sight as crucial mechanisms able to manage critical stages during sexual plant reproduction. This regulation involves a complex redox network which includes reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), glutathione and other classic buffer molecules or antioxidant proteins, and some thiol/disulphide-containing proteins belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily, like glutaredoxins (GRXs) or thioredoxins (TRXs). These proteins participate as critical elements not only in the switch between the mitotic to the meiotic cycle but also at further developmental stages of microsporogenesis. They are also implicated in the regulation of pollen rejection as the result of <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> In addition, they display precise space-temporal patterns of expression and are present in specific localizations like the stigmatic papillae or the mature pollen, although their functions and subcellular localizations are not clear yet. In this review we summarize insights and perspectives about the presence of thiol/disulphide-containing proteins in plant reproduction, taking into account the general context of the cell redox network...|$|E
40|$|Thioredoxins (TRXs) {{are small}} {{ubiquitous}} oxidoreductases involved in disulfide bond reduction {{of a large}} panel of target proteins. The most complex cluster in the family of plant TRXs is formed by h-type TRXs. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), nine members of this subgroup were described, which are less well known than their plastidial counterparts. The functional study of type-h TRXs is difficult {{because of the high}} number of isoforms and their similar biochemical characteristics, thus raising the question whether they have specific or redundant functions. Type-h TRXs are involved in seed germination and <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> in pollen-pistil interaction. Their function as antioxidants has recently been proposed, but further work is needed to clarify this function in plants. In this study, we describe two new h-type TRXs from pea (Pisum sativum; stated PsTRXh 1 and PsTRXh 2). By functional complementation of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) trx 1 Delta trx 2 Delta double mutant, we demonstrate that PsTRXh 1 is involved in the redox-imbalance control, possibly through its interaction with peroxiredoxins. In contrast, PsTRXh 2 provokes a phenotype of hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in the yeast mutant. Furthermore, we show differential gene expression and protein accumulation of the two isoforms, PsTRXh 1 protein being abundantly detected in vascular tissue and flowers, whereas PsTRXh 2 gene expression was hardly detectable. By comparison with previous data of additional PsTRXh isoforms, our results indicate specific functions for the pea h-type TRXs so far described...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} open, self and cross {{pollination}} {{within and between}} three cultivars of pomegranate, namely: Khob El-Jamil, Taiefe and Al-madina on fruit set, seed number, fruit quality and yield were studied for two consecutive years. Percent of male and perfect flowers varied considerably according to the cultivar. The proportions of male to perfect flowers were 0. 12, 0. 35 and 0. 37 for Khob El-Jamil, Taiefe and Al-madina cvs., respectively. Lowest pollen viability percentage was in Al-madina and the highest pollen viability was in Khob El-Jamil cultivar. Hand self pollination (HSP) in Khob El-Jamil cultivar increased fruit set percentage, followed by hand cross pollination with pollen grains from Taiefe or Al-madina cultivars (HCPT and HCPM). Results of fruit set percentages and seed number per fruit revealed that a partial <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> was existing in Al-madina cultivar. A certain degree of cross incompatibility was found when Al-madina as seed parent was pollinated with Taiefe cultivar. Hand self pollination in Khob El-Jamil and Taiefe cvs. gave higher yield compared to other pollinizers. Application of pollen from Khob El-Jamil to emasculated flowers of Al-Madina cultivar significantly affected the weight, volume and size of fruits when compared with pollen of aiefe cultivar. Also, open pollination (OP) treatment in Khob El-Jamil cultivar significantly decreased peel thickness and juice volume compared to hand self pollination.

40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: <b>Self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> (SI) in rare plants {{presents}} a unique challenge—SI protects plants from inbreeding depression, but requires {{a sufficient number}} of mates and xenogamous pollination. Does SI persist in an endangered polyploid? Is pollinator visitation sufficient to ensure reproductive success? Is there evidence of inbreeding/outbreeding depression? We characterized the mating system, primary pollinators, pollen limitation, and inbreeding/outbreeding depression in Erysimum teretifolium to guide conservation efforts. METHODS: We compared seed production following self pollination and within- and between-population crosses. Pollen tubes were visualized after self pollinations and between-population pollinations. Pollen limitation was tested in the field. Pollinator observations were quantified using digital video. Inbreeding/outbreeding depression was assessed in progeny from self and outcross pollinations at early and later developmental stages. KEY RESULTS: Self-pollination reduced seed set by 6. 5 × and quadrupled reproductive failure compared with outcross pollination. Pollen tubes of some self pollinations were arrested at the stigmatic surface. Seed-set data indicated strong SI, and fruit-set data suggested partial SI. Pollinator diversity and visitation rates were high, and {{there was no evidence of}} pollen limitation. Inbreeding depression (δ) was weak for early developmental stages and strong for later developmental stages, with no evidence of outbreeding depression. CONCLUSIONS: The rare hexaploid E. teretifolium is largely self incompatible and suffers from late-acting inbreeding depression. Reproductive success in natural populations was accomplished through high pollinator visitation rates consistent with a lack of pollen limitation. Future reproductive health for this species will require large population sizes with sufficient mates and a robust pollinator community...|$|E

In Papaver rhoeas, the rejection of ?self? pollen involves a Ca 2 +-dependent signalling network that triggers {{programmed cell death}} (PCD), providing a neat {{way to get rid}} of unwanted incompatible (?self?) pollen. Several SI-induced events have been identified, including: rapid depolymerization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton ([Snowman et al., 2002] and [Poulter et al., 2008]); phosphorylation of a soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase ([Rudd et al., 1996] and [de Graaf et al., 2006]); activation of a MAPK, p 56 ([Rudd et al., 2003] and [Li et al., 2007]), and PCD, which involves several caspase-like activities, including a DEVDase, VEIDase and a LEVDase ([Bosch and Franklin-Tong, 2007] and [Thomas and Franklin-Tong, 2004]). PCD provides a precise mechanism for the specific destruction of ?self? pollen.

40|$|A simple {{medium is}} {{described}} which supports the germination of Brassica pollen in vitro. The method is completely reliable {{and the percentage}} germination achieved is comparable to that found on a compatible stigma. The pollen tubes produced attain lengths equal to those growing in the style and exhibit similar growth kinetics. The major difference between this medium and other less-reliable media is the addition of 1 mM Tris. The efficacy of Tris is shown to be {{due in part to}} the establishment of an optimum pH but an "amine effect" is also identified. The optimum pH for growth in vitro may be different from that encountered on the stigma. Atmospheric concentration of CO 2 and pollen population density are also shown to have pronounced effects on germination in vitro. Germination in vitro is not significantly affected by prior incubation on the stigma surface. Neither crossnor self-stigmas exert any apparent influence on pollen viability in this respect. Similarly the numbers of tube initials produced in atmospheres of 98 % relative humidity (RH) are not altered by such treatments. Conversely, incubation in germination medium and in 98 % RH prior to pollination appears to modify pollen-stigma interactions to some extent. Stigma extracts added to the germination medium cause an increase in the rate of hydration of both cross- and self-pollen, but this effect is greater in the case of cross-pollen. Evidence for specific inhibition of self-pollen germination by stigma extracts added to the medium was not obtained. The relevance of these phenomena to current concepts of the mechanism of <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> (SI) are discussed and a potential use of the medium in overcoming the SI response is suggested...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rye (Secale cereale L.) is an {{economically}} important crop, exhibiting unique {{features such as}} outstanding resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and high nutrient use efficiency. This species presents a challenge to geneticists and breeders due to its large genome containing {{a high proportion of}} repetitive sequences, <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility,</b> severe inbreeding depression and tissue culture recalcitrance. The genomic resources currently available for rye are underdeveloped in comparison with other crops of similar economic importance. The aim {{of this study was to}} create a highly saturated, multilocus linkage map of rye via consensus mapping, based on Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from 5 populations (564 in total) were genotyped using DArT markers and subjected to linkage analysis using Join Map 4. 0 and Multipoint Consensus 2. 2 software. A consensus map was constructed using a total of 9703 segregating markers. The average chromosome map length ranged from 199. 9 cM (2 R) to 251. 4 cM (4 R) and the average map density was 1. 1 cM. The integrated map comprised 4048 loci with the number of markers per chromosome ranging from 454 for 7 R to 805 for 4 R. In comparison with previously published studies on rye, this represents an eight-fold increase in the number of loci placed on a consensus map and a more than two-fold increase in the number of genetically mapped DArT markers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Through the careful choice of marker type, mapping populations and the use of software packages implementing powerful algorithms for map order optimization, we produced a valuable resource for rye and triticale genomics and breeding, which provides an excellent starting point for more in-depth studies on rye genome organization...|$|E

40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{observations and}} measurements, herbarium specimen analyses and chromosomal and reproductive biology studies involving over 5, 000 specimens {{were done in}} order to understand the phylogenetic and evolutionary patterns of the genus Witheringia. Plants of Witheringia are mostly tropical herbs and shrubs, distributed from Mexico to Bolivia, usually found growing between sea level and 2200 m, but with a concentration of species in Central America, especially in Costa Rica and Panama (10 of 16 spp.). Witheringia solanacea, the type species, is also the most widespread, with an ample geographic distribution from southern Mexico to southern Bolivia and several Caribbean islands and an altitudinal range from 0 – 1900 m. Floral characteristics, including pollen quantity, size and viability, number of ovules and seeds imply a trend toward outcrossing, and insect pollination. These species further avoid selfing by dichogamy; all the studied taxa proved to be protogynous. Observations on flowers in situ at three biological reserves in Costa Rica showed bees to be the dominant floral visitors and presumed pollinators. All species of Witheringia had a chromosome number of n = 12. A total of 1466 reciprocal and self crosses was performed among 39 individuals of 14 species of Witheringia, and related genera, Brachistus, Cuatresia and Capsicum. These experiments confirmed that <b>self</b> <b>incompatibility</b> characterizes all species of Witheringia except two accessions of W. solanacea (from Costa Rica and Panama), which are self compatible. The only hybridization yielding viable seeds involved W. solanacea and W. asterotricha (reciprocal crosses were successful). Results of a phylogenetic analysis rearranged the generic boundaries of Witheringia by transferring three species to two different genera. A second analysis with the three species removed yielded strong support for Witheringia as a monophyletic genus. Brachistus, another tropical American genus proved to be the sister taxon of Witheringia. A key to Witheringia and related genera is provided. Furthermore, a key and detailed descriptions of Witheringia and its 12 species complement this biosystematic study. ...|$|E
