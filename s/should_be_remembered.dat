40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although hematogenous acute epididymo-orchitis complicating Gram {{negative}} bacteremia, {{tuberculosis and}} brucellosis {{have been reported}} in medical literature, there is paucity of report on acute epididymo-orchitis complicating Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. CASE REPORT: We report the case of hematogenous acute epididymo-orchitis from S. pneumoniae bacteremia in an adult chronic cigarette smoker and alcoholic with community acquired pneumonia. CONCLUSION: We recommend that acute epididymo-orchitis <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remember</b> as a sequel of S. pneumoniae bacteremia especially in adult males with immune suppressio...|$|R
60|$|It is {{not enough}} that the content and the belief-feeling <b>should</b> coexist: it <b>is</b> {{necessary}} that there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a specific relation between them, of the sort expressed {{by saying that the}} content is what is believed. If this were not obvious, it could be made plain by an argument. If the mere co-existence of the content and the belief-feeling sufficed, whenever we were having (say) a memory-feeling we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembering</b> any proposition which came into our minds at the same time. But this is not the case, since we may simultaneously remember one proposition and merely consider another.|$|R

25|$|It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that in {{the early}} part of the 20th century matches were a {{necessity}} for smoking and the lighting of stoves and gas appliances among other uses and therefore demand for them was highly inelastic, meaning that a monopolist could raise prices (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold.|$|E
25|$|The Genale Dam <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> not so {{much for}} the {{intrinsic}} importance (though fairly innovative by the 1920s, being built with reinforced concrete) but especially for the difficulties in the realization and for the great improvements for the social and economic life of the area. The dam also improved the image of colonial Italy in the world.|$|E
25|$|In Wisconsin, Schurz {{soon became}} {{immersed}} in the anti-slavery movement and in politics, joining the Republican Party. In 1857, he was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for lieutenant-governor. In the Illinois campaign {{of the next year}} between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, he took part as a speaker on behalf of Lincoln—mostly in German—which raised Lincoln's popularity among German-American voters, though it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Senators were not directly elected in 1858, the election being decided by the Illinois General Assembly.|$|E

50|$|Despite these problems, the {{parameters}} p and β are powerful {{tools in the}} mathematical modelling of epidemics.

25|$|On 7 March 2006, Profumo {{suffered}} a stroke and was admitted to London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. He died two days later surrounded by his family, {{at the age of}} 91. In the immediate aftermath of his death, many commentators said that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> as much for his contribution to society after his fall from political grace as for the scandal of 1963 which caused that fall. He was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium, his ashes buried next to those of his wife at the family vault in Hersham.|$|E
25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works. While it has been criticized as the least {{substantial}} of the composer's three ballets, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Tchaikovsky was restricted by a rigorous scenario supplied by Marius Petipa. This scenario provided no opportunity {{for the expression of}} human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, at its best, the melodies are charming and pretty, and by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E
25|$|The Tang dynasty {{was a time}} {{of major}} social and {{probably}} linguistic upheavals. Thus, the genre may be divided into several major more-or-less chronological divisions, based on developmental stages or stylistic groupings (sometimes even on personal friendships between poets). It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that poets may be somewhat arbitrarily assigned to these based on their presumed biographical dates (not always known); furthermore that the lifetimes of poets toward the beginning or end of this period may overlap with the preceding Sui dynasty or the succeeding Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The chronology of Tang poetry may be divided into four parts: Early Tang, High Tang, Middle Tang, and Late Tang.|$|E

40|$|The capital {{controversy}} {{began with}} Joan Robinson's famous {{critique of the}} aggregate production function. She chose to include only the 'negative' part in the second volume of her Collected Economic Papers. The 'constructive' part, which had attracted so much attention in subsequent discussions of reswitching and reverse capital deepening, was peripheral to her concern {{with the role of}} realized expectations in neoclassical theory. The splitting of her famous paper into two parts raises a question. In the context of the capital controversy, <b>should</b> Joan Robinson <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> as a classical economist in modern dress, or <b>should</b> she <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> mainly as a critic of neoclassical theory?...|$|R
25|$|Hand axes {{are most}} {{commonly}} made from rounded pebbles or nodules, {{but many are}} also made from a large flake. Hand axes made from flakes first appeared {{at the start of}} the Acheulean period and became more common with time. Manufacturing a hand axe from a flake is actually easier than from a pebble, it is also quicker as flakes are more likely to be closer to the desired shape. This allows easier manipulation and fewer knaps are required to finish the tool, it is also easier to obtain straight edges. When analysing a hand axe made from a flake it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that its shape was predetermined (by use of the Levallois technique or Kombewa technique or similar). Notwithstanding this, it is necessary to note tools characteristics: type of flake, heel, knap direction.|$|E
25|$|Occlusal splints {{are divided}} into partial or full-coverage splints {{according}} to whether they fit over {{some or all of}} the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower splints are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. Another problem with wearing a splint can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the splint about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. As an added measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the splint so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal level of sensitivity from the teeth, although it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.|$|E

5000|$|Elrington Ball's unflattering {{portrait}} of Dongan in The Judges in Ireland [...] <b>should</b> <b>be</b> balanced against the kindly and respectful {{portrayal of the}} judge by his son-in-law Arnold Boate, which emphasizes his family virtues. If his service under Cromwell led to accusations of treachery to the Stuart dynasty, or at least time-serving, it <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that he used his position to assist relatives in distress.|$|R
500|$|When {{assessing}} Lady Rosebery's behaviour to {{her children}} it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that she lived {{in an era of}} plentiful nannies, wet nurses, nursemaids and governesses which the upper classes employed as the norm. These people were employed regardless of the mother's affection towards her children; it was inconceivable that a countess would nurse her own children, and to do so would have been breaking social conventions. Hence her seeming lack of attention {{to her children}} was not unusual– she was following the upper class conventions and [...] "stiff upper lip" [...] philosophies of her era. However, in spite of their prolonged absences from their children, the Roseberys do not appear to have been very distant or remote figures in the earliest stages of their children's lives. Margot Asquith records how Rosebery loved to play and romp on the floor with the children.|$|E
500|$|But {{despite the}} {{continuity}} – {{or perhaps because}} of it – all was apparently not well. In 1188 Gerald of Wales accompanied Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, on a tour of Wales, the primary object being a recruitment campaign for the Third Crusade, a secondary one to establish his authority over the whole Welsh church. Gerald’s vivid account of the journey is the first great European travel book. Gerald visited Llanbadarn Fawr, and described the college of secular canons under a lay abbot (Ednowain [...] "bishop of Llanbadarn"), in not especially flattering terms; it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> that Gerald was a zealous reformer, critical of anything of which he disapproved, as he did of Llanbadarn: the abbot was described as [...] "a certain old man, waxen old in iniquity". The account of his visit was subsequently published in the Itinerarium Cambriae (1191), and was followed by the Descriptio Cambriae in 1194.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} been called a flawed {{masterpiece}} by critics. The scale and variety of choice and effect was highlighted by reviewers as Bloodlines greatest success, including the variety of clans, with specific dialog options, and the specific reactions from other characters, each with their own clan loyalty and bias. GameSpy called it a nearly flawless classic role-playing game; The New York Times described it as brilliant but unfinished. Eurogamer praised its [...] "effortlessly intelligent" [...] script, saying that [...] "no other game has come close. Nothing's even tried". VideoGamer.com opined that at its best, Bloodlines stands among the greatest RPGs of the preceding five years, although its technical problems <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered.</b> According to HonestGamers, the game [...] "may not be polished and may end with a sigh instead of a shout, but for its ambition alone it deserves stream after stream of compliments." [...] Reviewers compared it to other successful role-playing games, including Fallout, , , , , and Deus Ex; Eurogamer described Bloodlines as Deus Ex with vampires.|$|E
