5000|$|In the United States, a {{life estate}} is {{typically}} {{used as a}} tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested fee <b>simple</b> <b>remainder.</b> As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. Such a transfer risks the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, selling the estate prematurely to an innocent purchaser such as when Al is on vacation but makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. [...] "Beneficiary deeds" [...] have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} Uspensky's {{expansion}} theorem for the Poisson approximation {{of the distribution of}} sums of independent Bernoulli random variables can be rewritten in terms of the Poisson convolution semigroup. This gives rise to exact evaluations and <b>simple</b> <b>remainder</b> term estimations for the d viations of the distributions in study with respect o various probability metrics, generalizing results of Shorgin (1977, Theory Probab. Appl., 22, 846 - 850). Finally, we compare the sharpness ofPoisson versus normal approximations...|$|E

Only Richard had a legal estate, the interests of Jasper and James being equitable analogues of a legal fee tail and fee <b>simple</b> in <b>remainder.</b>|$|R

The state owns 420 acre {{of the park}} in fee <b>simple,</b> and the <b>remainder</b> of park land is leased from the Department of the Army. [...] The park is located along the Cape Fear River and Snow's Cut (part of the Intracoastal Waterway).|$|R
50|$|The {{electoral system}} for the National Assembly {{is based on the}} electoral law passed on 1 November 1991. The 220 members are elected in two ways; 90 are elected from 18 five-seat {{constituencies}} and 130 from a single nationwide constituency. Both constituency types use a closed list proportional representation system : the D'Hondt method in the provincial constituencies and the <b>simple</b> quota largest <b>remainder</b> method in the nationwide constituency.|$|R
50|$|By 1869, only 93 Kansas Kickapoo had {{accepted}} fee <b>simple</b> allotment, the <b>remainder</b> preferring to continue holding their lands in common. Though a small band, approximately 50 tribesmen returned from Mexico to the Kansas Reservation before the forfeit period lapsed. They {{settled on the}} common lands briefly, but left before claiming their allotments. They later joined the Kickapoo in Indian Territory in 1874. In 1875, a group of 114 of the Mexican Kickapoo were returned to the Kansas Reservation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>simplest</b> (to define) <b>remainder</b> {{sequence}} {{consists in}} taking always α=1. In practice, {{it is not}} interesting, as {{the size of the}} coefficients grow exponentially with the degree of the input polynomials. This appears clearly on the example of the preceding section, for which the successive pseudo-remainders are The number of digits of the coefficients of the successive remainders is more than doubled at each iteration of the algorithm. This is a typical behavior of the trivial pseudo-remainder sequences.|$|R
40|$|The Streptomyces glaucescens genome {{frequently}} undergoes gross genomic rearrangement {{events which}} {{result in the}} deletion of extremely large segments of chromosomal DNA. The structure and origin of the DNA forming the novel junctions arising from five of these deletion events are described. Only one junction {{proved to be the}} result of a relatively <b>simple</b> event; the <b>remainder</b> were more complex, with one involving DNA which originated from at least five distinct loci. In three of the investigated cases, DNA sequences present in the junctions appeared to have resulted from the duplication of previously unique sequences, suggesting that duplication of chromosomal segments may be an important factor in genetic instability. The nucleotide sequences surrounding these junctions and their respective wild-type termini were determined...|$|R
40|$|Diverticulitis {{affects the}} right side of the colon more {{commonly}} than the left side in the Far East. A consecutive series of 35 patients (mean age 44 years) with right sided diverticulitis seen at this hospital is presented. All had localised pain in the right iliac fossa but systemic upset was uncommon. All but one were thought to have acute appendicitis. Thirty one were explored through a right iliac fossa incision but in more than half this had to be closed and a full laparotomy performed. A correct diagnosis was then made at the time of surgery in 28 (80 %). Five patients underwent <b>simple</b> diverticulectomy, the <b>remainder</b> having a right hemicolectomy. On histological analysis most (26) had a single false diverticulum. All patients made a satisfactory recovery from surgery...|$|R
50|$|The Kickapoo {{indicated}} that they were unaware that the agreement had been reached and thought that they were still negotiating terms. The Kansas Attorney General, Warren William Guthrie, launched a grand jury hearing. The charges were considered serious enough that allotment was suspended and the new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, William P. Dole, appointed in 1863, traveled to Kansas to investigate. In the ensuing hearings, it was alleged that Guthrie's real interest in the matter stemmed from his involvement with rival railroad Hannibal and St. Joseph. Dole returned to Washington, D.C. and submitted his report to President Abraham Lincoln on 4 April 1864. Some of the frustrated Kickapoo decided to leave Kansas, and a group of about 700 headed for Mexico to join kinsmen there in September 1864. In 1865, pressure from Pomeroy finally gained approval to continue with the Kickapoo allotment, although the tribe resisted. By 1869, only 93 Kickapoo had accepted fee <b>simple</b> allotment, the <b>remainder</b> preferring to continue holding their lands in common.|$|R
40|$|In some contexts, mixture {{models can}} fit certain {{variables}} {{well at the}} expense of others in ways beyond the analyst's control. For example, when the data include some variables with non-trivial amounts of missing values, the mixture model may fit the marginal distributions of the nearly and fully complete variables {{at the expense of}} the variables with high fractions of missing data. Motivated by this setting, we present a mixture model for mixed ordinal and nominal data that splits variables into two groups, focus variables and remainder variables. The model allows the analyst to specify a rich sub-model for the focus variables and a <b>simpler</b> sub-model for <b>remainder</b> variables, yet still capture associations among the variables. Using simulations, we illustrate advantages and limitations of focused clustering compared to mixture models that do not distinguish variables. We apply the model to handle missing values in an analysis of the 2012 American National Election Study, estimating relationships among voting behavior, ideology, and political party affiliation.

40|$|This article {{traces the}} {{evolving}} judicial {{interpretation of the}} “adequate and full consideration” exclusion found in section 2036. Part III examines the proper application of the “adequate and full consideration” exclusion to <b>simple</b> sales of <b>remainders</b> such as those involved in D 2 ̆ 7 Ambrosio and Wheeler and concludes that the holdings in those cases are indisputably correct. It then analyzes the possible planning opportunities these decisions offer, {{particularly in light of}} section 2702. Part IV examines the effect of the D 2 ̆ 7 Ambrosio trilogy on spousal elections. This Part outlines the potential gift and estate tax savings this device affords and then considers how such elections should be analyzed for purposes of the “adequate and full consideration” exclusion. It concludes that spousal elections in virtually every case should be governed by the reciprocal trust doctrine. Under this approach, spousal elections do not constitute sales of remainders, and hence the holdings of the D 2 ̆ 7 Ambrosio trilogy should not apply. Indeed, in many cases, the existing position of the Internal Revenue Service and the courts produces excessively generous results to taxpayers. However, in the relatively few cases where the reciprocal trust doctrine should not apply, the current treatment of spousal elections should change to conform to the holdings in D 2 ̆ 7 Ambrosio, Wheeler, and Magnin...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{study is}} made of finite groups which satisfy the {{following}} hypothesis:- (*) G is a finite group admitting an automorphism α of order r with a fixed point subgroup of order q, where q and r are distinct prime numbers. The main result is Theorem A. Let G be a group satisfying hypothesis (*). Assume either that q is odd or that q = 2 and r is not a Fermat prime greater than 3. Then G is soluble. First a structure theorem for soluble groups satisfying hypothesis (*) is obtained (theorem B). Solubility of groups satisfying hypothesis (*) is shown under the additional assumption that the symmetric group S 4 is not involved: this serves to prove solubility in general for r = 2 or r = 3, and {{to point to the}} initial reductions in the general case. The proof of theorem A is by induction on the order of groups satisfying the hypothesis for a given pair (q,r). A minimal counterexample is <b>simple,</b> and the <b>remainder</b> of the proof is to show non-existence. After initial reductions the cases q odd and q = 2 are considered separately. For the case q odd, we require the following theorem which is of independent interest: it is a generalisation of a result of Glauberman, theorem A of (12). Let p be a prime and P a p-group. Let d(P) denote the largest of the orders of the abelian subgroups of P, and let J(P) be the subgroup of P generated by the abelian subgroups of order d(P). Also, let Qd(p) be the natural semi-direct product of z p × z p, regarded as a vector space, by SL(2,p). We obtain Theorem 9. 3. Let G be a finite group, p a prime, P a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and Q a subgroup of Z(P). If Q is normal in N G (J(P)) and if either (i) p is odd and (p- 1) does not divide the index [N(Q) :C(Q) ] or (ii) Qd(p) is not involved in G, then Q is weakly closed in P with respect to G. For the case q = 2, the arguments involved in the proof of theorem A are mainly character-theoretic: we also obtain information about the exceptional cases. Except as mentioned above, the arguments are entirely group-theoretic. </p...|$|R
