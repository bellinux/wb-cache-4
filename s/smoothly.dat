5|$|As of 2016, Cena {{had started}} {{learning}} Mandarin Chinese to help WWE expand its reach, and spoke the language relatively <b>smoothly</b> at a WWE/PPTV {{press conference in}} Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} media reported the elections as having run <b>smoothly</b> with relatively little violence or voter fraud, {{in contrast to}} previous elections.|$|E
5|$|In {{a couple}} of Lexus firsts, the {{fifth-generation}} LS is the first Lexus sedan to feature a six-sided window design, while the flush-surface windows integrate <b>smoothly</b> with the pillars. In the company’s efforts to reconcile two conflicting goals, sufficient headroom with a low roofline, the new LS employs an available outer-slide-type panoramic moonroof instead of the conventional, internally retracting item.|$|E
5|$|In {{day-to-day life}} {{all of us}} observe that a stream of water {{emerging}} from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how <b>smoothly</b> the stream is emitted from the faucet. This {{is due to a}} phenomenon called the Plateau–Rayleigh instability, which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{designer}} Mike Posehn had no {{video game}} experience prior to developing Desert Strike. Inspired by Choplifter, he aimed {{to create a}} nonlinear game with <b>smoothly</b> animated vehicles. Posehn developed a camera system with momentum to mimic realistic helicopter movements. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling was used to generate the vehicle sprites, which were later touched up on the pixel level with color.|$|E
5|$|Paul Adelstein as Paul Kellerman (seasons 1–2, 4–5): Kellerman was {{introduced}} as a Secret Service agent {{working for the}} Vice President {{to make sure that}} the execution of Lincoln Burrows goes <b>smoothly.</b> He appears as a major character in the first and second seasons.|$|E
5|$|Proctor's Theater: A 1914 {{theater on}} Fourth Street transitioned <b>smoothly</b> between live-entertainment and motion-picture eras. RPI {{had hoped to}} convert it into a hotel, but a new {{proposal}} to gut the interior completely {{has been the subject}} of local controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} went <b>smoothly,</b> {{except for a}} clash with the editors of The Russian Messenger, about which very little is known. Since the {{manuscript}} Dostoyevsky turned in to Katkov was lost, it is unclear to what the editors had objected in the original.|$|E
5|$|To support Wongso, stage actress Elly Joenara {{was cast}} as Siti, making her film debut, while Mohamad Arief {{appeared}} as Wisnu. Other cast members included Djoenaedi, R. Sukran, and Miss Satijem. To ensure that fight scenes went <b>smoothly,</b> Jo hired members of Primo Oesman's silat and boxing group to perform as criminals; Oesman, a professional boxer, {{also appeared in}} the film.|$|E
5|$|Voting {{took place}} {{relatively}} <b>smoothly</b> at 22,264 voting stations in South Africa. It {{was reported that}} 2,449, or 11%, of the voting stations opened later than the scheduled opening time of 7am. All voting stations were operational by 11am. Voting stations closed and counting began at 9pm.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving with}} the Grand Fleet, Battleship Division Nine {{was forced to}} adapt quickly to {{unfamiliar}} British methods and standards. New signals and maneuvers were adopted relatively <b>smoothly,</b> while more stringent gunnery standards proved more difficult to achieve. On a personal level, relations between American and British officers and men were notably cordial.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas <b>smoothly</b> becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran <b>smoothly,</b> until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face <b>smoothly</b> and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disagreement}} {{as to whether}} Craig was deserving of the captaincy, the team proceeded <b>smoothly</b> without infighting. Prior to the Fifth Test, Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form, which would have made Harvey captain. Peter Burge, the third member of the selection panel and a Harvey supporter, was comfortable with this, but Harvey relinquished his opportunity to seize the leadership by ordering Burge to retain Craig. When the vote was formally taken, Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig, who was still offering to drop himself.|$|E
5|$|From Exile onward, the {{characters}} of Myst were generally praised in each release. The live-action characters in the pre-rendered Myst titles were favorably received; Greg Kasavin of GameSpot said that the series' use of real actors and full-motion video endeared {{the characters}} to the player, giving the games a distinctively personal touch. Fellow Gamespot reviewer Scott Osborne stated the actors delivered convincing performances, and were <b>smoothly</b> incorporated into the game's scenes. The reviewers of G4tv, on the other hand, called the acting of the earlier installments overwrought and melodramatic.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888 Scott {{passed his}} {{examinations}} for sub-lieutenant, with four first class certificates out of five. His career progressed <b>smoothly,</b> with service on various ships and promotion to lieutenant in 1889. In 1891, {{after a long}} spell in foreign waters, he applied for the two-year torpedo training course on , an important career step. He graduated with first class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations. A small blot occurred {{in the summer of}} 1893 when, while commanding a torpedo boat, Scott ran it aground, a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke.|$|E
5|$|In any case, the {{succession}} of Nyuserre seems to have gone <b>smoothly.</b> A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{directly}} {{ordering the}} aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, the Australian Government purchased its F/A-18s through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Ordering the aircraft via the US Government allowed the RAAF {{to take advantage}} of the superior purchasing power of the US military, and reduced the service's project management requirements. This led to a complicated arrangement whereby the aircraft were ordered by the US Government, delivered to the US Navy, and then transferred to the RAAF once initial flight testing had taken place. The process functioned <b>smoothly,</b> however, and was cost effective.|$|E
5|$|Maximian's campaigns {{were not}} {{proceeding}} as <b>smoothly.</b> The Bagaudae had been easily suppressed, but Carausius, {{the man he}} had {{put in charge of}} operations against Saxon and Frankish pirates on the Saxon Shore, had, according to literary sources, begun keeping the goods seized from the pirates for himself. Maximian issued a death-warrant for his larcenous subordinate. Carausius fled the Continent, proclaimed himself Augustus, and agitated Britain and northwestern Gaul into open revolt against Maximian and Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|On November 11 Hans Shack and {{his forces}} boarded Dutch {{transport}} ships {{to take them}} to the east side of Funen. After some false starts, due to weather and Swedish resistance, he managed to land near Kerteminde. General-Major Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein {{was in charge of the}} allied forces that had been left on Jutland, and was also moving towards Funen; landfall was made two days later without any Swedish resistance. Both Eberstein and Schack marched towards Odense, meeting up on November 12. So far, the invasion of Funen was going <b>smoothly</b> for the combined Danish and allied forces.|$|E
5|$|The Authority's {{principal}} innovation was its supranational character. It had a broad area {{of competence}} to ensure {{the objectives of the}} treaty were met and that the common market functioned <b>smoothly.</b> The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.|$|E
5|$|The Disposals Commission's {{activities}} peaked during 1946 and 1947. Sales generally went <b>smoothly</b> and {{in accordance}} with the principles set by the Government and did not significantly disrupt normal commerce. While the Commission generally operated efficiently, some mistakes occurred such as clothing and scrap metal being sold well beneath their market value. The volume of sales dropped rapidly after 1947 and the Disposals Commission was disbanded in July 1949. By this time the commission had sold £135,189,000 worth of equipment.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{then passed}} {{to a third}} reading in the House of Lords, where {{it took a few}} minor amendments, but escaped any {{significant}} opposition barring a brief dispute over the status of Cadet units; it was eventually agreed that they could be supported by the associations provided that no funding was to be provided from money voted by Parliament. This amendment was accepted by the Government, and the bill passed <b>smoothly</b> to royal assent.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by <b>smoothly.</b> On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E
5|$|The half-lives of {{mendelevium}} isotopes mostly increase <b>smoothly</b> from 245Md onwards, {{reaching a}} maximum at 258Md. Experiments and predictions {{suggest that the}} half-lives will then decrease, apart from 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the island of relative stability of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|The half-lives of {{nobelium}} isotopes increase <b>smoothly</b> from 250No to 253No. However, a dip {{appears at}} 254No, and beyond this the half-lives of even-even nobelium isotopes drop sharply as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode. For example, the half-life of 256No is almost three seconds, {{but that of}} 258No is only 1.2milliseconds. This shows that at nobelium, the mutual repulsion of protons poses a limit to the region of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series. The even-odd nobelium isotopes mostly continue to have longer half-lives as their mass numbers increase, with {{a dip in the}} trend at 257No.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1880s {{marked a}} turning point in Shaw's life, both {{personally}} and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always <b>smoothly,</b> for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.|$|E
5|$|The {{pastor of}} Mt. St. Peter Parish is {{appointed}} to the position by the Bishop and {{is the leader of}} the parish. When one steps down, is transferred to another church, passes away, or retires, another is appointed. He is in charge of making sure that everything goes <b>smoothly</b> with the priests and administration of the church. The pastor works in collaboration with the Parish Staff, the Parish Pastoral Council, and the Parish Finance Council. His mission is to proclaim and help facilitate the building of the Kingdom of God among the parishioners of Mt. St. Peter Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} marred by various concerns, notably the safety of Mir {{following}} a fire and a collision, financial issues with the cash-strapped Russian Space Program and worries from astronauts about {{the attitudes of the}} program administrators. Nevertheless, a large amount of science, expertise in space station construction and knowledge in working in a cooperative space venture was gained from the combined operations, allowing the construction of the ISS to proceed much more <b>smoothly</b> than would have otherwise been the case.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{feature of}} Solar Two was {{its use of}} molten salt to capture and store the sun's heat. The very hot salt was stored and used when needed to produce steam to drive a turbine/generator that {{produces}} electricity. The system operated <b>smoothly</b> through intermittent clouds and continued generating electricity long into the night. Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999, and was converted by the University of California, Davis, into CACTUS, an Air Cherenkov Telescope, in 2001, measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The western slopes fall <b>smoothly</b> to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the overall {{impression}} of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, but above this is a sense of wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing straight down the slope.|$|E
5|$|They also {{expressed}} disbelief that slabs would split so <b>smoothly,</b> or that {{one half of}} a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the counterslab. These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave {{the bulk of the}} fossil on one side and little on the other.|$|E
5|$|While {{construction}} of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more <b>smoothly</b> than the {{construction of}} the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, {{construction of the}} spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction.|$|E
5|$|After their FA Cup final appearance, Liverpool's {{fortunes}} declined steadily. Kay resigned through ill-health, and {{was replaced}} by Don Welsh. Welsh's first season did not go <b>smoothly,</b> as Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Norwich City of the Third Division South. The following year, 61,905 spectators watched Liverpool beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–1 in the fourth round of the FA Cup, the biggest attendance ever recorded at Anfield. Under Welsh's stewardship the club gradually slipped further down the table, and were relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season, after finishing in bottom place. Their relegation came after 50 uninterrupted years in the top division of English football. The side's decline did not prevent John Moores, owner of retail company Littlewoods, from investing in the club with a 51% stake.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases <b>smoothly</b> {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
