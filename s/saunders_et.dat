25|$|A {{protocol}} {{suggested by}} <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> al. assigns research reports to six categories, {{on the basis}} of research design, theoretical background, evidence of possible harm, and general acceptance. To be classified under this protocol, there must be descriptive publications, including a manual or similar description of the intervention. This protocol does not consider the nature of any comparison group, the effect of confounding variables, the nature of the statistical analysis, or a number of other criteria. Interventions are assessed as belonging to Category 1, well-supported, efficacious treatments, if there are two or more randomized controlled outcome studies comparing the target treatment to an appropriate alternative treatment and showing a significant advantage to the target treatment. Interventions are assigned to Category 2, supported and probably efficacious treatment, based on positive outcomes of nonrandomized designs with some form of control, which may involve a non-treatment group. Category 3, supported and acceptable treatment, includes interventions supported by one controlled or uncontrolled study, or by a series of single-subject studies, or by work with a different population than the one of interest. Category 4, promising and acceptable treatment, includes interventions that have no support except general acceptance and clinical anecdotal literature; however, any evidence of possible harm excludes treatments from this category. Category 5, innovative and novel treatment, includes interventions that are not thought to be harmful, but are not widely used or discussed in the literature. Category 6, concerning treatment, is the classification for treatments that have the possibility of doing harm, as well as having unknown or inappropriate theoretical foundations.|$|E

30|$|Malnutrition {{is defined}} by the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) as any “any {{nutritional}} imbalance” (White et al. 2012, p. 730). More specifically, malnutrition can refer to a state of under-nutrition (from insufficient intake or impaired utilisation), or over-nutrition (from excessive calorie intake and/or inadequate physical activity) (Escott-Stump 2012). Either state leads to altered body composition and function (<b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> al. 2010). It is important however, that the term ‘under-nutrition’ is not confused with being underweight (e.g. often represented by Body Mass Index [BMI] < 18.5  kg/m 2). Under-nutrition is a term used synonymously with protein-energy deficiency, where there is a loss of body cell mass with signs of subcutaneous fat loss and skeletal muscle wasting and therefore (Escott-Stump 2012; <b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> al. 2010); under-nutrition can occur irrespective of individuals’ BMI (<b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> al. 2010). Malnutrition, in this study protocol, refers to ‘under-nutrition’, meaning protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) (Escott-Stump 2012).|$|R

30|$|The study {{outlined}} {{in this paper}} aims to provide a new and detailed perspective on the burden, impact and diagnosis of PEM in a high income country setting and in an underserved population, in this instance, Indigenous Australians. The prevalence of PEM and those at-risk of malnutrition is significant in hospital inpatients (Allard et al. 2015; Agarwal et al. 2012, 2013; Ultang et al. 2012; Gibson et al. 2012). PEM, in turn, {{has been associated with}} a number of adverse clinical outcomes (Allard et al. 2015; Agarwal et al. 2012, 2013; Escott-Stump 2012; Lim et al. 2012; Rowell and Jackson 2011; <b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> al. 2010). Whilst the cost of PEM is substantial for both patients and the health care system (Agarwal et al. 2013; Lim et al. 2012; Barker et al. 2010; Rowell and Jackson 2011; Norman et al. 2008), understanding of its burden and impact remains limited, particularly in underserved populations such as Indigenous Australians. We hypothesise that the burden and impact of malnutrition in Indigenous Australians is likely to be greater and more severe than for non-Indigenous Australian inpatients. We also anticipate that the type of PEM that Indigenous Australian inpatients present with {{is more likely to be}} chronic disease-related. Such stratification of malnutrition into different aetiology types is important to allow a tailored response to management. Whilst documenting the burden and impact of malnutrition is important this information must also, where appropriate, be utilised to enhance health care practice. While the Dietitians Association of Australia recommend that all hospital patients are screened within 24  h of hospital admission (DAA 2009), this is variably implemented (Green and James 2013). In addition, whilst such screening must necessarily use a reliable malnutrition screening tool that has been validated for a specific patient population this is not possible for Indigenous Australians where no such validated tool currently exists. By validating a new malnutrition screening tool (ANT), we hope to enhance and inform the detection and management of PEM in Australia in general and for Indigenous Australians. In summary, the Indigenous Australian Malnutrition project will provide new insights into PEM in adult Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the acute care setting and seek to improve and simplify diagnosis with the validation of a new malnutrition screening tool (ANT) for the detection of PEM in Indigenous Australians.|$|R

On the other hand, Lomax distribution is used as the basis for several generalizations. For example, Al-Awadhi and Ghitany (2001) use Lomax distribution as a mixing distribution for the Poisson parameter and derive a discrete Poisson-Lomax distribution; and Punathumparambath (2011) introduced the double-Lomax distribution and applied it to the IQ data.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{reports the}} case of a child in which the {{clinical}} and laboratory data indicate a progressive intrahepatic cholestasis of the type described as Byler's disease. The histological and histochemical findings suggest an intrahepatic cholestasis. Electron microscopy reveals interruptions of the bile canalicular membrane, which have been described as characteristic of this disease. A striking feature in the present case is the remarkable increase of microfilamentous structures in the pericanalicular ectoplasm and in the hepatocytic cytoplasm. The findings suggest a primary dis-turbance in bile acid secretion as the cause of cholestasis, entailing a hypertrophy of pericanalicular microfilaments which supposedly {{play a role in the}} final step of biliary secretion. In 1965, Clayton and his colleagues identified a disorder characterized by progressive intrahepatic cholestasis.

40|$|Mitotic {{apparatus}} (MA) plays central {{roles in}} cell division for both mitosis and cytokinesis. It achieves these mechanical tasks by changing its morphology {{under the control}} of cell cycle machinery. This relies on dynamic polymerization and depolymerization cycles of microtubules and their assembly into higher order structures such as bundles involving various microtubule regulators. A dramatic remodeling of the MA occurs at the metaphase to anaphase transition (Fig. 1). Before this, 2 spindle poles are connected both by interpolar microtubules and by kinetochore microtubules attaching the unsegregated chromatids. After anaphase onset, the link via kinetochore microtubules and chromosomes disappears due to loss of chromosome cohesion. As a consequence, the interpolar microtubules, which have now developed into a more prominent structure termed the central spindle, become the sole mechanical link between the 2 poles (Fig. 1, case i). Metaphase-anaphase transition also promotes the growth of astral microtubules. Dynein anchored at the cell cortex interacts with the astral microtubules and generates mechanical forces (cortical pulling forces) that pull spindle poles toward the cell cortex. 1 Grill SW, et al. Nature 2001; 409 (6820) : 630 - 3; PMID: 11214323; [URL] [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®] In some cell types such as the C. elegans embryos, cortical pulling force is the major driving force for chromosome separation via elongation of the pole-to-pole distance (anaphase B). In this situation, the central spindle is dispensable for chromosome segregation; it rather works as a brake against the cortical pulling force. Indeed, in C. elegans embryos, chromosome separation is accelerated when the central spindle is severed by laser manipulation or by genetic perturbation. 2 <b>Saunders</b> AM, <b>et</b> al.

Because the amount of core recovered during Leg 163 was very limited, this shore-based, postcruise study focuses on materials recovered at a nearby site during Leg 152. In particular, this study examines sediments recovered at Site 919; these sediments were described as containing a significant ice-rafted component in the Leg 152 Initial Reports volume (Larsen, <b>Saunders,</b> Clift, <b>et</b> al., 1994, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. ir. 152. 1994).
