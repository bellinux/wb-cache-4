25|$|The Staff and Ticket safeworking {{system was}} {{used on the}} line, but with no tickets to be issued {{due to the lack}} of {{crossing}} places or signalling staff at the terminus. Staff locked points were provided at the main line junction. In 1953 the main line was using the Electric Staff safeworking system, so a special procedure was required. A freight train would be despatched from Heidelberg with a 'Heidelberg to Macleod' electric staff. The train then proceeded to the junction, where it would be met by the signalman from Macleod carrying the 'Macleod to Mont Park' train staff. The staffs would be exchanged, the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' staff used to unlock the points so they could be set for the diverge, and the train allowed to proceed to Mont Park with the 'Macleod to Mont Park' staff.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{cross-cultural}} adaptation to Brazilian Portuguese of two instruments for {{the measurement of}} family-centered care, one for parents and one for healthcare professionals. Methods: Methodological study of cross-cultural adaptation following the phases of translation, back-translation, analysis by experts, pre-test, test-retest and psychometric analysis after {{the application of the}} instrument to 100 parents of hospitalized children and 100 professionals from pediatric units of a teaching hospital. Results: the evaluation of experts in both instruments showed a Kappa of 0. 85 and 0. 93 respectively. At pretest, participants suggested no changes. Test-retest reliability was good for both stability indexes. Factor analysis explained 43. 9 % of the total variance in the parents instrument and 43. 4 % in the <b>staff</b> <b>instrument.</b> Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0. 723 for the parents instrument and 0. 781 for the <b>staff</b> <b>instrument.</b> Conclusion: the instruments adapted to the Brazilian culture presented reliability, stability and good internal consistency, with potential {{to be used in the}} pediatric clinical practice.

40|$|The {{solar wind}} is the Sun's exosphere. As the solar {{atmosphere}} expands into interplanetary space, it is accelerated and heated.

40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{a powerful}} tool for structural studies of samples in special sample environments because of the high penetrating power of neutrons compared to x-rays. The Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) offers its users a variety of sample environments for pulsed neutron scattering and diffraction experiments. At the present time over 80 % of all experiments performed at the IPNS invoke some type of ancillary equipment to control the sample environment. These include closed-cycle refrigerators, cryostats, furnaces, magnets, and pressure cells. There are also devices for automatic sample changing, positioning, and orientating. Most instruments have at a minimum, a dedicated closed cycle refrigerator (10 K to RT) configured for the instrument's typical sample dimensions and scattering angles.

40|$|International audience[1] The k-filtering {{technique}} {{is a method}} to characterize stationary fluctuations in space plasmas {{in terms of the}} wave energy distribution in the frequency and wave vector space. It has the ability to distinguish between wave modes of the same frequency in the spacecraft frame of reference, but with different wave vectors. This method is based on simultaneous multi-point measurements of the wave field components, where a filter bank is used to enhance the spatial resolution. We have for the first time combined electric field data from the Electric Field and Wave (EFW) instrument and magnetic field data from the Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuation (<b>STAFF)</b> <b>instrument</b> on the four Cluster spacecraft {{in order to determine the}} wave energy distribution. The k-filtering technique has previously been performed with only the magnetic field measurements. The reason to include the electric field measurements is that it is important to include as much data as possible in order to get the best possible estimation of the wave energy distribution. Another reason is that it also enables comparisons between the electric and the magnetic part of the wave energy distribution to make it possible to differentiate the observed waves according to their polarization. The k-filtering method has been extended in order to allow for two measured components of the electric field, and also for the possibility that the electric field measurements from one or more satellites cannot be used for k-filtering. The technique has been applied on satellite data from the magnetosheath and the foreshock, and from these examples it is clear that k-filtering using both electric and magnetic field measurements is a good tool for characterizing the waves that are observed in space.
