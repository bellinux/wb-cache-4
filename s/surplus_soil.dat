In order to promote effective use of the <b>surplus</b> <b>soils,</b> it is required to improve their properties by cement and/or lime stabilization. However, as cement or lime stabilized soils exhibit the high value of pH, the environmental impact of the alkaline solution must be carefully concerned. The objective of this study is to discuss the method or concept to control the environmental impact induced by the use of cement stabilized soil. The alkaline leachate characteristics from the stabilized soils, the buffer ability of cover layer and the interaction of these functions were investigated through the experimental studies; alluvial clay and decomposed granite were used in this study and a series of permeability and pH test were carried out on compound specimens of stabilized soil and buffer layer. Based on the experimental results, the minimum thickness of cover layer of the stabilized-soil embankment was estimated through the parametric study. It is concluded that the buffer ability of cover soil and the permeability of both stabilized soils and cover layer are important to control the environmental impact by alkaline leachate...|$|R

The filling was made of <b>surplus</b> <b>soils,</b> and it contained a mass of water supplied from rainfall and ground water flow of a permeable layer {{at the bottom of}} the filling. The collapsed soil flowed down and destroyed a house. In this paper, the cause of this disaster is discussed. The site of the disaster was used as the dumping site of <b>surplus</b> <b>soils,</b> after several changes of ground formation. The history of the geographical change was reconstructed by the image processing of old map, aerial photographs, result of 3 -dimentional laser survey carried out after collapse and the measurement of thickness of collapsed soil by dynamic cone penetration test. According to the result of processing, the shape and the size of the filling before collapse was reconstructed. The relationship between the rainfall and the groundwater in the river sediments layer over which the filling was constructed was determined. A stability analysis of the filling was conducted considering the rise of the groundwater level in the filling and the laboratory measured strength parameters. The results of the stability analysis showed that the collapse would have taken place when the groundwater level rose by about 9 m due to the supply of groundwater through the river sediments layer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports of}} several new soil {{treatment}} methods in Japan, which include 1) a liquefied soil stabilizing method to re-use construction sludge and excavated <b>surplus</b> <b>soils,</b> 2) a high-speed continuous soil treatment system using pipe-line mixers and a light-weight banking method which utilize in-situ surface soil without purchase and carrying of fill materials. Liquefied soil stabilizing method involves adding stabilizer to slurried soil, and enables the laying of soil with stable quality that requires no compacting at construction sites. The {{application of this}} method has recently been increasing in Japan for backfilling underground multi-purpose ducts or other underground structures. This method has a major advantage in that muddy construction sludge, dredged material and various other types of soils generated from excavation can be effectively used, thus both the waste disposal cost and the production cost of stabilized soil slurry can be reduced. An attempt to use lightweight foam mixed soil throughout the entire road embankment cross-section on a soft ground was shown to be applicable, in which in-situ surface soil was {{used to make a}} high lightweight soil embankment, which means that the in-situ surface soil is expanded to attain the required volume of the embankment.

50|$|From {{the time}} the {{original}} urban society collapsed, the great mound became overgrown with trees, the roots of which helped stabilize its steep slopes. In the 20th century, researchers removed {{the trees in the}} course of work at the mound and park preparation. Reduction of groundwater levels in the Mississippi floodplain during the 1950s caused the mound to dry out, damaging the clay layers within. When heavy rainfall occurred, it caused new slumping, starting about 1956. The increasingly violent weather of recent decades has exacerbated the problem. In 1984-5 there were several slumps, and the state government brought in <b>surplus</b> <b>soil</b> to make repairs to the major scar on the eastern side. A decade later, there was further slumping on the western side, so irregular that repair was impractical. Drains were installed to reduce the effects of heavy rain.

50|$|Following World War II, the {{government}} struggled {{with how to}} deal with the large farm surpluses that have been created by price supports. The first proposed solution to the problem was the Brannan Plan proposed by Secretary of Agriculture, C. F. Brannan, in 1949. The Brannan plan allowed for the treasury to pay farmers the difference between market prices and a modernized parity price. The Brannan plan was praised because it would eliminate the need to store surpluses and is also beneficial to the American for the goodbye across the low prices. However, the Brannan plan was never instituted. Many labor consumer groups supported plan as well as the Americans for Democratic action, and the NFU. However, most labor economist opposed the plan “for its failure to make provisions for the adjustment for support levels in light of demand and supply and for setting these levels and excessive 100% parity.” The Soil Bank act fall of the Brannan plan and was a less radical solution to the problem of crop <b>surpluses.</b> The <b>Soil</b> Bank act was similar to many Depression-era solutions.|$|R

Nitrogen was mainly distributed in the stems and leaves of the flue-cured tobacco, and went up gradually with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer. Generally, with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer, the proportion of fertilizer-N in roots, stems, buds and terminal buds first increased and then decreased, however, it basically showed the increasing trend in leaves. The loss of nitrogen (runoff, seepage and sediment) and wastage nitrogen (other ways) mainly came from soil-N with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer rate.

In this paper, we show the need for, and the application of, a process-based relationship between soil moisture conditions and vegetation characteristics. We considered 366 groundwater-dependent sites, where oxygen stress, caused by a <b>surplus</b> of <b>soil</b> moisture, codetermines plant performance. We compared two existing indirect proxies for the soil oxygen status – namely mean spring groundwater level (MSL) and sum exceedence value (SEV) – with our newly developed process-based proxy, viz. root respiration stress (RS). The two indirect proxies and the process-based proxy for oxygen stress performed equally well in describing vegetation characteristics for the Netherlands under the current climate. However, relationships based on MSL and SEV appeared to produce systematic prediction errors when applied outside their calibration range, {{in contrast to the}} relationship based on RS. Hence, the two indirect proxies cannot be used in projections, such as in predicting effects of climate change on vegetation composition, all the more because they – unlike RS – do not account for essential parameters that determine oxygen stress (e. g. temperature and extreme rainfall events in the growing season). We advocate using RS for estimating vegetation impacts in climate projections to increase the reliability and effectiveness of adaptive strategie...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT:The {{effect of}} European black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.) on the {{contents}} of carbon and nitrogen, exchangeable base cations, and plant available forms of phosphorus in the reclaimed mine soils formed by waste deposition from opencast lignite mines was researched in central Serbia. It was concluded that the greatest part of dead organic residues reaching the soil under European black alder monocultures was liable to rapid decomposition into end products. This was the consequence of a narrow C/N ratio in the European black alder litterfall which amounted on average to 12. 77 in the study monocultures. Only {{a small part of}} organic residues was transformed into humus. On that account, European black alder monocultures did not {{have a major impact on}} the accumulation of organic carbon and total nitrogen in the soil. The content of carbon in the surface layers accounted for 1. 55 - 1. 57 %, and the content of nitrogen to 0. 085 - 0. 132 %. Fast mineralisation of organic matter, and thus also of the organic forms of nitrogen, resulted in the <b>surplus</b> of <b>soil</b> nitrates, which were liable to washing through the soil. Nitrate movement resulted in the soil leaching and the movement of base cations, primarily calcium, to the deeper layers of the solum.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyse the economic and environmental effects of extra region specific environmental measures and a redistribution of direct payments to the Dutch agricultural sector in 2020. In doing so a chain of models is used from the dairy farm level to the regional sector level in the Netherlands to the European sector level. From the dairy farm model it is found that the extra-environmental measures result in a decrease in the number of dairy cows per ha and a decrease in the gross margin per ha in the regions at hand. At maximum the gross margin decreases with about € 1, 300 per ha. This is the case on intensive types of dairy farms in the Nature 2000 areas. Linking and aggregating these results to the regional sector level and using the sector model of the Netherlands it is found that income from dairy farming at sector level and national milk production decreases with about 6 %.

40|$|Regional climate {{simulations}} over Europe were initialized with {{soil moisture}} {{derived from the}} Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) {{in order to assess}} the model accuracy in predicting soil moisture and other components of the hydrological cycle. The AMSR-E soil moisture initially showed systematic differences with model-predicted soil moisture. For proper initialization the AMSR-E product had to be rescaled and after that vertically profiled. To retrieve a root zone soil moisture profile, we tested the application of an exponential filter. The smoothing through the layers of the ERA-Interim soil moisture profile was applied to the rescaled AMSR-E surface soil moisture. The filter performed very well for that part of the data set where the top layer is positively correlated with the deeper layers. After the preparation of the soil moisture fields, several sensitivity simulations were performed. The model's soil moisture was replaced with the vertically profiled AMSR-E soil moisture at different initial times for a dry summer (2003) and a wet summer (2005). In general, the <b>surplus</b> of <b>soil</b> moisture in the AMSR-E data resulted in a better performance in predicting temperature when compared with observations. This finding was more pronounced in the dry summer of 2003 when the model results appeared very sensitive to land-atmosphere feedbacks.

40|$|International audienceExcessive {{nutrient}} delivery into freshwater bodies {{results in}} increased eutrophication risk worldwide. Because high-frequency monitoring cannot be generalised to all rivers, methods {{are needed to}} assess eutrophication risk in contexts with scarce data. To this end, we present an assessment framework which includes: (i) a mass-balance model to estimate diffuse N and P transfer/retention in unmonitored catchments and (ii) a set of indicators based on N:P:Si molar ratios to assess the risk of eutrophication in freshwaters. The model, called Nutting, integrates variables that describe both agricultural pressures and physical attributes of catchments (climate, topography, soil). Nutting refines previous mass-balance models by describing nutrient pressures with <b>soil</b> N <b>surplus</b> and <b>soil</b> P content instead of N and P inputs, and by considering physical attributes not only as lumped variables over the entire area but also within river corridors. The model was calibrated {{on a set of}} 160 independent catchments across France and applied to all headwater catchments. We found that apparent N and P retention represented 53 +/- 24 % and 95 +/- 29 % of soil N and P surplus, respectively, and was mainly controlled by the climate and a hydrology-related connectivity index. The spatial organisation of the landscape was of secondary importance compared to the refined description of agricultural pressures. Estimated eutrophication risk was highly sensitive to assumptions about P bioavailability, hence the potential range of headwaters at risk of eutrophication spanned 26 - 63 % of the catchments, depending on assumptions. This framework provides a generic method to assess the relative contribution of agriculture to nutrient loads and the subsequent risk of eutrophication. (V) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As this soil includes sulfuric acid produced with the oxidation of sulfide, the growth of plants is disturbed and it becomes difficult to improve the soil by adding a stabilizer. In general, the calcic materials such as stone powder and zeolite have been employed to neutralize the acid sulfate soil from the past. Therefore, the shells which are composed mainly of a calcium carbonate {{can also be considered}} to be useful as a material for the neutralization process. We have ascertained the stabilization effect due to the using of crushed oyster shell by comparing the amount of swelling and CBR value for soil-stabilizer-shell mixture with those for soil-stabilizer mixture. Mixing crushed oyster shell into the soil, pH value of the mixture gradually shifted to neutral with elapsed time and its water content decreased immediately. Furthermore, the amount of swelling which occurred during submergence curing was extremely small for soil-stabilizer-shell mixture and CBR value of this mixture was 1. 5 to 4 times larger than that of soil-stabilizer mixture.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{economic}} and environmental impacts of CAP greening introduced by the 2013 CAP reform using the CAPRI model. CAPRI captures the farm heterogeneity across the EU and it allows to depict {{the implementation of the}} greening measures in high detail while integrating the environmental effects and the market feedback of the simulated policy changes. The simulated results reveal that the economic impacts (land use, production, price and income) of CAP greening are rather small, although some farm types, crops (fallow land and pulses) and Member States may be affected more significantly. The CAP greening will lead simultaneously to a small increase in prices and a small decrease in production. Farm income slightly increases because the price effects offset the production decline. Similarly to economic effects, the environmental impacts (GHG emissions,N surplus, ammonia emissions, soil erosion, and biodiversity-friendly farming practices) of CAP greening are small, although some regions may see greater effects than others. In general, the environmental effects at EU level are positive on a per hectare basis, but the increase in UAA can reverse the sign for total impacts.

Results indicate that nitrate concentrations in the upper groundwater are related to N <b>surplus,</b> land use, <b>soil</b> type and groundwater level. On dry sandy <b>soils,</b> the N <b>surplus</b> has to be below 60 to 140 kg of N per ha per year, depending on land use, to decrease the nitrate concentrations in the upper groundwater to below 50 mg nitrate per litre. Decreases of N and P concentrations in surface waters, upon lowering levy-free surpluses appear relatively small. For improving the ecological state of surface waters, we recommend a combination of low levy-free N and P surpluses with dredging P rich sediments, flushing of ditches, and decreasing discharges from other sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} policy {{measures}} on agriculture {{and water quality}} with respect to nitrogen have been monitored on farms in the sandy regions since the early 1990 s. Nitrogen surplus on dairy farms decreased by 100 kg/ha (30 %) in the 1991 - 1999 period due to demonstration projects and the implementation of MINAS, limiting farm gate balance surplus. Nitrogen surplus on arable farms has slightly decreased (30 kg/ha, i. e. 20 %), probably because MINAS became mandatory for arable farms from 2001 onwards. About 25 % of the farm-gate balance N surplus leached as nitrate into the upper metre of the groundwater. The NO 3 -N concentration decreased in the 1992 - 2001 period, but the decrease was larger for dairy farms (16 mg/l, 46 %) than for arable farms (7. 7 mg/l, 30 %). Of the decrease in NO 3 -N concentration on dairy farms, 23 % {{is caused by a}} decrease in N surplus, and 27 % by environmental factors, such as a higher precipitation <b>surplus,</b> more wet <b>soils</b> and more peat soils {{in the second part of}} the monitoring period. However, unknown factors are responsible for 50 % of the decrease...|$|R
40|$|Within manure {{management}} strategies, anaerobic digestion followed by vacuum evaporation of digestate represents an interesting solution {{for both the}} reduction of nitrogen and phoshorous <b>surpluses</b> in <b>soils</b> and to avoid odour and gas emissions connected with the operations of treatment and storage of effluents. In reality, both anaerobic digestion and evaporation processes {{take place in a}} confined reactor, collecting gaseous emission as biogas and condensate, respectively. The aim of vacuum evaporation is i) to reduce the volume of the slurry to be spread on the field, thus reducing transport and distribution costs, and ii) to produce a condensate that can be discharged, to reduce the storage volume only to the concentrated fraction. Previous anaerobic digestion (AD) provides the heat necessary for the evaporation process, without it wasting in the atmosphere, as usually happens for the amount exceeding the needs of the digestor. With the goal to verify concentration efficiency, energy consumption and characteristics of concentrate and condensate, tests were performed using a one-stage semi-continuous pilot plant fed with the liquid fraction of a cattle slurry and maize silage digestate, without acidification. This practice is used to prevent ammonia volatilisation, but requires significant quantities of acid, thus increasing operational costs and causing problems for the on-farm storage of this product. A 12 % TS concentrate was obtained, representing the 40 - 50 % of the effluent. The condensate, because of its ammonia content (2. 7 g/L on average) cannot be discharged. A solution for the recovery of ammonia from condensate is the filtration on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, with previous acidification. Tests are on-going with a RO pilot plant to verify whether discharge limits can be matched. With a heat requirement of 0. 87 kWh/kg of condensate, heat is the limiting factor of the process when the objective is to treat the entire quantity of digestate effluent from the biogas plant, especially in winter when the heat demand from AD plant increases...|$|R
