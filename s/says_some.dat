25|$|Maimonides (12th century), in his Mishneh Torah, {{says that}} the {{restrictions}} as to the eating of meat and the drinking of wine refer only to the last meal before fasting on the Eighth Day of Av, if taken after noon, but before noon anything may be eaten (Hilchoth Ta'anith 5:8). Rabbi Moses of Coucy (13th century) wrote {{that it is the}} universal custom to refrain from meat and wine during the whole day preceding the Ninth of Av (Sefer Mitzvoth ha-Gadol, Venice ed, Laws of Tishah B'Av, 249b). Rabbi Joseph Caro (16th century) <b>says</b> <b>some</b> are accustomed to abstain from meat and wine {{from the beginning of the}} week in which the Ninth Day of Av falls; and still others abstain throughout the three weeks from the Seventeenth of Tammuz (Shulkhan Arukh, Orach Chayim 551).|$|E
500|$|The same source tells {{two stories}} {{of the death of}} Orion. The first says that because of his [...] "living joined in too great a friendship" [...] with Oenopion, he boasted to Artemis and Leto that he could kill {{anything}} which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion. In the second story, Apollo objected to his sister Artemis's love for Orion, and, seeing Orion swimming with just his head visible, challenged her to shoot at that mark, which she hit, killing him. He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased Pleione, the mother of the Pleiades, for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars. In Works and Days, Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. Canis Minor and Canis Major are his dogs, the one in front is called Procyon. They chase Lepus, the hare, although Hyginus <b>says</b> <b>some</b> critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing Taurus, the bull, instead. A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, Maera, Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, Lycoctonus, Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.|$|E

Entertainment Tonight's Sophie Schillaci declared it a [...] "fun track" [...] that stayed true to the singer's [...] "classic country roots". A staff member from WUSN enjoyed the recording, and claimed it would make anyone more excited for If I'm Honest, which was then unreleased.

Sidbury <b>says</b> <b>some</b> trials {{had a few}} measures to prevent abuses, such as an appointed attorney, but they were [...] "hardly 'fair'". Slave codes prevented slaves from being treated like whites, and they were given quick trials without a jury. Monroe influenced the Executive Council to pardon and sell some slaves instead of hanging them. Historians say the Virginia courts executed between 26 and 35 slaves. None of the executed slaves had killed any whites because the uprising had been foiled before it began.|$|E

2500|$|According to one Rand biographer, {{most people}} first read Rand's works in their [...] "formative years." [...] Rand's former protégé Nathaniel Branden {{referred}} to Rand's [...] "especially powerful {{appeal to the}} young," [...] while Onkar Ghate of the Ayn Rand Institute said Rand [...] "appeals to the idealism of youth." [...] This appeal has alarmed a number of critics of the philosophy. Many {{of these young people}} later abandon their positive view of Rand and are often said to have [...] "outgrown" [...] her ideas. Supporters of Rand's work recognize the phenomenon, but attribute it to the loss of youthful idealism and inability to resist social pressures for intellectual conformity. In contrast, historian Jennifer Burns, writing in Goddess of the Market (2009), <b>says</b> <b>some</b> critics [...] "dismiss Rand as a shallow thinker appealing only to adolescents," [...] although she thinks the critics [...] "miss her significance" [...] as a [...] "gateway drug" [...] to right-wing politics.|$|E

2500|$|A 1947 {{report by}} an {{official}} inspector {{who visited the}} Home <b>says</b> <b>some</b> {{of the children were}} suffering from malnutrition, and 12 out of 31 infants examined were described as being [...] "emaciated and not thriving". It also says that the Home was overcrowded, with 271 children and 61 mothers living there. Death rates were extraordinarily high: 34 per cent of children died in the home in 1943; 25 per cent died in 1944; [...] 23 per cent died in 1945; 27 per cent died in 1946. [...] The report states [...] "The death rate amongst infants is high... The death rate had appeared to be on the decrease but has now begun to rise again. It is time to enquire into the possible cause before the death rate mounts higher." [...] The report went on to say, [...] "the care given to infants in the Home is good, the Sisters are careful and attentive; diets are excellent. It is not here that we must look for cause of the death rate".|$|E
2500|$|Ever {{since that}} time, people run around {{saying they are}} looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were {{separated}} from women run after their own kind, thus creating lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men (191e). Those that come from original androgynous beings are the men and women that engage in heterosexual love. He <b>says</b> <b>some</b> people think homosexuals are shameless, but he thinks they are the bravest, most manly of all, as evidenced by the fact that only they grow up to be politicians (192a), and that many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful (191e). Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated (192c). This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained. [...] Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. [...] He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the axe again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart again(193a). If man works with the god of Love, they will escape this fate and instead find wholeness.|$|E
