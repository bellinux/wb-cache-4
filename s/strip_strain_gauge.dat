40|$|The writers wish {{to thank}} the discusser for his {{valuable}} comments. While the writers are in general agreement with the discusser, some of his points warrant further clarification. Firstly, {{the aim of the}} paper was to investigate the effectiveness of the geocell mattress used as reinforcement in subballast under cyclic loading. The authors agree that the vertical strains reported for the geocell and subballast were different in magnitude from those reported for the geocell mattress. This is because strains in the geocell mattress were measured using <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> attached to the geocell <b>strips.</b> <b>Strain</b> <b>gauges</b> inclined in both vertical and horizontal directions were used to measure axial and radial strains, respectively. As clearly stated in the original paper, linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) were used for recording the vertical and lateral strains of unreinforced as well as reinforced subballast specimens...|$|R

40|$|A strain {{survey of}} the F/A- 18 {{stabilator}} spindle has recently been undertaken to calibrate a finite element model of the spindle. Whilst the strain measurements used for the finite element validation were made using conventional electrical resistance foil <b>strip</b> <b>gauges,</b> <b>strain</b> measurements were also carried out using co-located distributed optical-fibre Bragg-grating arrays. This report describes the design, fabrication and attachment of the distributed Bragg gratings and compares the strain response of the optical fibre sensors to the conventional electrical-resistance foil <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> during the static strain survey. The results demonstrate that {{the performance of the}} high-density distributed Bragg grating arrays compares favourably with electrical resistance foil strip gauges with the additional advantage of reducing <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> cabling weight, density and complexity. The response of the Bragg gratings to a dynamic loading regime of up to 100 Hz was also measured. Although excellent correlation between the two types of measurement techniques on a full scale structure were observed, further work is required to optimise the application technique for these gratings and to assess the reliability and durability of these sensors over time...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> {{is capable}} of measuring strains in the approximate range of 0 to 50 microstrains with a resolution of 0. 1 microstrain. (To some extent, {{the resolution of the}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> can be tailored and may be extensible to 0. 01 microstrain.) The total cost of the hardware components of this <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is less than $ 100 at 2006 prices. In comparison with prior <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> capable of measurement of such low <b>strains,</b> this <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is more accurate, more economical, and more robust, and it operates at a higher update rate. <b>Strain</b> <b>gauges</b> like this one are useful mainly for measuring small strains (including those associated with vibrations) in such structures as rocket test stands, buildings, oilrigs, bridges, and dams. The technology was inspired by the need to measure very small strains on structures supporting liquid oxygen tanks, as a way to measure accurately mass of liquid oxygen during rocket engine testing. This improved fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> was developed to overcome some of the deficiencies of both traditional foil <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> and prior fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauges.</b> Traditional foil <b>strain</b> gages do not have adequate signal-to-noise ratios at such small <b>strains.</b> Fiber-optic <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> {{have been shown to be}} potentially useful for measuring such small strains, but heretofore, the use of fiberoptic <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> has been inhibited, variously, by complexity, cost, or low update rate...|$|R

The <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> method is an experimental technique to the stress-strain analysis with high accuracy of measurements.

5000|$|Humidity - If {{the wires}} {{connecting}} the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> to the signal conditioner are not protected against humidity, such as bare wire, corrosion can occur, leading to parasitic resistance. This can allow currents to flow between the wires and the substrate {{to which the}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is glued, or between the two wires directly, introducing an error which competes with the current flowing through the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge.</b> For this reason, high-current, low-resistance <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> (120 ohm) are less prone {{to this type of}} error. To avoid this error it is sufficient to protect the <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> wires with insulating enamel (e.g., epoxy or polyurethane type). <b>Strain</b> <b>gauges</b> with unprotected wires may be used only in a dry laboratory environment but not in an industrial one.|$|R

The <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> change the resistance as they stretch or contract, and their change in resistance is correlated to the strain of the object they are attached to and consequentially the force or torque applied to the object. <b>Strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are typically wired in a Wheatstone bridge configuration using four <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> (some of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> can be replaced by resistors). The increase or decrease in resistance of two of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> (placed in opposite sides of the bridge) causes the output voltage of the bridge to increase or decrease, respectively. The opposite is also true for the other two <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> where the increase or decrease in resistance decreases or increases the output voltage of the bridge, respectively.|$|R

The {{most common type of}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is the metallic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge,</b> which consists of a very fine wire arranged in a grid pattern. The wire is bonded to a thin and flexible substrate, which is then attached to the test specimen. As the test specimen is deformed, the thin wire in the gauge is stretched or compressed, thus changing its length and consequently its electrical resistance[23]. Other types of <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are based on semiconductor materials, like silicon. Silicon-based <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are usually more sensitive than metallic gauges.

Silver and carbon electrical resistance <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> were fabricated and characterised. Carbon resistive <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> with gauge factor values greater than 16 were measured using a proven cantilever bending arrangement. This represented a seven to eight fold increase in sensitivity over commercial gauges that would be glued to the implant materials. The strain sensor fabrication process was specifically developed for directly fabricating resistive strain sensor structures on synthetic bone implant surface (ceramic and titanium) {{without the use of}} glue and to provide feedback for medical diagnosis.
