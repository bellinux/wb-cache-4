5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} verge of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross.</b> Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{first choice}} {{to lead the}} mission was Count Folke Bernadotte, the {{vice-chairman}} of the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> {{and a member of}} the Swedish Royal Family. When Bernadotte's proposed appointment was rejected by the Hungarians, Lauer suggested Wallenberg as a potential replacement. Olsen was introduced to Wallenberg by Lauer in June 1944 and came away from the meeting impressed and, shortly thereafter, appointed Wallenberg to lead the mission. Olsen's selection of Wallenberg met with objections from some US officials who doubted his reliability, in light of existing commercial relationships between businesses owned by the Wallenberg family and the German government. These differences were eventually overcome and the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs agreed to the American request to assign Wallenberg to its legation in Budapest as part of an arrangement in which Wallenberg's appointment was granted in exchange for a lessening of American diplomatic pressure on neutral Sweden to curtail their nation's free-trade policies toward Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of extreme climatic conditions, contacts with civilians, {{the density of}} the population in the barracks and poor organization led to the first outbreak of typhus in December 1915. In February 1916, a quarantine was enforced and sick prisoners were transferred either to the hospital or separate barracks. The epidemic was subdued in March with the help of two <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> sisters of mercy who had arrived two months earlier. In order to further isolate the healthy from the sick, healthy prisoners formed groups which were employed in the local agricultural sector. Productivity improved rapidly once the work became paid. The spectrum of employment opportunities gradually expanded to include the telegraph–post service, railroad maintenance, leather work, logging, photo ateliers, mills, construction work, production of building materials and soap. The influx of cheap labor greatly benefited the local economy. Over time the camp was visited by delegations from the Danish and <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> as well as the American embassy. The commander of the Zabaykalsk gendarmerie believed the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> mission to be motivated by intelligence gathering rather than humanitarian concerns. Reports issued by the delegation attested to the upholding of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} few weeks of the war and after liberation the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> {{undertook}} a program, known as the White Buses, aimed to rescue Scandinavian concentration camp inmates. After negotiations led by Count Folke Bernadotte some 15,000 inmates were evacuated in the last months of the war. Half of them Scandinavians, including 423 Danish Jews. In addition to the White Busses a train with some 2,000 female inmates, 960 of them Jewish, arrived in Padborg, Denmark, on May 2. and then further transported to Copenhagen and Malmö, Sweden.|$|E

25|$|In February 1945, {{the head}} of the Swedish office of the WJC, Hilel Storch, {{established}} contact through an intermediary with SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In April, Norbert Masur of the Swedish Section of the WJC secretly met with Himmler at Harzfeld, around 70 kilometers north of Berlin. Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with {{the head of}} the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> Folke Bernadotte, the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.|$|E
25|$|During early 1945, Schellenberg {{encouraged}} Himmler {{to overthrow}} Hitler {{in order to}} negotiate a separate peace with the Western Allies, using as an excuse Hitler's poor health; however, Himmler never took action toward doing it and vacillated instead. He also convinced Himmler {{to meet with the}} former president of Switzerland, Jean-Marie Musy, who promised to pay in Swiss francs for the release of Jews. At the end of the war, Schellenberg was able to persuade Himmler to try negotiating with the Western Allies through Count Folke Bernadotte. Schellenberg had earlier in the year worked as an intermediary between Count Bernadotte and Himmler for the release and safe passage of a number of prisoners and inmates held in concentration camps through the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1945, Bernadotte was in Germany when he met Heinrich Himmler, who was briefly {{appointed}} commander of an entire German army following the assassination attempt on Hitler the year before. [...] Bernadotte had originally been assigned to retrieve Norwegian and Danish POWs in Germany. [...] He returned on 1 May 1945, the day after Hitler's death. [...] Following an interview, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet wrote that Bernadotte succeeded in rescuing 15,000 people from German concentration camps, including about 8000 Danes and Norwegians and 7000 women of French, Polish, Czech, British, American, Argentinian, and Chinese nationalities. [...] The missions took around two months, and exposed the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> staff to significant danger, both due to political difficulties and by taking them through areas under Allied bombing.|$|E
2500|$|By {{virtue of}} its age and place in {{international}} humanitarian law, the ICRC is the lead agency in the Red Cross Movement, but it has weathered some power struggles within the movement. The ICRC has come into conflict with the Federation and certain national societies at various times. The American Red Cross threatened to supplant the ICRC with its creation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as [...] "a real international Red Cross" [...] after the First World War. Elements of the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> desired to supplant the Swiss authority of the ICRC after WWII. Over time the Swedish sentiments subsided, and the IFRC grew to work more harmoniously with the ICRC after years of organizational discord. Currently, the IFRC's Movement Cooperation division organizes interaction and cooperation with the ICRC.|$|E

[...] The main point of the proposal was that Germany would only surrender to the Western Allies (the United Kingdom and the United States), but {{would be allowed to}} continue resisting the Soviet Union. [...] According to Bernadotte, he told Himmler that the proposal had no chance of acceptance, but nevertheless he passed it on to the Swedish government and the Western Allies. It had no lasting effect.|$|E

Eventually Himmler agreed that these Scandinavians, and selected others regarded as less harmful to Germany, could be transported through Denmark to freedom in Sweden. Then between the 16 and 28 April 1945, Neuengamme was systematically emptied of all its remaining prisoners, together other groups of concentration camp inmates and Soviet POWs; with the intention that they would be relocated to a secret new camp, either on the Baltic island of Fehmarn; or at Mysen in Norway where preparations were put in hand to house them under the control of concentration camp guards evacuated from Sachsenhausen.
