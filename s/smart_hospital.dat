The main commitment for any health care system is to improve the quality of the patient and privacy of patient’s information. There are many organizational units or departments in the hospital, from which, it is necessary for them that there should be good coordination in each others. Even the available health care automation software also does not provide such coordination among them. These softwares are limited up to the hospital works but do not provide the interconnectivity with other hospitals and blood banks etc. Thus, these hospitals cannot share information in-spite of the good facilities and services.

30|$|Through the {{extensive}} literature review, {{it is concluded}} that in most sleep wakeup schemes, all nodes have the same generic sleep/wake schedule and each node makes a wake up decision in isolation, without considering its neighbors {{in order to save}} energy. However, as WSNs use multi-hop communication, every node has one designated next-hop relaying node in the neighborhood, thus, to do the transmission, sender node has to wait for the arrival of wakeup time of the next hop forwarding node. Similarly, next forwarding nodes {{have to wait for the}} wakeup interval of its next hop and so on, until message reaches the sink node. Consequently, due to the autonomous same duration wake-up intervals, delays are added at each hop along the path to the sink, as each node has wait for next hop wake interval before transmitting packet. All these delays at each hop contribute to the final end-to-end delay of packet. This increase in delay is the equal to the product of the number of intermediate forwarders times the length of the wakeup interval [17]. This delay is not acceptable for many delay-sensitive applications, which includes military surveillance, tsunami alarm, <b>smart</b> <b>hospitals,</b> seismic detection, biomedical health monitoring, hazardous environment sensing, fire detection, intrusion detection, disaster monitoring, and real-time control, which require the event reporting delay to be small. In this article, the delay minimization problem is investigated and sleep wake scheduling scheme to optimally choose the variable wakeup interval of the nodes based on node's dissimilar traffic loads is proposed. The proposed protocol provides distributed and low-complexity solution to this problem.|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) {{have emerged}} as a new information-gathering {{paradigm}} based on the collaborative efforts {{of a large number}} of self-organized sensing nodes. These networks form the basis for many types of smart environments such as <b>smart</b> <b>hospitals,</b> intelligent battlefields, earthquake response systems, and learning environments. A set of applications, such as biomedicine, hazardous environment exploration, environmental monitoring, military tracking and reconnaissance surveillance, are the key motivations for the recent research efforts in this area. Different from traditional networks, sensor networks do impose a set of new limitations for the protocols designed for this type of networks. Devices in sensor networks have a much smaller memory, constrained energy supply, less process and communication bandwidth. Topologies of the sensor networks are constantly changing due to a high node failure rate, occasional shutdown and abrupt communication interferences. Because of the nature of the applications supported, sensor networks need to be densely deployed and have anywhere from hundred to thousands of sensing devices, which are orders of magnitude larger than traditional ad hoc mobile networks. In addition, energy conservation becomes the center of focus because of the limited battery capacity and the difficulty of recharge in the hostile environment. With fundamental difference between traditional networks and sensor networks, it is not appropriate and probably inefficient to port previous solutions for ad hoc networks into sensor networks with only incremental modifications. For ensuring the functionality of a sensor network, especially in malicious environments, security mechanisms are essential for all sensor networks. However, sensor networks differ from classical (wireless) networks and this consequently makes it harder to secure them. Reasons for this are resource constraints of the sensor nodes, the wireless multi-hop communication, and the possibility of node compromise. Since sensor nodes are often deployed in unattended or even hostile environments and are usually not equipped with tamper-resistant hardware, it is relatively easy to compromise a sensor node. By compromising a sensor node, an adversary gets access to all data stored on the node, such as cryptographic keys. This thesis discusses concepts and mechanisms to cope with energy efficiency and security issues in wireless sensor networks. The contribution of this work is to provide a novel system architecture for WSN which offers interfaces for diverse applications to directly control communication, topology, mobility, security, localization, and energy-saving based on predefined requirements...|$|R

Analysis and simulation study show that our proposed iterative algorithm guarantees globally convergence to the least-squares (LS) solution, where for our suitably assumed independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) zero-mean Gaussian RSS measurement errors the converged localization performance achieves the optimum that corresponds to the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) ...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{explosive}} deployment of WiFi and ZigBee wireless networks, 2. 4 GHz ISM bands (2. 4 GHz- 2. 5 GHz) {{are becoming increasingly}} crowded, and the co-channel coexistence of these two networks is inevitable. For coexistence networks, people always want to predict their performance (e. g. throughput, energy consumption, etc.) before deployment, or even want to tune parameters to compensate unnecessary performance degradation (owing to the huge differences between these two MAC protocols) or to satisfy some performance requirements (e. g., priority, delay constraint, etc.) of them. However, predicting and tuning performance of coexisting WiFi and ZigBee networks has been a challenging task, primarily {{due to the lack}} of corresponding simulators and analytical models. In this dissertation, we addressed the aforementioned problems by presenting simulators and models for the coexistence of WiFi and ZigBee devices. Specifically, based on the energy efficiency and traffic pattern of three practical coexistence scenarios: disaster rescue site, <b>smart</b> <b>hospital</b> and home automation. We first of all classify them into three classes, which are non-sleeping devices with saturated traffic (SAT), non-sleeping devices with unsaturated traffic (UNSAT) and duty-cycling devices with unsaturated traffic (DC-UNSAT). Then a simulator and an analytical model are proposed for each class, where each simulator is verified by simple hardware based experiment. Next, we derive the expressions for performance metrics like throughput, delay etc., and predict them using both the proposed simulator and the model. Due to the higher accuracy of the simulator, the results from them are used as the ground truth to validate the accuracy of the model. Last, according to some common performance tuning requirements for each class, we formulate them into optimization problems and propose the corresponding solving methods. The results show that the proposed simulators have high accuracy in performance prediction, while the models, although are less accurate than the former, can be used in fast prediction. In particular, the models can also be easily used in optimization problems for performance tuning, and the results prove its high efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Protection of the {{environment}} {{is one of the}} most sensitive topics of recent years and is resulting in more effective recycling and reuse of materials. Simply disposing of waste through landfill or burning, as was the historically case, will damage our environment. Waste disposal systems usually lack automatic logistic support feature, which can result in high transportation cost, low recycling rates and/or fly-tipping. Some waste material such as plasterboard has a low recycling rate because of the high recycling cost and transport fees. The UK generates more than 1 Mt of plasterboard waste from construction and demolition sector per annum, and only 7 %, or about 70, 000 tonnes are recycled. This thesis conducts research on developing a 'Technology Hub' framework for using emerging technology (such as RFID) in waste management sector that aims to help the recycling rate by tracking and verification of the waste movement in order to prevent fly -tipping and illegal disposal. The framework developed in this research is in two formats: 'Technology view framework' classifies the technologies by their functionality, and can be used as a tool to determine the technologies for certain systems; ' Network view framework' focuses on the system structure and data flow in the system, and the relationship between each component. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, RFID technology has been examined in this research by experiments, which indicates the RFID technology is able to be used in waste management scenarios, and enable 'automatic feature' for the systems based on the framework. In addition, a software module for control of RFID equipment linked with knowledge-based system is developed. A framework has been developed and three case studies from two hospitals and waste recycling companies are used to validate the system. Two of the novel waste management systems are developed for evaluation purpose, with RFID technology and knowledge-based technology: Firstly, a plasterboard waste management system for a local waste recycling company to improve their waste management, and secondly, for a Chinese Hospital to prevent the loss of contaminated waste during the internal transportation process.

However, room-scale solutions are not very common today, and as such, other interfaces also need to be supported. A key research point has therefore been how different devices and interfaces need to adapt for them to be included into a <b>smart</b> university <b>hospital.</b> As the widely-used architectures utilized today do not support room-scale VR, a prototype application with a new architecture has been developed from the ground up, using the Unity game engine. The requirements of the application have been based on a role-playing case from an existing solution. The prototype and the existing solution were tested by the same group of people, and the results showed that room-scale virtual reality increased realism and immersion for the users. Additionally, supporting several interfaces in the same environment proved to be a challenging task. Finally, the thesis concludes that a multi-interface application used for interprofessional collaborative healthcare training can be developed in a few months, given that not all interaction methods provide the same functionality. It also seems evident that room-scale virtual reality makes procedural tasks much more lifelike.
