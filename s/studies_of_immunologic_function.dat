40|$|Chemotherapeutic {{agents are}} used widely in {{clinical}} medicine {{for the treatment}} of conditions where diminution of the host immune response is a goal. The clinical use of immunosuppression is indicated for immunologically mediated disease, lymphoproliferative diseases, and prevention of graft rejection. Five categories of agents are useful for these purposes; they are ionizing irradiation, corticosteroids, biological alkylating agents, antilymphocyte sera and antimetabolites. While the specific molecular action of many of these drugs is known, how they affect cellular events in immune responses is less clear. One of the unfortunate sequelae of chemotherapy induced immunosuppression is an increased susceptibility of the host to opportunistic pathogens or malignancies. Specific methods are described for monitoring the various parameters of both humoral and cellular immunity. <b>Studies</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunologic</b> <b>function</b> in lymphoma patients and cardiac transplant patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs have shown specific defects in cell mediated immunity to herpes viruses which may relate to their increased susceptibility to infection by these agents...|$|E

50|$|Decoy cells alone do {{not need}} to be treated since they do not {{necessarily}} indicate pathology. However, in the context of overt viral replication against the background of immunodeficiency, the viruses that cause the emergence of decoy cells must be treated. For polyomavirus BK, only the restoration <b>of</b> <b>immunologic</b> <b>function</b> and the subsequent reconstitution of cells with antiviral activity such as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells has proven to be effective. Restoration of the immunesystem can be achieved via different paths according to the different patient groups. For example, in severely immunocompromised HIV-patients, previously called AIDS-patients, <b>immunologic</b> <b>function</b> can be restored by treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy. In kidney transplant recipients who are treated with immunosuppressive agents, <b>immunologic</b> <b>function</b> can be treated by tapering of the immunosuppressive regimen. Other agents that have been proposed to target polyomavirus BK, such as cidofovir, fluoroquinolones, leflunomide, and statins are far from established and the published results on their effectivity are conflicting. Also, some of these agents may cause severe long-lasting side effects.|$|R

MethodsThirty-three patients with severe trauma were randomly divided into a control group (n= 16) and a treatment group (n= 17). The patients of two groups were all treated conventionally, and the only difference was that Xuebijing injection was given to patients of the treatment group. The CD+ 4 and CD+ 8 subpopulations of T-lymphocyte in the perioheral blood were detected respectively on admission, 3 rd and 5 th days after trauma by double antibody labeling and flow cytometry. ResultsThe CD+ 4 T-lymphocytes and CD+ 4 /CD+ 8 ratio of peripheral blood in patients with severe trauma decreased markedly on the 3 rd and 5 th days after trauma. Further more, compared with control group, the peripheral CD+ 4 T-lymphocytes and CD+ 4 /CD+ 8 ratio of treatment group renewed obviously on the 5 th day after trauma, and showed statistical differences (P< 0. 05).

Three patients received allografts from matched related donors and 3 patients from matched unrelated donors. Two patients received peripheral blood stem cells and 4 patients bone marrow {{hematopoietic stem cell}}s. Tacrolimus and short-course methotrexate on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 were used for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.

It has also been shown (3 - 5) that in vivo administration of IL- 2 can modify immune responses in nude and normal mice. However, the effects of IL- 2 on immune responses under control of Ir genes have not been tested. We have been studying the H- 2 - 1 inked Ir gene control of the antibody and T cell responses to sperm whale myoglobin, a model globular protein antigen. Both the T cell proliferative response and the antibody response to myoglobin are controlled in parallel by H- 2 - 1 inked genes (6, 7). The availability of large amounts of highly purified recombinant IL- 2 (8) prompted us to evaluate the influence of IL- 2 on immune responses under Ir gene control. For this purpose, we immunized low- and high-responder mice with myoglobin together with IL- 2, and evaluated its effects on antibody responses.

Reduced glutathione (GSH) and related thiols have been postulated to play important roles in detoxification of electrophilic xenobiotics, protection of tissues against reactive oxygen species, and modulation <b>of</b> <b>immunologic</b> <b>functions</b> in normal and diseased subjects. The dynamic aspects of GSH metabolism, however, and its significance in patients with LCD and ACD remain to be clarified. The current study was carried out to elucidate the pathogenesis and possible involvement of GSH in both types of inflammation. Normal mice and mice sensitized with dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) were challenged by cutaneous administration of DNCB, and changes in GSH metabolism in skin and liver were determined. Kinetic analysis revealed that 24 h after challenge with DNCB, levels of hepatic glutathione and its secretion increased more markedly in the sensitized mice than in the unsensitized animals. Administration of buthiothne-L-sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis, inhibited the increase in glutathione levels in the liver and the skin of both groups. Histologic examination revealed that cutaneous inflammation was enhanced by BSO more significantly in mice with ACD than with lCD.

Proliferation of spleen cells in response to concanavalin A (ConA) and toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA) was studied {{during the course of}} infection in mice susceptible (CBA/Ca) and resistant (BALB/c) to development of toxoplasmic encephalitis to determine if reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) are involved in the suppression of the proliferative responses. Maximal suppression of proliferation of spleen cells in response to ConA and TLA was observed on days 7 and 14 after infection and correlated with elevated levels of nitrite in spleen cell culture supernatants. By day 68 postinfection in BALB/c mice, proliferative responses returned to normal levels, whereas in CBA/Ca mice, they remained suppressed. The addition of an inhibitor of production of RNI (NG-monomethyl-L-arginine) increased proliferation of spleen cells in response to both ConA and TLA at days 7, 14, and 21 after infection. Depletion of adherent cells from spleen cell preparations obtained from acutely infected mice followed by their repletion with adherent spleen cells from uninfected mice resulted in increased proliferation of spleen cells from infected mice and a significant decrease in nitrite in the cultures.

40|$|Purpose: The purpose <b>of</b> this <b>study</b> was {{to review}} {{the results of a}} single-center {{experience}} in the management of “closed abdomen” hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) using a sophisticated technical device (EXIPER®) in the palliative setting of neoplastic ascites from peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with advanced cancer of different primary sites. Patients and methods: The study was an open, prospective, single-center, non-randomized study conducted at the Department of Medical Oncology 1, University of Cagliari, Italy, from May 2006 to October 2012. Fifteen patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis were treated with HIPEC: 5 males and 10 females (age range 51 – 82, median 62 years), for a total of 30 procedures (5 patients were treated more than once). Malignant ascites were from ovarian, uterine cervical, colorectal, gastric, malignant pleural mesothelioma, and unknown primary cancer. Main endpoints were increase of free interval between two consecutive procedures, progressive reduction of ascites volumes and improvement of quality of life assessed with ECOG performance status and EORTC QLQ-C 30 questionnaire, and improvement <b>of</b> <b>immunologic</b> <b>function.</b> Results: Twelve patients were completely evaluable while three patients were “lost” to follow-up. The treatment was well tolerated. The mean free interval between two consecutive drainages increased from 11. 2 to 39. 5 days. The mean ascites volume drained decreased from 7. 8 to 1. 8 l. ECOG PS improved in the majority of patients and EORTC QLQ-C 30 scores in all patients as well as <b>immunologic</b> <b>function.</b> In September 2015, only one patient was still alive. Conclusions: Our study shows that good results may be achieved in terms of symptom palliation and improvement of quality of life in very advanced cancer patients with MA from PC.

Aim: The aim <b>of</b> this <b>study</b> was to report the severity of periodontal disease in HIV-positive individuals and its association between clinical periodontal indices and CD 4 +T-cell count. Materials and Methods: 25 HIV-positive individuals were recruited and medical history was recorded. To evaluate periodontal disease, clinical attachment loss (CAL), oral hygiene index (OHI), and gingival bleeding index (GI) were recorded. Immune suppression was measured by peripheral blood CD 4 +T cells/mm 3 as analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistical Analysis: Association between CD 4 + T levels and clinical parameters were determined using correlation coefficient test. Results: When all subjects were evaluated, a negative correlation was obtained between CD 4 + T-cell count and clinical attachment loss (r = - 0. 68226). In individuals with CD 4 +cell counts < 200 cells/ mm 3, a negative correlation was obtained between clinical attachment loss (- 0. 35467) and GI (- 0. 35202). In patients with CD 4 count < 200, a negative correlation was obtained between CAL (- 0. 30361), GI (- 0. 29711), and OHI (- 0. 14669).

The changes of acute phase proteins (CRP, HP, a 1 -AAG and CER) and immune function (CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 + and CD 4 + /CD 8 +) levels before and after treatment were observed after 2 months. Results: Before treatment, CRP, HP, a 1 -AAG, CER, CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 + and CD 4 + /CD 8 + levels of two groups had no statistically significant difference; CRP, HP, a 1 -AAG, CER, and CD 8 + levels of control and observation groups decreased significantly after treatment, the decreases of observation group were more obvious than that of control group, and the levels after treatment were significantly {{lower than that of}} control groups.

40|$|Masters of ScienceBackground: Infection with HIV {{results in}} gradual loss <b>of</b> <b>immunologic</b> <b>functions,</b> {{especially}} those mediated by CD 4 +T helper cells with consequent impairment {{of the immune}} response leading to severe manifestations of periodontal disease. The lower the CD 4 +T lymphocyte cell count or the higher the level of immunosuppression, the higher the incidence of periodontal disease in those patients will be. Putative periodontopathic bacteria namely Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia, {{commonly referred to as}} "red complex", and many other bacterial species have been implicated in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. Objective: The present study tests the association between different CD 4 +T lymphocyte levels and "red complex" pathogens using BANA, in HIV-positive patients with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (CIPD). Methods: 120 HIV-positive patients from the infectious disease clinic at Tygerberg hospital participated in the study {{with a mean age of}} 33. 3 years. The CD 4 +T lymphocyte counts were obtained from patient's medical records. The six Ramjford teeth were used for evaluating periodontal clinical parameters such as plaque index, gingival index, periodontal probing depth and clinical attachment loss. Subgingival plaque samples were collected and analyzed by the enzymatic BANA test for the detection of the "red complex". Results: The CD 4 +T lymphocyte mean level was 293. 43 cells/mm 3. Statistically significant associations were found between CD 4 +T cell counts and probing depth (p= 0. 0434) and clinical attachment loss (p= 0. 0268). Significant associations were found between BANA with all the clinical indices (p= < 0. 05). However no association was found between CD 4 +T cell counts and BANA. Conclusion: HIV-positive patients show a high prevalence of "red complex" pathogens subgingivally.

Diagnostic significance was evaluated by determining serum CEA levels in neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. The upper levels of serum CEA in healthy control was 10 μ/m?, and the incidence of cases which showed an abnormal increase of the level was 66 % for patients with colo-rectal cancer, 40 % for gastric cancer and 47 to 69 % for cancers of the pancreas, liver and the lung. In a few patients with atrophic gastritis and miscellaneous liver diseases, slightly elevated values were observed. In gastric cancer cases significantly higher levels of serum CEA were found in stage III and IV classified by criteria setforth by the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer, and in addition, a remarkable increase of the levels up to 89 % of the cases was noted in patients with liver metastasis and in the majority of these cases values exceeding 50 μ/m? were seen.

40|$|WHO(世界保健機構) は 1996 年度の全世界におけるHIV感染症の累計総数を 2, 940 万人,AIDS患者 840 万人と報告している. また,CDC(疾病管理予防センター) の報告(1996 年 12 月 30 日) によると,米国内ではHIV感染者 58 万人,AIDS患者 22 万人が報告されており,このような現状の中でCDCを中心とした米国州単位のHIV/AIDSサーベイランスシステムが確立されいる. しかしながら,HIV/AIDSサーベイランスは複雑な過程と多面性が交錯し,対象についても病院の臨床検査室,外来診療,死体安置所,さらには囚人までを含む先進的コンピューターシステムが要求される. その典型例として,ルイジアナ州ニューオリンズ市では公衆衛生局の疫学者を中心にチューレーン大学医療センターとルイジアナ州立大学医学部のACTU(AIDS臨床研究グループ) の指導の下,基幹病院であるチャリティ病院内でCDCのHARSデーターべース,ASDスタディによるAIDSサーベイランスが展開されており,医療先進国である米国のコンピューターシステムによるHIV/AIDSサーベイランスを公衆衛生学的見地から報告する. CDCのHARSシステムは米国 50 州および 6 大主要都市において多目的サーベイランスとして公的,私的,政府機関を問わず,HIV/AIDS患者の総数をモニターすることを目的としており,その内容は地域,人種,感染危険度,年齢,性別等,多岐に渡り報告される. ASDスタディは指定機関で治療を受けた外来・入院HIV患者の多種多様の免疫状態を反映している. これらより,サーベイランスプログラムはその地域におけるHIV感染進展度をモニターするものでなければならず,効果的なサーベイランスプログラムとはモニタリングとともに時代の変化を認識するものであり,ルイジアナ州ニューオリンズ市の公衆衛生局のHIV/AIDSサーベイランスは,社会環境変化に対応した情報伝達の意義と分析能力を求められ確立されたといえる. In the United States, 581, 429 {{cases of}} AIDS had been {{reported}} to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of December 30, 1996. A recent study estimated that 223, 000 people in the United States were living with AIDS. HIV/AIDS surveillance is a multifaceted, complex process that involves many parts, people, and advancing computers systems. The HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program {{in the state of}} Louisiana is headquartered at the Louisiana Office of Public Health in New Orleans. All information is recorded on a form provided by the CDC and data are entered into the HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS) database and observing data analysis from the Adult Spectrum <b>of</b> Disease (ASD) <b>study.</b> HARS databese: It is a multipurpose surveillance system designed to monitor the total number of reported cases from public, private, and government reporting facilities. Case reports are received from providers who voluntarily complete the CDC form and who report to the local surveillance program by phone with a surveillance representative completing the case report form. ASD study: ASD project are to enumerate and characterize persons with HIV infection at various stages <b>of</b> <b>immunologic</b> <b>function</b> who received medical care at selected inpatient and outpatient facilities. This information is forwarded to the CDC and is used in data analysis with information from other states to form conclusion about the epidemic in the United States as a whole. The Louisiana data is also analyzed for the state 2 ̆ 7 s funding and disease strategies. Surveillance program should be carried out in order to monitor the extent of HIV infection and disease in given region and community. Effective surveillance programs require careful monitoring and evaluation to understand changing social circumstances. With many epidemiologists taking experience and institutional strengthening, surveillance program at the Louisiana Office of Public Health in New Orleans is more accurate and very modern program. HIV/AIDS surveillance need careful adaptation of existing methods and the development of new approaches and of new ways of analyzing and making sense of the information...|$|R
40|$|NZB X NZW F 1 hybrid (NZB X W) 1 mice {{are highly}} {{susceptible}} to an autoimmune disease that resembles human {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE), and they die {{at an early age}} of the consequent immune complex (IC) glomerulonephritis (1). However, restricting their intake of calories delays the onset of disease and markedly prolongs their life spans (2 - 4). This beneficial effect is associated with alteration <b>of</b> host <b>immunologic</b> <b>function</b> and decreased deposition of IC in their kidneys (4, 5). Because SLE-prone mice have high concentrations of the retroviral envelope glycoprotein, gpT 0, in their sera and deposited in their diseased glomeruli (6 - 9), endogenous retroviruses and/or their gene products have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease (6, 10, 11). Apparently, only SLE-prone strains of mice spontaneously develop immune responses to their own serum retroviral gp 70 and form antibodies, which subsequently become part of the IC found in their sera and tissues (12, 13). The fact that the appearance of gp 70 -anti-gp 70 IC (gp 70 IC) in serum closely parallels the onset of disease in each SLE-prone mouse (12, 14 - 16) underscores the pathogenic significance of gp 70 IC. Therefore, in the present study...|$|R

Ia antigens {{appear to be the}} molecules determining genetic control of immune responsiveness, at least in part by determining the way in which macrophages "present " antigen to T cells (3).

40|$|The {{treatment}} of healthy donors with {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} (G-CSF) and dexamethasone results in sufficient numbers of circulating granulocytes to prepare granulocyte concentrates for clinical purposes. Granulocytes obtained in this way demonstrate relatively normal functional behavior combined with a prolonged life span. To <b>study</b> the influence <b>of</b> mobilizing agents on granulocytes, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify genes that are differentially expressed in mobilized granulocytes compared with control granulocytes. More than 1000 genes displayed a differential expression pattern, {{with at least a}} 3 -fold difference. Among these, a large number of genes was induced that encode proteins involved in inflammation and the immune response, such as C-type lectins and leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors. Because mobilized granulocytes have a prolonged life span, we focused on genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis. One of the most prominent among these was CAST, the gene encoding calpastatin. Calpastatins are the endogenous inhibitors of calpains, a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases recently shown to be involved in neutrophil apoptosis. Transcriptional activity of the CAST gene was induced by G-CSF/dexamethasone treatment both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the protein expression of CAST was stabilized during culture. These studies provide new insight in the genotypic changes {{as well as in the}} regulation <b>of</b> the <b>immunologic</b> <b>functions</b> and viability <b>of</b> mobilized granulocytes used for clinical transfusion purpose...|$|R
40|$|Few {{population-based}} <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> infantile spasms {{have been}} done, and most reports have not included comparison groups. In {{spite of these}} limitations, this review attempts to summarize {{what is known about}} the distribution, etiology, and natural history of infantile spasms in populations; discusses the limitations of current data; and includes suggestions for further population-based research. Most estimates of the incidence of infantile spasms are between 0. 25 and 0. 42 per 1000 live births per year. Among children less than 10 years of age, the annual prevalence of infantile spasms is 0. 14 to 0. 19 per 1000. The peak age at onset of spasms is 4 to 6 months, and {{there appears to be a}} slight excess of male cases. The etiology of infantile spasms is unknown for 40 % to 50 % of affected children. Selected syndromes (eg, Aicardi syndrome, Down syndrome, etc) and inherited disorders (eg, tuberous sclerosis) may account for as many as one third of cases. Other factors, such as intrauterine infection, "birth injury, " and head trauma have not been systematically evaluated, and thus, their contribution to the etiology of infantile spasms is uncertain. Areas for future etiologic research include con-trolled <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunologic</b> factors and in utero and postnatal infections and further exploration of the interrelation-ship between infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

40|$|A major {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} the immunodeficiency associated with bone marrow transplantation states that thymic epithelial damage due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) abrogates or delays the recovery <b>of</b> normal <b>immunologic</b> <b>function.</b> This <b>study</b> evaluated the thymus glands of 36 human bone marrow transplant recipients dying between 4 and 1742 days after transplant using histology, histochemistry, and immunohistology. The observations lead to a model of thymic damage by irradiation, chemotherapy, and GVHD in which early injury by {{all three of these}} agents results in profound thymic atrophy followed by long-delayed restitution. Patients undergoing total body irradiation showed more severe damage to thymic cortical and medullary epithelium than did patients undergoing chemotherapy alone as preparation for transplantation. Patients with GVHD showed additional damage in the form of individual thymic epithelial cell death and showed HLA-DR surface protein expression on thymic epithelium during GVHD. Longer-term survivors showed a profoundly delayed restitution of normal thymic epithelium and delayed evidence of restored lymphopoiesis. A few patients dying late after transplant showed evidence of reconstitution of normal thymic structure or nodules of lymphopoiesis in focal areas of epithelial-cell reconstitution. Evidence of such lymphopoiesis was seen at times ranging between 90 and 1742 days after grafting. The data are consistent with a model of long-standing thymic damage caused by GVHD which is reversible after the development of tolerance...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to further characterize the interaction ofmonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors with different targets, and to assess their ability to influence TNF effects on U 937 and human endothelial cell (HEC) functions. Actions of recombinant TNF-a on U 937 and HEC were effectively inhibited by Htr- 5 and Utr- 1, and {{to a greater extent}} by a combination ofboth mAbs. These observations indicate that TNF interaction with antigenically different components of membrane receptors (p 55 and p 75) represents a crucial step in transduction of signals for TNF toxicity against U 937 and TNF activation of HEC functions. TNF-a, also called cachectin, is a protein produced mainly by macrophages (1).
