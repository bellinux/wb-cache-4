5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, as <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> preserved alveoli.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the overall}} {{geomagnetic}} field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration {{corresponds to a}} 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated {{in the past several}} years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.|$|E

5|$|During {{the closing}} credits, it is {{indicated}} that the bank is successfully continuing with its operations despite the death of its Chairman—as Skarssen had predicted to Salinger before he was killed.

5|$|However, pay {{would have}} been much more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The top of the pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Taylor/Fillmore ticket won narrowly, with New York's {{electoral votes}} again {{key to the}} election. The Whig ticket won the popular vote by 1,361,393 (47.3 percent) to 1,223,460 (42.5 percent), and triumphed 163 to 127 in the Electoral College. Minor party {{candidates}} took no electoral votes, but {{the strength of the}} burgeoning anti-slavery movement was <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> vote for Van Buren, who though he won no states earned 291,501 votes (10.1 percent) and finished second in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{the year}} nor {{the date of}} Stigand's birth is known. He was born in East Anglia, {{possibly}} in Norwich, to an apparently prosperous family of mixed English and Scandinavian ancestry, as is <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Stigand's name was Norse but his brother's was English. His brother Æthelmær, also a cleric, later succeeded Stigand as bishop of Elmham. His sister held land in Norwich, but her given name is unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve {{traces of the}} reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments used in the eggs of many modern birds. The eggs were most likely an intense blue-green color, as <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> predominance of biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, as <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists {{over the years to}} form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
