In this paper 70 cores have selected from 4 wells in the first period of Qingshankou (q 1), Songliao Basin, then get the experimental TOC value after core analysis.

30|$|The {{first step}} in the geochemical study of {{petroleum}} systems in an area is to characterize the quantity, quality, and maturity <b>of</b> the <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> The most widely used method to identify the generation potential <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> is Rock–Eval pyrolysis (Espitalié et al. 1977). After some treatment to remove synthetic contamination such as mica, iron junk, nut shell, and drilling mud additives, samples were ground and homogenized.|$|R
50|$|The {{petroleum}} exploration {{discovered a}} system <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> in the North Falkland Basin capable of generating more than 102 kg of hydrocarbons per tonne of rock. Although a great {{portion of the}} thickness <b>of</b> the <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> is geologically immature, {{it is capable of}} generating hydrocarbons below 2,000 metres. The rock generating the largest quantity of hydrocarbons is located at a depth of nearly 3,000 metres. The calculations of the volume of rock that lies just inside the bordering fringe of the petroleum deposit ranges from 36 billion cubic metres to 400 billion cubic metres, depending on the interpretation of the seismic survey data. In general, it is believed that the basin could have generated up to 60 billion barrels of petroleum.The petroleum exploration discovered that under the principal interval <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> is a layer of sandstone approximately 100 metres thick with porosities reaching 30%. Up to now, very few sandstones with good reserve properties have been found in the succession of rifts below the interval <b>of</b> principal <b>source</b> <b>rock,</b> but very few wells have penetrated into this zone.|$|R
50|$|If the {{likelihood}} of there being a <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> {{is thought to be}} high, the next matter to address is the state of thermal maturity of the source, and the timing of maturation.

In order to determine {{the likelihood}} of oil/gas generation, therefore, the thermal history <b>of</b> the <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> must be calculated.

30|$|Despite the {{significant}} hydrocarbon accumulation in the Middle Cretaceous–Early Miocene petroleum system within the Persian Gulf, {{little is known}} about the quality and maturity <b>of</b> the potential <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> this petroleum system in this area.

Also, 1 D basin modeling, a very useful tool in exploration-related studies, was applied to investigate the thermal maturity evolution and timing of hydrocarbon generation <b>of</b> these <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> candidates in the study area. The integration of the results <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> characterization and basin modeling provides more detailed information to answer exploration questions.

50|$|An {{economically}} significant {{consequence of}} oceanic anoxic events {{is the fact}} that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's petroleum and natural gas reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation <b>of</b> potential petroleum <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent <b>of</b> oil <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> on anything other than a local scale.|$|R

30|$|TOC {{values of}} all the {{residual}} “oil-based drilling mud” samples analyzed were greater than 20 %, with a range from 21.4 to 63.3 % (average[*]±[*]standard deviation[*]=[*] 34.6 % ± 8.6) (Table  1). However, the TOC values of the cleaned rock cuttings were all less than 2 %, with a range from 0.4 to 1.5 % (average[*]±[*]standard deviation[*]=[*] 0.8 % ± 0.3) (Table  1). Consequently, removal of contaminants is an essential task for interpretation <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rock</b> properties using the rock-cutting samples. Previous work has shown that asphalt additives have TOC contents of approximately 35  wt% (Wenger et al. 2004).

30|$|The {{tight oil}} {{reservoirs}} in China are continental deposition, {{and there are}} many types <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> the properties and pressure coefficient are quite different from marine deposit tight oil in North America, thus the successful exploration of North America tight oil cannot fully replicate.|$|R
30|$|The {{theory of}} “source rock control” {{has evolved from}} source-rock-control {{hydrocarbon}} accumulation, to effective source-rock-control hydrocarbon accumulation, and to high-quality source-rock-control hydrocarbon accumulation. However, there are problems, such as whether high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> exist or not? What high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> are, and how to identify them, are yet to be agreed upon. Aimed at this issue of concern to explorationists, and taking the Beier Sag in the Hailaer Basin as an example, this paper defines the high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and the lower limit for evaluation <b>of</b> high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> by using the inflection point on the relationship curve of hydrocarbon (oil) expulsion, which is calculated by the material balance principle, versus total organic carbon (TOC). The results show that when TOC is low, all <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> have limited hydrocarbon expulsion and slow growth rate, thus they cannot be high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> However, when TOC rises to some threshold, hydrocarbon expulsion increases significantly with TOC. This inflection point should be the lower limit <b>of</b> high-quality <b>source</b> rocks: those with TOC greater than the inflection-point value are high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> In addition, the lower limit <b>of</b> high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> is also related to the type and maturity of organic matters in the <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{as well as the}} mineral components <b>of</b> the <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> affecting the residual hydrocarbons. Theoretically, the lower limit <b>of</b> high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> depends on geological conditions rather than being a constant value. However, for the sake of simplicity and practicability, in this paper TOC= 2.0 % is regarded as the lower limit <b>of</b> high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks.</b> The examination <b>of</b> such standard in the work area indicates that the high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in members K 1 n 2 and K 1 n 1 of the Nantun formation contribute 76 % and 82 % to oil generation, and 96 % and 91 % to oil expulsion, respectively. The distribution <b>of</b> high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> is also closely related to the distribution of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the region, demonstrating that high-quality <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> control hydrocarbon accumulation.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Oligocene Yacheng Fm {{contains}} {{the most important}} <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> that have been confirmed by exploratory wells in the Qiongdongnan Basin. The efficiency <b>of</b> these <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> {{is the key to}} the breakthrough in natural gas exploration in the study area. This paper analyzes the hydrocarbon potential of each sag in this basin from the perspective of control <b>of</b> both <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and geothermal heat. Two types <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> occur in the Yacheng Fm, namely mudstone of transitional facies and mudstone of neritic facies. Both of them are dominated by a kerogen of type-III, followed by type-II. Their organic matter abundances are controlled by the amount of continental clastic input. The mudstone of transitional facies is commonly higher in organic matter abundance, while that of neritic facies is lower. The coal-measure <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>of</b> transitional facies were mainly formed in such environments as delta plains, coastal plains and barrier tidal flat-marshes. Due to the control of Cenozoic lithosphere extension and influence of neotectonism, the geothermal gradient, terrestrial heat flow value (HFV) and level of thermal evolution are generally high in deep water. The hot setting not only determines the predominance of gas generation in the deep-water sags, but can promote the shallow-buried <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> in shallow water into oil window to generate oil. In addition to promoting the hydrocarbon generation <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> the high geothermal and high heat flow value can also speed up the cracking of residual hydrocarbons, thus enhancing hydrocarbon generation efficiency and capacity. According to the theory of joint control <b>of</b> <b>source</b> quality and geothermal heat on hydrocarbon generation, we comprehensively evaluate and rank the exploration potentials of major sags in the Qiongdongnan Basin. These sags are divided into 3 types, of which type-I sags including Yanan, Lingshui, Baodao, Ledong and Huaguang are the highest in hydrocarbon exploration potential...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{although}} hydrocarbon enrichment is favored by better conditions <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rocks,</b> reservoirs, seals, and other necessary elements, it is virtually impossible for all these factors to concurrently achieve their respective best conditions. In nature, the sufficient development of any one of the above factors is commonly {{at the expense of other}} conditions. For instance, assuming that the condition of hydrocarbon generation in a given region is adequately developed (i.e., the thickness <b>of</b> <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> and the abundance of organic matter attain their maximum), the reservoir condition therein is commonly less developed. In contrast, if the reservoir quality is excellent (large reservoir thickness and excellent rock properties), then the hydrocarbon-generating and sealing conditions may be relatively inferior. As a result, the most favorable conditions for the enrichment of tight oil/gas exist where an optimal association <b>of</b> <b>source,</b> reservoir, sealing, and all other necessary conditions is realized.

According to the lithologic combination, the Xiagou Formation was divided into four members: the Zeroth (K 1 g 0), First (K 1 g 1), Second (K 1 g 2), and Third (K 1 g 3), from oldest to youngest. The Xiagou Formation mainly consists of shale, dolomitic shale, dolomitic sandstone, and sandstone. The shale and dolomitic shale as <b>source</b> <b>rocks</b> generally contain laminas and microfractures as well as minor stylolites (Cheng et al. 2007; Ma et al. 2007).
