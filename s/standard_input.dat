25|$|Research {{in future}} input systems hold {{a great deal}} of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as brain–computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller proved that naïve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found that subjects were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become <b>standard</b> <b>input</b> modalities in future virtual simulation systems.|$|E

From these standards {{and the number of}} cases passing through a hospital, total <b>standard</b> <b>inputs</b> can be determined. Division of the <b>standard</b> <b>inputs</b> by the actual inputs provides productivity figures for each kind of <b>input.</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>inputs</b> per class of cases are calculated, through a chain of matrices, from <b>standard</b> <b>inputs</b> per elementary operation. Classification of cases into diagnostic categories, and the validity of assuming a typical average set of treatments for each class, are discussed. A numerical example is presented which demonstrates the proposed approach for calculating manpower productivity in a maternity ward. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} global {{fit to the}} CKM {{unitarity}} triangle using the latest experimental and theo-retical constraints. We present results for three different sets of constraints: the <b>standard</b> <b>inputs</b> used by CKMfitter [1] and UTFit [2], the <b>standard</b> <b>inputs</b> minus |Vub|, and the <b>standard</b> <b>inputs</b> minus both |Vub | and |Vcb | [3]. For the required nonperturbative weak matrix elements, we use three-flavor lattice QCD averages from www. latticeaverages. org; these have been up-dated from Ref. [4] to reflect all available lattice calculations as of the “End of 2010 ". Given current theoretical and experimental inputs, we observe an approximately 3 σ tension in the CKM unitarity triangle that {{can be interpreted as}} sign of physics beyond the standard model in the flavor sector. Using a model-independent parameterization of new physics effects, we test the compatibility of new physics in kaon mixing, in B-mixing, or in B → τν decay with the current data. Although the tension could be accommodated with each hypothesis, the scenarios with new physics in B-mixing or, to a lesser extent, in B → τν decay are strongly preferred. Finally, we interpret these results in terms contributions to ∆S = 2 and ∆B = 2 four-fermion operators. We find that the preferred scale of new physics (with Standard Model like couplings) is in the few hundred GeV range...|$|R

The R6RS standard specifies much more sophisticated and capable port procedures and many new types of port.|$|E

We also discuss how to derive a classical language from a given quantum language and as a result we introduce new QCMA and QMA languages. ...|$|R
