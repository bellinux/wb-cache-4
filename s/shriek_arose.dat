60|$|A {{tremendous}} <b>shriek</b> <b>arose</b> {{from the}} women on the bank at this juncture.|$|E
60|$|Shriek after <b>shriek</b> <b>arose</b> {{on the air}} {{and several}} of the boys and girls fled from the scene.|$|E
6000|$|A {{universal}} <b>shriek</b> <b>arose</b> as the russet boots waved wildly {{from the}} wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, [...] "I told you so! I told you so!" [...] With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...|$|E
60|$|<b>Shrieks</b> <b>arose</b> {{from the}} children, {{especially}} Bab and Betty, basely bereaved {{of their new}} dinner-pail; {{but no one could}} follow the thief, for the bell rang, and in they went, so much excited that the boys rushed tumultuously forth to discover the cause. By the time school was over the sun was out, and Bab and Betty hastened home to tell their wrongs and be comforted by mother, who did it most effectually.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{situation}} {{as we see}} it demands immediate reparation on our part. The principal grievance of the <b>Shriek</b> <b>arises</b> from the existence of our fort and garrison on the Kowfat river. Our proper policy is to knock down the fort, and either remove the garrison or give it to the Shriek. We are convinced that as soon as the Shriek realises that we are prepared to treat him in the proper Christian spirit, he will at once respond with true Mohammedan generosity.|$|R
6000|$|Louis talked vigorously of Virginia and Louisa--secretly marvelling how his hosts {{had brought}} {{themselves}} down to such fare. Isabel was dining without apparently seeing anything amiss, and James attempted {{nothing but a}} despairing toss of his chin, as he pronounced the carrots underdone. After the first course {{there was a long}} interval, during which Isabel and Louis composedly talked about the public meeting which he had been attending, and James fidgetted in the nervousness of hardly-restrained displeasure; but suddenly a frightful <b>shrieking</b> <b>arose,</b> and he indignantly cried, 'That girl!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The shores! the shores!" [...] exclaimed the {{carpenter}} from within. [...] "The shores!" [...] repeated Spike, throwing himself {{back into the}} boat, and shouting to his men to [...] "see all clear of the wreck!" [...] The grating {{of one of the}} shores on the coral beneath was now heard plainer than ever, and the lower extremity slipped outward, not astern, as had been apprehended, letting the wreck slowly settle to the bottom again. One piercing <b>shriek</b> <b>arose</b> from the narrow cavity within; then the gurgling of water into the aperture was heard, when naught of sound could be distinguished but the sullen and steady wash of the waves of the gulf over the rocks of the reef.|$|E
6000|$|... "The boat {{running to}} Coney Island had slowed up to a walk, which caused Cicero to grow impatient, {{as he wanted}} {{a ride on the}} shoot-the-chutes. Henry Clay, along with Napoleon and a Roman sausage-maker named Hannibal, were in the bow of the craft trying to solve the fifteen puzzle by the aid of a compass and a book on etiquette. Suddenly a great commotion arose to a height of a mile or more. The boat sank {{to the bottom of the}} sea, turned over three times, and came to the surface again. A <b>shriek</b> <b>arose</b> from one of the ladies, Cleopatra's waiting-maid: 'I have lost my {{knitting}} overboard.' 'Man the pumps!' cried Cicero, and then tied his sandals around his neck for a life-preserver. Henry Clay drew a Henry Clay from his pocket and began to smoke vigorously. Hannibal said he would turn cannibal if the boat went down again. Cleopatra said she would die happy if only they would start up the phonograph, and Homer did so, with that beautiful ode entitled, 'Why Eat Turkey When Corned Beef Is So Cheap?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{when the}} morning of a tournament, [...] By these in earnest those in mockery called [...] The Tournament of the Dead Innocence, [...] Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot, [...] Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey, [...] The words of Arthur flying <b>shrieked,</b> <b>arose,</b> [...] And down a streetway hung with folds of pure [...] White samite, and by fountains running wine, [...] Where {{children}} sat in white with cups of gold, [...] Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps [...] Ascending, filled his double-dragoned chair.|$|R
50|$|In Edo period Japan, Murasame Castle {{houses a}} {{gigantic}} stone statue known as Murasame. The people lived peacefully until one stormy night, when a shining golden object {{fell onto the}} castle from the sky. Deafening <b>shrieks</b> <b>arose</b> from the castle, and the shining object is later revealed to be an alien creature who gives life to the stone statue Murasame and takes over the castle. The alien creature extends its power to four other neighboring castles, giving the daimyo lords each an evil sphere of power. The lords are {{taken over by the}} alien's evil power, and use the spheres to summon ninja armies and monsters to attack villagers. Hearing of these strange occurrences, the shogunate led by Tokugawa Ietsuna sends Takamaru, a samurai apprentice, on a secret mission to investigate the castle. As Takamaru, the player must infiltrate the four castles to defeat each castle lord, before going on to face the alien entity itself.|$|R
60|$|Here he {{lay down}} to rest a few moments. During the brief period of his stay he saw several of his {{captured}} friends have their hands and feet chopped off by the marauders, while a terrible <b>shriek</b> that <b>arose</b> once or twice told him all too plainly that on {{a few of them}} had been perpetrated the not uncommon cruelty of putting out the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>shrieking,</b> she <b>arose,</b> and <b>shrieking</b> fell, [...] With joy and sorrow, {{hope and}} fear, to see [...] Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell [...] The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be [...] Perchance {{the death of}} one she loved too well: [...] Dear as her father had been to Haidee, [...] It was a moment of that awful kind-- [...] I have seen such--but must not call to mind.|$|R
60|$|The sailor, in the meantime, {{was both}} rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, {{as it could}} {{scarcely}} escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived {{as high as the}} window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those hideous <b>shrieks</b> <b>arose</b> upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled {{into the middle of the}} room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.|$|R
6000|$|Certainly the {{spectacle}} of these exotically plumed bipeds, whose fine feathers were already bedrabbled by sand and growing limp in the sea breeze, was somewhat dissonant with the rudeness of sea and sky and shore. A few gulls screamed at them; a loon, startled from the lagoon, <b>arose</b> <b>shrieking</b> and protesting, with painfully extended legs, in obvious burlesque of the younger gentleman. The elder lady felt the justice of her gentle daughter's criticism, and retaliated with simple directness:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|A short pause {{of intense}} suspense, and then Nat, Demi, and Tommy marched forth, each bearing a new kite, which they {{presented}} to the three young ladies. <b>Shrieks</b> of delight <b>arose,</b> but were silenced by the boys, who said, with faces brimful of merriment, [...] "That isn't all the surprise;" [...] and, running behind the rock, again emerged bearing a fourth kite of superb size, on which was printed, in bright yellow letters, [...] "For Mother Bhaer." ...|$|R
60|$|Shrill {{and terrible}} though the Indian war-cry is proverbially known to be, it was excelled in appalling wildness by the <b>shriek</b> which <b>arose</b> from the Esquimaux, as they hurried tumultuously into their canoes and put off to sea. These poor creatures were {{naturally}} brave--much more so, indeed, than their assailants; but the murderous {{effects of the}} terrible gun caused the sternest brow among them to blanch and the stoutest heart to quail. The arrow and the spear, however rapid, could be avoided, if observed in time; but this dreaded implement of destruction was so mysterious to them, and its death-dealing bullet so quick, and the smoke, the fire, and the loud report so awful, that they shuddered even when they thought of it. No wonder, then, that they uttered a despairing cry when it actually sounded in their ears.|$|R

60|$|A fierce yell from twenty throats {{rose in the}} air, {{and there}} was a rush towards the door, while two or three shots were fired at the window. Mr. Atherton had, however, stepped back the instant he had {{discharged}} his rifle, and now, leaning out, discharged the chambers of his revolver in quick succession among the natives gathered round the door. <b>Shrieks</b> and yells <b>arose</b> from them, and they bounded away into the darkness, and again several musket-shots were fired at the window. By this time the settler and Wilfrid had both joined Mr. Atherton, having leapt from their beds, seized their arms, and ran out when the first shot was fired.|$|R
60|$|At last he evidently {{decided that}} there was no danger lurking about. He was {{returning}} from the head of the run-way, from where he had taken a peep down at the drinking-place. His course brought him near, but still he did not notice me. He proceeded casually on his way until abreast of me, and then, without warning and with incredible swiftness, he smote me a buffet on the head. I was knocked backward fully a dozen feet before I fetched up against the ground, and I remember, half-stunned, even as the blow was struck, hearing the wild uproar of clucking and <b>shrieking</b> laughter that <b>arose</b> from the caves. It was a great joke--at least in that day; and right heartily the Folk appreciated it.|$|R
60|$|This expostulation implied a reproach on Mr Kettledrummle, who, {{though an}} {{absolute}} Boanerges, or son of thunder, in the pulpit, when the enemy were afar, and indeed sufficiently contumacious, {{as we have}} seen, when in their power, had been struck dumb by the firing, shouts, and <b>shrieks,</b> which now <b>arose</b> from the valley, and--as many an honest man might have been, {{in a situation where}} he could neither fight nor fly--was too much dismayed to take so favourable an opportunity to preach the terrors of presbytery, as the courageous Mause had expected at his hand, or even to pray for the successful event of the battle. His presence of mind was not, however, entirely lost, any more than his jealous respect for his reputation as a pure and powerful preacher of the word.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} instant a chorus of <b>shrieks</b> and howls <b>arose</b> from the circle of spectators, so {{that for a moment}} I thought that the {{upsetting}} of their champion was the cause; but in this I soon saw that I was mistaken. As I looked, the ape-things broke in all directions toward the surrounding hills, and then I distinguished the real cause of their perturbation. Behind them, streaming through the pass which leads into the valley, came a swarm of hairy men--gorilla-like creatures armed with spears and hatchets, and bearing long, oval shields. Like demons they set upon the ape-things, and before them the hyaenodon, which had now regained its senses and its feet, fled howling with fright. Past us swept the pursued and the pursuers, nor did the hairy ones accord us more than a passing glance until the arena had been emptied of its former occupants. Then they returned to us, and one who seemed to have authority among them directed that we be brought with them.|$|R
60|$|I was {{too much}} {{interested}} at this moment to feel the concern that I might otherwise have experienced. On the forecastle, it appeared to us all {{that we should be}} boarded in a minute, for one of the proas was actually within a hundred feet, though losing her advantage a little by getting under the lee of our sails. Kite had ordered us to muster forward of the rigging, to meet the expected leap with a discharge of muskets, and then to present our pikes, when I felt an arm thrown around my body, and was turned in-board, while another person assumed my place. This was Neb, who had thus coolly thrust himself before me, {{in order to meet the}} danger first. I felt vexed, even while touched with the fellow's attachment and self-devotion, but had no time to betray either feeling before the crews of the proas gave a yell, and discharged some fifty or sixty matchlocks at us. The air was full of bullets, but they all went over our heads. Not a soul on board the John was hurt. On our side, we gave the gentlemen the four sixes, two at the nearest and two at the sternmost proa, which was still near a cable's length distant. As often happens, the one seemingly farthest from danger, fared the worst. Our grape and canister had room to scatter, and I can at this distant day still hear the <b>shrieks</b> that <b>arose</b> from that craft! They were like the yells of fiends in anguish. The effect on that proa was instantaneous; instead of keeping on after her consort, she wore short round on her heel, and stood away in our wake, on the other tack, apparently to get out of the range of our fire.|$|R
60|$|In such a scene {{none had}} leisure {{to note the}} {{fleeting}} moments. It might have been ten minutes (it seemed an age), that the sisters had stood riveted to one spot, horror-stricken, and nearly helpless. When the first blow was struck, their screaming companions had pressed upon them in a body, rendering flight impossible; and now that fear or death had scattered most, if not all, from around them, they saw no avenue open, but such as conducted to the tomahawks of their foes. On every side <b>arose</b> <b>shrieks,</b> groans, exhortations, and curses. At this moment Alice {{caught a glimpse of}} the vast form of her father, moving rapidly across the plain, in the direction of the French army. He was, in truth, proceeding to Montcalm, fearless of every danger, to claim the tardy escort for which he had before conditioned. Fifty glittering axes and barbed spears were offered unheeded at his life, but the savages respected his rank and calmness, even in their fury. The dangerous weapons were brushed aside by the still nervous arm of the veteran, or fell of themselves, after menacing an act that it would seem no one had courage to perform. Fortunately, the vindictive Magua was searching for his victim in the very band the veteran had just quitted.|$|R
