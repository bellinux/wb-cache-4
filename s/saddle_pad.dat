2500|$|An English-style saddle is {{required}} for riding dressage, specifically a [...] "dressage saddle" [...] which is modeled exclusively for the discipline. It is designed with a long and straight saddle flap, mirroring the leg of the dressage rider, which is long with a slight bend in the knee, a deep seat and usually a pronounced knee block. Dressage saddles have longer billets and use shorter girth than other types of English saddles to minimize the straps and buckles underneath the rider's legs. The saddle is usually placed over a square, white <b>saddle</b> <b>pad.</b> Colored trim on the white <b>saddle</b> <b>pad</b> is permitted. A dressage saddle {{is required}} in FEI classes, although any simple English-type saddle may be used at the lower levels.|$|E
2500|$|Treeless saddle, {{available}} in both Western and English designs, but not built upon a solid saddle tree, {{intended to be}} flexible and comfortable {{on a variety of}} horses, but also not always able to provide the weight support of a solid tree. The use of an appropriate <b>saddle</b> <b>pad</b> is essential for treeless saddles. (See Controversy section, below) ...|$|E
2500|$|Watching a steeplechase race is {{a rather}} simple undertaking, {{as it is the}} horse that comes over the finish line first that wins. However, before this occurs, several steps must be undergone. [...] First, the horse’s trainer must officially declare that the horse is on grounds for a {{specified}} period before the beginning of its race. [...] Furthermore, the rider must report to the clerk of scales and weigh out with the minimum prescribed weight. If the jockey and his gear do not meet the minimum weight requirement, lead is inserted into the <b>saddle</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E

2500|$|If {{it seems}} the back pain is caused by an ill-fitting saddle, the saddle should be changed or adjusted, though as an interim measure a horse can be ridden without a saddle or with a <b>saddle</b> <b>pad</b> that is either thicker or thinner, as needed to reduce saddle pressure. To avoid causing back pain caused by lack of {{athletic}} fitness, gradually build the horse's athletic agility until it {{is strong enough to}} avoid getting sore in the back. [...] Back pain related to stress or injury may require rest and time without being ridden, with a gradual return to work.|$|E
2500|$|Bareback pad, {{usually a}} simple pad {{in the shape}} of an English-style <b>saddle</b> <b>pad,</b> made of cordura nylon or leather, padded with fleece, wool or {{synthetic}} foam, equipped with a girth. It is used as an alternative to bareback riding to provide padding for both horse and rider and to help keep the rider's clothing a bit cleaner. Depending on materials, bareback pads offer a bit more grip to the rider's seat and legs. [...] However, though some bareback pads come with handles and even stirrups, without being attached to a saddle tree, these appendages are [...] unsafe and pads with them should be avoided. [...] In some cases, the addition of stirrups without a supporting tree place pressure on the horse's spinuous processes, potentially causing damage.|$|E
60|$|Just as I {{was getting}} ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and things on his <b>saddle</b> <b>pad.</b> The screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed {{together}} when the time comes to use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.|$|E

Over the next few years, Balmoral held several races in conjunction with the World Driving Championships hosting drivers from 16 countries. Local driving star Dave Magee won the competition in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Saddle {{blankets}} {{have been}} used for many centuries with all types of saddles. Some are a single thickness, others are made to be folded and used with a double thickness. Although a pad or blanket cannot take the place of a properly fitted <b>saddle,</b> <b>pads</b> with shims or blankets with a special design can partially compensate for minor fitting problems.|$|R
50|$|A {{lightweight}} saddle {{with a high}} {{horn and}} cantle is ideal. Forward strung stirrups also help to keep the rider's feet in proper position. Typically, riders choose a saddle that is up to a full size smaller than {{he or she would}} normally use. Most importantly, it must fit the rider's horse properly. <b>Saddle</b> <b>pads</b> and cinches are chosen based on the horse's size.|$|R
5000|$|For display, a <b>saddle</b> <b>pad</b> may {{be placed}} beneath the saddle; {{historically}} in England a <b>saddle</b> <b>pad,</b> also called [...] "housing" [...] or [...] "saddle cloth", was shaped {{to match the}} contour of the saddle, {{in the manner of}} an English numnah today.|$|E

5000|$|In a horse {{handicap}} race (sometimes called just [...] "handicap"), each horse {{must carry}} a specified weight called the impost, {{assigned by the}} racing secretary or steward based on factors such as past performances, so as to equalize the chances of the competitors. To supplement the combined weight of jockey and saddle, up to the assigned impost, lead weights are carried in <b>saddle</b> <b>pads</b> with pockets, called lead pads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{studies have}} shown that wider saddles tend to {{increase}} penile blood flow while cycling, though wider seats also induce chafing and impede a cyclist’s full range of leg motion. A downward-tilted saddle relieves pressure on the perineum and the [...] "sit bones" [...] (ischial tuberosities), thus improving a cyclist's perineal blood flow. Most <b>saddles</b> include <b>padding,</b> generally foam or gel. Gel padding tends to distribute pressure in the perineum and provide higher levels of penile oxygenation than does foam padding. However, width and design have proved to be more important than the amount of <b>saddle</b> <b>padding</b> in determining the intensity of perineal distress the cyclist suffers. In fact, some researchers have postulated that extra padding, foam or gel, can result in an increased prevalence of pain in the sit bones.|$|R

2500|$|At {{international}} levels, <b>saddle</b> <b>pads</b> {{are usually}} white and square in shape, allowing the pair {{to display a}} sponsorship, national flag, or breeding affiliation. In contrast, riders in show hunters and equitation often use [...] "fitted" [...] fleece pads that are the same shape as the saddle. Girths vary in type, but usually have a contour to give room for the horse's elbows, and many have belly guards to protect {{the underside of the}} horse from its shoe studs when the front legs are tightly folded under.|$|R
50|$|Aporrectodea calignosa (also {{known as}} Allolobophora similis or the grey worm) is an {{earthworm}} {{commonly found in}} Great Britain. It is recognizable by the three distinct shades of colour at its front end, and it is 6 cm in length when not moving. Its <b>saddle</b> <b>pads</b> usually form a two humped ridge across three segments {{along the length of}} the saddle, however this is not clearly visible. The worm mostly lies in non-permanent horizontal burrows in topsoil, and is rarely found in leaf litter. Like most worms, its diet consists only of soil.|$|R

5000|$|The saddle {{is usually}} a type of forward seat (jumping saddle), {{generally}} the style called [...] "close contact," [...] though [...] "eventing" [...] and [...] "all-purpose" [...] designs are seen in some areas, particularly at lower levels. Saddles are usually of brown leather, with a plain girth, usually of leather. The <b>saddle</b> <b>pad</b> should be white, and shaped to fit the saddle. Ideally, {{no more than one}} inch of pad should appear under the saddle.|$|E
50|$|A <b>saddle</b> <b>pad</b> (US) or numnah (UK) is thicker, {{usually with}} layers of felt, foam or other modern {{material}} sandwiched between a tough outer cover on top and a soft cover on the side {{in contact with the}} horse. The best designs absorb shock and minimize fatigue for the horse's back muscles. Saddle pads of various styles or shapes are used with any type of saddle. Sheepskin numnahs that are shaped to fit around a saddle are popular in some disciplines.|$|E
50|$|Ideally {{the pack}} saddle {{rests on a}} saddle blanket or <b>saddle</b> <b>pad</b> to spread {{the weight of the}} saddle and its burden on the pack animal's back. The {{underside}} of the pack saddle is designed to conform well to the shape of the pack animal's back. It is typically divided into two symmetrical parts separated by a gap at the top to ensure that the weight being carried does not rest on the draft animal's backbone and to provide good ventilation to promote the evaporation of sweat.|$|E

They are not permitted to wear boots (including hoof or bell boots) or wraps (including tail bandages) during the test, nor are they allowed to wear martingales or training devices such as draw or running reins or the gogue anywhere on the showgrounds during the competition. Due to the formality of dressage, tack is usually black leather, although dark brown is seen from time to time.|$|R
