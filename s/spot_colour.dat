50|$|In the mid-1990s, Exeposé {{became a}} weekly tabloid newspaper, {{ranging in size}} from 8 to 12 pages, and printed by Express & Echo Publications (which has since gone through several name and {{structural}} changes, its publishing arm now known as Harmsworth Printing). During the late 90s, Exeposé began to increase in size to 16-20 pages on average, some of these pages in <b>spot</b> <b>colour</b> or full colour. Between 2,000 and 2,500 papers were printed for each issue, distributed to drop-off points on Streatham and St. Luke's Campuses.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the system}} depends on {{comparison}} {{rather than an}} evaluation of the <b>spot</b> <b>colour</b> density, and because many successive samples can be taken, it is considered highly reliable.

5000|$|Nicholls {{subsequently}} {{teamed up}} with another artist, Stan Clements, to start the first ever locally produced weekly comic book. Fatty Finn's Weekly was launched on 20 May 1934 as {{a black and white}} eight tabloid pages of comics and text, with a <b>spot</b> <b>colour</b> cover. Fatty Finn made an appearance and Nicholls' also contributed a center spread continuity strip called [...] "Forest of Fear". The rest of the comic featured Australian artists only, with other strips such as Basso the Bear and Pam and Pospsy Penguin by 'Hotpoint' and Ossie by George Little. While there was text below each frame, the panels contained word balloons. The ninth issue is a series of coupons - three of which made the sender a member of [...] "Fatty Finn's Club" [...] (complete with membership certificate and a badge). Nicholls then approached Frank Packer, who took over the publishing of the comic in November 1934. Under the new management the size of the comic increased to sixteen pages, a red tint added to the covers and centrespread, and the price increased from 1d to 2d. [...] Packer also added a US strip, Brick Bradford but did not increase the volume of comic strips instead padding out the additional pages with text. Nicholls disagreed with the direction that the comic book was taking. The comic struggled before folding in early 1935.|$|E

30|$|In the COSCH RRT, each {{institution}} {{was asked to}} follow its own practices and to produce a good quality result. Yet the datasets exhibited {{a wide range of}} image quality attributes. Much has been made in the discussion above about the need for a standardised procedure, {{but the fact is that}} today there exists no such standard. In order to achieve a standard whereby different institutions could achieve consistent results with different optomechanical systems, the imaging geometry, in particular, would have to be closely specified and controlled, analogous to the standards for instrumental <b>spot</b> <b>colour</b> measurement [36].|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{laminating}} processes on spot colours is of great importance in the offset printing process, especially given the application versatility of spot colours. Laminating process, as a very common process {{and one of the}} first in a sequence of finishing processes in graphics production, can affect print’s visual impression to varying degrees. Spot colours, as mixtures of different ratios of inks, are subject to a change due to matt or gloss lamination process. The research examined the impact of thermal lamination processes on printed spot colours on different printing substrates. The degree of change on prints caused by laminating films in the thermal process was determined using spectrophotometric and densitometric methods. Particular emphasis is placed on the <b>spot</b> <b>colour</b> because of its specific characteristics. Research results are shown in charts and they are showing clearly the modality and the extent laminating processes effect the colorimetric difference in laminated and non-laminated prints. This scientific research provides objective conclusions that help in predicting the possible variations within the usage of laminating processes...|$|E
40|$|A First Dictionary of Erre, Mengerrdji, Urningangk. This {{publication}} is {{a bilingual}} dictionary of the Giimbiyu (stone country) languages formerly spoken by the Erre, Mengerrdji and Urningangk {{people of the}} Alligator rivers region of north-western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. As the Giimbyu languages {{are no longer in}} active use today, the dictionary was compiled {{on the basis of a}} few hours of recordings made in the 1960 s by the linguists Joy Kinslow-Harris and Peter Carroll, as well as on a 600 -entry wordlist compiled by Arthur Capell. This publication consists of an introduction which discusses the classification and location of the Giimbiyu languages, gives an insight into the contact history of the region, and summarizes the previous documentation of those languages. It continues with an analysis of the phonological system, and discusses some grammatical features, in particular gender and noun classes, and free pronouns. The dictionary itself presents the three languages in three seperate sections, each followed by a finderlist. The dictionary is accompanied by an Audio CD featuring stories in Erre and Mengerrdji, and an excerpt of an elicitation session in Urningangk. This publication and the research on which it is based were carried out on behalf of the custodians of the cultural language groups Erre, Mengerrdji and Urningangk.

40|$|In packaging, spot colours {{are used}} to print key {{information}} like brand logos and elements for which the colour accuracy is critical. The present study investigates methods to aid the accurate reproduction of these spot colours with the n-colour printing process. Typical n-colour printing systems consist of supplementary inks {{in addition to the}} usual CMYK inks. Adding these inks to the traditional CMYK set increases the attainable colour gamut, but the added complexity creates several challenges in generating suitable colour separations for rendering colour images. In this project, the n-colour separation is achieved by the use of additional sectors for intermediate inks. Each sector contains four inks with the achromatic ink (black) common to all sectors. This allows the extension of the principles of the CMYK printing process to these additional sectors. The methods developed in this study can be generalised to any number of inks. The project explores various aspects of the n-colour printing process including the forward characterisation methods, gamut prediction of the n-colour process and the inverse characterisation to calculate the n-colour separation for target spot colours. The scope of the study covers different printing technologies including lithographic offset, flexographic, thermal sublimation and inkjet printing. A new method is proposed to characterise the printing devices. This method, the <b>spot</b> <b>colour</b> overprint (SCOP) model, was evaluated for the n-colour printing process with different printing technologies. In addition, a set of real-world spot colours were converted to n-colour separations and printed with the 7 -colour printing process to evaluate against the original spot colours. The results show that the proposed methods can be effectively used to replace the spot coloured inks with the n-colour printing process. This can save significant material, time and costs in the packaging industry...|$|E

40|$|Eggshell {{coloration}} in bird clutches shows {{a striking}} variability within species {{which has not}} yet been fully explained. Its character is determined by the deposition of two main pigments: blue-green biliverdin is responsible for the background colour while brown-red protoporphyrin is associated with the dark spot pattern. Considering the role and matabolism of these two pigments in the avian organism it was suggested that they might have an important impact on the oxidative stress levels and their deposition into the eggshell is therefore suggested to possibly reflect the body condition of laying females during the laying periods. This is also the basic assumption for the signalling hypothesis of eggshell coloration which predicts the eggshell appearance to reflect the female body condition and individual health status or directly indicate aenemia in birds (aenemic hypothesis). Here it was tested whether there is a relationship between parameters representing the body condition of female great tits (Parus major) and the characteristics of protoporphyrin maculation of their eggs. Female body condition was expressed by standardized body weight and the selected haematological parameters (heterophil to lymphocyte ratio and relative immature erythrocyte counts). Eggshell coloration was characterized by <b>spot</b> <b>colour</b> (hue, saturation and brightness), spot counts and the reflectance of the background colour. It was found that females with higher heterophil to lymphocyte ratio laid eggs with more spots and higher reflectance of the background colour in some nesting seasons. Eggs with more spots on its surface were also laid by females with higher immature erythrocyte counts. These results suggest that more intensive deposition of protoporfyring into the eggsell can indicate worse body condition of the laying females. On the other hand, it was also found that heavier females laid eggs with lower reflectance of the background colour. Despite this discrepancy, these results are not inconsistent with the pressumptions of the signalling hypothesis and they partially support the aenemia hypothesis. However, the above mentioned dependencies were inconsistent among the nesting seasons, indicating that further important determinants must be considered in the avian eggshell coloration...|$|E
