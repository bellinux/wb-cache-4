40|$|In the {{critical}} state of a beam under central compression a flexural-torsional equilibrium shape becomes possible {{in addition to}} the fundamental straight equilibrium shape and the Euler bending. Particularly, torsional configuration takes place in all cases where the line of <b>shear</b> <b>centres</b> does not correspond with the line of centres of mass. This condition is obtained here about a z-axis highly variable section beam; with the assumptions that <b>shear</b> <b>centres</b> are aligned and line of centres is bound to not deform. For the purpose, let us evaluate an open thin wall C-cross section with flanges width and web height linearly variables along z-axis in order to have <b>shear</b> <b>centres</b> axis approximately aligned with gravity centres axis. Thus, differential equations that govern the problem are obtained. Because of the section variability, the numerical integration of differential equations that gives the true critical load is complex and lengthy.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation of effect of load height on buckling resistance of steel beams. Shapes that {{are intended to}} be used primarily as a beam are generally proportioned so that moment of inertia about the principal axis is considerably larger than that about minor axis. Hence monosymmetric sections are preferable. The lateral stability of beam subjected to transverse loading is very complicated in monosymmetric sections. The distance of transverse load from <b>shear</b> <b>centre</b> axis may significantly affect the buckling resistance of a simply supported beam. When transverse concentrated load W acts at (Yq-Yo) below the <b>shear</b> <b>centre</b> and moves with the beam it acts as an additional torque W(Yq-Yo) about <b>shear</b> <b>centre</b> which opposes twist and increases resistance to buckling. Conversely, when load above <b>shear</b> <b>centre,</b> additional torque increases the twist rotation and reduces buckling resistance of beam. To verify the effect of load height on buckling resistance, a simply supported beam subjected to concentrated and uniformly distributed load is considered. The effect of load height on buckling resistance has been plotted...|$|E

In this paper a general survey of the literature is performed and the two definitions of the <b>shear</b> <b>centre</b> (here named kinematic and energetic) are compared.

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{method for}} predicting {{the degree of}} translational-torsional coupling of mixed-bent type multi-storey building structures subject to dynamic loading is presented. The method uses the parametric approach {{and is based on}} the generalized representation of asymmetric wall-frame structures by shear-flexure, torsion-warping cantilevers. It is applicable to structures consisting of any combinations of walls and frames that are uniform with height. Simple methods for predicting the uncoupled translational-torsional period ratio and the equivalent eccentricity, which require a knowledge of only the preliminary design information, are developed. The actual coupled period ratio can then be estimated in terms of these two quantities. The concepts of <b>shear</b> <b>centres</b> and centres of resistance of mixed-bent type multi-storey building structures are clarified, and the significance of the uncoupled and coupled period ratios in the assessment of the coupling effect is discussed. The derivation of the method and comparisons of results with those obtained by 3 -D finite element dynamic analyses of discrete member models, are given. Numerical examples are worked to illustrate the application of the method. The applicability of the method to non-uniform wall-frame structures having changes in the stiffness through the height is demonstrated; a non-uniform distribution of mass over the floor is also taken into account...|$|R

The linear elastic analysis is valid for thin-walled composite doubly symmetric I-beams made from mid-plane symmetric, fibre-reinforced laminated panels. Here, the test configuration has an I-beam with specially orthotropic panels. It is subjected to three-point bending, and supported at each end such that the only degree of freedom is rotation about the major axis of the beam. For the modelling case where the central load is applied at the <b>shear</b> <b>centre</b> (centroid) of the cross-section there is a favourable comparison between the finite difference results and those results presented by Timoshenko and Gere (1961, Theory of Elastic Stability 2 nd edn, McGraw-Hill, New York), which were originally generated for isotropic beams.

The {{question}} {{of what it means}} to be human is an old one, and of central importance to the social sciences. Our powerful brains and complex cultural and economic lives distinguish us from other animals, yet recent developments in neuroscience are placing new emphasis on the mammalian nature of human brains. This poses challenges for how the social sciences view the question of being human. The first lecture of this course will focus on the implications of recent neuroscience for psychology and for how we understand human behaviour. The lectures that follow will explore how the social sciences have engaged with the issue {{of what it means to}} be human, covering classical understandings as well as recent evidence from the biological and behavioural sciences. The second lecture will discuss the way in which the human has been conceptualised by neoclassical economics as ‘homo-economicus’ and how recent developments in behavioural economics are shifting our understanding. The third lecture will discuss classical political thinking (primarily Locke and Rousseau) and then turn to empirical research on power, authority, hierarchy and obedience among humans and other primates. The fourth lecture will look at the issue of sociality and antisociality by posing the question of how we understand the criminal.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{rheology}} and mineral reactions in a brittle-ductile shear zone within the Wyangala Batholith, SE Australia. In the shear zone, a coarse-grained two feldspar-quartz-biotite granite {{is transformed into a}} fine-grained quartz-muscovite mylonite. The samples from shear zone margins display cataclasis of feldspar and crystal-plastic deformation of quartz. Quartz accommodates most of the deformation and is extensively recrystallized showing distinct crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO). Feldspar-to-muscovite, biotite-to-muscovite and albitization reactions occur locally at fracture and porphyroclast margins. However, the bulk rock composition shows very little change in respect to the wall rock composition. In the <b>shear</b> zone <b>centre,</b> quartz occurs as large, weakly deformed porphyroclasts, in sizes similar to that in the wall rock, suggesting that it has undergone little deformation. Feldspars and biotite are almost completely reacted to muscovite, which is arranged in a fine grained interconnected network. Muscovite has accommodated most of the strain. Muscovite rich layers contain significant amounts of fine grained intermixed quartz with random CPO. XRF bulk rock analysis suggests a significant increase in SiO 2 and depletion in NaO content compared with the wall rock composition. We suggest that the high and low strain fabrics represent markedly different scenarios and cannot be interpreted as a simple sequential development with respect to strain. The large quartz clasts in the central parts of the shear zone have never undergone the structural development displayed by the low strain domain. We interpret that the fabrics in the <b>shear</b> zone <b>centre</b> have formed due to fluid influx probably along an initially brittle fracture where hydration reactions dramatically changed the rheological property of the rock. Subsequent ductile deformation focussed in the newly produced muscovite-quartz layers, thus original quartz grains did not recrystallize. In contrast, in the shear zone margins the amount of fluid and reactions was limited therefore deformation was taken up mainly by the relatively weak original igneous quartz. The studied shear zone exemplifies the role of fluids and fluid-induced reactions on contrasting rheological behaviour at local scales. 1 page(s...|$|R

Thus a general stiffness matrix for the element, and a transformation matrix for loads and displacements with respect to centroid and <b>shear</b> <b>centre</b> were derived, by taking into consideration the value of-bimoment due to an axial force offset from the <b>shear</b> <b>centre.</b> Internal forces including bimoments, and global displacements including warping were calculated, and the stress distributions on the cross-sections of a beam at each-element node, were evaluated. The problem of buckling of thin-walled beams was treated using a finite strip program which was formulated to solve problems with the following combination of stresses: a) Linearly distributed axial stresses b) Uniform lateral stresses c) Uniform shear streses The results for beams of cruciform, box and channel sections, under uniform axial stresses and linearly distributed axial stresses, also accounting for flexural stresses, were conpared with other theoretical and some experimental results. The agreement was satisfactory. A series of, laboratory tests on beams of channel sections under compression were carried out.

The best goodness of the total fitness function will result in a layout design of a footing layout of residential housing.

The latter contains thin lath structures in the boundary regions, fine elongated subgrains in the outer areas and roughly equiaxed (sub) grains with a mean size of 70 nm in the centre region. The early stage of shear localization involves the formation of twin/matrix lamellae aligned along the shear direction. The lamellae subsequently undergo longitudinal splitting into thin laths, which are in turn subjected to transverse breakdown, giving rise to fine elongated subgrains. The continuing thermally assisted lath breakdown, in conjunction with lateral sliding and lattice rotations, ultimately leads {{to the formation of}} roughly equiaxed, nanosized (sub) grains in the macroscopic <b>shear</b> band <b>centre</b> at large strains...|$|R

40|$|The LiteSteel beam (LSB) is a cold-formed high {{strength}} steel channel section made of two torsionally rigid closed flanges and a slender web. Due to its mono-symmetric characteristics, its centroid and <b>shear</b> <b>centre</b> do not coincide. The LSBs {{can be used in}} floor systems as joists or bearers and in these applications they are often subjected to transverse loads that are applied away from the <b>shear</b> <b>centre.</b> Hence they are often subjected to combined bending and torsion actions. Previous researches on LSBs have concentrated on their bending or shear behaviour and strengths, and only limited research has been undertaken on their combined bending and torsion behaviour. Therefore in this research a series of nine experiments was first conducted on LSBs subject to combined bending and torsion. Three LSB sections were tested to failure under eccentric loading at mid-span, and appropriate results were obtained from seven tests. A special test rig was used to simulate two different eccentricities and to provide accurate simple boundary conditions at the supports. Finite element models of tested LSBs were developed using ANSYS, and the ultimate strengths, failure modes, and load–displacement curves were obtained and compared with corresponding test results. Finite element analyses agreed well with test results and hence the developed models were used in a parametric study to investigate the effects of load locations, eccentricities, and spans on the combined bending and torsion behaviour of LSBs. The interaction between the ultimate bending and torsional moment capacities was studied and a simple design rule was proposed.

In the studied shear zone (Wyangala, SE Australia), a coarse-grained two-feldspar–quartz–biotite granite {{is transformed into}} a medium-grained orthogneiss at the shear zone margins and a fine-grained quartz–muscovite phyllonite in the central parts. The orthogneiss displays cataclasis of feldspar and crystal-plastic deformation of quartz. Quartz accommodates most of the deformation and is extensively recrystallized, showing distinct crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Feldspar-to-muscovite, biotite-to-muscovite and albitization reactions occur locally at porphyroclasts' fracture surfaces and margins. However, the bulk rock composition shows very little change in respect to the wall rock composition. In contrast, in the <b>shear</b> zone <b>centre</b> quartz occurs as large, weakly deformed porphyroclasts in sizes similar to that in the wall rock, suggesting that it has undergone little deformation. Feldspars and biotite are almost completely reacted to muscovite, which is arranged in a fine-grained interconnected matrix. Muscovite-rich layers contain significant amounts of fine-grained intermixed quartz with random CPO. These domains are interpreted to have accommodated most of the strain. Bulk rock chemistry data show a significant increase in SiO 2 and depletion in NaO content compared to the wall rock composition. We suggest that the high- and low-strain microstructures in the shear zone represent markedly different scenarios and cannot be interpreted as a simple sequential development with respect to strain. Instead, we propose that the microstructural and mineralogical changes in the <b>shear</b> zone <b>centre</b> arise from a local metasomatic alteration around a brittle precursor. When the weaker fine-grained microstructure is established, the further flow is controlled by transient porosity created at (i) grain boundaries in fine-grained areas deforming by grain boundary sliding (GBS) and (ii) transient dilatancy sites at porphyroclast–matrix boundaries. Here a growth of secondary quartz occurs from incoming fluid, resulting in significant changes in bulk composition and eventually rheological hardening due to the precipitation-related increase in the mode and grain size of quartz. In contrast, within the shear zone margins the amount of fluid influx and associated reactions is limited; here deformation mainly proceeds by dynamic recrystallization of the igneous quartz grains. The studied shear zone exemplifies the role of syn-deformational fluids and fluid-induced reactions on the dominance of deformation processes and subsequent contrasting rheological behaviour at micron to metre scale...|$|R

It is demonstrated that there is close agreement between the values obtained from the design formulae and their original analytical counterparts. These are also compared with the results from design formulae based on analogous column behaviour, an approach commonly used in design codes.

40|$|Strong tectonic remobilisation and {{shear zone}} {{development}} are typical {{features of the}} easternmost part of the Vepori- cum tectonic unit in the Western Carpathians. The granodiorite mylonites {{in the area of}} the Rolovská shear zone (Čierna hora Mts) underwent a complex polystage evolution during the Hercynian and Alpine orogenies. Deformation during the latter reached greenschist facies under metamorphic conditions. Mylonites are macroscopically foliated rocks with a stretching lineation and shear bands. Structurally different mylonite types, ranging from protomylonites to ulramylo- nites with typical grainsize reduction from the margins towards the <b>shear</b> zone <b>centre,</b> have been assessed. The modal mineralogy of the different mylonite types changes considerably. Typical is a progressive decrease in feldspar content and simultaneously the quartz and white mica content increases from protomylonites towards the most strongly defor- med ultramylonites. The deformation had a brittle character in less deformed rocks and a ductile one in more deformed tectonites. Obvious chemical changes occur in mesomylonites and ultramylonites. During mylonitisation, the original biotite granodiorite was depleted of Mg, Fe, Na, Ca and Ba, while K, Rb and mainly Si increased considerably. Other (major and trace) elements reflect erratic behaviour due to lateral mobility. Chemical changes indicate the breakdown and subsequent recrystallisation of biotite and feldspars and, in turn, the crystallisation of albite and sericite.

40|$|A k-ω based hybrid RANS/LES (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation) {{model is}} tested for {{simulation}} of plane impinging jets at various nozzle-plate distances (H/B, where H is {{the distance and}} B is the slot width) and various Reynolds numbers (based on the slot width and the velocity in the symmetry plane). The studied combinations are H/B= 2 for Re= 10000, H/B= 4 for Re= 18000 and H/B= 9. 2 for Re= 20000. The focus is on small distance of the nozzle exit to the plate. This means for impact of the jet onto the plate before complete mixing of the <b>shear</b> layers. The <b>centre</b> of the impact zone is then in laminar state and the developing boundary layer on the plate undergoes transition to turbulent state. The transitional flow cannot be correctly simulated with a RANS turbulence model, but we will demonstrate that a hybrid model is basically correct...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Within the {{limitations}} of the classical thin plate theory expressions are obtained for the small deflections of a thin isotropic circular plate uniformly load-ed over a c,ncentric ellipse and supported by four columns at the vertices of a recta,g[e whose sides are parallel to the axes of the ellipse. Formulae are given for the mo,aents and <b>shears</b> at the <b>centre</b> of the plate and on the edge. Limiting cases are invest igated. KEY WORDS AND PIIRASES. Deflections of circular plates, four point supports, free boundary, uniform loading on a concentric ellipse 1980 AMS SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION CODE. 73 N. |. INTRODUCTION. The technological importance of thin elastic plates is sufficiently well estab-lished to require no elaboration. Thin slabs of material are structures which are widely used in engineering work and their transverse flexure has been extensively studied by many authors both theoretically and experimentally when the boundary of th...|$|R
