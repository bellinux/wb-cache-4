Lincoln who joined him upon his graduation in 1907, as the sales director of the company. The product line of the company expanded and included battery chargers for electric automobiles.

5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space).

Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding.
