5|$|While some {{birds are}} {{essentially}} territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are <b>safety</b> <b>in</b> numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators {{is particularly important}} in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This {{has led to the}} development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide <b>safety</b> <b>in</b> numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis article {{examines}} the relationship between safety climate, risk perception and involvement <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management by first-line managers (FLM). Sixty-three FLMs from two French nuclear plants answered a questionnaire measuring perceived workplace safety climate, perceived risk, and involvement <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management. We hypothesized that a positive perception of safety climate would promote substantial involvement <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management, and that this effect would be stronger than the perceived-risk effect. We also expected that safety climate dimensions would have a different impact on involvement <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management. Especially, we expected climate dimensions dealing with safety-related exchanges between managers and their supervisees to be more related to FLMs’ involvement <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management. As expected, perceived risk, as well as safety climate, was related to FLMs’ involvement <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management: the more they perceived risks as probable and serious for their supervisees, the more involved they got <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management. Similarly, FLMs who perceived a good <b>safety</b> climate <b>in</b> their company reported getting more involved <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management than did FLMs who perceived a poor safety climate. Moreover, {{the results showed that}} safety climate was the key variable because it completely mediated the effect of perceived risk on involvement <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management. Another important result showed that immediate supervisor encouragement was more influential than senior management views on safety. Furthermore, the fact of being called upon by supervisees on safety issues prompted the FLMs to be more involved <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management. Possible avenues for improving the involvement of FLMs <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management are suggested...|$|R
