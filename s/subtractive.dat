5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (<b>subtractive)</b> in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E
25|$|Around 1920, {{the first}} {{practical}} <b>subtractive</b> color processes were introduced. These also used black-and-white film to photograph multiple color-filtered source images, {{but the final}} product was a multicolored print that did not require special projection equipment. Before 1932, when three-strip Technicolor was introduced, commercialized <b>subtractive</b> processes used only two color components and could reproduce only a limited range of color.|$|E
25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the <b>subtractive</b> color system, which filters colors from white light by using {{superimposed}} cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A <b>subtractive</b> primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary <b>subtractive</b> primary.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} <b>subtractive</b> processes, {{including}} Gasparcolor, a single-strip 3-color system developed in 1933 by the Hungarian chemist Dr. Bela Gaspar.|$|E
25|$|A <b>subtractive</b> {{decoding}} bus bridge {{must know}} to expect this extra {{delay in the}} event of back-to-back cycles in order to advertise back-to-back support.|$|E
25|$|A {{chromaticity}} diagram can illustrate {{the gamut of}} different choices of primaries, for example showing which colors are lost (and gained) if you use RGB for <b>subtractive</b> color mixing (instead of CMY).|$|E
25|$|The {{colors are}} cyan, magenta and yellow, {{which is a}} <b>subtractive</b> system, {{comparable}} to the principle used in inkjet printing for example. Compared to LCD, brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.|$|E
25|$|Though the printer-produced {{resolution}} {{is sufficient for}} many applications, printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material with a higher-resolution <b>subtractive</b> process can achieve greater precision.|$|E
25|$|Variable, {{incremental}} Cyan, Magenta and Yellow color-mixing filters to vary beam color via <b>subtractive</b> color mixing. Using this method, a {{much wider}} range of colors can be created than is possible using single color filters.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, {{the basic}} {{elements}} required for the modern analog <b>subtractive</b> synthesizers— audio oscillators, audio filters, envelope controllers, and various effects units — had already appeared and were utilized in several electronic instruments.|$|E
25|$|Synthesizers use various {{methods to}} {{generate}} electronic signals (sounds). Among {{the most popular}} waveform synthesis techniques are <b>subtractive</b> synthesis, additive synthesis, wavetable synthesis, frequency modulation synthesis, phase distortion synthesis, physical modeling synthesis and sample-based synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Often <b>subtractive,</b> additive, deformative, or {{transformative}} {{methods are}} combined in whatever ways are advantageous. Such multidisciplinary manufacturing falls under classifications including rapid prototyping, desktop manufacturing, direct manufacturing, direct digital manufacturing, digital fabrication, instant manufacturing, or on-demand manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|The first truly {{successful}} <b>subtractive</b> color {{process was}} William van Doren Kelley's Prizma, an early color process that {{was first introduced}} at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City on 8 February 1917. Prizma began in 1916 as an additive system similar to Kinemacolor.|$|E
25|$|Chainfire {{continues}} {{the story of}} Richard {{in his attempt to}} teach the people that their lives are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using <b>Subtractive</b> Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the <b>Subtractive</b> Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E
25|$|Threading is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a screw thread. More screw threads are produced each year than any other machine element. There are many methods of generating threads, including <b>subtractive</b> methods (many kinds of thread cutting and grinding, as detailed below); deformative or transformative methods (rolling and forming; molding and casting); additive methods (such as 3D printing); or combinations thereof.|$|E
25|$|Another basic {{distinction}} is between <b>subtractive</b> carving techniques, which remove material from an existing block or lump, for example of stone or wood, and modelling techniques which shape or {{build up the}} work from the material. Techniques such as casting, stamping and moulding use an intermediate matrix containing the design to produce the work; many of these allow the production of several copies.|$|E
25|$|During {{a raid on}} his camp, Richard {{is seriously}} wounded and now Nicci must use <b>Subtractive</b> Magic {{in order to save}} him. Richard awakens to find his wife Kahlan missing and discovers that he is the only person alive who remembers her. As he begins to search for her, he learns that he is also hunted by a beast created by Jagang's Sisters of the Dark.|$|E
25|$|Kernel-mode Plug-And-Play {{enhancements}} include {{support for}} PCI multilevel rebalance, partial arbitration {{of resources to}} support PCI <b>subtractive</b> bridges, asynchronous device start and enumeration operations to speed system startup, support for setting and retrieving custom properties on a device, an enhanced ejection API to allow the caller to determine if and when a device has been successfully ejected, and diagnostic tracing to facilitate improved reliability.|$|E
25|$|The RGB color {{model is}} {{additive}} {{in the sense}} that the three light beams are added together, and their light spectra add, wavelength for wavelength, to make the final color's spectrum. This is essentially opposite to the <b>subtractive</b> color model that applies to paints, inks, dyes, and other substances whose color depends on reflecting the light under which we see them. Because of properties, these three colours create white, this is in stark contrast to physical colours, such as dyes which create black when mixed.|$|E
25|$|Additive manufacturing, {{starting}} with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization, as end users will {{do much of}} their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations. The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is {{more a matter of}} complementing traditional <b>subtractive</b> methods rather than displacing them entirely.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the reader learns that Kahlan indeed exists, {{and has been}} kidnapped by the four {{remaining}} Sisters of the Dark who escaped the Dream Walker in Blood of the Fold. The Sisters have cast a spell called Chainfire, using <b>Subtractive</b> Magic to erase people's memories of Kahlan and Kahlan's memories of herself. The Sisters then use Kahlan to steal the boxes of Orden from the Garden of Life in the People's Palace. Kahlan leaves Spirit behind, the statue Richard carved for her.|$|E
25|$|However, after 1917, Kelley reinvented {{the process}} as a <b>subtractive</b> one with several years of short films and travelogues, such as Everywhere With Prizma (1919) and A Prizma Color Visit to Catalina (1919) before {{releasing}} features such as the documentary Bali the Unknown (1921), The Glorious Adventure (1922), and Venus of the South Seas (1924). A Prizma promotional short filmed for Del Monte Foods titled Sunshine Gatherers (1921) is available on DVD in Treasures 5 The West 1898–1938 by the National Film Preservation Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Screenprinting has {{its origins}} in simple stencilling, most notably of the Japanese form (katazome), used who cut banana leaves and {{inserted}} ink through the design holes on textiles, mostly for clothing. This was taken up in France. The modern screenprinting process originated from patents taken out by Samuel Simon in 1907 in England. This idea was then adopted in San Francisco, California, by John Pilsworth in 1914 who used screenprinting to form multicolor prints in a <b>subtractive</b> mode, differing from screenprinting as it is done today.|$|E
25|$|Each photographed color component, {{initially}} just a colorless {{record of}} the luminous intensities {{in the part of}} the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image in the color complementary to the color of the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the <b>subtractive</b> color method. In some early color processes (e.g., Kinemacolor), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through color filters to synthesize the original colors by the additive color method.|$|E
25|$|In {{the current}} scenario, 3D {{printing}} or AM {{has been used}} in manufacturing, medical, industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing or AM to become successful commercial technology. The earliest application of additive manufacturing was on the toolroom end of the manufacturing spectrum. For example, rapid prototyping was one of the earliest additive variants, and its mission was to reduce the lead time and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices, which was earlier only done with <b>subtractive</b> toolroom methods such as CNC milling, turning, and precision grinding. In the 2010s, additive manufacturing entered production to a much greater extent.|$|E
25|$|On {{the rising}} edge of clock 0, the {{initiator}} observes FRAME# and IRDY# both high, and GNT# low, so it drives the address, command, and asserts FRAME# {{in time for}} the rising edge of clock 1. Targets latch the address and begin decoding it. They may respond with DEVSEL# in time for clock 2 (fast DEVSEL), 3 (medium) or 4 (slow). <b>Subtractive</b> decode devices, seeing no other response by clock 4, may respond on clock 5. If the master does not see a response by clock 5, it will terminate the transaction and remove FRAME# on clock 6.|$|E
25|$|Prokudin-Gorsky's own inventions, {{some of them}} collaborative, led to the {{granting}} of numerous patents, most issued {{during the years of}} his voluntary exile and not directly related to the body of work on which his fame now rests. Some concern processes for making <b>subtractive</b> color transparencies, which do not require any special projection or viewing equipment. Examples of these were preserved by Prokudin-Gorsky's family and have recently appeared online. Most of his patents relate to the production of natural-color motion pictures, a potentially lucrative application that attracted the attention of many inventors in the field of color photography during the 1910s and 1920s.|$|E
25|$|The first {{permanent}} color {{photograph was}} taken in 1861 using the three-color-separation principle first published by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1855. The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, Maxwell's idea was to take three separate black-and-white photographs through red, green and blue filters. This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image. Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an additive method of color reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing carbon prints of the three images made in their complementary colors, a <b>subtractive</b> method of color reproduction pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 1860s.|$|E
25|$|Hazards {{to health}} and safety also exist from {{post-processing}} activities done to finish parts {{after they have been}} printed. These post-processing activities can include chemical baths, sanding, polishing, or vapor exposure to refine surface finish, as well as general <b>subtractive</b> manufacturing techniques such as drilling, milling, or turning to modify the printed geometry. Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used, such as respirators or safety glasses. Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some 3D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes. These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin.|$|E
25|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{additive}} systems (including a camera with two apertures, {{one with a}} red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. Herbert Kalmus, Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a <b>subtractive</b> color system for Technicolor. The system used a beam splitter in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green, then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was Toll of the Sea (1922) starring Anna May Wong. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was The Black Pirate (1926), starring and produced by Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
25|$|If one {{illuminates}} {{two parallel}} slits, {{the light from}} the two slits again interferes. Here the interference is a more-pronounced pattern with a series of light and dark bands. The width of the bands is a property of the frequency of the illuminating light. (See the bottom photograph to the right.) When Thomas Young (1773–1829) first demonstrated this phenomenon, it indicated that light consists of waves, as the distribution of brightness {{can be explained by the}} alternately additive and <b>subtractive</b> interference of wavefronts. Young's experiment, performed in the early 1800s, played a vital part in the acceptance of the wave theory of light, vanquishing the corpuscular theory of light proposed by Isaac Newton, which had been the accepted model of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, the later discovery of the photoelectric effect demonstrated that under different circumstances, light can behave as if it is composed of discrete particles. These seemingly contradictory discoveries made it necessary to go beyond classical physics and take the quantum nature of light into account.|$|E
25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using <b>subtractive</b> color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.|$|E
25|$|Newton, et al. cultured L. jordanis {{and various}} other species of Legionella in BCYE or ACES broth. DNA {{extraction}} and PCR amplification were done under standard conditions. However, due to low GC-content and the mismatching of base pairs, the temperature used during <b>subtractive</b> hybridization was adjusted to 35°C. Small amounts of biosynthetic enzymes L-cysteine synthase and acetyltransferase were detected in L. jordanis and L. pneumophila; 19 open reading frames (ORFs) were found in L. jordanis, {{with a range of}} punitive functions making up around 47.5% of the 41 sequences represented by 40 ORFs. L. jordanis was found to contain the gene loci sidH, sidE, sidB, and sidG which express an Dot/Icm effector protein. This effector protein is essential for L. pneumophila to infiltrate host cells, so it is thought {{to be used as a}} virulence factor in L. jordanis, also. Both strains of L. jordanis tested positive for proteolysis and hemolysis. They did not test positive for cytotoxicity. Several species of Legionella “produced different proteolytic cleavage patterns on synthetic peptide substrates.” This suggests some genetic differences exist between the proteases produced by the different species of Legionella, despite them having some similarities. L. jordanis also appears to contain complex chains of lipopolysaccharides. Legionella species use amino acids as both carbon and energy sources.|$|E
500|$|In the <b>subtractive</b> color system, [...] used in {{painting}} and color printing, green {{is created by}} a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; [...] in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, {{it is one of the}} additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors.
