The author is one of the key system designers supplied by the consultancy services of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The system emphasizes the enhancement of the integrity and effectiveness of decision-support and the information flow among the various construction parties for construction target <b>cost</b> <b>contracts</b> aided by a computerized construction integrated management system, equipped with intelligent database and data mining technology. Complex and capital-intensive construction projects usually involve higher risks. A partnering approach can be applied to such projects as a basis to bring about better project results. Partly as a result of rational risk sharing, target <b>cost</b> <b>contracting</b> can also be effective, where a fixed target cost is set based on given parameters at the outset. If this fixed target is exceeded or undercut, the outcome is split between the contracting parties in a pain/gain sharing fashion. An advantage of this approach lies in the incentive to the contractor to be efficient and to achieve savings. Target <b>cost</b> <b>contracting</b> has been globally recommended as an appropriate means of realizing high-risk construction projects.

40|$|It seems {{surprising}} that small firms engage in offshore outsourcing given that {{they lack the}} resources that large firms possess to overcome the difficulties involved. We examine these factors using transaction cost theoryâ€™s three stages: contact <b>costs,</b> <b>contract</b> <b>costs,</b> and control costs. Then, using our field data from small client firms (in the United States and the United Kingdom), intermediaries, and offshore vendors, we analyze the mitigation approaches that reduce transaction costs for small firms. We identify nine such approaches: three for client firms and six for suppliers. For the small client firm, they are liaisons of knowledge flows, gaining experience, and overcoming opportunism; and, for the service providers, they are onshore presence, reducing contact <b>costs,</b> simplifying <b>contracting,</b> providing control channels, expert intermediaries, and standardization of services...|$|R

40|$|Competitive {{tendering}} {{of local}} public transport services has been allowed in Norway since 1994. By 2005, 28 percent of all route production in Norway was procured {{on the basis of}} tendered contracts, covering around 40 percent of all passengers. The majority of the tendered <b>contracts</b> were gross <b>cost</b> <b>contracts,</b> whereas historically, most Norwegian contracts have been net <b>cost</b> <b>contracts.</b> This article analyses the effect of competitive tendering on operating cost and subsidies paid. It is found that competitive tendering reduces costs by 10 percent and that most of the cost reduction has been used to reduce subsidies for public transport by local authorities. The effects of competitive tendering in Norway are smaller compared to other countries. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the industry had improved efficiency over a long period before competitive tendering was introduced...|$|R
40|$|Simulations of net <b>cost</b> <b>contracts</b> {{augmented}} with {{a subsidy}} per passenger for public transport bus operators in Sweden indicate that such contracts may shift the operators profit maximising price and frequency combination {{in a direction}} that yields an increased patronage. The calculations suggest that a subsidised increase in patronage is welfare improving. The simulations unfortunately also indicate that such contracts may become very costly for the public transport authority. In a system with franchised contracts we however suggest that a large part of these costs may be recovered as a bid for the contract. In this study we can not calculate all the potential adaptations that the operator may undertake to optimise the supply. We therefore conjecture that a net <b>cost</b> <b>contract</b> augmented with a subsidy may well be a reasonable policy to achieve increased patronage. incentive contract; public transport; patronage; subsidy...|$|R

40|$|Target <b>cost</b> <b>contracts</b> entail {{the use of}} {{open book}} accounting, giving the client full access to project costs. Since {{comprehensive}} cost control is expensive, other less costly control mechanisms might {{be better for the}} client. Moreover, the ambiguous connection between control and trust and the negative impact of control on the collaboration climate is well known. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the variety of control mechanisms used by the client in the early phases of a target <b>cost</b> <b>contract</b> and give a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between trust and control. A case study approach is adopted, which demonstrates the control mechanisms used by the client in a construction project in order to guarantee that the contractor behaves in a trustworthy way. The case is a large laboratory project with a target <b>cost</b> <b>contract,</b> where the empirical data were gathered through interviews and non-participant observations. Based on previous experiences the client considered the contractor as reliable and believed that a rigorous control of project costs might hurt the relationship. However, the clientâ€™s opinion was that trust is fragile and must be continuously preserved. Therefore the client analyses the contractorâ€™s response to project changes as a measure of contractor reliability. For instance, if there are any strange features in the contractorâ€™s response, or if the contractor behaves in a suspicious way, the client might find it necessary to expand control, even if it might impact negatively on the collaboration climate...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse land {{allocation}} between competing agri-environmental contracts taking into account institutional issues and farm household and farm characteristics. We consider a Biodiversity Protection Contract, Landscape Management Contract and a Restriction on Intensive Practises Contract. The paper shows that it is important to study the choice for an agrienvironmental contract in combination with the choice for other agri-environmental contracts. The reasons being that a unit of land can only be allocated to one contract (although a farm can select more than one contract) and perceived relative marginal <b>costs</b> of <b>contracts</b> can change if institutional settings and farm household and farm characteristics alter. The model uses a two stage method. In the first step the probability of contract choice is determined. In the second stage these probabilities are linked to ex ante costs (including transaction <b>costs)</b> and optimal <b>contract</b> choice is determined.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry is often {{characterized by the}} traditional adversarial working relationships between contracting parties. There has been a strong call for applying target <b>cost</b> <b>contracts</b> to align the interest of owners and contractors together. By doing so, it aims to achieve a winâ€“win situation under a partnering arrangement within the {{construction industry}}. Even though a multitude of research studies have been undertaken on target <b>cost</b> <b>contracts</b> (TCC) or guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contracts, not {{many of them have}} focused on the risk management and analysis of these procurement strategies. This paper aims to identify, rank and compare the key risk factors encountered with these forms of procurement based on an empirical questionnaire survey geared towards the clients, contractors and consultants in Hong Kong. Despite the limited number of completed TCC and GMP (TCC/GMP) construction projects in Hong Kong, the chosen sample was perceived to be truly representative of the survey population. A four-level data analysis framework was applied in this paper, including descriptive statistics, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and Mannâ€“Whitney U test. The research findings showed that the client group, contractor group and consultant group are in general agreement on the impact of individual risks. The identification of the key risk factors and their relative significance is important in the risk management of target <b>cost</b> <b>contracts</b> and guaranteed maximum price projects, which, if properly done, would enhance the value for money throughout the whole procurement process. This research study also helps various key project stakeholders to be equipped with better knowledge and understanding of TCC/GMP scheme by paying close attention to those high-risk factors and then the implementation of appropriate risk mitigation measures in a proactive manner.

However, {{there is still a}} lack of research evidence to evaluate the levels of success and lessons learned from these innovative procurement strategies. Based on the analysis of a series of in-depth interviews on the perceptions of various relevant experienced industrial practitioners, this paper aims to explore the key attributes of GMP/TCC including the underlying motives, perceived benefits, potential difficulties, critical success factors, key risk factors involved and optimal project conditions for adopting GMP/TCC. The research findings are useful in assisting key project stakeholders in minimising the detriments brought about by potential difficulties in and maximising the benefits derived from implementing GMP/TCC concepts. The study is also significant in contributing to new knowledge and practical information of GMP/TCC applications and implementation, in both a national and international context.
