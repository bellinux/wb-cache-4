Authorial music is subdued by this place “where Quiet dwells” and “whose silent shade is for the modest Muses made”. The effects are predominantly visual, as {{in the description of}} how perception of the surrounding natural features is modified on ascending the hill <b>slope</b> (<b>lines</b> 30-40), or in the likening of the contrasting aspects of the view to “pearls upon an Ethiop’s arm” (line 113). While the view is not minutely detailed, what Dyer sees from the summit is authentic, as is apparent from a comparison with the prose description in the guidebook already quoted. But it is possible for the eye to be guided by the vision of the painters then in vogue. Among the influences on Dyer identified by critics have figured Claude Lorrain, Nicholas Poussin, and Salvator Rosa, the latter of whom was, like Dyer, both a poet and painter. The mellow light effects of Dyer’s poem are certainly Claude’s, but without the Classical trappings. As a vista, with the abrupt ascent rising from the river in the foreground, leading to a view of distant towers, it approximates more closely to Rosa’s “Mountain Landscape”, now in Southampton Art Gallery.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{basis for}} the determination of <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> in grid digital elevation models is provided by using the D 8 -LTD method (eight slope directions, least transverse deviation). The D 8 -LTD method's capability to predict consistently exact <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> as the grid cell size goes to zero is shown analytically by applying mathematical analysis methods. The use of cumulative, least transverse deviations {{is found to be}} the key factor allowing for globally unbiased approximations of <b>slope</b> <b>lines.</b> The D 8 -LTD method's properties are also demonstrated numerically by using digital elevation models of a synthetic sloping surface obtained from the Himmelblau function. It is shown that <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> obtained from the D 8 -LTD method can approximate the exact <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> as close as desired by selecting a grid cell size that is small enough. In contrast, the standard D 8 method is found to produce significantly biased results even when small grid cells are used. The D 8 -LTD method outperforms the D 8 method over a wide range of grid cell sizes (up to 20 m in this application), beyond which grid cell size becomes too large to validly represent the underlying sloping surface. It is therefore concluded that the D 8 -LTD method should be used in preference to the standard D 8 method in order to obtain <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> that are only limited in reliability by the detail of topographic data, and not by the accuracy of the slope direction method applied.

Characteristic points of contours are defined in relation to the skeleton lines of the terrain and determined using the deviation angles at the contour points.

A skeleton {{line is the}} one with minimum slope among the <b>slope</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Slope</b> <b>lines</b> are {{the lines of the}} steepest slope. Skeleton lines are used {{for a wide range of}} aims, e. g. emphasizing land forms, generation of high fidelity digital terrain models, terrain generalization, determining characteristic points of contours, etc. There are several methods for derivation of skeleton lines from contours and digital elevation models (DEMs). The primary objective of this study is to compare the results obtained by two different methods. Firstly, the skeleton lines are derived with respect to the algorithm developed by Aumann et al. (1991) using the contours generated from the height points of the DEM in addition to the characteristic points of the terrain. After that, the algorithm developed by Chang et al. (1998) for derivation of the skeleton lines from only the height points of the DEM is used. The results are compared with the skeleton lines of the terrain drawn by the operator in the stereo models of the area. For comparison, some cartographic and geomorphologic properties of contours and skeleton lines (i. e. numbers, locations and lengths of skeleton lines, and relationships between the contours and the skeleton lines) are used as the measurements. As a result, the skeleton lines derived from contours are more satisfactory than that are derived from DEM. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Geographical {{information}} systems (GIS) are means of effective collection, storage, searching, transformation, analysis and display of geographic information. Geographic data are spatial {{data on the}} geographic sphere (the landscape). Their most important feature is the aspect of position, recorded, for example, as a digital terrain model. The basic requirement set up {{in terms of the}} terrain model is to calculate the terrain altitude of a specific location, object, etc. The ways of fulfilling this requirement are related mostly to the terrain model type. This article describes the methods of creation of the contour and <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> based on a terrain model. It describes an algorithm to produce terrain models from the measured altitude, with the possibility of displaying contour lines and slope profiles. The altitude point system ensures that we interpret the system of contour lines and slope profiles correctly and it provides a simple interface to construct contour lines, slope profiles and the digital terrain model...|$|E
40|$|As a noise {{analysis}} method for inertial sensors, the traditional Allan variance method requires {{the storage of}} {{a large amount of}} data and manual analysis for an Allan variance graph. Although the existing online estimation methods avoid the storage of data and the painful procedure of drawing <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> for estimation, they require complex transformations and even cause errors during the modeling of dynamic Allan variance. To solve these problems, first, a new state-space model that directly models the stochastic errors to obtain a nonlinear state-space model was established for inertial sensors. Then, a neural-extended Kalman filter algorithm was used to estimate the Allan variance coefficients. The real noises of an ADIS 16405 IMU and fiber optic gyro-sensors were analyzed by the proposed method and traditional methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more suitable to estimate the Allan variance coefficients than the traditional methods. Moreover, the proposed method effectively avoids the storage of data and can be easily implemented using an online processor...|$|E

30|$|A Ni–Al {{coating of}} three {{different}} thicknesses was successfully prepared on the outer surface of a stainless steel 316 L tube (SS tube) using a flame spray technique with Ni- 5 wt%Al powder as the starting material. SEM and EDX analyses of the cross-section area of the Ni–Al coating confirm that all three thicknesses consist of Ni, Al and O elements with a non-uniform chemical distribution. The O element distributes over the cross-sectional area of the sample and is predominantly in the Al-rich area. Ni, Al, NiO and Al 2 O 3 phases are indexed on the Ni–Al solar absorber. The spectral R of all thicknesses are identical values over the whole wavelength range of UV–VIS-NIR and IR regions, indicating that the spectral selectivity of this coating is independent of its thickness. According to the thermal efficiency equation of the PTC based on the intercept (FRηo) and <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> (−FRUL/C), the thermal performance of the PTC increases with increasing thickness of the Ni–Al coating, while the heat loss transfers from the PTC to the surroundings decreases. In conclusion, the Ni–Al coating prepared using the flame spray technique is a very promising candidate for a solar absorber material to use in concentrating solar collectors.|$|E

40|$|The {{automatic}} detection of subsurface defects {{has become a}} desired goal {{in the application of}} Non Destructive Techniques. In this paper, a new algorithm based on the Radon Transform is proposed to reduce human intervention to a minimum in the field of Thermography for defect detection and/or characterization. The analysis of a thermographic sequence for the detection of subsurface defects can be reduced to the identification of the - 0. 5 slope in the surface temperature decay for each pixel within the image. Employing techniques commonly used in computer vision, an algorithm can be developed in order to look for the - 0. 5 slope in the temporal temperature decay profiles of each pixel. In our case, the Radon transform can be used to detect those - 0. 5 <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> in the temporal temperature decay profiles. The final result provided by this algorithm is an image showing the different defects avoiding the necessity of evaluating parameters as relevant in other algorithms as the delayed time of the first image or any subjective point of view in the analysis. All the information is contained in only one image and leads to a quantitative estimation of the defect depths. The principal limitation is that the specimens under inspection should be semi-infinite homogeneous samples because this algorithm is supported on a 1 -D Fourier diffusion equation approximation. Experimental works using a PlexiglasTM specimen were performed showing a good agreement with other semi-automated techniques...|$|E
40|$|A {{physically}} based distributed hydrological {{model is}} presented. Starting from a contour-based terrain analysis, the model makes a no-conventional discretization of the terrain. From the maximum <b>slope</b> <b>lines,</b> obtained using {{the principles of}} minimum distance and orthogonality, the models obtains a stream tubes structure. The implemented model automatically can find the terrain morphological characteristics, e. g. peaks and saddles, and deal with them respecting the stream flow. Using this type of discretization, the model divides the elements in which the water flows in two classes; the cells, that are mixtilinear polygons where the overland flow is modelled as a sheet flow and channels, obtained by the interception {{of two or more}} stream tubes and whenever surface runoff occurs, the surface runoff is channelised. The permanent drainage paths can are calculated using {{one of the most common}} methods: threshold area, variable threshold area or curvature. The subsurface flow is modelled using the Simplified Bucket Model. The model considers three type of overland flow, depending on how it is produced:infiltration excess;saturation of superficial layer of the soil and exfiltration of sub-surface flow from upstream. The surface flow and the subsurface flow across a element are routed according with the mono-dimensional equation of the kinematic wave. The also model considers the spatial variability of the channels geometry with the flow. The channels have a rectangular section with length of the base decreasing with the distance from the outlet and depending on a power of the flow. The model was tested on the Rio Gallina and Missiaga catchments and the results showed model good performances...|$|E

During 1998 and 1999 thirty patients (20 males and 10 females, aged 525 + 1. 3) have been followed-up at the Department of Nephrology, Clinical Centre of Serbia. On regular monthly controls serum creatinine, urea, calcium and protein levels, creatinine clearance, and blood pressure, were measured. All patients were suggested a low protein diet. Progression of the disease was expressed by the slope of the regression line showing reciprocal serum creatinine values.
