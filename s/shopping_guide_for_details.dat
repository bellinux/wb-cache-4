The engaging team of Kim Stanford and Bill Backhaus represents both these audiences, and together they have developed over 200 flavorful and tempting recipes for all types of dishes, from appetizers to desserts. Goodbye Gluten is both a cookbook and <b>shopping</b> <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> people who do not want gluten in their diets and are tired of missing out on their favorite foods. In each recipe the authors use everyday brand names that can be found at your local grocery store, which means you no longer have to check labels to decipher if a product is gluten-free.

40|$|A {{catalog of}} optical warps of galaxies is presented. This can be {{considered}} complementary to that reported by Sanchez-Saavedra et al., with 42 galaxies in the northern hemisphere, and to that by Reshetnikov & Combes, with 60 optical warps. The limits of the present catalog are: logr 25 > 0. 60, B_{t} < 14. 5, delta(2000) < 0, - 2. 5 < t < 7. Therefore, lenticular galaxies have also been considered. This catalog lists 150 warped galaxies out of a sample of 276 edge-on galaxies and covers the whole southern hemisphere, except the Avoidance Zone. It is therefore very suitable for statistical studies of warps. It also provides a source <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>detailed</b> particular observations. We confirm the large frequency of warped spirals: nearly all galaxies are warped. The frequency and warp angle do not present important differences for {{the different types of}} spirals. However, no lenticular warped galaxy has been found within the specified limits. This finding constitutes an important restriction for theoretical models.

40|$|The low {{temperature}} electrical conductance through correlated quantum dots provides a sensitive probe of the physics (e. g., of Fermi-liquid vs non-Fermi-liquid behavior) of such systems. Here, we investigate {{the role of}} level asymmetry (gate voltage) and local Coulomb repulsion (charging energy) on the {{low temperature}} and low field scaling properties of the linear conductance of a quantum dot described by the single level Anderson impurity model. We use the numerical renormalization group to quantify the regime of gate voltages and charging energies where universal Kondo scaling may be observed and also quantify the deviations from this universal behavior with increasing gate voltage away from the Kondo regime and with decreasing charging energy. We also compare our results with those from a recently developed method for linear and non-linear transport, {{which is based on}} renormalized perturbation theory using dual fermions, finding excellent agreement at particle-hole symmetry and for all charging energies and reasonable agreement at small finite level asymmetry. Our results could be a useful <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>detailed</b> experiments on conductance scaling in semiconductor and molecular quantum dots exhibiting the Kondo effect.

40|$|This manual {{contains}} {{useful information}} in writing programs using the GNAT compiler. It includes information on implementation dependent characteristics of GNAT, {{including all the}} information required by Annex M of the Ada language standard. GNAT implements Ada 95 and Ada 2005, and {{it may also be}} invoked in Ada 83 compat-ibility mode. By default, GNAT assumes Ada 2005, but you can override with a compiler switch to explicitly specify the language version. (Please refer to Section “Compiling Dif-ferent Versions of Ada ” in GNAT User’s <b>Guide,</b> <b>for</b> <b>details</b> on these switches.) Throughout this manual, references to “Ada ” without a year suffix apply to both the Ada 95 and Ada 2005 versions of the language. Ada is designed to be highly portable. In general, a program will have the same effect even when compiled by different compilers on different platforms. However, since Ada is designed to be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, it also contains a number of system dependent features to be used in interfacing to the external world. Note: Any program that makes use of implementation-dependent features may be non-portable. You should follow good programming practice and isolate and clearly document any sections of your program that make use of these features in a non-portable manner. What This Reference Manual Contains This reference manual contains the following chapters: • Chapter 1 [Implementation Defined Pragmas], page 5, lists GNAT implementation-dependent pragmas, which can be used to extend and enhance the functionality of the compiler. • Chapter 2 [Implementation Defined Attributes], page 67, lists GNAT implementation-dependent attributes, which can be used to extend and enhance the functionality of the compiler...|$|R
