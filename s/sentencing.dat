40|$|This {{study is}} {{a study on the}} {{language}} variation used in Renungan Rajawali. The writer finds out the variation of the language used in Renungan Rajawali by analyzing the <b>sentences</b> and the words in the three articles of Renungan Rajawali. This qualitative study applies descriptive analysis in order to find the information of standard and non-standard language used in Renungan Rajawali. The approach of the study is done by analyzing the standard and non-standard <b>sentences</b> in the articles based on the four <b>sentence</b> patterns. Then, the writer sorts the <b>sentences</b> into standard or non-standard <b>sentences.</b> The writer also analyzes the words used in the articles and classifies them into three categories. They are non-standard word formation, colloquial, and borrowing words. The research findings are: 1 st article (5 th April) : there are 20 <b>sentences</b> in the article. 11 <b>sentences</b> are standard and 9 <b>sentences</b> are non-standard. Among the standard <b>sentences</b> in the first article, there are 4 <b>sentences</b> using pattern 1 (Subject-Predicate), 3 <b>sentences</b> using pattern 2 (Subject-Predicate-Complement), 2 <b>sentences</b> using pattern 3 (Subject-Predicate Object) and the rest using pattern 4 (Subject-Predicate-Object-Complement). The non-standard <b>sentences</b> contain only the sub-clauses. 2 nd article (15 th April) : the second article has 16 standard <b>sentences</b> and 17 non-standard <b>sentences.</b> Among the 16 standard <b>sentences,</b> there are 6 <b>sentences</b> using pattern one (Subject-Predicate), none of them using pattern two (Subject-Predicate Complement), 9 <b>sentences</b> using pattern three (Subject-Predicate-Object) and only a <b>sentence</b> using pattern four (subject-Predicate-Object-Compelement). While among the non-standard <b>sentences,</b> there are 3 <b>sentences</b> containing only the predicate, 13 <b>sentences</b> are only the sub clause and only one <b>sentence</b> containing only the adverb. 3 rd article (29 th April) : there are 16 standard <b>sentences</b> in the article. There are 6 <b>sentences</b> using pattern one (Subject-Predicate), a <b>sentence</b> using pattern two (Subject-Predicate-Complement), 4 <b>sentences</b> using pattern three (Subject-Predicate-Object) and 5 <b>sentences</b> using pattern four (Subject-Predicate-Object-Complement). Meanwhile, there are 9 non-standard <b>sentences.</b> There is only one <b>sentence</b> containing the predicate and object and 8 <b>sentences</b> containing the sub-clause. Based on the discussion above, the writer finds out that as a whole there are more standard <b>sentences</b> than non-standard <b>sentences</b> in the articles under study. However, the difference is not big. There are 43 standard <b>sentences</b> and 35 nonstandard <b>sentences.</b> The difference of both standard <b>sentences</b> and non-standard <b>sentences</b> is only 8 <b>sentences.</b> The result of the analysis shows also that both standard and non-standard formations of the verbs are used. Moreover, colloquial words and borrowings words give effects on the <b>sentences</b> of the articles and they make the <b>sentences</b> are more interesting to read by the young people. As a whole, the writer concludes that the articles in Renungan Rajawali use standard Indonesian language. It is based on the total number of standard <b>sentences</b> used in the articles of Renungan Rajawali. The non-standard <b>sentences</b> are used in the articles just for the variation to help and attract young people in reading the Bible because Renungan Rajawali is indeed for Christian young people. While, the nonstandard word formation, colloquial and borrowing words give interesting effects on the youth in reading and understanding the bible...|$|R

This study focuses on Mr. Andrie Wongso's speech style. The writer chose Mr. Andrie Wongso because Mr. Andrie Wongso has different style to convey information and to express feeling in his speech.

The writer analyzed the language style related to <b>sentence</b> types and communicative functions in his <b>sentences.</b> The problem {{of this research is}} to see <b>sentence</b> types and communicative functions used in Mr. Andrie Wongso's speech.

The <b>sentence</b> types are declarative <b>sentence,</b> interrogative <b>sentence,</b> imperative <b>sentence,</b> and exclamative <b>sentence.</b> The communicative functions are making a statement, asking a question, directing others, and expressing attitude.

Besides, he used imperative <b>sentence</b> more in the first five minutes of the speech compared to imperative <b>sentence</b> on average spoken English and his speech in other parts.
