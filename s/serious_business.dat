5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the <b>serious</b> <b>business</b> of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E

25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, {{this has to do with}} the idea that taking a break from <b>serious</b> <b>business</b> (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E

25|$|The murders {{were not}} {{committed}} {{in the heat of}} sudden passion for some fancied wrong: they were the result of a deliberate system. The wronged individual laid his case before a quasijudicial tribunal demanding the death, say, of a mining boss and urging his reasons. If they were satisfactory, as they usually were, the murder was decreed; but the task was not assigned to the aggrieved person or to any one in his and the victim's neighborhood: perhaps directly aggrieved parties might be tempted to use more force or more cruelty than necessary. Two or more relatively disinterested Mollies from {{a different part of the}} county or even from the adjoining county were selected to do the killing because, being unknown, they could the more easily escape detection. Refusal to carry out the dictate of the conclave was dangerous and seldom happened, although an arrangement of substitution, if properly supported, was permitted. The meeting generally took place in an upper room of a hotel or saloon and, after the <b>serious</b> <b>business,</b> came the social reunion with deep libations of whiskey.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Ohio Whig Convention in Columbus on February 22, the theme and enthusiasm had taken full hold.

The competition between commercial and open source software has impacted the industry and the society as a whole.

500|$|Morris Dickstein of The New York Times {{was more}} {{critical}} of the book, calling it [...] "a misconceived and badly executed novel, a sideshow distraction from the <b>serious</b> <b>business</b> of thinking through the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi era."

He also complained that the characters are lifeless, and while they each have detailed histories, they are only [...] "verbal figments" [...] that do not separate them from one another. Finally Dickstein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler's speech are drawn from some of Steiner's earlier works, he [...] "unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant—at once absurdly harmless and unconvincingly dangerous." ...|$|E

500|$|The New York Times, however, printed its amazement that Tennessee Coal and Iron {{stocks were}} not {{acceptable}} to the clearing house and that the Trust Company of America was deemed insolvent when it had more than enough assets to cover all deposits.

The staff of Mean Machines Sega called the game [...] "hopelessly redundant" [...] and [...] "very, very disappoint", and they believed that the John Madden Football series was [...] "on its last legs".

500|$|In 1907, Gates {{took his}} usual summer holiday in Europe. [...] Upon {{arriving}} in Paris, he {{was met with}} an urgent cablegram from Grant Schley. Schley, {{the owner of a}} brokerage and a board member of Republic Steel and Tennessee Coal and Iron, advised Gates of <b>serious</b> <b>business</b> trouble and asked him to return to the US at once. As the Panic of 1907 began, Schley's brokerage had become short of money and it was necessary for him to obtain large loans to try to keep the brokerage solvent. Schley offered some US$6 million shares of Tennessee Coal and Iron Company as part of the collateral for the loans. [...] Oakleigh Thorne was the president of the Trust Company of America bank and {{also a member of the}} Gates coalition. Thorne believed his bank was in sound financial condition until a New York Times article stated otherwise. Thorne told reporters that if he paid off every depositor, he would still have US$4 million in assets. When the clearing house run by J. P. Morgan audited the bank's books, they found the bank was sound, but were quite interested in the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company stock they found and indicated that the stock was not acceptable to them as security.|$|E
500|$|NHL President Clarence Campbell was at {{the game}} and was seated near where the {{incident}} occurred. After receiving {{a report from the}} game's officials, Campbell called a news conference and said the injury was not Kennedy's fault. Campbell also publicly rebuked Ivan for his accusation, saying, [...] "That is a pretty <b>serious</b> <b>business</b> and a very vicious charge." [...] It was also argued that since Kennedy was a right-handed shot, the butt-end of his stick was towards the boards and away from Howe. Sportswriter Ted Reeve of the Toronto Telegram quipped, [...] "How would a right-handed stickhandler going down the left boards give anyone a butt end? Unless he wanted to lift the snappers out of someone in the rail seats." [...] Howe was lost from the playoffs, but the incident influenced the momentum of the series. Detroit won the second game of the series 3–1, a violent and fight-filled affair which included a stick-swinging incident between the Leafs' Jimmy Thomson and Detroit's Leo Reise and a fight between Kennedy and Ted Lindsay. After the game, Campbell threatened the players with fines if the violent play continued, and both teams continued to play hockey {{for the remainder of the}} series. However, Detroit was now determined to [...] "win the series for Gordie" [...] and defeated the Leafs in seven strongly-contested games to eliminate them from the playoffs, going on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E

500|$|Prior to 1621, {{the only}} oath taken {{was that of}} {{obedience}} {{to the rules of}} the conclave in force at that time, when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked, and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote. Gregory XV added the additional oath, taken when each cardinal casts his ballot, to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting [...] "courtesy votes" [...] and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three. Speed in electing a pope was important, and that meant using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the <b>serious</b> <b>business</b> of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates. The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step-by-step procedure used in choosing a pope; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis. The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed voting procedure of scrutiny making use of anonymous oaths. This was perhaps the most significant change in the modern era. It was a significant change to the step-by-step voting procedure, since that detailed voting procedure was first created in 1621. It was Pius XII who made this change in 1945.|$|E
