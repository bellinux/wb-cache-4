5|$|Winter <b>service</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers usually {{work part}} time, {{before and during}} inclement weather only, with drivers working a 12- to 16-hour shift. Main roads are {{typically}} gritted in advance, to reduce the disruption to the network. Salt barns are provided at regular intervals for drivers to collect more grit, and bedding is provided at road maintenance depots for drivers to use between shifts in heavy or prolonged storms.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter <b>service</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter <b>service</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{regional}} strike teams. These strike teams are put together {{when there are}} high fire danger days coming up and the CFS {{does not want to}} stretch a group's resources. These regional strike teams usually have one or two trucks from a few groups in that region. They sometimes have two or more commanding cars, plus a State Emergency <b>Service</b> <b>vehicle</b> for logistics.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's bus network, {{like that}} of Great Britain outside London, is {{deregulated}} following an act of UK Parliament in 1986. This broke up the former national and city bus companies, formerly run by the local authorities since the 1930s, into private companies. The act also allowed buses to be operated by private companies and individuals for profit, provided they met the financial, background and maintenance requirements {{to qualify for a}} licence, set down by VOSA who administrate the system. A Public <b>Service</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Licence is then granted to allow a specified number of vehicles to be operated. Using this licence firms can then register their routes with the Local Traffic Commissioner for the area, in this case Scotland, indicating the exact route to be operated as well as the times and dates their buses will run. No requirements are set as to when and what routes buses can run, their age and what fares can be charged-this is decided by companies, often by the profitability of the route. Currently only one bus company, Lothian Buses in Edinburgh, remains under ownership and control of local councils in Lothian and Edinburgh.|$|E
500|$|A winter <b>service</b> <b>vehicle</b> (WSV), or {{snow removal}} vehicle, {{is used to}} clear {{thoroughfares}} of ice and snow. Winter service vehicles are usually based on a dump truck chassis, with adaptations allowing them to carry specially designed snow removal equipment. Many authorities also use smaller vehicles on sidewalks, footpaths, and cycleways. Road maintenance agencies and contractors in temperate or polar areas often own several winter service vehicles, using them to keep the roads clear of snow and ice and safe for driving during winter. [...] Airports use winter service vehicles to keep both aircraft surfaces, and runways and taxiways free of snow and ice, which, besides endangering aircraft takeoff and landing, can interfere with the aerodynamics of the craft.|$|E

2500|$|While {{initially}} {{and according}} to Enrico Colantoni, the setting for the show was not identified, a Canadian flag was included on the officer's uniforms. As the show has progressed, the setting has become more significantly identifiable. This {{is especially true of}} the third season. Toronto landmarks, such as the CN Tower and York University, a fictional Toronto Interpreter newspaper (designed {{in the style of the}} Toronto Star, though [...] "The Star" [...] was mentioned during the premiere of Season 3) and Toronto Transit Commission stations and patrol cars are now regularly shown, identical to a Toronto Police <b>Service</b> <b>vehicle</b> but without the city name and with a fake division number. Various episodes show ex-Toronto police cars with the Toronto police logo still on them and SRU HQ has a flag with the Toronto Police logo on it. [...] Dialogue also references Tim Hortons, and local streets, as well as communities within the Greater Toronto Area.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, winter <b>service</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{usually have}} amber light bars, which are {{activated}} {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter <b>service</b> <b>vehicles</b> use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency <b>service</b> <b>vehicles,</b> rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|R
