5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

Humayun was amazed at their work and asked if they would work for him if he were to regain the sovereignty of Hindustan: they agreed. With <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> Humayun did not even meet the Shah until July, some six months after his arrival in Persia. After a lengthy journey from Herat the two met in Qazvin where a large feast and parties were held for the event. The meeting of the two monarchs is depicted in a famous wall-painting in the Chehel Sotoun (Forty Columns) palace in Esfahan.|$|E

Its tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use {{sampling}} really successfully. I also think that Brian Eno's idea of the studio-as-instrument comes from this kind of recording.|$|E

[...] "I had a little thumb-drive, and I would just drive around listening to it, and especially back and forth from Taylor's house. And I would sing little rhythmic sings to myself - they didn't make sense. There were no words. But this is another one that really intimidated me because I was like, 'I have all these melody ideas because there's no <b>so</b> <b>much</b> melody <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> rhythm <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> It's <b>so</b> inspiring. But how am I going to fit what I feel into that?' It took a minute." ...|$|R
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised the song {{as one of}} the best tracks of the album, calling it [...] "infectious". Sean O'Brien from The People praised [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as [...] "the best song of the album" [...] and her [...] "one of her best ever". He also said that the song is one of the reasons why Madonna is queen of pop. Jon Pareles from The New York Times considered it as the album's most danceable song. Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, called the song [...] "dazed-sounding". Metro Times described Ahmadzai's programming as [...] "by far the best thing on the album". James Hannaham from Spin compared [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] to Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love", and deemed it as a highlight from the album. Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was [...] "insane" [...] with its electronic, chaotic, fast and manic pounding synths. [...] "There is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> here several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as the [...] "downright thrilling" [...] and [...] "deploys a shrewd little form-versus-content paradox".|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Declan and Kate's {{relationship}} {{ended when}} Kate chose {{to break up}} with him after he began pushing her away. Declan starts a new job and he later lies to his family in front of her. Mullally said [...] "Declan's been pushing Kate away, he has <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in his life. He's holding on to these massive pieces of information that he feels he can't share with anyone – not even Kate." [...] When Kate sees Declan lying to his mother, she believes {{that he is not}} the boy she fell for and does not know if she can trust him. Mullally said that Declan is not prepared for the moment Kate breaks up with him and he is confused. Declan goes to Ringo Brown's (Sam Clark) bucks night where he meets Kate's rival, Candace Carey (Sheona Urquhart), who makes it clear that she is attracted to him. Declan and Candace later share a kiss, which Kate sees. Mullally said [...] "Candace gets talking to Declan and is there for him, he wants comfort and makes that split-second decision to kiss her. He doesn't think about the consequences". Declan does not know Kate saw them together and Mullally added that he hoped they could move on as they [...] "really do work as a couple".|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... there was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, {{who had to be}} replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|E

5000|$|Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly {{called it}} [...] "boring cyber-nonsense". [...] William McDonald of The New York Times wrote, [...] "The movie does gather {{suspense}} and momentum in Part II, but <b>so</b> <b>much</b> is <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> dialogue {{is devoted to}} explaining it, {{that no one has}} time to be interesting."

500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 21 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Dan Martin of NME gave the record {{a very positive}} review, calling a [...] "defining statement" [...] with the band's [...] "most stylistically hatstand-but-indisputably-best songs yet." [...] He wrote, [...] "We're not saying it's as good as genre watermarks American Idiot or The Black Parade. We're just saying it comes close," [...] closing with calling it a [...] "staggering achievement." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the album {{four out of five}} stars and compared it to labelmate Panic! at the Disco's effort earlier in the year, Pretty. Odd. He wrote that [...] "Fall Out Boy capture the Zeitgeist of {{the latter half of the}} 2000s better than any band: there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Folie à Deux, you either choose to take it all seriously or take none of it. Fall Out Boy make as much sense when heard either way." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press, commending the band for its [...] "creativity, ingenuity and willingness to try just about anything." [...] He compared the meaning of the term folie à deux ("a madness shared by two") to the two very distinct feelings expressed in the different sides of the record, calling the album a good representation of the band's career.|$|E
500|$|Special {{effects and}} {{pyrotechnics}} {{were provided by}} Pyritz Pyrotechnics Group. Terry Ritz, founder of the organization, and his partner Steve Aleff had created various ideas based on the tour soundtrack that was provided {{to them by the}} Wonder World Tour's personnel. They met with the tour's choreographer, band manager, and lighting designer, asking them to bring their [...] "hopes, wishes, and dreams." [...] Out of these meetings, the show was completed and a lighting crew, who monitored the stage with a four-camera monitor system when cues were executed, was selected. The pyrotechnics for the show were described as more elegant and subtle, being composed of pink flames with accentuation of silver and white glitter. Because of the extensive automation executed throughout the concert, two personnel were in charge of running it. Neville Emerton ran the automation from under the stage, and Sean Conner ran all of the flying moves from a position at the front of each venue. Meanwhile, assistant stage manager Seth Posner called cues for each concert. [...] "Normally, in a rock show you don’t need someone calling the show. In this one we had to take a more theatrical approach with someone calling cues {{every step of the way}} because there was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> at once between props and automation", explained production manager Omar Abderrahman. One of the props that required much attention on the part of Posner was a car made to resemble a tractor, designed and built by effects designer and stage manager Scott [...] "Stryker" [...] Christensen. Because it came along late in the design process, the main elevator was not built to handle the weight of the car, though it was eventually reinforced to support the weight and movement of the car. The car was also modified; it was made electric, instead of using a combustion engine, for fire-safety and changed to turn around by adjusting its turning radius to automate steering with all four wheels. In order to translate the concert tour overseas to the United Kingdom, the Wonder World Tour paired with Sound Moves, a company that was already providing minor support for the North American leg of the tour.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a review}} for Koreanfilm.org, Tom Giammarco {{considered}} it [...] "unfortunate" [...] {{that many people}} dismissed the film as [...] "simple pornography", because [...] "there is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>going</b> <b>on...</b> than gratuitous sex and nudity". However, he also stated, [...] "the film fails to pull itself into the cohesive social satire it aspired to be and must settle for being a straight-forward thriller, interesting but not gripping".|$|R

2500|$|Young {{was awarded}} the NFL Rookie of the Year honors for 2006. In spite of this, Young {{considered}} ending his career. In an article published by NFL.com Young {{was quoted as saying}} he thought about retiring from professional football after his first season stating [...] "I really thought long and hard about it. There was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with my family. It was crazy being an NFL quarterback. It wasn't fun anymore. All of the fun was out of it. All of the excitement was gone. All I was doing was worrying about things." [...] However, Young would later recant this stating he never considered quitting football and his remarks were blown out of proportion.|$|E
2500|$|Episodes two {{and three}} did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping. But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, [...] "Sadly, all the {{electric}} tension of episode one has evaporated, instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in {{for the sake of}} it. ... There's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that it's starting to feel unbelievable." [...] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew. Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two [...] "Broadchurch first truly bad hour of television." [...] He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichéd timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance [...] "lacking". The [...] "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop that makes no sense at all," [...] said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. [...] "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving." [...] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: [...] "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch always looks fabulously bucolic but tonight the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." [...] He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her [...] "once again on top form".|$|E

50|$|After {{taking up}} her parish role in Hackney, Hudson-Wilkin staged a rooftop protest {{on the church}} with her curate to {{highlight}} the need for funds to repair {{the fabric of the}} building.

2500|$|Perry {{described}} the process [...] "a very pure moment for me" [...] and continued saying, [...] " [...] where I started my creative juices. And also {{it kind of}} exudes this euphoric feeling because everybody remembers what their teenage dreams were — all the girls that were on your poster walls." [...] After she recorded the vocals, McKee pulled Luke and Martin aside and told them her idea, to which they responded, [...] "Well why didn't you {{say that in the}} first place?". The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max sitting back and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get somewhere that we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way when you were a teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand. She added, [...] "To me, this year is pretty heavy. I am going to be getting married and putting out this record, and there is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that it's nice to think of those young dreams." ...|$|E

[...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E

There was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> negativity <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the world in the early 70s and it needed a refreshing sound. The country rock sound we were creating, would be it.

5000|$|In his New York Times review, writer Ben Ratliff {{found that}} the song was the [...] "attention-getter" [...] on the album: [...] "For its first 30 seconds, she whispers over the intertwining {{patterns}} of two electric basses, played by real fingers with real hesitations and stickiness; one has the tone of an undergreased hinge. They sound close-up and untreated, punctuated by short chord stabs from an organ, which seems far away and softened by reverb. The song makes you think about distances." [...] He added that [...] "with the microphone at close range, Tamia underperforms. And that’s mildly interesting, but there’s <b>so</b> <b>much</b> else <b>going</b> <b>on</b> — layers of keyboards and vocals, buried loops of cries and shouts, the couplet “If you wanna ride these curves/ hop in your Chevy Nova.” ...|$|R
