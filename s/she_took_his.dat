5|$|The {{reader is}} forced to {{question}} {{the stability of the}} Hackee union: Chippy stays away from home long after Timmy's situation is resolved and returns to his wife only after being frightened from the tree by a bear entirely superfluous to the tale. At home, Chippy suffers with a head cold, but Mrs. Hackee's lack of expression in the illustration leaves the reader wondering how <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> abrupt return. One wonders why Mrs. Hackee did not pursue Chippy once she learned of his whereabouts from a bird. After the reader discovers Goody is the happy mother of triplets and Timmy has made the decision to keep his nuts under lock and key, he may wonder what sort of fate the future holds for the Hackees.|$|E
5|$|As Shaw grew older, his {{reputation}} as a dramatic actor grew stronger, and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style. Although his good looks diminished, reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self-assuredness in such roles as generals, priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts. In 1956, his wife Margaret Delamere died; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla. Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid-1950s with Joan Ingpen, the well-known classical music and opera talent agent who had previously represented him. The two were romantically involved, to the point that <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> surname, until Shaw's death. During the 1980s, however, Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft, the mother of the disc jockey John Peel, whom he met while performing at Ludlow Castle at Ludlow. He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four-day rotating basis to which both women consented. Although Peel got along with Shaw and said he made his mother happy, {{he said he did not}} feel comfortable with the arrangement. He felt it disrupted his mother's friendships and prospects for a more stable relationship.|$|E
25|$|Stanwyck and Taylor {{mutually}} {{decided in}} 1950 to divorce, {{and after his}} insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers. There have been many rumors regarding the cause of their divorce, but after World War II, Taylor had attempted to create a life away from Hollywood, and Stanwyck did not share that goal. Taylor had romantic affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, The Night Walker (1964). She never remarried and cited Taylor as {{the love of her}} life, according to her friend and Big Valley co-star Linda Evans. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> death in 1969 very hard, and took a long break from film and television work.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, {{far from}} being a radical or {{threatening}} manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted {{the extent to which the}} character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: [...] "'Behold!' and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> [...] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do I kiss my lord'." [...] Ayesha declares this to be the [...] "first most holy hour of completed womanhood".|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the studio albums Stars (1975), I'd Rather Believe in You (1976), Cherished and Two the Hard Way (1977), which became commercial failures, Cher {{went to the}} headquarters of Casablanca Records, in order to start recording for a new full-length record. She was hoping to record rock and roll-tinged music, though she was quickly advised by Neil Bogart to delve into disco music before recording with a genre that, according to him, she was not very good at. She was reluctant to take his advice, as she regarded disco as a [...] "superficial" [...] genre and did not believe it was [...] "serious music". However, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> advice, and started working with Bob Esty, who arranged and produced records for Donna Summer and Barbra Streisand. Esty was skeptical of Cher's decision to record disco music, although {{he changed his mind}} after he began recording with her. The first song he played her was a demo of [...] "Take Me Home", which Cher said she liked.|$|E

2500|$|At the Battle of Fort Washington, Margaret (“Captain Molly”) Corbin, {{the wife}} on an enlisted man {{in one of}} the {{companies}} of the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion, became the first American woman to be wounded on the battlefield and later the first woman to be paid a pension by the U. S. government for her service. [...] When her husband, John Corbin, was killed during the assault on Fort Tryon, a small outer redoubt of Fort Washington, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> place in the gun crew, cleaning and loading the cannon. [...] She was seriously wounded by grapeshot shortly before the Hessians overran the battery. [...] Margaret was put on the rolls of the Invalid Regiment at West Point.

2500|$|In 1948, {{her mother}} met a United States Air Force officer named Paul Beaulieu, from Quebec, Canada. The couple were married within a year. Beaulieu {{took over the}} raising of Priscilla, and was the only father she would ever know. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> surname {{and over the next}} few years she grew up quickly, helping to care for the growing family as her stepfather's Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. In her own words, she {{described}} herself during this period as [...] "a shy, pretty little girl unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years". Priscilla later recalled that she felt uncomfortable moving so often because she never knew if she could make friends for life, or even if she would fit in with the new people she met on each move.|$|E
2500|$|King's parents {{visited him}} {{in the fall and}} had suspicions about Coretta Scott after seeing how clean his {{apartment}} was. While the Kings had tea and meals with their son and Scott, Martin, Sr. turned his attention to her and insinuated that her plans of a career in music were not fitting for a Baptist minister's wife. After Coretta did not respond to his questioning of their romance being serious, Martin, Sr. asked if <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> son [...] "seriously". King's father also told her that there were many other women his son was interested in, and had [...] "a lot to offer." [...] After telling him that she had [...] "a lot to offer" [...] as well, Martin Luther King, Sr. and his wife went on to try and meet with members of Coretta's family. Once the two obtained Edythe's number from Coretta, they sat down with her and had lunch with her. During their time together, Martin Luther King, Sr. tried to ask Edythe about the relationship between her sister and his son. Edythe insisted that her sister was an excellent choice for Martin Luther King, Jr., but also felt that Coretta did not need to bargain for a husband.|$|E

2500|$|Once Io {{was given}} to Hera, she tied her to a tree and sent her servant Argus to keep Io {{separated}} from Zeus. [...] Argus was a loyal servant to Hera and he has immense strength and one hundred eyes all over his body. It {{was not possible to}} go past Argus since he never closed more than half his eyes at any time. Zeus was afraid of Hera's wrath could not personally intervene, so to save Io, he commanded Hermes to kill Argus, which he does by lulling all one hundred eyes into eternal sleep. In Ovid's interpolation, when Hera learned of Argus' death, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> eyes and placed them in the plumage of the peacock, her favorite animal, accounting for the eye pattern in its tail and making it the vainest of all animals. Hera, furious about Io being free and the death of Argus, sent a gadfly (Greek oistros, compare oestrus) to sting Io as she wandered the earth. [...] Eventually Io made it to Egypt, the Egyptians worshiped the snow-white heifer and named her the Egyptian goddess Isis. [...] Hera permitted Zeus to change Io back into her human form, under the condition that he never look at her again. [...] Io, the goddess-queen of Egypt, then bore Zeus' son as the next King.|$|E
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E
