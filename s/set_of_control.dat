The sums {{in the following sections}} are to be understood as affine combinations, the coefficients sum to 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansive}} {{movements of}} science, technology, trade, diplomacy, and the arts, {{combined with the}} historical dominance of the Greek and Latin languages {{have resulted in a}} large common vocabulary among European languages. With Interlingua, an objective procedure is used to extract and standardize the most widespread word or words for a concept found in a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> languages: English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, with German and Russian as secondary references. Words from any language are eligible for inclusion, so long as their internationality is shown by their presence in these control languages. Hence, Interlingua includes such diverse word forms as Japanese geisha and samurai, Arabic califa, Guugu Yimithirr gangurru (Interlingua: kanguru), and Finnish sauna.|$|E

2500|$|In {{computer}} aided design, computer aided manufacturing, {{and computer}} graphics, a powerful extension of B-splines is non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). NURBS are essentially B-splines in homogeneous coordinates. Like B-splines, they {{are defined by}} their order, and a knot vector, and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> points, but unlike simple B-splines, the control points each have a weight. When the weight is equal to 1, a NURBS is simply a B-spline and as such NURBS generalizes both B-splines and Bézier curves and surfaces, the primary difference being the weighting of the control points which makes NURBS curves [...] "rational".|$|E
