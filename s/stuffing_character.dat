5000|$|Augustown is a 2016 {{novel by}} Jamaican writer Kei Miller. Augustown was {{published}} in the US on May 23, 2017 by Pantheon Books. It is Miller's third novel; he is also a poet. Reviewing Augustown for The New Yorker, Laura Miller contrasts the book to [...] "the stereotype of a 'poet’s novel'—that is, it isn’t introspective, replete with long passages of description, and scant of plot. Instead, it is <b>stuffed</b> with the <b>characters</b> and stories of hardscrabble Augustown, a former hamlet on the outskirts of St. Andrew founded by slaves freed in 1838." [...] The book is based on an historical incident from 1920 in which Baptist preacher Edward Bedford told congregants he would physically fly up to heaven; instead he was committed to an insane asylum. In Miller's reimagining, however, the preacher proves able to fly and people gather in the impoverished neighborhood of Augustown to see the miracle for themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Harold [...] "Buddy" [...] William Bradley Jr., {{generally}} {{referred to}} as Buddy Bradley, is a comic book character created by Peter Bagge and the main protagonist in several of his comic books, most notably Hate and Neat <b>Stuff.</b> The <b>character</b> first appeared in Bagge's self-published Comical Funnies in 1981. In the 1990s Buddy became an iconic symbol of Seattle underground culture, with the character being associated with slackerdom and the grunge movement, something which his creator sees as fairly unintentional on his part. Bagge created Buddy as a fairly unlikeable character as a commentary on shallow hipster culture, but the character was immensely popular, with members of Generation X strongly identifying with Buddy and his problems. In this way {{he may have been}} seen as an antihero and archetype of 1990s underground culture. Bagge had the character enact storylines based on events from his past, such as his family life, adolescence and his move to Seattle in the 1980s. Buddy is a disaffected adolescent who is a self-proclaimed outsider. He is directionless and unmotivated, drifting through life without goals and commonly has a cynical attitude to almost everything. By his twenties he has not changed much, although he is rather more comfortable in his hipster persona, fitting into the Seattle grunge scene and listening to obscure rock music as proof of his hip credentials. He has a brittle personality and is quick to anger, often becoming violent and getting into fights, be it with his family, friends, spouses or rivals. He has a ruthless and selfish streak which he uses to his advantage in his business dealings as a music promoter, memorabilia salesman and junkyard dealer.|$|R
5000|$|Olli is {{a cartoon}} <b>character</b> and a <b>stuffed</b> toy.

Olli {{was one of many}} characters used on the packages and posters of the bottled water brand and John's Phone. Olli was launched on a party of MTV In Rotterdam in 2004. In 2013 Olli was again part of a campaign. This time to save the Rotterdam Zoo Diergaarde Blijdorp. Olli is part of the Ollimania family which is the company that created and owns all characters.

5000|$|There {{are also}} further {{cognates}} used {{in connection with}} folkloristics. Folklorism refers to [...] "material or stylistic elements of folklore presented in a context which is foreign to the original tradition." [...] This definition, offered by the folklorist Hermann Bausinger, does not discount the validity of meaning expressed in these [...] "second hand" [...] traditions. Many Walt Disney films and products belong in this category of folklorism; the fairy tales, originally told around a winter fire, have become animated film <b>characters,</b> <b>stuffed</b> animals and bed linens. Their meaning, however {{far removed from the}} original story telling tradition, does not detract from the importance and meaning they have for their young audience. Fakelore refers to artifacts which might be termed pseudo-folklore; these are manufactured items claiming to be traditional. The folklorist Richard Dorson coined this word, clarifying it in his book [...] "Folklore and Fakelore". Current thinking within the discipline is that this term places undue emphasis on the origination of the artifact as a sign of authenticity of the tradition. The adjective folkloric is used to designate materials having the character of folklore or tradition, at the same time making no claim to authenticity.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} the phenomenon of Tijl Uilenspiegel character {{in the context of}} the Flemish literature after 1867. The thesis focuses on the comparison of two pieces of work of the Flemish literature - the novel De legende van Tijl Uilenspiegel by Charles De Coster of 1867 and its adaptation into a play by Hugo Claus with the emphasis on analysis of the influence of the Flemish Movement on the message of the work. The first chapter describes the medieval <b>stuff</b> around the <b>character</b> Tijl Uilenspiegel and brings an overview of important adaptation of this theme between 1967 and 1965. A two lever analysis of the novel is followed by chapters which are focused on the description of the social and political factors of the Flemish Movement in the 19 th century and in the first half of the twentieth century. These are a literary text analysis and an analysis of the occurrence of the references to the Flemish nationalism. These two levels of the novel are later compared with the play of Hugo Claus. The literary analysis includes the analysis of the plot, narrative mode, time, place and motives of the novel. The reference occurrence analysis is divided into two groups - direct references (occurrence of the word Flanders and all the variations of this word) and indirect references [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A chegada ao poder dos partidos ditos progressistas na região, a partir do ano 2003, trouxe consigo uma série de medidas que visavam o relançamento do Mercosul. O bloco passara pela sua pior crise no início do século, evidenciando que a supremacia do escopo econômicofinanceiro na integração era um elo fraco. A falta de legitimidade desse processo frente aos seus cidadãos fez com que parte das novas decisões tomadas pelo do bloco estivessem voltadas para um caráter social. Tendo esse quadro em mente, este trabalho propõe-se a analisar particularmente duas dessas medidas: o Fundo de Convergência Estrutural (FOCEM) e a Iniciativa Somos Mercosul. Temos como objetivo averiguar de que forma essas construções contribuem para o aprofundamento da dimensão social do bloco. Para tal, vamos utilizar {{bibliografia}} especializada e estudo sobre as principais Decisões e documentos relacionados aos objetos da pesquisa.
