5000|$|Plymouth {{claimed that}} the tailfins were not fins, but [...] "stabilizers" [...] to place the [...] "center of pressure" [...] as far to the rear as {{possible}} and thus [...] "reduce by 20% the needs for <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> in a cross wind", while Mercedes-Benz called its own tailfins “Peilstege” or “sight lines,” which ostensibly aided in backing up.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} {{of the new system}} is the increased level of wheel speed control afforded by the 3-phase control cycle, which now operates at 18 MHz (up from 12 MHz) and has increased ROM capacity (32kB up from 12kB). Under driving conditions, the result is around 50 percent less yaw moment (oversteer/understeer attitude) when one side of the vehicle is braking on ice and the other is on asphalt. One-third the amount of <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> is needed under these conditions.|$|E
50|$|In {{aerospace}} engineering, {{especially those}} areas dealing with spacecraft, the eigenvector slew {{is a method}} to calculate a <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> (called a slew) by rotating the spacecraft around one fixed axis, or a gimbal. This corresponds in general to the fastest and {{most efficient way to}} reach the desired target orientation as there is only one acceleration phase and one braking phase for the angular rate. If this fixed axis is not a principal axis a time varying torque must be applied to force the spacecraft to rotate as desired, though. Also the gyroscopic effect of momentum wheels must be compensated for.|$|E
50|$|The missile is steered {{in flight}} by command {{signals from the}} {{launcher}} transmitted over a guidance wire spooled out behind the missile. A xenon lamp on {{the rear of the}} missile allows the NEC manufactured launcher sight unit to compute an offset between the missile position and line of sight to the target, and calculate <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> based on this offset.|$|R
50|$|In 1892 chain boats using Zeuner water {{turbines}} {{were introduced}} on the Elbe. They were a precursor of the present-day hydrojet propulsion systems. In addition to faster downstream travel times, the auxiliary engine also enabled <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> during chain operations and simplified turning manoeuvres. Water turbines were used on several chain boats on the Elbe {{and on the}} Bavarian chain boats on the Main.|$|R
5000|$|While being {{commended for}} its {{acceleration}} and build-quality, Modern Motor criticised the 1978 528i was for unpredictable handling and excessive body roll. <b>Steering</b> <b>corrections</b> during cornering meant the car's body [...] "lurches back annoyingly and messily", {{in part due}} to the soft springing and hard damping combination. In comparison to the Jaguar XJ3.6 and Peugeot 604, the car was viewed as narrow and cramped in the rear and prone to wind noise.|$|R
50|$|The {{operator}} {{tracks the}} target using the sight mechanism, then launches the missile using the front trigger. Once the missile is in flight, he steers the missile into {{his line of}} sight using the thumb joystick. The missile's auto pilot uses a gyroscope to maintain a straight flightpath directly away from the launch point, compensating for any wind buffeting. When the operator moves the joystick, the missile applies a <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> in the appropriate direction, once the joystick is released the opposite correction is applied automatically, keeping the missile travelling directly away from the launch point. Vigilant {{has a reputation for}} ease of control and high success with minimal operator training. This was largely due to the 'velocity control' method of Vigilant, relying on gyroscopes, rather than the simpler 'acceleration control' of competing missiles such as Entac or SS.11.|$|E
5000|$|The latest mini-z chassis {{released}} {{at the end}} of October 2009 was the MR03 chassis. The most noticeable change is using dynamic strut front suspension instead of sliding knuckle. It uses a small coreless servo motor instead of the brushed servo motor for steering. Small servo motor allows the batteries to be closer to the centerline of the car for lower polar moment if inertia. The modified ASF receiver board comes with a reverse delay of exactly [...]01 second, which for all practical purposes is instant. The reverse delay can be programmed back in using the optional computer interface cable. The MR-03, like the dNaNo, has an optional gyro that can be installed on the car. The gyro senses when the car is about the spin out. It corrects by reducing power to the motor or by correcting steering. The amount of throttle and <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> from the gyro can be programmed via the ASF connector. The front end of the car has interchangeable parts to allow use of both narrow and wide AutoScale bodies. The rear end of the car uses a different t-plate design but the motor pod mounting holes are the same. This allows motor mounts from the previous generation MR-02 and MR-015 cars to work on an MR-03. The MR-03 chassis works with all currently available Kyosho Mini-Z bodies.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002 Robert Chicken {{patented}} a {{sheet to}} tiller {{system in the}} UK, known as The Steersman. It consists of two swinging platforms fitted on to the cockpit coamings {{either side of the}} boat,. The normal jib sheet winches are moved from their normal position and then re-bolted down on to the top of these platforms.With the sails set, the leeward jib sheet is cleated to the winch in the normal way, and the wind pressure in the jib, transmitted through the jib sheet, swings the platform forward. To balance this movement, a shock cord spring tensioned between the platform and a point at the stern of the boat, keeps the platform in a central neutral position. Once set, any slight changes in wind strength or direction, causes the platform to swing forwards or backwards. A simple linkage then transmits this movement to the helm to keep the boat on course.The pressure in the sails can vary hugely depending on the wind strength and the direction that the boat is travelling relative to the wind. To accommodate this, the spring is arranged in a ‘block-and-tackle’ form with a double block fitted to the stern of the boat, and a single block clipped to the platform. The fixed end, and tail end are also attached to the platform; the fixed end is clipped, and the tail end passes through a jamb cleat for fine adjustment. With this in place, the maximum spring tension is now made up of four lengths of shock cord. For a lower wind pressure in the jib, the fixed end, and the single block can be re-clipped to an attachment point on the base of the platform. This then gives a range of spring strengths from one to four shock cord lengths. For very light wind pressures, a single lighter length of shock cord is used instead.The claimed benefit of this design over a windvane system that it [...] "is far more sensitive because it uses the larger jib area to sense any changes in the wind" [...] is questionable. When the jib is in laminar flow, i.e. optimally trimmed and delivers maximum propulsion, the force at the sheet is biggest and decreases to both sides of course deviation from this optimum. Concluding from that, the ship must be sailed with sub-optimal sail trim in order to have the proper <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> at the tiller. Its position in the cockpit area however leaves the stern of the boat clear for other purposes such as dinghy davits, stern ladders etc. In 2012, the invention won the Haven Academy Award in the UK. The chairman of the judging committee was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to complete a circumnavigation non-stop, single handed.|$|E
50|$|Driving {{a padded}} v-hull takes {{practice}} and patience. At speed the hull is riding {{on a small}} area {{roughly the size of}} a paper towel. It is a balancing act to keep the hull on the pad and it requires small steering inputs from the driver to keep the hull flying level. Padded v-hulls will want to chine-walk if no <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> are used. Chine-walk is when the boat rocks side to side on the rear portion of the hull. As speeds increase, chine walk becomes more of a factor and can become violent and dangerous if the driver does not know how to compensate for it.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} and {{fundamental}} property of steering is demonstrated: It is shown that <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> generally follow bell-shaped proﬁles of steering rate. The ﬁnding is {{strongly related to}} what is already known about reaching movements. Also, a strong linear relationship {{was found between the}} maximum steering wheel rate and the steering wheel deﬂection, something that indicates a constant movement time for the correction. Furthermore, by closer examination of those corrections that cannot be described by a single bell-shaped rate proﬁle, it was found that they typically can be described using two or, in some cases three or four, overlapping proﬁles, something which relates to superposition of motor primitives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{effectiveness}} of closed-loop brake control to reduce vehicle off-tracking arising from overspeeding in curves. When a driver enters a curve too fast given the available friction, {{the aim is to}} use electronic brake control to reduce speed and increase path curvature to complete the turn. Previously it has been found that coordinated four wheel braking referenced to an inertially fixed vehicle mass center acceleration (PPR) is an optimal control strategy. The present work introduces the effect of driver-vehicle interaction, using simulation and track experiments. It is confirmed that PPR effectiveness is not disrupted by typical <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> from the driver.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to examine how driver {{behavior}} is influenced by the reliability of an in-vehicle warning system under naturalistic driving conditions. Driver responses to lateral drift warnings were examined to determine if the latency to initiate a corrective steering response was related to prior system reliability. An operational definition of subjective reliability was developed based on measures of the proportion of lateral drift warnings that the drivers responded to in the 24 -hour period preceding a warning event that elicited a <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> (called the day proportion). Age, gender, weather condition, light level, road class, and day proportion were used to model response latency to make a <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> in a linear model. A main effect of day proportion was found, suggesting that reaction time to respond decreases by about 300 msecs as the day proportion increases from 0 to 1. The study illustrates a method of quantifying subjective reliability and performance using naturalistic data. The results suggest that latency to make a <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> is inversely related to the perceived reliability of the warning system in the 24 hours preceding the warning...|$|E

By measuring the position of a beam, which has just passed the IP and compare in it the position of a first pilot bunch-which does not have a partner in the opposing beam-with that of the following bunches in the same bunch train, the opposing beam can be steered with ultra fast kicker magnets for optimum collision at the IP.

40|$|The CEBAF {{accelerator}} requires accurate phasing of the 338 superconducting cavities {{to achieve}} the design rms energy spread of 2. 5 X 10 {sup {minus} 5 }. The rms phase error along each linac, with 160 cavities over a length of 200 m, may not exceed 2. 6 degrees, assuming that the whole linac is operated on crest. The common procedure is to maximize the energy gain with a spectrometer. At CEBAF, however, phase-dependent cavity steering effects cause deflections of the beam of several mrad, requiring <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> in the linac, which makes this method very time consuming.

40|$|Drivers’ {{expectations}} {{influence their}} responses to events in complex ways. In particular, covert and sustained hazards, like crosswinds, might require complex vehicle control adaptations. We investigated differences between drivers’ lateral responses in unexpected and expected (repeated) crosswind events using probabilistic topic modeling. First, each driver’s event-based steering wheel movements (angle and rate, 5 Hz) were transformed into symbolic words. Then, probabilistic topic modeling was used to discover patterns in the steering wheel movement data across the event conditions. Results indicate that drivers may make fewer abrupt steering wheel movements when they encounter unexpected crosswinds. On the contrary, drivers {{are more likely to}} make continuous faster <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> to compensate crosswinds when they are expected. The topic models also classify unexpected and expected crosswind events better than traditional models that use single aggregated values across events (maximum steering wheel angle and rate). These preliminary insights show an advantage for granular, time-series based analysis of driving data, and suggest a viable machinelearning based technique to conduct such investigations...|$|R

This paper proposes the modelling and analysis of a hydrostatic steering system for an agricultural tractor to calculate the performance of the system and determine the influence of its main design parameters. The focus here is on the driver’s steering feel, which can improve the driver’s behavior reducing unnecessary <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> during the working conditions. The hydrostatic steering system is quite complex and involves a hydraulic circuit and a mechanical mechanism to transmit the steering to the vehicle tires.

40|$|This thesis {{challenges}} the traditional view of treating steering behaviour as a tracking task, instead treating it as a reaching task. Here, reaching {{refers to a}} fundamental human behaviour with the the intriguing characteristic of having a linear relationship between maximum speed and distance, effectively making the movement time constant. Historically, by contrast, human steering behaviour has been modelled as tracking, since {{it was assumed that}} drivers follow the road by applying continuous error-minimising control. Early on, it was found that linear control could to some extent represent human steering behaviour, but with a consistent non-linear error referred to as the remnant. Using instead the framework of reaching, as in this thesis, one can better explain even the non-linear parts of steering behaviour. In the analysis of data collected within the work presented here, it was found that up to 70 % of all steering behaviour can be modelled as individual reaching movements or, in the case of driving, <b>steering</b> <b>corrections.</b> It was furthermore shown that, by allowing the superposition of two such <b>corrections,</b> nearly all <b>steering</b> behaviour can be modelled...|$|R

The purpose of the chicane is to provide a fixed angular separation between two successive EPU photon fans, and to correct steering perturbations resulting from EPU polarization state changes.

30|$|Several {{attempts}} have been already undertaken {{in the past in}} order to reduce uncertainties in fluid flow measurements through an optical distortion [27] and even a fluctuating water surface [28]. In latter case a beam <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> for a 0 D measurement volume was accomplished. An interference pattern was optimized within the focal region in order to reduce measurement uncertainty. Smooth surface water waves are correctable due to their moderate wave height (200  μm) and frequency (300  Hz) that are within reach of the available actuator amplitudes and frequency range. Our findings indicate that water surface waves can become correctable with low order Zernike modes for the improvement of PIV measurements through fluctuating air-liquid interfaces. An important problem that has to be solved is reduction of the time budget in the correction system. A personal computer based operating system is not real-time capable. Therefore a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) could be of advantage in terms of image acquisition and metric calculation time.|$|E

To get the optimal parameters of the membership functions of the fuzzy control system, we {{have built a}} genetic algorithm application that runs our simulator thousands of times, minimizing the effort made on steering, and maintaining an acceptable path error. We have used a high mutant rate genetic algorithm (that we call radioactive environment evolution) with a fitness function having two objectives. The results are impressive: the steering efforts when the vehicle is entering the bend are drastically reduced and the <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> efforts inside the bends have disappeared. Although we have achieved such good results, {{it is important to}} remember that they are simulator based. We are now testing this control on real autonomous cars with relatively good results. However, we hope to achieve better real results as we improve our simulation program. I...|$|E
40|$|As a great {{portion of}} fatal {{accidents}} {{is caused by}} road departures, numerous systems for lateral control have been developed.

A system based on reflexes has the potential of eliciting reactions reliably and quickly. In a simulator study, the principle was examined and different adjustments of the stimulus used to elicit target behaviour were tested. Subjective and objective data were collected. Results show that the participants trusted the system and perceived it as a valuable contribution to traffic safety. Objective data, like steering angle and measures of lateral position, were analysed and three different types of elicited reactions could be identified.

A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is used to discipline the oscillator. The PID controller obtains real-time common-view GPS measurements from the Internet at 10 -minute intervals, and provides <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> to a rubidium oscillator through a serial interface. In principle, the rubidium oscillator can be locked to any time scale that makes real-time common-view data available.

40|$|The {{problem of}} reentry {{guidance}} for an atmospheric entry vehicle {{is taken up}} for the study with focus {{on the evolution of}} a guidance strategy, which satisfies both terminal and path constraints. For this purpose, the numerical predictor-corrector approach is adopted, and an algorithm, based on real-time trajectory planning, is presented. The proposed guidance algorithm generates a feasible trajectory at each guidance cycle during the reentry flight, which {{is a function of the}} reference trajectory generated at the previous cycle and the measured parameter dispersions. The predictor steering program includes the bank reversal philosophy, and the corrector algorithm is formulated based on two control parameters and two terminal constraints. The path constraints on heat rate, aerodynamic load, and dynamic pressure are implemented as part of the predictor-corrector algorithm, by designing a control law for following the allowable drag and drag rate profiles. This control law is implemented through <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> in each predictor step, which ensures that each predicted trajectory satisfies the path constraints. The performance results for nominal and dispersed cases show that the algorithm steers a typical entry vehicle along a feasible 3 -D trajectory, which satisfies both terminal and path constraints...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{presented}} {{study was}} to explore how simulator motion cueing affects the driver’s control performance of a car. We looked at steering behavior as a measure of control performance. The experimental task was a slalom maneuver where the car velocity was limited to 70 km/h. Subjective and objective variables were measured. This paper describes the objective steering behavior. The slalom task was driven in four conditions: a lateral motion scale factor of 1 (one-to-one lateral motion), 0. 7, 0. 4 and 0 (no-motion), respectively. In total 16 participants completed the experiment. The study showed that the motion condition affects the steering-wheel behavior. The general tendency is that less <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> took place when the magnitude of the motion cues was increased, which was quantified by two performance indicators. Firstly, the number of steering wheel reversals reduced when the motion-cue magnitude was increased. Secondly, the amount of relative high-frequency correction was reduced with increasing motion cue magnitude. It is concluded that motion feedback can improve the driver’s control performance in an extreme scenario like a slalom maneuver...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Driver {{steering}} control performance varies with {{time during the}} vehicle driving course. A serial vehicle steering assist controller {{is designed to provide}} <b>steering</b> <b>correction</b> that can compensate the difference between the current driver and an “idealized ” driver model. Using variable structure model reference adaptive control, a robust adaptive controller for lane keeping assist is developed. To reduce the complexity in control computations, a simplified version of the robust adaptive steering assist controller is also developed. Due to the significant variations in human driver behaviour, the stability of the compensated system is not guaranteed and conflict between the driver and the steering assist controller exist. A model predictive control based driver model and a dual-loop structure driver model are employed to represent the variations in driver intention, and the conflict between the controller and the driver is observed from computer simulations. A simple decision making algorithm is implemented and the conflict situations are successfully avoided for different driver behaviour modes and driving scenarios. Future work of this research will focus on implementing the designed controller on a driving simulator and experiments with human drivers on the driving simulator.

The simulation results in terms of yaw and lateral motions were observed, and the proposed control strategy was shown to successfully improve the directional mobility of the armoured vehicle after firing.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Many of the {{published}} driver models concentrate on algorithms which achieve accurate path following {{at the expense}} of realistic replication of the driving task itself. In this paper we consider only the most basic driving responses, to achieve a simple yet surprisingly realistic driver model. Lateral control is based on <b>steering</b> <b>corrections</b> aimed at projecting the vehicle onto a path at a single preview point on the road ahead. Only the preview time and a single proportional gain are required parameters, supported by a basic approximation of understeer gradient which becomes proressively more important as desired lateral acceleration increases. The longitudinal model regulates speed solely in proportion to an estimate of the length of road the driver can see ahead. Both aspects of the model are executed in a computationally efficient way, using the simplest possible definition of a track. The model is tested for robustness in simulation, and it gives intuitively sensible responses. Results are then given in comparison to vehicle tests, with the longitudinal parameters tuned to match the measured driving behaviour of two test subjects, while nominal lateral parameters are shown to be effective. Finally, the model is also shown to be capable of reasonable, if approximate prediction of speed variations for the same test drivers on an independent section of road...|$|R
