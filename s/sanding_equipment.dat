Research approach is concentrated also on the specific characteristics of the Romanian capital market (especially in terms of illiquidity and lack of transparency additional costs), macroeconomic environment and corporate finance decision process. We compute default point from the perspective of the arbitrage between assets and leverage; in accordance with the most recent theories on specific features corporate default within emerging countries (Galytskyy, 2006), a key element will be represented by the assets volatility which will be correlated with the country risk premium in order to highlight out a potential macroeconomic impact on corporate failure.

500|$|The first {{locomotives}} were 2-4-0 tender engines, {{built by}} Wm Fairbairn in Manchester {{to the design}} of the locomotive superintendent Daniel Kinnear Clark. Twelve were ordered for the opening of the first line, seven passenger and five goods. They were all fitted with Clark's patent smoke preventing system that improved fuel economy and painted green with black borders, and red buffer beams. There was no protection for the driver or fireman and braking was by wooden blocks on the four wheels of the tender. The railway opened with only five locomotives, and within days one had been seriously damaged in the collision at [...] and a second had a mechanical fault. Two more locomotives had arrived by the end of 1854, and the order was complete by summer 1855. Four more passenger locomotives were ordered in 1857, weatherboards and <b>sanding</b> <b>equipment</b> had been fitted by 1860, and cabs added in the 1880s. John Folds Ruthven replaced Clark in 1855 and an order was placed with Beyer, Peacock & Co. for two 0-4-0 tank engines to bank trains on the line to Waterloo near Aberdeen harbour. After William Cowan became locomotive superintendent nine more locomotives arrived in 1859–61. These were followed by nine 4-4-0s, also built by R. Stephenson & Co., and delivered between 1862 and 1864. Six more powerful 4-4-0 locomotives arrived from Neilsons in 1866, and were fitted with a more modern bogie. Three passed to the London and North Eastern Railway after the 1923 Grouping, and No. 45 hauled a train at the Railway Centenary celebrations in 1925 before being scrapped.|$|E

50|$|Trouble-free {{locomotive}} running {{requires that}} there is sufficient traction between wheel and rail. Steam engines therefore had sandboxes (usually two, {{on top of the}} boiler). These were filled with the help of <b>sanding</b> <b>equipment.</b> For sanding there was either a sanding system with an elevated bunker or a sanding tower. The special sand was kept in its own store. On a sanding tower a telescopic pipe was hooked up to the sandbox, the lock released and the locomotive sandbox filled as required.

The first new locomotives to be built postwar were seven of a batch of ten K class 2-6-0s, the first being finished in December 1920.

40|$|The African Regional Centre for Engineering Design and Manufacture (ARCEDEM) {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1980 {{in response to the}} urgent need for Africa to feed its population effectively. Those who established the Centre believed that increases in agricultural production would demand the continued use of better tools and equipment to till the soil and to process the crop. The Centre is located at Ibadan, Nigeria. The need to rationalize research, planning and implementation programmes for the effective use of agricultural machinery and equipment for intensive agriculture led to the setting up of ARCEDEM. African nations faced difficulties in achieving this objective on their own. ARCEDEM benefits from inter-regional cooperation with and assistance from, developed countries. The Centre was setup in order to design, develop and adapt machinery; to develop prototypes; to manufacture machine <b>sand</b> <b>equipment</b> and to help market them in member states (Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Comoros, Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Zaire and Zambia). Its mandate was to train engineers in design, manufacture and maintenance; to cooperate with national and international centres; and to offer and promote engineering consultancy services especially for the development of plant and factories. One of its achievements has been to establish a regional technical network through which African countries share information on the development and procurement of machinery.

50|$|The KB {{class were}} {{technically}} {{very similar to}} the KA class, but were distinguished by the inclusion of a booster on the rear axle of the trailing bogie and Nicholson thermic syphons in the firebox. The use of the booster, first proposed for the K class in 1932, was mainly due to steeper gradients and heavy freight trains on the Midland Line, especially Cass bank. Additional piping and <b>sanding</b> <b>equipment</b> for the booster gave the KB a slightly different appearance to the KA. The booster was intended solely for use at low speed, and some class members ultimately had the booster removed due to problems such as jamming in gear, reducing the locomotive's top speed.|$|E

The engine was fitted with a governor preventing overspeed, and electric overload protection. An 80-volt battery was used to energise the {{main generator}}, as well powering the electric control system and lights, and was also used to start the engine with the generator in motor mode; the battery was automatically charged when the engine was idling. An air compressor was powered via a belt drive from the generator via a belt drive; compressed air-operated Westinghouse double-wheel tread brakes, as well as <b>sanding</b> <b>equipment</b> and the whistle.|$|E
50|$|On this {{occasion}} {{the train was}} not assisted, because the coaches had been propelled, rather than hauled, into the platform, {{and so there was}} no locomotive at the rear as was the usual arrangement. The train left platform 5 at King's Cross station five minutes late, and entered Gasworks Tunnel. When it reached the rising gradient {{at the far end of}} the tunnel the locomotive began to slip badly on a section of newly replaced rail. In the absence of an assisting locomotive and with its own <b>sanding</b> <b>equipment</b> not working fully, no. 2512 was unable to grip the rail and eventually came to a stand. Preoccupied with his tasks at the controls and operating in darkness the driver didn't notice when the train slowed to a stop, and then began to run backwards.|$|E
40|$|A mobile thermal {{foundry sand}} {{reclamation}} unit {{was designed and}} constructed. This unit consisted of thermal and mechanical <b>sand</b> reclamation <b>equipment</b> installed on the bed of a 50 foot low-boy trailer.

This allowed participating foundries to have their own refuse sand (10 - 100 tons) processed and then reused in production for evaluation. The purpose for building the unit was to demonstrate to foundries through ``hands on`` experience that refuse sands can be reclaimed and successfully reused particularly in regard to product quality. Most of the participating foundries indicated a high level of satisfaction with the reclaimed sand. Laboratory testing of samples of the used sand, before and after processing by the demonstration unit, verified the usability of the reclaimed sand. One of the foundries participating was a brass foundry, the sand from this foundry contained lead and is classified as a hazardous material. After reclamation the sand was no longer hazardous and could also be reused in the foundry...|$|R
