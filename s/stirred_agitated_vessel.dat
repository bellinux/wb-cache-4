Most of the currently employed industrial <b>agitated</b> <b>vessels</b> have baffles in them because they are considered to provide better mixing thereby leading to uniform solids suspension and higher mass transfer rate.

The critical impeller speed Njs required to &lsquo;just suspend&rsquo; the solids off the tank bottom was determined by measuring the sedimentation bed height (HB) visually and defining the impeller speed at which HB becomes zero as Njs. The changes in the conductivity values of water due to the dissolution of benzoic acid from solid surface were measured as a function of time and used in determining the volumetric solid-liquid mass transfer coefficient kSLap. Experimental results show that, regardless of Cv used, kSLap increases with the impeller speed gradually up to Njs and remains more or less constant beyond that. It has been also found that kSLap increases rapidly with an increase in Cv from 3 to 10 % (v/v) and remains more or less constant beyond that, regardless of the active particle concentration used. It was interesting to note that kSLap values increases for solids with higher active particle mass fraction for all Cv used. These results suggest that higher values of kSLap can be achieved in <b>agitated</b> <b>vessels</b> by operating them at higher total solids loadings with higher active particle concentration than hitherto thought.

For the description of behaviour of polymers in the process of dissolution a phenomenological model, determining the value of the mutual diffusion coefficient of polymer and solvent depending on the dissolution rate and thickness of the swelling boundary layer in static solvent, is used. The experimental part of work includes determination of the main control mechanism of dissolution of polymeric particles in <b>agitated</b> <b>vessel</b> with baffles and a high speed stirrer placed in the vessel axix. For the six pitched-blade stirrer CSV 691020 and tooth stirrer CSV 691038 a dependance of a mass-transfer coefficient on stirrer speed, particles diameter and concentration of solution is determined. Verification of modelling conditions is based on experiments with two different diameters of vessel, D= 0, 15 and 0, 3 m. Universality for the amorphous polymers is verified experimentally with two polymeric materials, polystyrene and polyvinylchloride dissolved in the thermodynamically suitable solvents. Forms of dependence of the mass-transfer coefficient on parameters, obtained in the experimental part of the thesis, corresponds with the form for dissolution of micromolecular materials, for both turbulent and non-turbulent region. Experimental data are thus interpreted in the form of dimensionless criterial equations determining the mass-transfer coefficient value. The equations obtained in this way can be used for universal description of dissolution of the polymeric articles in the vessels with high speed stirrers.

The increase in mass transfer coefficient with an increase of solid concentrations is mainly due to the increase in N-js (critical impeller speed) with increasing solids concentration, thereby leading to an upsurge of turbulence around the particles. The solids concentration at which the highest mass transfer coefficient is obtained is designated as the effective solids concentration.

40|$|Solid-liquid <b>agitated</b> <b>vessels</b> {{are widely}} used in the mineral process {{industry}} {{where there is a}} strong demand to intensify existing vessels to process more ore. It has been shown that process intensification can be achieved by increasing solids throughput or by optimising process equipment and conditions. This can be achieved by operating a taller/larger <b>agitated</b> <b>vessel</b> fitted with multiple impellers or by increasing the extraction yield via cavitation. These methods, however, require the addition of extra energy. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to determine the optimum vessel/mixer design and operating condition that will ensure high impeller energy efficiency, increased rates of solid-liquid mass transfer, and high sonochemical reaction yields. Impeller power consumption and mass transfer experiments were carried out in 0. 2 m diameter (T) cylindrical tanks with liquid height (H) fixed at H=T and H= 1. 5 T for all single- and dual-impeller systems, respectively, to study solids suspension, dispersion, and mass transfer coefficient (kSL). Aqueous NaOH and cationic exchange resins were used as the liquid and solid phases, respectively. Experiments studying the effect of solids concentration, particle type and particle size on cavitation activity were carried out in the 0. 2 m <b>agitated</b> <b>vessel</b> irradiated with ultrasound and fitted with an A 310 impeller. Cation exchange resins, sand, and glass spherical beads of different sizes were used as the solid phases and aqueous potassium iodide (KI) as the liquid phase. Experiments investigating mass transfer enhancement with cavitation were carried out in the 0. 2 m <b>agitated</b> <b>vessel</b> irradiated with ultrasound and fitted with a Rushton turbine. Aqueous NaOH and cation exchange resin were used in the &lsquo;ion exchange&rsquo; system whereas polymeric resin saturated with phenol and water were used in the &lsquo;desorption&rsquo; system. Experimental results show that the Zwietering correlation can be reliably applied to all mixing systems used in this study. It was found that by operating the system at a volumetric solids concentration (CV) at 0. 2 (v/v), the specific power consumption is minimised while simultaneously achieving maximum kSL values. Particle dispersion was found to generally increase with increasing CV. The removal of baffles was shown to decrease impeller power requirements for solids suspension and dispersion, but however, its influence on kSL was dependent on impeller type and vessel geometry. Overall, improved energy efficiency and increased solids throughput can be achieved using radial flow impellers under unbaffled conditions at relatively higher CV. Using experimental data, mathematical correlations to estimate impeller power consumption and kSL were derived and estimated values were found to fit experimental data within a &plusmn; 15 % band. It was found experimentally that cavitation activity decreases with increasing solids concentration up to 0. 1 (v/v) but increases thereafter up to 0. 4 (v/v) followed by a further decrease. Cavitation activity increases with increasing particle diameter and surface roughness {{plays an important role in}} enhancing sonochemical yields. Experimental results suggest that ultrasonic irradiation had no effect on solid-liquid mass transfer rates in the ion exchange system. However, the rate of phenol desorption into water from polymeric resin increased in the presence of ultrasound. The enhancement of mass transfer due to ultrasound was the greatest at CV = 0. 1 and 0. 15 (v/v). This suggests that increased solid-liquid mass transfer in the presence of ultrasound is dependent on the physical properties of the solid and liquid phases as well as CV.

40|$|Stirred vessels with {{draught tube}} {{are often used}} as crystallizers, bioreactors, for mixing of highly viscous liquids and in {{minerals}} processing industry. The flow regime often varies from laminar to full turbulent. One {{of the most fundamental}} needs for the analysis of processes in <b>agitated</b> <b>vessels</b> is knowledge of the flow structure in such vessels. The objective of this work is to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} flow field produced by an impeller running in a draught tube at different Reynolds numbersAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
