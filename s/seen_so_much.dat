500|$|Davis {{was pleased}} with the episode; he stated [...] "For me the episode was terrific to play because they ended up making the Cigarette Smoking Man {{somewhat}} tougher. We have <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> softness in him; it was great to play that tough side." [...] He described the scene in which he was strapped to an operating table with Mulder as [...] "totally uncomfortable". He joked that [...] "the only upside of that was that the author [...] was lying right beside me, feeling equally uncomfortable. I wonder if David would have written it that way if he had known what he would have to go through." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have {{been through so much}} in my life and I've <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> And you cure me every time with your love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix you with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Tapping {{found it}} a {{challenge}} to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; [...] "after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable – Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and {{it was sort of}} finding that because Carter always looks on the bright side and Helen has been around so long, and has <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the evil in human society if you will." [...] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a [...] "very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness." [...] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.|$|E

500|$|Sometimes Levin {{wrote about}} frivolous, even farcical matters, {{such as a}} series of mock-indignant {{articles}} about the sex-lives of mosquitoes. At other times he wrote about matters of grave moral importance, unfailingly denouncing authoritarian regimes whether of the left or the right. He observed, [...] "I am barred by the governments concerned from entering the Soviet Union and the lands of her empire {{on the one hand and}} South Africa on the other. These decrees constitute a pair of campaign medals that I wear with considerable pleasure and I have a profound suspicion of those who rebuke me for partisanship while wearing only one". He wrote regularly about the arts. Music was a recurrent theme; he was notorious for his addiction to Wagner, and other favourite composers included Schubert and Mozart. He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. He turned less regularly to the visual arts, but when he did his views were clear-cut and trenchantly expressed. He wrote of a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in 1984, [...] "Never, in all my life, not even at the exclusively Millais exhibition in 1967, have I <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sickening rubbish in one place at one time". His knowledge and love of literature were reflected in many of his writings; among his best-known pieces is a long paragraph about the influence of Shakespeare on everyday discourse. It begins: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{well-known}} Austrian pacifist Bertha Von Suttner recalls in her memoires {{the great}} impression of meeting, on that occasion, [...] "the old warrior, General Türr" [...] (he was seventy {{one at the}} time) and hearing from him that [...] "he had <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of war that he came to throughly detest it".|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Caryll {{looked him}} over with an amused eye, and laughed. [...] "It distresses me," [...] said he, [...] "to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> good thought wasted." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{liked to}} feel her hearty indignation flash {{out on me}} in that way. We <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> malice and <b>so</b> little indignation in my profession.|$|R
2500|$|In this {{business}} I am {{very easy to}} cubby hole. As someone said to me the other day—they had seen the HBO special—and they said, [...] "Are you really a sad obsessed person?" [...] And I thought, No, I'm not really a sad person, except when I lie awake at night in winter thinking about all the animals out without shelter, and then I'm sad! Who wouldn't be? Wouldn't anybody be sad {{if they have a}} heart? It's just that I've <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, at the {{beginning}} of the season. We did not <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of him afterwards. I don't think he is so little changed as you do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were rare}} stuck {{on it at}} one time, weren't you? I always thought it funny like how you could <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in another man's child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{an autumn}} in ourselves," [...] he answered, [...] "just {{as much as}} there is in Nature. I won't <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of that down there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The best {{coming home}} I ever had, {{and the most}} surprising. I have <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that is unexpected, that I don't know how to realize it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|The Duchess {{had a fine}} contemplative pause—evidently {{with more}} to say. She made, in the quantity, her next selection. “Lambeth says he has <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of you.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she said, [...] "it {{will be just}} as {{well for}} her not to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of June. She's such a decided character, dear June!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{never talk}} with you five minutes--I do not know why--without feeling wiser and happier. I envy Valencia for having <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of you of late." ...|$|E
6000|$|The duchess for {{a moment}} was silent, though she {{appeared}} to have more to say. [...] "Lambeth says he has <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of you," [...] she presently began.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But when,' said Mr Pluck, 'when I <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{sweetness}} and beauty {{on the one}} hand, and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> ardour and devotion on the other, I--pardon me, Pyke, I didn't intend to resume that theme. Change the subject, Pyke.' ...|$|R

6000|$|In what {{manner is}} the {{production}} of the earth and sea, of which I have <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>much?</b> From whence came myself, and all other creatures living, and of what are they made? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly,' he {{answered}} composedly; 'you <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> depends upon a first impression, especially,' he added, 'as I observe {{that there are}} ladies about. One at least of us ought to be decently dressed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And how do {{you think}} then," [...] the Colonel asked with interest, [...] "that, when together, they SHOULD do? The less they do, one would say, the better--if you <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know!" [...] she answered. [...] "And {{yet it is}} inevitable. What {{have you}} and I to look forward to? Sometimes I {{think that it is}} {{weakness}} to <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of one another." ...|$|R
