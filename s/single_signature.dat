40|$|A circuit {{may produce}} unknown output values during {{simulation}} of an input sequence {{due to an}} unknown initial state or due {{to the existence of}} tri-state elements. For circuits tested using BIST, unknown output values make it impossible to determine a <b>single</b> unique <b>signature</b> for the fault free circuit. To accommodate unknown output values in a BIST scheme, we describe a procedure for synthesizing a minimal logic block that replaces unknown output values by a known constant. The proposed procedure ensures that the BIST scheme will be able to detect all the faults detectable by the input sequence applied to the circuit while allowing a <b>single</b> unique <b>signature</b> to be obtained...|$|R

5000|$|Astral {{projection}} author Robert Bruce {{describes the}} astral as seven planes {{that take the}} form of planar surfaces when approached from a distance, separated by immense coloured [...] "buffer zones". These planes are endlessly repeating ruled Cartesian coordinate system grids, tiled with a <b>single</b> <b>signature</b> pattern that is different for each plane. Higher planes have bright, colourful patterns, whereas lower planes appear far duller. Every detail of these patterns acts as a consistent portal to a different kingdom inside the plane, which itself comprises many separate realms. Bruce notes that the astral may also be entered by means of long tubes that bear visual similarity to these planes, and conjectures that the grids and tubes are in fact the same structures approached from a different perceptual angle.|$|E

An attempt was made on 6 June to get the judges to treat the publications of Bastwick and Burton (who had added to his offence by publishing, from his prison, An Apology for an Appeale, 1636 consisting of epistles to the king, the judges, and the nobility) as presenting a primâ facie case of treason, but this fell through. The defendants prepared answers to the indictment, but it was necessary that these should be signed by two counsel.

40|$|We survey {{two recent}} {{signature}} constructions that support signature aggregation: Given n signatures on n distinct messages from n distinct users, {{it is possible}} to aggregate all these signatures into a <b>single</b> <b>signature.</b> This <b>single</b> <b>signature</b> (and all n original messages) will convince any verifier that the n users signed the n original messages (i. e., for i = 1,..., n user i signed message number i). We survey two constructions. The first is based on the short signature scheme of Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham and supports general aggregation. The second, based on a multisignature scheme of Micali, Ohta, and Reyzin, is built from any trapdoor permutation but only supports sequential aggregation. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP...|$|E

40|$|As the {{application}} of digital signature is progressed in real life, the situation of using digital signatures tends to become more complex. Depending on applications a user may need to generate multiple signatures for the same message with his multiple signing keys. But the general approach of generating multiple independent signatures is not e#cient. To solve this problem, we propose multi-key signature scheme in which a signer generates a <b>single</b> <b>signature</b> for a message using his multiple signing keys all together...|$|E

40|$|A multi{{signature}} {{scheme is}} a digital signature scheme that allows multiple signers {{to generate a}} <b>single</b> <b>signature</b> in a collaborative and simultaneous manner. In this paper we first review of the digital multisignature schemes using elliptic curvers and elliptic curve version of the multisignature scheme with distinguished signing responsibilities. Then, we propose a new multisignature scheme with distinguished signing responsibilities. In this scheme, each group member has distinguished signing responsibility and partial contents of the message can be verified without revealing the whole message. Our proposed scheme is more efficient than the scheme reviewed and capable of application in practice...|$|E

Moreover, we implement aggregated signatures and evaluate their performances...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} packet DS-CDMA systcms with a connectionless architecture {{where no}} dedicated connection is kept between users and the system.

Due to the asynchronous nature of the system, multiple users can be accommodated even when a <b>single</b> <b>signature</b> is available. However, we observe that even under optimistic assumptions, the capacity of such a system is less than that of G orthogonal ALOHA channels that can be accommodated in the same bandwidth of this CDMA system with processing gain G. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an authentication scheme and an access control scheme for JPEG 2000 image codestreams based on hash chains. Both schemes are fully {{compatible with the}} core part of JPEG 2000 standard. The authentication scheme allows users to verify the authenticity of sub-images progressively extracted from a single codestream protected with a <b>single</b> <b>signature,</b> and the access control scheme allows users to access sub-images partially decrypted from a single encrypted JPEG 2000 codestream. In addition, the two schemes can be integrated to provide both authenticity and access control simultaneously. Our experiments demonstrate the two scheme are very efficient and highly scalable...|$|E
40|$|A {{gravitational}} {{mirror is}} a non-singular finite redshift surface which bounces all incident null geodesics. While a white mirror (outward bouncing) resembles 't Hooft's brick wall, a black mirror (inward bouncing) offers a novel mechanism for sealing off curvature singularities. The geometry underlying a two-sided mirror {{is characterized by}} a <b>single</b> <b>signature</b> change, to be contrasted with the signature flip which governs the black hole geometry. To demonstrate the phenomenon analytically, we derive an exact, static, radially symmetric, two-sided mirror solution, which asymptotes the massless BTZ black hole background, and then probe the local structure of a massive mirror.

40|$|International audienceTraceable {{signatures}} schemes {{were introduced}} by Kiayias, Tsiounis and Yung {{in order to}} solve traceability issues in group signature schemes. They wanted to enable authorities to delegate some of their detection capabilities to tracing sub-authorities. Instead of opening every <b>single</b> <b>signatures</b> and then threatening privacy, tracing sub-authorities are able to know if a signature was emitted by specific users only. In 2008, Libert and Yung proposed the first traceable signature schemes proven secure in the standard model. We design another scheme in the standard model, with two instantiations based either on the or the assumptions. Our construction is far more efficient, both in term of group elements for the signature, and pairing computation for the verification. Besides the “step-in” (confirmation) feature that allows a user to prove he was indeed the signer, our construction provides the “step-out” (disavowal) procedure that allows a user to prove {{he was not the}} signer. Since list signature schemes are closely related to this primitive, we consider them, and answer an open problem: list signature schemes are possible without random oracles...|$|R
