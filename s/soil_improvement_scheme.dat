40|$|Abstract. To {{satisfy the}} {{geotechnical}} strength requirements and the serviceability requirements, types of foundation systems (such as shallow foundation, pile foundation and composite foundation) have been developed. Of course, {{the type of}} foundation system is determined by many factors such as ground condition, economy and environmental influence of construction. To cope with weak or compressible soils, the authors present a raft foundation system with walled and columniform <b>soil</b> <b>improvement</b> for multistory buildings, which is economical and environment-friendly. In this raft foundation system, different columniform <b>soil</b> <b>improvements</b> in size and depth are used, and the subgrade under {{the edge of the}} foundation is walled by <b>soil</b> <b>improvement.</b> It can effectively control differential settlement and prevent relative rising of the structure by adjusting the size and depth of columniform <b>soil</b> <b>improvements</b> according to the soil layer difference of geological situation under the building. We have performed series numerical analyses under two-dimensional plane strain condition to study the settlement behaviors of the composite foundation system, and its effects on controlling differential settlement and improving bearing capacity were verified for immediate condition. As a continuous research, consolidation settlement analyses are performed, the process of excess hydraulic pressure dispersion with time and the consolidation settlement development are studied in this paper...|$|R
