25|$|The term Hunter-Russell {{syndrome}} {{derives from}} a study of mercury poisoning among workers in a seed packing factory in Norwich, England in the late 1930s who breathed methylmercury that was {{being used as a}} <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectant</b> and preservative.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, Geigy began {{research}} on moth- and plant-protection agents and Müller was specifically interested in plant protection. He {{said that his}} love for plants and nature in general, which led him to choose botany as a minor subject at university, brought him to think about plant protection. Specifically, he wanted to start synthesizing chemical plant protection agents himself. In 1937, he patented a technique for synthesizing novel rhodanide- and cyanate-based compounds which showed bactericide and insecticide activity.He then developed the product Graminone, a <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectant</b> which was safer than the mercury-based disinfectants at the time.|$|E
40|$|The {{agriculture}} in Sweden today uses chemical substances to control vermin, weed and diseases. This usage shows through polluted subsoil water and trace {{elements in the}} food we eat. There’s a risk that additional symptoms will arise in the future. Our product Sha Jun, developed in 2006 - 2007, {{is an attempt to}} try and minimize the need of chemicals in the agriculture. The idea started with the attempt to minimize the usage of pesticides on the cropland. It later developed in an attempt to decrease <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectant.</b> The spraying with <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectant</b> today is happening with a rate of 1 tonne/h. They hope one day to reach the speed of 5 tonnes/h. With our product you reach speeds of 17. 5 tonnes/h. We also eliminate the need to use the dangerous <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectant</b> on the seed before it s stored. The market for our product in Sweden consists of approximately 800 potential buyers. These include farms over 200 hectares and collection centrals. It will also give ecological framers a change to decrease their losses in useless crops. This because our method of treatment is environment-friendly...|$|E
50|$|In 1922 DuPont reorganized its {{research}} {{by dividing the}} entire research enterprise into four parts, each {{assigned to one of}} its four production areas. Bolton was made director of research for the Dyestuffs Department where his ability in this capacity was quickly realized. Dye manufacture requires the synthesis {{of a large number of}} intermediate compounds, and Bolton realized these could be used in many activities outside the Dyestuffs Department. By 1923 his lab was working on accelerators for manufacture of synthetic rubber and soon after extended the research to include antioxidants for gasoline and rubber, floatation agents, insecticides, <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectants,</b> and large scale manufacture of tetraethyllead.|$|R
5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure to <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectants.</b> In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|R

40|$|Iowa {{is a major}} crop- and seed-producing area. More {{acres of}} corn and oats are grown in Iowa {{than in any other}} state, and most of the seed of these crops for Iowa farmers is {{produced}} within the state. Furthermore, in 1943 over 95 percent of the corn acreage was planted with hybrid seed, and over 60 percent of the oat. acreage was planted with seed of new rust-resistant varieties. Other seed crops of importance in Iowa are soybeans, bluegrass, timothy, wheat, flax, bromegrass, red clover, sweet clover, sudan grass, sweet corn, watermelon and sorghum. The yield and quality of a crop harvested each year is dependent in part {{on the quality of the}} seed that is planted and the only, way to know the quality factors of purity, vitality, weed seed content and sanitation is to test seed prior to planting. The purpose of this bulletin is to provide teachers and farmers with information about the need for clean seed and methods of testing seed with special emphasis on determination of pure seed, identification of weed and crop seeds, germination tests and use of <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectants</b> for the control of molds that cause disease...|$|R
40|$|Preharvest {{infection}} of groundnut seeds by toxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus {{is a major}} cause for aflatoxin contamination in the crop. The objective {{of this study was}} to refine screening techniques for in-vitro seed colonization and preharvest seed infection that could be effectively used in resistance breeding programmes. A highly aggressive and toxigenic strain of A. flavus, Af 11 - 4, was used to improve the screening techniques for in-vitro seed colonization and preharvest seed infection. The in-vitro seed colonization technique involved the use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl-clorax 20 %) instead of mercuric chloride (HgCl 2 0. 1 %) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol 70 %) as <b>seed</b> surface <b>disinfectant,</b> and multiwell dishes to incubate single inoculated seeds that will facilitate selection of seeds resistant to A. flavus colonization. The preharvest seed infection screening technique involved the development of A. flavus infested beds and imposing soil moisture stress (54 - 63 % water deficit) during the last 48 days of the crop growth. Both in-vitro seed colonization and field screening methods were successfully used to screen a number of groundnut genotypes with consistent results...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Agriculture)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2001. Onion seeds (cultivar Caledon Globe), {{and soil}} {{into which the}} {{seedlings}} were planted, were treated with various adjuvants including fungicides, a <b>seed</b> <b>disinfectant</b> and a soil sterilant, as well as soil-applied growth stimulants {{to determine the effect}} of these on germination of seed, the growth of plants and the storage life of onions obtained. Three sets of germination trials were undertaken in petri dishes, and sets of seed was also sown in deep seed trays. A trial planting was made and the crop graded and stored. Seed was also sown in pots in soil obtained from a commercial undertaking where poor germination had been obtained. A portion of this soil was pasteurised and a portion inoculated with Fusarium spp. Growth of these seedlings was then followed by re-sowing in the same pots using seed of additional cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Toleration of {{germination}} and embryonic {{growth stage}} to heavy elements is {{as a key}} of plant establishment under limited conditions. In this study effects of two heavy metals, cadmium and copper sulfate and their interplays were evaluated on germination and growth of A. elongatum. Therefore A. elongatum <b>seeds</b> after <b>disinfectant,</b> placed on watman paper and influenced by cadmium (10, 20 and 30 mg L - 1) and copper sulfate (10, 20 and 30 mg L - 1). Distilled water was used as control treatment. Each treatment had 4 replications and there were 25 seeds for each replication. Germination of seeds was evaluated everyday and growth index was determined by measuring of root length, shoot length, seedling length and seed vigurity index. Results indicated that there weren’t significant differences among the treatment of germination percentage and speed but length of roots, length of shoots, length of seedling and vigurity index reduced significantly by application of these heavy metals. Root length reduced from 6. 2 cm in the control to 2. 4 cm at 30 mg L - 1 Cd solution but it reduced from 6. 3 cm in the control to 4. 1 cm at 30 mg L - 1 Cu solution. Shoot length was reduced from 9. 2 cm in the control to 4. 6 cm at 30 mg L - 1 Cd solution and reduced from 9. 4 cm in control to 5. 6 cm at 30 mg/L Cu solution...|$|R
30|$|Two {{replicates}} {{each with}} 20 <b>disinfectant</b> <b>seeds</b> {{which had been}} pre-selected for uniform mass. Seeds were germinated in water into plastic pots (78.5  cm square by 15.8  cm in height) containing quartz gravel. After germination, 10 plants were kept in each pot and grown in a glasshouse under 16  hour’s illumination a day. All pots for each replicate were placed in a single large plastic pool. Temperature was controlled at 18 °C to 20 °C. Waterlogging was achieved by filling the pool with water {{to make sure that}} the tallest leaf tip was at least 10  cm below the water surface. Watelogging treatment was conducted after 7  days of germination, and continued for 7  days. After that, water level was treated the same as control in the experiments. Following the treatment, all plants in both control and treatment were cultured with modified Hoagland’s nutrient solution in one week. Root dry weight, shoot dry weight, and total dry weight were measured. Waterlogging index calculated as values in waterlogging treatment divided by total dry weight in control.|$|R
