40|$|Abstract. Fatigue S-N {{relations}} are investigated experimentally on the grade B cast steel for Chinese railway freight car bogie frames. Group test method was employed. Results {{reveal that the}} fatigue cracks were initiated from the material cast <b>shrinking</b> <b>cavities</b> with hot ties. Distinct fatigue striations, river-like flowers, and second cracks appeared on the fracture surface in perpendicular to the fatigue crack path. Lots of dimples in the transient fracture district indicate that present material is ductile. Considering both the scattered S-N relations and no fatigue limits under variable loads, the S-N {{relations are}} measured probabilistically in terms of continuous declined probabilistic S-N curves including super-long life regime (SLLR) of> 107 cycles. Affordable novel approach, i. e. concurrent probability extrapolation method, was applied. The test S-N data in mid-long life regime (MLLR) and conventional fatigue limits are used. The curves are established by extrapolating the conventional S-N curves crossing the fatigue limits, in a concurrent probability manner, into the SLLR. Appropriate measurements have been given for the test data of the present material...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} these large <b>shrink</b> <b>cavities</b> on {{mechanical}} properties could be easily calculated using well established engineering formulas. Over the years, increases in computational and metallurgical resources have allowed the modeler to improve accuracy and increase the complexity of numerical predictors. An accurate prediction of micro-porosity, not observable using conventional radiographic techniques, and an engineering understanding of the effect on mechanical properties would give a designer confidence in using a more efficient casting design and a lower safety factor. This will give castings an additional design advantage. The goal of this project is to provide current and future modelers/designers with a tensile and Charpy property dataset for validation of micro-porosity predictors. The response of ultimate strength, elongation, and reduction in area to micro-porosity was very similar in all four alloys. Ultimate strength was largely unaffected by tensile fracture surface porosity until values of about 25 % were reached and decreased linearly with increasing values. Elongation and reduction in area decreased sharply after less than 5 % fracture surface porosity. Niyama values of about 0. 7 were produced sound material and acceptable tensile properties. Ultrasonic velocities of 0. 233 in/usec and higher produced acceptable tensile properties. Metallographic examination revealed a ratio of 4 - 6 to 1 in fracture surface porosity to metallographic porosity. Charpy impact properties were largely unaffected by the microporosity concentrations {{examined in this study}} and did not correlate to either Niyama values, fracture surface porosity, or metallographic porosity...|$|R

40|$|Pure {{substances}} {{can often}} be cooled below their melting points and still remain in the liq-uid state. For some supercooled liquids, a further cooling slows down viscous flow greatly, but does not slow down self-diffusion as much. We formulate a continuum theory that regards viscous flow and self-diffusion as concurrent, but distinct, processes. We generalize Newton’s law of viscosity to relate stress, rate of deformation, and chemical potential. The self-diffusion flux is taken to be proportional to the gradient of chemical potential. The relative rate of viscous flow and self-diffusion defines a length, which, for some supercooled liquids, is {{much larger than the}} molecular dimension. A thermody-namic consideration leads to boundary conditions for a surface of liquid under the influ-ence of applied traction and surface energy. We apply the theory to a cavity in a supercooled liquid and identify a transition. A large <b>cavity</b> <b>shrinks</b> by viscous flow, and a small <b>cavity</b> <b>shrinks</b> by self-diffusion.

40|$|Column {{separation}} {{refers to}} the breaking of liquid columns in fully filled pipelines. This may occur in a water hammer event when the pressure drops to the vapor pressure at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope). A vapor cavity, driven by the inertia of the parting liquid columns, will start to grow. The cavity acts as a vacuum, a low-pressure point, retarding the liquid columns, which finally starts to diminish in size when the liquid columns change flow direction. The collision of two liquid columns, or of one liquid column with a closed end, moving towards the <b>shrinking</b> <b>cavity,</b> may cause a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure. The large pressure rise travels through the entire pipeline and forms a severe load for hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures. The situation is even worse: in one water- hammer event many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur. This report reviews water-hammer-induced column-separation from {{the discovery of the}} phenomenon in the late 19 th century, the recognition of its danger in the 1930 s, the development of numerical methods in the 1960 s and 1970 s, to the standard models used in commercial software packages in the late 20 th century. A comprehensive survey of laboratory tests and field measurements is given. The review focuses on transient vaporous cavitation. Gaseous cavitation and steam-condensation are beyond the scope of the report. There are more than 300 references cited in this review report. Anton Bergant, Angus R. Simpson, Arris S.

40|$|The dithia/diselena meso-tetraarylporphyrins have {{a lesser}} {{tendency}} to form metal complexes {{because of the}} larger size of the heteroatom(s), which <b>shrinks</b> the <b>cavity</b> size, and the heteroatoms also have poor coordinating ability to bind metal ions. The first example of a rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complex of 21, 23 -diselenaporphyrin was synthesized by treating 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetra-p-tolyl- 21, 23 -diselenaporphyrin with Re(CO) (5) Cl in chlorobenzene at reflux temperature and its structural properties were compared with our earlier reported rhenium(I) complex of tetraaryl- 21, 23 -dithiaporphyrin. The crystal structures of rhenium(I) complexes of diheteroporphyrins revealed that the Re-I ion binds to both the Se/S atoms {{and one of the}} N atoms of the porphyrin core along with three terminal carbonyl groups in an octahedral fashion. The rhenium(I) complexes of 21, 23 -diheteroporphyrins are stabilized by a large counterion, the trichloro-bridged dirhenium(I) ion. We also present a detailed account of the spectral and redox properties of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes of 21, 23 -diheteroporphyrins...|$|R

Using visualization experiments with smoke particles and multiscale simulations we show that in addition a high-speed air-jet is pushed out of the cavity.

40|$|Fundamental measure theory (FMT) {{for hard}} {{particles}} has {{great potential for}} predicting the phase behavior of colloidal and nanometric shapes. The modern versions of FMT are usually derived from the zero-dimensional limit, a system of at most one particle confined {{in a collection of}} cavities in the limit that all <b>cavities</b> <b>shrink</b> {{to the size of the}} particle. In [Phys. Rev. E 85, 041150 (2012) ], a derivation from an approximated and resummed virial expansion was presented, whose result was not fully consistent with the FMT from the zero-dimensional limit. Here we improve upon this derivation and obtaining exactly the same FMT functional as was obtained earlier from the zero-dimensional limit. As a result, further improvements of FMT based on the virial expansion can now be formulated, some of which we suggest in the outlook...|$|R

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are currently used in horses. The gold-standard source for stem cells is derived from bone marrow, although other sources, such as fat, are also available. Bone marrow is often harvested from the sternum, hip, or ileum. The sternum and ileum contain the same quality of stem cells, but the ileum is usually harder to use in horses older than 5 years of age, because the marrow <b>cavity</b> <b>shrinks.</b> Marrow is collected using a Jamshidi needle in a sedated horse.

40|$|Recent cryoEM density maps of Aβ 42 fibrils {{obtained}} at low pH revealed two protofilaments winding around a hollow core raising the question if such tubular structures also exist at physiological pH. Based on the cryoEM measurements and on NMR data, we probe amyloid fibril organizations {{corresponding to the}} observed cryoEM density map. Our study demonstrates that the tubular Aβ 42 fibril models exist at both acidic and physiological pH; however, the relative populations of the polymorphic models shift with pH. At acidic pH, the hollow core model exhibits higher population than the other models; at physiological pH, although it is less populated {{compared to the other}} models, structurally, it is stable and represents 8 % of the population. We observe that only models with C termini facing the external surface of the fibril retain the hollow core under acidic and physiological conditions with dimensions similar to those observed by cryoEM; on the other hand, the hydrophobic effect <b>shrinks</b> the tubular <b>cavity</b> in the alternative organization. The existence of the hollow core fibril at physiological pH emphasizes the need to examine toxic effects of minor oligomeric species with unique organizations...|$|R
40|$|Immediately after ovulation, in the {{follicular}} cavity, by multiplying and metaplasia of granulosa {{and internal}} sheath cells, a transient endocrine gland is formed, {{known as the}} corpus luteum (corpus luteum). Although in adult mice, ovulation occurs every 4 - 5 days throughout the year and important individual variations were noticed in terms of the normal estrous cycle, formation, progression and regression of corpus luteum are somewhat synchronized. This paper proposes a cytohistological study of the ovary of adult mice to capture the main morphological changes which occur {{in the process of}} organization, evolution and involution of the corpus luteum in this species. The investigations were performed on adult mouse ovaries of NMRI line, in various stages of the estrous cycle. They were fixed in 10 % formalin, then were sectioned 5 μ in size and were stained with Mallory trichrome method. Luteal morphology emphasizes that, after the loss of oocyte, follicular <b>cavity</b> <b>shrinks</b> due to the wrinkling of sheaths, then is filled with blood and lymph resulting initially the bleeding body (corpus hemorrhagicum). Cell differentiation takes thus place on a blood-cytolitic support, which is reabsorbed, and in the parenchyma of corpus luteum two types of luteal cells can be identified (large and small) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} free surface flow {{is the impact}} of a solid object on a liquid: At impact a “crown” splash is created and a surface cavity (void) emerges which immediately starts to collapse due to the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding liquid. Eventually the cavity closes in a single point about halfway down its length and shoots out a fast and extremely slender water jet. Here we impact thin circular discs a few centimeters in radius with velocities of a few meters per second. Combining high-speed imaging with sophisticated boundary-integral simulations we elucidate various aspects of this fascinating process. First we show that the mechanism behind the formation of the fast, almost needle-like liquid jet is reminiscent of the violent jets of fluidized metal created during the explosion “of lined cavities” in military and mining operations. We obtain quantitative agreement between our simulations, experiments, and analytical model. Next we use visualization experiments to measure the air flow as it is squeezed out of the <b>shrinking</b> impact <b>cavity.</b> Together with numerical simulations we show that even in our simple system of a 2 cm disc impacting at merely 1 m/s the air flow easily attains supersonic velocities. A long-standing controversy in the fluid dynamics community has been until recently the pinch-off behavior of a bubble inside a liquid. Our observation of different time scales for the onset of the predicted final regime reconciles the different views expressed in recent literature about bubble pinch-off. Next we replace the impacting disc by a long, smooth cylinder and find that the closure position of the cavity displays distinct regimes separated by discrete jumps which are consistently observed in experiment and numerical simulations. Finally, we simulate the collapse of nanobubbles nucleating from small (50 nm) pits drilled into a silicon wafer. We find that just prior to final collapse a jet very similar in appearance to those after solid object impact forms and penetrates deep into the hole...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} results of {{two-dimensional}} hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating circumbinary discs around binaries whose parameters match those of the circumbinary planet-hosting systems Kepler- 16, Kepler- 34 and Kepler- 35. Previous work has shown that non-self-gravitating discs in these systems form an eccentric precessing inner cavity due to tidal truncation by the binary, and planets which form at large radii migrate until stalling at this cavity. Whilst this scenario appears to provide a natural explanation for the observed orbital locations of the circumbinary planets, previous simulations have failed to match the observed planet orbital parameters. The aim of this work {{is to examine the}} role of self-gravity in modifying circumbinary disc structure as a function of disc mass, prior to considering the evolution of embedded circumbinary planets. In agreement with previous work, we find that for disc masses between one and five times the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), disc self-gravity affects modest changes in the structure and evolution of circumbinary discs. Increasing the disc mass to 10 or 20 MMSN leads to two dramatic changes in disc structure. First, the scale of the inner <b>cavity</b> <b>shrinks</b> substantially, bringing its outer edge closer to the binary. Secondly, in addition to the eccentric inner cavity, additional precessing eccentric ring-like features develop in the outer regions of the discs.

40|$|Necrosis of the renal {{papillae}} {{was first}} described by von Friedreich [1] in 1877, and the radiologic appearances were first described by Praetorius [2] in 1937. Further radiologic details were published by Günther [3, 4], Lagergren and Lindvall [5], Lindvall [6], and Hare and Poynter [7]. Necrosis of a papilla will first {{result in a}} local disturbance in function and a swelling of the papilla, which later shrinks irregularly. The fornices of the calyx become widened. The necrotic papilla may then either be detached, and a cavity is formed, or the papilla may remain attached (in situ). In the latter case, calcium deposits may occur in the necrotic portion. When detached, the necrotic tissue may either remain in the <b>cavity,</b> <b>shrink</b> and be absorbed, {{or it may be}} passed in the urine, whole or in fragments. Sometimes the necrotic tissue may form the nucleus of a calculus. The necrotic changes never encroach upon the cortex or the columns of Bertin. Günther [4] differentiated between two types of necrosis with detachment: the papillary form, where the whole papilla or a greater part of the medulla was necrotized, and the medullary form, where only {{the central part of the}} papilla was necrotized. As these names indicate different degrees of necrosis, and are confusing, Hare and Poynter [7] suggested a more appropriate nomenclature: total papillary necrosis (TPN) instead of papillary necrosis (Fig. 1), and partial papillary necrosis (PPN) instead of medullary necrosis (Fig. 2). They also suggested the name necrosis in situ (NIS) for those instances where there is no detachment of the necrotic papilla (Fig. 3). As this nomenclature is more adequate than that of Günther [4], I will use it here...|$|R
