50|$|The Declaration of Independence of the United States {{initiated}} {{a requirement for}} a national seal that would represent {{the sovereignty of the}} United States of America. After three design committees had not yet completed the design work for the Great Seal, Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson was given the assignment to complete the design in June of 1782. Thomson's design utilized many of the features of the committees' work, and was approved by Congress on June 20, 1782. The engraver for the original Great <b>Seal</b> <b>die</b> was attributed as Robert Scot by Richardson Dougall and Richard Patterson in their book, The Eagle and the Shield. The primary source of their attribution was a note by Thomson for payment of a seal to Robert Scot. The only seal that Thomson is known to have been involved with is the Great Seal. Other evidence includes exact stylistic and technical attributes of Robert Scot's engravings to the Great <b>Seal</b> <b>die,</b> including a star constellation for the Commissioner of Revenue seal, the eagle for 1782 frontispiece engraving of Ahiman Rezon, and borders on a 1783 seal for the College of William and Mary.|$|E

40|$|Stranding patterns, {{clinical}} and pathological records were analysed for harbour seals (Phoca vitulina vitulina) {{submitted to the}} rehabilitation centre Ecomare between 2009 and 2013. Of 38 <b>seals</b> that <b>died</b> or were euthanized stranding patterns, clinical records an pathological findings were analysed. Of 38 seals that were released the stranding patterns and clinical records were evaluated. A comparison between these two groups were also conducted. Most strandings of <b>seals</b> that <b>died</b> or were euthanized occurred {{during the winter months}} January and December (60. 5 %). The stranding locations were limited to Texel (47. 4 %) and North-Holland (52. 6 %) because this is the region covered by Ecomare. The <b>seals</b> that <b>died</b> or were euthanized (n= 38) were all juveniles, 57. 9 % was male and 42. 1 % was female. The seals that were released show a significantly (P= 0. 045) higher bodyweight upon submission than the <b>seals</b> that <b>died</b> or were euthanized. The seals of both groups first lost weight before regaining weight after approximately 2 weeks in the rehabilitation centre. The most common clinical findings of the <b>seals</b> that <b>died</b> or were euthanized, were elevated intensity of breathing sounds (47. 4 %), dyspnoea (42. 1 %) and coughing (34. 2 %). The most common clinical findings of the seals that were released, were elevated intensity of breathing sounds (76. 3 %), diarrhoea (34. 2 %) and wounds of the skin (28. 9 %). The treatment administered was mostly the same for both groups. The most common pathological findings of the <b>seals</b> that <b>died</b> or were euthanized were bronchopneumonia (86. 8 %), nematodiriasis in the bronchial tree (76. 3 %) and intestinal parasites (42. 1 %). The most common causes of death or underlying disease in case of euthanasia were parasitic bronchopneumonia (57. 9 %) and cachexia/emaciation of undetermined cause (28. 9 %). Respiratory signs were the main clinical signs of the seals submitted to the rehabilitation centre. Respiratory problems were the main reason for the <b>seals</b> to <b>die</b> or be euthanized as well. Intestinal problems did occur, however these were not a reason for the <b>seals</b> to <b>die</b> or be euthanized...|$|R
5000|$|Richard Austin (1756-1832) was an English punchcutter. He was the {{original}} cutter of the typefaces now known as Bell, Scotch Roman, and Porson. [...] Born in London 4 August 1756 and christened at St Luke's Old Street, he studied <b>seal,</b> <b>die</b> and copper-plate engraving as an apprentice to John Phillips near Finsbury Square. He married Phillips' daughter Sarah and set up on his own about 1786. He was hired by John Bell's British Letter Foundry in 1788 as a punch-cutter, to imitate Didot's 1782 types [...] "de la troisième manière," [...] cut by Pierre Vafflard to F-A Didot's designs. Bell sold {{his interest in the}} foundry to S & C Stephenson. When the foundry closed in 1797, Austin bought in his own punches and sold strikes to Fry & Steele, Figgins, and Caslon. Strikes were even sold in North America. Austin cut Greek types for Cambridge University Press in 1806-8, following designs provided by the famous drunken master Richard Porson. He probably also cut the Sarcophagus Greek that preceded it. Austin then provided strikes to William Miller's foundry in Edinburgh & Alexander Wilson's Sons' foundry in Glasgow, creating the types now known as Scotch, before founding his own Imperial Letter Foundry in London in 1815, with his son George (who had been his apprentice until 1805). The first Miller Specimen of 1809 is now lost (The University of Vermont holds the 1811 Specimen). Wilson's earliest specimen showing the improved types is dated 1812. Richard Austin died circa 20 August 1832, leaving the foundry to his son George, whom many credited with the innovations in type designs manifest in the Scotch types. Austin's other sons were John Phillips Austin, a music engraver, and Richard Turner Austin (1781-1842), a painter (member of the Royal Academy) and commercial wood engraver.|$|E

However, a generalized infection, a case with lesions confined to the liver and draining lymph nodes, and a case with tuberculous meningitis also were seen. Histological lesions were characterized by spindle cell proliferation and necrosis without mineralization or giant cell formation. The mycobacteria isolated was identified as belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex but it appeared to be unique. Intradermal tuberculin testing showed promise as a diagnostic aid; however, the results were not statistically significant.
