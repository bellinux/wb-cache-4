5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E
5|$|At the time, his {{employers}} {{refused to}} make allowances for him to play sport, forcing him to begin work at <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> As a result, he considered moving to South Australia, where a grocery magnate offered him employment and financial incentives. However, he stayed after state officials intervened, with Sir Ronald Irish, the Australian chairman of Rothmans, providing him with a job in Sydney. At the time, O'Neill had another offer. Having represented his state in baseball and been nominated in the All-Australian team in 1957, he was approached by the New York Yankees, having had experience at a pitcher and short stop. O'Neill was offered a fee more than 25 times that for a single Test match, as well as travel costs and accommodation, to trial with the Yankees. He agreed, but Irish dissuaded him {{less than a week}} before his scheduled departure.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} {{returning}} to England Honora Sneyd died of consumption at <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> on 1 May 1780 at Bighterton, surrounded by her husband, her youngest sister, Charlotte and a servant. Honora Sneyd {{was buried in the}} nearby Weston church where a plaque on the wall (see box) bears witness to her life. Honora Sneyd died within eight years of her marriage to Richard Edgeworth, at almost the same age as her predecessor. The same disease which had taken the life of her mother and five maternal aunts would soon claim the life of her young daughter, Honora Edgeworth (1790), as well as her younger sister, Elizabeth, seven years later (1797), as well as at least two of Elizabeth's children, Charlotte (1807) and Henry (1813). Honora's brother, Lovell was also affected by the consumption. At the time it was thought this was a hereditary weakness carried by the family.|$|E

Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> she got up to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E

25|$|As Rebbe, Schneerson {{would receive}} {{visitors}} for private meetings, known as yechidus, on Sunday and Thursday evenings. Those meetings would begin at 8pm and often continue until five or <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and {{were open to}} everyone. Schneerson, who spoke several languages including English, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, Russian, German and Italian, would converse with people on all issues and offer his advice on both spiritual and mundane matters. Politicians and leaders from across the globe came to meet him, but Schneerson showed no preference to one person over another. His secretary once even declined to admit John F. Kennedy because Schneerson was already meeting 'ordinary' people who had requested appointments months previously. Those meetings were discontinued in 1982 when it became impossible to facilitate {{the large number of}} people. Meetings were then held only for those who had a special occasion, such as a bride and groom for their wedding or a boy and his family on the occasion of a bar mitzvah.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 {{the company}} made some trials with a steam tram from Messrs Hughes and Co of Loughborough. On 27 May, at <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the engine {{was brought to the}} top of Sion Hill outside the general {{cemetery}} where a number of invited guests boarded. The tram proceeded down the steep hill on Derby Road and Chapel Bar to the terminus next to the Exchange. Then the car left the Market Place and made the reverse journey back up the Derby Road hill, stopping to prove that it could start on a steep hill. The tram then proceeded to the Basford Depot and when the flat ground of Radford Road was reached the driver was instructed to increase the speed, and 20 m.p.h. was achieved. The tram reached the Basford Depot in approximately 20 minutes and the trial was judged a success. A further experiment was undertaken on 3 June, to which civic dignitaries including the Mayor, the Town Clerk and various Aldermen were invited, some of whom followed the trial from horse-drawn tram cars. The emission of steam in the Market Place was explained by the manufacturer, Mr. Hughes as he had been requested by the authorities to discharge the condensing water outside of the town, so under normal operating conditions, steam would be prevented from escaping in the town.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian and Prussian armies {{began to}} {{assemble}} {{on the northern}} and eastern frontiers of France, and the legislature issued a warning that the nation was in danger. On 29 July, at the Jacobins Club, Robespierre demanded suspension of the monarchy, and {{the election of a}} National Convention to write a new constitution. On 1 August, news reached Paris that the Duke of Brunswick, commander of the army of the King of Prussia, threatened to destroy Paris unless the Parisians accepted the authority of their king. Shortly before midnight on 9 August, Danton rang the church bell of the Cordelier Club, signaling an insurrection. The sans-culottes took over the Hôtel-de-Ville, deposed the Paris City government, put the second mayor of Paris, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve, under house arrest, and established their own government, the insurrectional Commune. At <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> on the 10th, armed sans-culottes from the more radical sections of the city, joined by volunteers for the new revolutionary army who had just arrived from Brest and Marseille, attacked the Tuileries Palace. The Palace was defended by two thousand national guardsmen, whose loyalty to the King was uncertain; a company of two hundred volunteer nobles, and nine hundred Swiss guards. Early in the morning the commander of the National Guard at the Palace was invited to an urgent meeting, where he was surprised and murdered. The King and his family were persuaded to leave at the Palace, to take refuge with the National Assembly in the riding academy a short distance away. He had just left the Palace when volunteers from Brest and Marseille forced the gates and the Swiss Guards opened fire. A bloody battle followed, even after the King sent a message ordering the Swiss guards to cease fire. Most of the noble volunteers and remaining National Guardsmen escaped, but two thirds of the Swiss guards, recognizable in their red uniforms, were massacred.|$|E

Robinson was the {{youngest}} of three children; his eldest sister Marie was born in 1917 and his other sister Evelyn was born in 1919. His father was a cotton, peanut, and corn farmer in Georgia, who moved the family to Detroit where he initially found work in construction. According to Robinson, Smith Sr. later worked two jobs to support his family—cement mixer and sewer worker. [...] "He had to get up at <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and he'd get home close to midnight. Six days a week.

500|$|In early 1990, Guns N' Roses {{returned}} to the studio to begin recording the full-length follow-up to Appetite for Destruction. Recording sessions initially proved unproductive due to Steven Adler's struggle with drug addiction, which made him unable to perform and caused sessions to abort for several days at a time. Adler was fired the following July and replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult. Keyboardist Dizzy Reed also joined the band that year at Rose's insistence. Sorum and Reed played their first show with Guns N' Roses at Rock in Rio 2 in January 1991. The group fired its long-time manager, Alan Niven, in May of that year; Rose reportedly forced the dismissal of Niven against the wishes of his bandmates by refusing to complete the new album until Niven was gone. He was replaced by roadie Doug Goldstein, whom Izzy Stradlin described as [...] "the guy who gets {{to go over to}} Axl's at <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> after he's smashed his $60,000 grand piano out of the picture window".|$|E
500|$|Typically, when {{creating}} a manga chapter, an artist draws a rough draft or [...] "name", then {{a more detailed}} storyboard, and lastly the finalized version. However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work. He did not plan {{the details of his}} stories in advance. When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters. The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half. Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him. Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks' time travel. The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making it seem to have been foreshadowing. The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, which is exactly what he did.|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene with}} Ron and Tammy start {{stripping}} while running into a motel room, Mullally removed her top and appeared topless during filming. Mullally improvised the move {{and did not}} tell the crew she planned to do it. She said of filming the scene, [...] "I didn't care, it was <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> who cares, I didn't know anybody." [...] Offerman said his favorite scene in the episode was the one in which Leslie tried to break up with Tammy for him. He particularly enjoyed the rapport between Poehler and Mullally, and said he [...] "just wanted to pinch himself" [...] to prevent from laughing. After reuniting with Tammy, Ron puts a framed photo on his wall of a brunette woman holding a plate of breakfast, which he said symbolizes his relationship with Tammy and the breakfast she made him after sex. In the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, a photo of retired basketball coach Bobby Knight is on the wall. When it had to be removed for legal reasons, Parks and Recreation Schur searched an image library for [...] "things we thought Ron would like" [...] and found the breakfast photo. Schur said he thought it was perfect for the character, and it inspired the prop and the dialogue in the episode. The character Tammy later returned for the third season sequel episode, [...] "".|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} Sgt. Pepper, but {{prior to}} the album's commercial release, the Beatles took an acetate disc of the album to the American singer Cass Elliot's flat off King's Road in Chelsea, where at <b>six</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> they played it at full volume with speakers set in open window frames. The group's friend and former press agent, Derek Taylor, remembered that residents of the neighbourhood opened their windows and listened without complaint to what they understood to be unreleased Beatles music. On 26 May 1967, Sgt. Pepper was given a rushed release in the UK, where it was originally scheduled for 1 June. The US release followed on 2 June. It was the first Beatles album where the track listings were exactly {{the same for the}} UK and US versions. The band's eighth LP, it debuted in the UK at number one – where it stayed for 22 consecutive weeks – selling 250,000 copies during the first seven days. On 4 June, the Jimi Hendrix Experience opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with their rendition of the title track. Epstein owned the Saville at the time, and Harrison and McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: [...] "The curtains flew back and [...] came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down {{as one of the great}} honours of my career." [...] Rolling Stone magazine's Langdon Winner recalls: ...|$|E
