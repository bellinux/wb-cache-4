5|$|Scholarships at McGill are {{relatively}} difficult to attain, {{compared to other}} Canadian universities. For out-of-province first year undergraduate students, a high school average of 95% is required to receive a guaranteed one-year entrance scholarship. To be considered for the same scholarships, Quebec CEGEP <b>students</b> <b>need</b> a minimum R-score of 35.5, United States high school <b>students</b> <b>need</b> a minimum A average {{as well as at}} least 700 in each SAT or 33 in the ACT, and French Baccalaureate <b>students</b> <b>need</b> an average of 15.5 plus a minimum score of 14 in each course; similarly, students in the British education system need As in both GCSE Level and predicted Advanced Level results, and International Baccalaureate <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to attain a minimum overall average of 6.9 on predicted grades or a score of 42 on exam results. In general, entrance scholarship recipients rank in the top 1–2% of their class.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{psychotherapy}} supervision {{calls for}} a variety of supervisory roles and addresses a range of <b>student</b> <b>needs.</b> The particular <b>student</b> <b>need</b> should be the determining factor in selecting an appropriate supervisory role.

The unique Professional Model of psychotherapy supervision specifies the manner in which supervision is provided. The Professional Model is a three-dimensional model integrating supervisory roles and <b>student</b> <b>need</b> areas. The three dimensions are: (1) the primary areas of <b>student</b> <b>need</b> in the establishment of clinical skills; (2) a reflection of the various roles supervisors assume; and (3) the focus of attention during supervision.

25|$|Qualitative {{research}} is sometimes {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of qualitative research can be applied to other settings—as long as the reader of the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will tell us more about the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to be taken into consideration when applying any findings to other settings (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E
25|$|Undergraduate: The {{admission}} {{system of}} Islamic University of Technology (IUT) {{is different from}} other universities of Bangladesh for BSc and higher diploma programs. (In Bangladesh all public universities conduct enrolment examinations to select the students; students can come from any ethnic group and religion.) IUT authority only selects Muslim students as per their results in secondary and higher-secondary level. A placement test determines {{the position of the}} students against their choice which they had given on the admission form. Prospective Muslim <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to fill a form and submit it to the ministry of manpower and employment of their respective countries. The form can be collected from IUT office or the respective ministry. It is also available in the university website. IUT was established to support only Muslim students of all the countries of OIC. It takes students from the respective governments, and a majority of the students are Bangladeshi Muslims. Previously, only male Muslim students were eligible to apply but from the year 2016, IUT started a female section as well.|$|E
25|$|Students are {{admitted}} after {{they pass the}} Higher Secondary Exam (HSC exam). In earlier days students partake in entrance examinations, a separate one for each department. But now <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to partake under unit of different faculty. This has been a contentious issue, as {{there used to be}} only one exam for each faculty, after which students would be allocated to departments according to their result and choice of program. As a public university, University of Rajshahi's tuition fees are relatively low; nevertheless, a hike in admission fees, during the 2006–07 session, have drawn criticism from student bodies. As of 2007, the university awards a total of 340 scholarships, whose annual value is around 1.1million taka. In addition, there are merit awards given by residential halls, departments and the university itself. Students are also eligible for the Prime Minister's Gold Medal award. All colleges of the northern and southern regions of the country used to be affiliated with University of Rajshahi. However, the administration of colleges across the country was taken over by the National University when it was established in 1992.|$|E
