40|$|At present, {{a single}} viable {{population}} of endangered African wild dogs occurs in South Africa, in the Kruger National Park. Current conservation efforts focus on reintroducing wild dogs {{into a series}} of fenced reserves, thereby creating a meta-population in which sub-populations are actively managed to conserve genetic diversity. Additional options exist for conserving wild dogs outside protected areas. We report on an attempt to assess the numbers of wild dogs remaining outside protected areas as a precursor for conservation planning and show that they form a more significant component of the national population than previously recognized. Total numbers outside protected areas in South Africa are estimated to have fluctuated between 42 and 106 animals during the period 1996 – 2002. Of these, 25 – 67 individuals were thought to be resident outside protected areas during this period, with an extent of occurrence of 43 310 km 2 and an area of occupancy of 17 907 km 2. Sightings were most frequently reported from the western border of Kruger National Park, the Limpopo Valley, and northern KwaZulu-Natal. Most wild dogs occur on game ranches with unmodified land cover and low human densities, close to source populations. Significant <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> expansion exists in the Limpopo and North West Provinces. However, efforts aimed at changing landowner attitudes towards wild dogs are necessary to improve the conservation status of the species outside protected areas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe risk {{assessment}} proposed {{in this paper}} is a method based on the calculation of three kind of indicators based on the probability of threat incidents and assessing the subsequent consequences of these ones. The consequences are measured by the upset to the service; its <b>scope,</b> which <b>for</b> the <b>distribution</b> service is normally quantified {{by the number of}} properties affected; and by the duration of the upset, which {{is directly related to the}} concept of system resilience or response capacity. The method to characterise a distribution system by means of risk principles aims to support better decisions, accounting for different {{risk assessment}} <b>scopes</b> <b>for</b> the purpose depending on the type of decision to be made and the time horizons involved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} selected analytical techniques and their applications in the quantitative mapping/(bio) imaging of metals in biological samples. This work presents the advantages and disadvantages as well as the appropriate methods of <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> research. <b>Distribution</b> of metals in biological samples is currently one of the most important issues in physiology, toxicology, pharmacology, and other disciplines where functional information about the distribution of metals is essential. This issue is a subject of research in (bio) imaging/mapping studies, which use a variety of analytical techniques for the identification and determination of metallic elements. Increased interest in analytical techniques enabling the (bio) imaging of metals in a variety of biological material has been observed more recently. Measuring the distribution of trace metals in tissues after a drug dose or ingestion of poison-containing metals allows for the studying of pathomechanisms and the pathophysiology of various diseases and disorders related to the management of metals in human and animal systems...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the popular}} {{research}} topics on networked humanity is to understand how people interact and communicate. Scholars investigated the arising communication patterns, {{and in particular the}} series of events happening for a single user. The distribution of waiting times separating two consecutive events - also denoted by the inter-event distribution - is well known have a density fitting a power-law. A debate, however, persists on the nature of an underlying model that explains the observed distribution, and whether the model should incorporate an inter-event dependence. The purpose of the present research is to integrate the dependence of consecutive waiting times into the power-law model. One can observe that social media behavior is characterized by periods of intensive activities separated by longer periods of inactivity. We propose an intuitive explanation to understand the observed dependence of subsequent waiting times. This leads us to create a model to incorporate memory. Our contribution is twofold. The first idea consists of separating the short waiting times - out of <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> power-law <b>distributions</b> - from the long ones. The model is further enhanced by introducing a two-state Markovian process to incorporate memory. Both contributions show a significant improvement for modeling commenting events on Twitter and Reddit...|$|R
40|$|Inter-organisational {{workflow}} (IOW) is {{a natural}} scenario for MAS (multiagent system) technologies. In particular, MAS coordination infrastructures can work as a general-purpose support for WfMSs (workflow management systems) : coordination artifacts can be specialised as workflow engines, encapsulating workflow rules {{expressed in terms of}} coordination laws. A network of inter-connected coordination artifacts can then be used to represent multiple, interdependent, distributed workflows, where malleability and linkability of artifacts fit the needs for dynamics in IOWs. After presenting a model of workflow engine based on ReSpecT tuple centres—taken here as examples of MAS coordination artifacts—, we introduce a distributed workflow architecture based on TuCSoN—a MAS coordination infrastructure using ReSpecT tuple centres—, exploiting a declarative workflow language, along with a <b>scoping</b> mechanism <b>for</b> workflow <b>distribution.</b> We show how this enables workflows to be dynamically governed and distributed upon a coordination infrastructure based on artifact linkability, first in theory, then in practice through an example of a VE (virtual enterprise) workflow built upon TuCSoN. 1...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} allocation of living marine resources among countries. We examine the principles <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> emanating from the global rules for ocean governance, review state practice, and consider some distributional effects of conservation measures. We find {{that it is difficult}} to ascertain the influence of the distribution principles with any greater degree of precision. The principles vary with regard to their ease of operationalization. Further, state practice shows that distributional principles serve to define the <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> a range of different distributional outcomes, but their relative importance remains elusive. Thus, distributional outcomes cannot be explained in terms of these principles alone. A measure of politics is always at play.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 1992 Bulgarian {{household}} budget survey, the authors analyze the structure of income in Bulgaria, identifying who the poor are {{and how they are}} reached by the social safety net. Their main findings about household incomes: (a) Social transfers provide an extremely large component - 24 percent - of household income per capita. That is roughly {{on a par with the}} share in other Eastern European countries but more than 40 percent higher than the share of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. (b) Wage earnings have declined as a source of income, reflecting the counteraction of the state sector. Wage income in Bulgaria has declined to only half the OECD level. (c) Income from self-employment has increased, reflecting the surge in small-scale retail establishments. Income is considerably less concentrated in Bulgaria than in other lower-middle-income countries. The author's main findings about the poor (the bottom 20 percent in terms of household income) : The head of household in a poor home tends to be older, a woman, poorly educated, and unemployed. Poor households are not necessarily larger households in Bulgaria, unlike in other developing countries. The sources of income in poor Bulgarian households reflect other findings: (a) The poor depend for more than half their income on social benefits (especially pensions), indicating the importance of the social safety net. (b) The social safety net is not well targeted. Most social benefits are pro-poor, in the sense that they improve income distribution, but many benefits accrue to better-off households. There is substantial <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> better <b>distribution</b> of income. The authors conclude that comprehensive reform of social benefits is needed, focusing on pensions, unemployment benefits, child allowances, and social assistance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to, based on {{qualitative}} interviews with managers and group interviews with care providers, understand their interpretation of integrity and also their <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action to satisfy disable people’s integrity at sheltered housing for adults. The questions of this study are: How do the managers and the care providers interpret the concept of integrity? Which <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action do they have to satisfy the integrity of disabled people? Method: Individual – and group interviews have been used as methods to gather empirical data. Theory: The theories of <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action and integrity as a theoretical conception have been used to analyze the empirical material. Results: The informants of this study found it difficult to give a specific definition of integrity. The main aspects we could distinguish were that integrity was interpreted as a personal sphere and self-determination. The result of this study shows that the <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action to satisfy the integrity of disabled people is affected by many factors. First of all the <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action is affected by the Swedish law LSS and the assignment within the organization. The <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action is also affected by individual adaption for each person. This study shows the importance of the relationship between the managers, care providers and the persons. At last the informants emphasize some dilemmas in their <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> action to satisfy the integrity...|$|R

Otherwise, there is <b>scope</b> <b>for</b> cross-ownership provided that spillovers are sufficiently large.
