5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based <b>soaps</b> have a higher melting point than other alkali <b>soaps,</b> and are less corrosive than calcium based <b>soaps.</b> The small demand for lithium <b>soaps</b> and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E

5|$|During his {{production}} tenure on Children's Ward, Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs, particularly for soap operas; his {{intention was to}} eventually work on the popular and long-running Granada soap Coronation Street.
