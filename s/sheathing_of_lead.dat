40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to report 2 {{patients}} (3 eyes) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) who showed marked <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles that was ultimately attributed to calcification following vitrectomy. Cases: Case 1 involved a 65 -year-old female with PDR who underwent bilateral vitrectomy for traction retinal detachment. Postoperatively, bilateral retinal redetachment (reRD) was observed. <b>Sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles was observed at the same time, yet was not apparent preoperatively. Case 2 involved a 71 -year-old female with PDR who underwent vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage. Postoperatively, reRD was observed, and fundus findings showed <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles. In both patients, silicone oil tamponade and retinopexy were performed at reoperation, but <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal arterioles persisted postoperatively. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed that retinal blood flow was maintained, and no vessel leakage occurred. In addition, no <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> the retinal veins was observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a higher intensity for retinal arterioles with sheathing than for normal retinal arterioles. Conclusion: Vessel sheathing in our 2 patients (3 eyes) differed from the sheathing seen in vasculitis. Based on the hyperintensity on OCT, this sheathing may have been due to retinal artery calcification induced by hypoxia and inflammation associated with reRD...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{stability}} and strength of cold-formed and perforated steel sigma-section columns with steel <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> different thickness. Ceilings with and without steel <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> different thickness are tested to failure in compression on a laboratory machine, which was based on a manual hydraulic jack. Series of 4 experiments with full-scale walls (2. 5 m height) were carried out. Also, for examination of the role of boundary conditions, the sheet in a ceiling is either left free or connected to base with screws. In civil engineering there are many experiments and methodologies for calculating the strength and buckling of ceiling with the <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> various materials, such as oriented strand board and gypsum board. However, for producing superstructures of ships the materials with high plastic properties and strength characteristics are required. For example steel possesses such properties. It was the main reason for conducting a series of experiments and studying the behavior of cold-formed steel columns with steel sheathing. During the experiments the deformation of the cross-section of three equally spaced cross sections was determined, as well as the axial deformation of the central column in the ceiling with steel sheathing. The test results showed the influence of the thickness <b>of</b> <b>sheathing</b> and boundary condition of a sheet on the strength and buckling of ceiling. According to the results of the tests it is necessary to evaluate the impact <b>of</b> the <b>sheathing</b> made <b>of</b> different materials and if necessary to carry out further tests...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} four chosen types <b>of</b> {{vertical}} <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> {{houses in the}} passive standard and their overall thermo-technical and economic evaluation. At first, the materials which {{may be used in}} wood constructions <b>of</b> vertical <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> a house are described. Further, a design and thermo-technical assessment of each of the structures is performed. Wooden structures using environmentally friendly insulation are designed for three types <b>of</b> vertical <b>sheathing</b> and the system Ytong with external insulation is proposed for the fourth type, currently often used in the construction of passive houses in the Czech Republic. In order to comprehensively assess the building envelope, the composition of the roof and floor on the ground will be designed. The other part deals with the evaluation of the building envelope, separately for all four vertical sheathing options. An economic comparison of the envelope options based on the creation of itemized budgets will be carried out. Finally, {{the pros and cons of}} using each of the proposed envelope compositions will be evaluated...|$|R

60|$|There was {{a speedy}} <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> weapons at the king's command; {{for those who}} had {{hitherto}} been brandishing them in loyal bravado, began thereby to call to mind the extreme dislike which his Majesty nourished against naked steel, a foible which seemed to be as constitutional as his timidity, and was usually ascribed to the brutal murder of Rizzio having been perpetrated in his unfortunate mother's presence before he yet saw the light.|$|R
50|$|Their hulls were {{a complex}} {{sandwich}} structure, consisting of an inner layer of oak ribs 24 in thick, a 1.5 in iron skin, 6 in of oak support and backing for the armour, an armour layer of 4.5 to 5.5 inches (114-140 mm) in thickness, {{and a thin}} <b>sheathing</b> <b>of</b> anti-fouling Muntz metal.

5000|$|The {{structure}} {{was made from}} poplar logs, squared and closely notched at the corners.
