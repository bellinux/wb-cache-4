50|$|In {{case of a}} free <b>liquid</b> <b>surface</b> {{in contact}} with air, {{buoyancy}} and surface tension effects will {{also play a role}} in how the convection patterns develop. Liquids flow from places of lower surface tension to places of higher surface tension. This is called the Marangoni effect. When applying heat from below, the temperature at the top layer will show temperature fluctuations. With increasing temperature, surface tension decreases. Thus a lateral flow of <b>liquid</b> at the <b>surface</b> will take place, from warmer areas to cooler areas. In order to preserve a horizontal (or nearly horizontal) <b>liquid</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>cooler</b> <b>surface</b> <b>liquid</b> will descend. This down-welling of <b>cooler</b> <b>liquid</b> contributes to the driving force of the convection cells. The specific case of temperature gradient-driven surface tension variations is known as thermo-capillary convection, or Bénard-Marangoni convection.|$|R

New hazards have arisen from protective gear that was intended to increase survival time of firefighters while finding and rescuing victims. The insulation is so good now that a firefighter's metabolic heat buildup cannot escape. This forces body core temperatures to life threatening levels in about 20 minutes of moderate activity. Using NASA space suit technology, Oceaneering Space Systems developed a <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> garment prototype that will remove up to 250 watts of metabolic heat.

30|$|Later, a {{group at}} POSTECH (South Korea) {{investigated}} the flow boiling CHF of nanofluids under saturated conditions [40, 41]. To visualize liquid-vapor two-phase structures in nanofluid flow boiling, {{they used a}} rectangular channel made of transparent strengthened acryl with a cross-sectional area of 10 × 5 mm (width × height). The working fluid was heated only on a short-heated surface (a disk with a diameter of 10 mm) placed {{at the bottom of}} the flow channel, and a maximum CHF enhancement of 40 % was achieved. It was reported using the visualization results that the existence of nanoparticle deposition alters the wetted fraction of the heating <b>surface</b> by <b>cooling</b> <b>liquid</b> under forced convection, delaying the occurrence of the CHF.|$|R

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{supported}} by Ericsson to conduct research on immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> of electronics. By this technology, the liquid will be {{in direct contact with}} the electronics. The research begins with investigations in industrial background, literature review and theory in heat transfer. According to the knowledge from those investigations, different <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems including indirect, direct and immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems are introduced. The experiment consists of three parts: air cooling, single-phase and two-phase <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Those three parts are with the same test board with adjustable heat resources in the same geometry. In the first part, an air flow channel is used for testing air cooling, by which immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> can be compared to traditional technology. In the second part, an immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> system is designed and constructed with detailed explanation. Liquid NovecTM 7200 is used as working liquid. In the third part, a huge number of data has been collected during the whole process of boiling, through which a boiling curve for NovecTM 7200 has been acquired. Then comparisons between those three technologies have been made. The feasibility of immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> on an industrial scale has also been discussed. Based on the experiments and analyses, a careful conclusion that electronics with <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> has a larger heat flux limit than with today’s air cooling but with some practical problems can be drawn...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A thick flowing {{layer of}} liquid (e. g., flibe—a molten salt, or Sn 80 Li 20 —a liquid metal) protects the {{structural}} {{walls of the}} magnetic fusion configuration {{so that they can}} last the life of the plant even with intense 14 MeV neutron bombardment from the D-T fusion reaction. The surface temperature of the liquid rises as it passes from the inlet nozzles to the exit nozzles due to absorption of line and bremsstrahlung radiation, and neutrons. The surface temperature can be reduced by enhanced turbulent convection of hot <b>surface</b> <b>liquid</b> into the <b>cooler</b> interior. This surface temperature is affected by the temperature of liquid from a heat transport and energy recovery system. The evaporative flux from the wall driven by the surface temperature must also result in an acceptable impurity level in the core plasma. The shielding of the core by the edge plasma is modeled with a 2 D-transport code for the DT and impurity ions; these impurity ions are either swept out to the divertor, or diffuse to the hot plasma core. An auxiliary plasma between the edge plasma and the liquid wall may further attenuate evaporating flux of atoms and molecules by ionization near the wall. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Three-dimensional (3 D) {{circuits}} reduce communication de-lay in multicore SoCs, {{and enable}} efficient integration of cores, memories, sensors, and RF devices. However, vertical integration of layers exacer-bates {{the reliability and}} thermal problems, and cooling efficiency becomes a limiting factor. <b>Liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> is a solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems imposed by multi-layer architectures. In this paper, we first provide a 3 D thermal simulation model including <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling,</b> supporting both fixed and variable fluid injection rates. Our model has been integrated in HotSpot to study the impact on multicore SoCs. We design and evaluate several dynamic management policies that complement <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Our results for 3 D multicore SoCs, {{which are based on}} 3 D versions of UltraSPARC T 1, show that thermal management approaches that combine <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> with proactive task allocation are extremely effective in preventing temperature problems.
