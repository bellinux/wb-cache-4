40|$|Since the {{characteristics}} of wireless channel are open and broadcasting, wireless networks are very vulnerable to be attacked via eavesdropping, jamming, and interference. As traditional <b>secure</b> <b>technologies</b> are not suitable for PHY layer of wireless networks, physical-layer security issues become a focus of attention. In this paper, we firstly identify and summarize the threats and vulnerabilities in PHY layer of wireless networks. Then, we give a holistic overview of PHY layer secure schemes, which are divided into three categories: spatial domain-based, time domain-based, and frequency domain-based. Along the way, we analyze {{the pros and cons}} of current <b>secure</b> <b>technologies</b> in each category. In addition, we also conclude the techniques and methods used in these categories and point out the open research issues and directions in this area...|$|R

50|$|The third {{system of}} stored-value phonecards is chip cards, first {{launched}} {{on a large}} scale in 1986 in Germany by Deutsche Bundespost after three years of testing, and in France by France Télécom. Many other countries followed suit, including Ireland in 1990 and the UK circa 1994-1995, which phased out the old green Landis+Gyr cards in favor of the chip (smart) cards. The initial microchips were easy to hack, typically by scratching off the programming-voltage contact on the card, which rendered the phone unable to reduce the card's value after a call. But by the mid-to-late 1990s, highly <b>secure</b> <b>technology</b> aided the spread of chip phonecards worldwide.|$|E

50|$|Public-private partnership. As the U.S. {{government}} {{gets more}} involved in the development of IT products, many companies worry this may stifle their innovation, even undermining efforts to develop more <b>secure</b> <b>technology</b> products. New legislative proposals now being considered by the U.S. Congress could be potentially intrusive on private industry, which may prevent enterprises from responding effectively to emerging and changing threats. Cyber attacks and security breaches are increasing in frequency and sophistication, they are targeting organizations and individuals with malware and anonymization techniques that can evade current security controls. Current perimeter-intrusion detection, signature-based malware, and anti-virus solutions are providing little defense. Relatively few organizations have recognized organized cyber criminal networks, rather than hackers, as their greatest potential cyber security threat; even fewer are prepared to address this threat.|$|E
