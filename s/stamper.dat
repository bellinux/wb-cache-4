5|$|<b>Stamper</b> {{was fully}} {{occupied}} with work for Ziegfeld until 1927, when Gene Buck hired <b>Stamper</b> {{to write the}} music for Take The Air (1927). He also worked for the Schubert organization on Lovely Lady (1927) before returning to Ziegfeld for the 1931 Follies.|$|E
5|$|Development of Alien 8 began {{immediately}} {{after the release of}} Knight Lore, in which the <b>Stamper</b> brothers predicted that publishers would attempt to copy Knight Lore Filmation technology in other games. As with its predecessor, the <b>Stamper</b> brothers developed the game in monochrome to avoid visual overlay and attribute clash, as it was a common processing limitation in early 8-bit consoles. However, the Amstrad release exclusively displayed dual-colours.|$|E

5000|$|A record {{press is}} a machine for {{manufacturing}} vinyl records. It {{is essentially a}} hydraulic press fitted with thin nickel <b>stampers</b> which are negative impressions of a master disc. Labels and a pre-heated vinyl patty (or [...] "biscuit") are placed in a heated mold cavity. Two <b>stampers</b> are used, {{one for each of}} side of the disc. The record press closes under a pressure of about 150 tons. The process of compression molding forces the hot vinyl to fill the grooves in the <b>stampers,</b> and take the form of the finished record.|$|R

5|$|<b>Stamper</b> {{was working}} as a pianist rather than as a {{songwriter}} at the time the song appeared but never learned how to read or write using traditional music notation thus he would have not been able submit the song for copyright, or produce sheet music to prove his claim. Bayes and Norworth compelled <b>Stamper</b> at one point to wear stage make-up to appear Japanese, apparently to keep him from being interviewed by reporters.|$|E
5|$|The Follies of 1919 found <b>Stamper</b> {{branching}} out into writing lyrics {{as well as}} writing comic sketches. 1919 was a very busy year, with <b>Stamper</b> writing songs for the Follies {{as well as the}} Midnight Frolic and the Ziegfeld Nine O'Clock Review both of which appeared in a theater {{on the roof of the}} New Amsterdam theater.|$|E
5000|$|The DMM copper {{master disc}} can be plated {{to produce the}} {{required}} number of <b>stampers</b> using the one-step plating process. Rather than having to electroform a master (or [...] "father"), mother and then <b>stampers</b> (the traditional [...] "three-step process"), the DMM copper disc serves as the 'mother". Bypassing the silvering process and two electroforming stages {{reduces the risk of}} introducing noise that can be generated in the electroforming (galvanic) process. In cases where hundreds of <b>stampers</b> may be required, the DMM disc is often used as a mandrel to electroform a master and mother, from which many <b>stampers</b> are then made. Chemical passivation of the metal surface of each part precludes [...] "plating," [...] so the parts can be mechanically separated from each other upon removal from the tank.|$|R

5|$|Ultimate Play the Game {{was founded}} by {{brothers}} Tim and Chris <b>Stamper,</b> along with Tim's wife, Carol, from their headquarters in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1982. Under the trading name of Ultimate Play the Game, they began producing multiple video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s. Prior to founding Ultimate, the <b>Stamper</b> brothers had backgrounds in designing arcade machines, but no marketing experience in the video game sector.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the master}} was the unique {{source of the}} positive, made to produce the <b>stampers,</b> it was {{considered}} a library item. Accordingly, copy positives, required to replace worn positives, were made from unused early <b>stampers.</b> These were known as copy shells, and were the physical equivalent of the first positive.|$|R

5|$|Lunar Jetman was Ultimate Play the Game's {{first game}} to require 48K of RAM — all {{previous}} productions had run on unexpanded 16K models. The game {{was written by}} Chris <b>Stamper</b> with graphics designed by Tim <b>Stamper.</b> It was met with critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its addictive gameplay and wide range of colours. The game {{was followed by a}} third episode, , released for the NES in 1990. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Rare Replay was {{announced}} during the Microsoft press {{conference at the}} June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The reveal was leaked in the hours prior to the show. The compilation was released as an Xbox One exclusive worldwide on August 4, 2015. There are no plans for a Windows 10 release or downloadable content additions. While Rare's founders, the <b>Stamper</b> brothers, were not interviewed in the bonus features, Tim <b>Stamper</b> appeared in a Develop interview set {{to coincide with the}} compilation's release. Rare also added a tie-in wherein Rare Replay owners unlocked the Battletoads character Rash as a playable character in the 2013 fighting game Killer Instinct during a limited test period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stamper</b> {{continued}} as principal songwriter for the Follies of 1920 through 1925, {{with an additional}} summer edition in 1923. He returned for the Follies of 1931, the last edition produced by Florenz Ziegfeld himself.|$|E

5000|$|The initial {{years of}} the company were against a {{background}} of political turmoil (Jameson Raid, Second Boer War), various economic difficulties and huge investments. By 1888 the company had built a crushing or stamp mill with 25 <b>stampers.</b> The plant was further expanded to 100 <b>stampers</b> by 1895 and 320 <b>stampers</b> by 1899. Gold production at the mine reached its peak in 1922. By 1935 Simmer & Jack had processed 27,000,000 tons of rock and extracted 7.8 million ounces of gold for a gross profit of £10 million. In 1965 Goldfields sold their shares as the gold deposits were almost exhausted. The original mine was closed down in 1969.|$|R
5|$|The game centres around Donkey Kong and {{his nephew}} Diddy Kong, who must recover their stolen hoard of bananas from King K. Rool and the Kremlings. Development {{of the game}} first began shortly after Rare's Tim and Chris <b>Stamper</b> ran {{experiments}} with a Silicon Graphics workstation, rendering realistic 3D sprites. Nintendo became interested in Rare's work and soon acquired 49% of the company which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology for the SNES console. The <b>Stamper</b> brothers expressed an interest to create a standalone Donkey Kong game, and assembled a team of 12 to work on the game over an 18-month development cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} written by Chris <b>Stamper,</b> and {{graphics}} were designed by Tim <b>Stamper.</b> Alien 8 uses the same image masking technique as Knight Lore, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered isometric projection. The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game's graphics and innovation, however minor criticism was directed at its similarities to Knight Lore.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were designed by Bob Thomas, whereas the code was written by Dave Thomas. The Thomas brothers decided to show their progress {{of the game}} to Tim and Chris <b>Stamper</b> for evaluation, despite feeling embarrassed due to their workspace being inside their parents' attic. Impressed by the game, the <b>Stamper</b> brothers commissioned an entire series to be released for the Commodore 64. Dave Thomas recalled that every game they produced was met with little interference from Ultimate; once a game was complete, it {{would be sent to}} quality assessment and subsequently published for release.|$|E

5|$|While {{his work}} with Ziegfeld {{encompassed}} {{the majority of his}} working life, <b>Stamper</b> and Gene Buck worked for other producers as well. He had songs in two plays - When Claudia Smiles (1914) and Broadway and Buttermilk (1916) prior to traveling to London with Buck to write songs for Zig Zag! which ran for 648 performances at the London Hippodrome. <b>Stamper</b> returned to London in 1918 to write songs for another review Box O' Tricks with Frederick Chapelle, which ran for 625 performances. During his first trip to London, Buck befriended a man {{who turned out to be}} a German spy. Two results of this event were fellow passenger Eddie Rickenbacker deciding to enlist to fly, and Dave <b>Stamper</b> having to prove to British police and a Judge that his pages covered with numbers were sheet music rather than a code.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-year}} courtship, Microsoft {{acquired}} Rare in 2002, and the Stampers {{left the company}} {{at the end of}} 2006. Tim Stamper's wife continued to work for the company. The brothers were inconspicuous in the public eye for the next decade. Chris <b>Stamper</b> purchased the Eydon Hall estate for £17m in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Cobra Triangle was {{developed}} by Rare. Mark Betteridge and Tim and Chris <b>Stamper</b> designed the game and David Wise wrote its soundtrack. Nintendo released Cobra Triangle in July 1989. It was later included in the August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Rare titles, Rare Replay.|$|E

5000|$|After {{removing}} the silver deposit and passifying (see below), the metal master was then electroplated (electroformed) to create metal positive matrices, or [...] "mothers". From these positives, <b>stampers</b> (negatives) would be formed. Producing mothers {{was similar to}} electroforming Masters, except the time allowed to turn-up to full current was much shorter and the heavier Mothers could be produced {{in as little as}} one hour and <b>stampers</b> (145 grams) could be made in 45 minutes.|$|R
