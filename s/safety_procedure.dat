5000|$|Lockout-tagout (LOTO) or {{lock and}} tag is a <b>safety</b> <b>procedure</b> {{which is used}} in {{industry}} and research settings to ensure that dangerous machines are properly shut off and not able to be started up again prior to the completion of maintenance or servicing work. It requires that hazardous energy sources be [...] "isolated and rendered inoperative" [...] before work is started on the equipment in question. The isolated power sources are then locked and a tag {{is placed on the}} lock identifying the worker who has placed it. The worker then holds the key for the lock ensuring that only he or she can start the machine. This prevents accidental startup of a machine while it is in a hazardous state or while a worker is in direct contact with it.|$|E

5000|$|While Heinrich's {{figure that}} 88 {{percent of all}} {{workplace}} accidents and injuries/illnesses are caused by [...] "man-failure" [...] is perhaps his most oft-cited conclusion, his book actually encouraged employers to control hazards, not merely focus on worker behaviors.

[...] Emphasizing this aspect of workplace safety, Heinrich devoted 100 pages of his work {{to the subject of}} machine guarding.
