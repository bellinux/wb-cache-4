50|$|When <b>sulphanilic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is added}} (in the picture its {{sulphonamide}} is shown instead), the nitrites form a diazonium salt. When the azo dye agent (N-alpha-naphthyl-ethylenediamine) is formed a pink colour develops. This diamine {{is used in}} place of the simpler and cheaper alpha-naphthylamine because this latter is a potent carcinogen and moreover the diamine forms a more polar and hence a much more soluble dye in acidic aqueous medium.|$|E

The autoimmune response induced following injections of arsanil—sulphanil-thyroglobulin was re-stimulated {{by a single}} injection of native thyroglobulin given at a later time; however, multiple injections failed to re-stimulate and the lesions disappeared. The ability to produce autoimmune thyroiditis by injections of aqueous preparations of arsanil—sulphanil-thyroglobulin appeared to be highly dependent on the injection schedule and/or the injection dose...|$|R
40|$|Periodic {{injections}} of aqueous preparations of thyroglobulin coupled to the diazonium derivatives of arsanilic and <b>sulphanilic</b> <b>acids</b> (arsanil–sulphanil thyroglobulin) resulted in perpetuation {{of both the}} synthesis of circulating antibody to native thyroglobulin and thyroiditis. Two months after the last injection, the rabbits made a strong immune response to a subsequent injection of native thyroglobulin. Without the periodic injections both circulating antibody and thyroid lesions disappeared {{and the ability to}} respond to native thyroglobulin was lost. The level of circulating antibody and the incidence and severity of lesions were considerably greater in rabbits receiving periodic injections over a 6 -month period of time than in rabbits given a series of injections during a period of 1 month. The relation of these findings to the progressive nature of some autoimmune diseases is discussed. Complex-induced renal injury, secondary to the immune response to arsanil–sulphanil thyroglobulin, was observed in the rabbits given the periodic injections over a 6 -month period of time. Chronic glomerulonephritis apparently resulted from deposition of thyroglobulin–anti-thyroglobulin complexes and complement along the glomerular basement membranes...|$|R
40|$|Various monocotyledenous and {{dicotyledonous}} {{plants have}} been examined and found to possess an enzyme capable of deaminating 3, 4 -dihydroxypheny (DOPA) {{with the formation of}} transcaffeic acid. The activity of this enzyme in barley, dandelion and wheat is relatively high, whereas in broad-bean leaves it is low and in potato tubers tissues, negligible. It is possible that in the broad-bean, this low activity may be, at least in part, responsible for the high concentration of DOPA in the tissues. Broad-bean leaves also contain a tyrosine deaminase. It has been shown that "foreign" phenols can move rapidly up and down the stems of broad-bean plants and that glucosylation of many of these compounds readily occurs. Phenols fed into the cut ends of the main veins of leaves quickly appear in the sieve tubes of the stem. This has been proved by the use of the aphid, Macrosiphium pisi. Aphid techniques have also strongly suggested that the sieve tubes of broad-bean and willow normally contain phenolic compounds. The reaction of boron trichloride and methanol on cinnamic acid derivatives has been Investigated in detail and a procedure has been devised which aids the identification of these acids in plant tissues. Using this method all glycosidie, esterified and methoxylated derivatives are converted to the corresponding mono-, di-, or tri-hydroxyxy-methyl cinnamates which can be identified on paper chromatograms or electrophoretograms. Thus the cinnamic acids present can be classified into {{one or more of these}} families. The paper electrophoretic examination of high molecular weight phenols as azo dye derivatives has also been investigated. These phenols have been coupled with dizaotised p-aminobenzoic or diazotised <b>sulphanilic</b> <b>acids.</b> The resulting dyes possess strongly dissociated acidic groupings and therefore exhibit relatively high electrophoretic mobilities in comparison with the unsubstituted phenols. <p...|$|R

A new pK(_a) value of l. 4 is reported for sulphanilamide. A study of the diazotisation of <b>sulphanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and sulphanilamide in the presence of Cl¯, Br¯, SCN¯, and SC(NH(_ 2)) (_ 2) shows that the general catalytic trend Cl¯ NOBr >; NOSCN >NOS(^+) C(NH(_ 2)) (_ 2) is followed. No catalysis was observed in the case of 2, 4 =dinitroaniline and this has-been interpreted in terms of a rapid reversible nitrosation in which the rate of the denitrosation step is greater than the rate of decomposition of the intermediate nitrosammonium ion. The bimolecular rate constants obtained for <b>sulphanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and sulphanilamide approach the diffusion controlled limit for this process in the case of NOCl and NOBr, Also reported is a study of the diazotisation of two heteroaromatic amines: 2 -amino- 5 -nitrothiazole and 3 -amino-l, 2, 4 -triazoleo Catalysis by acid and the nucleophiles Cl¯ and SCN¯ has been observed.

The preparation of this pure acid with a good yield offers some difucuties. By sulphonating aminoazobenzene a product may be obtained, which consists mostly of the same monosulphoryic acid, but contains also some of disulphonic acid and possibly isomeric monosulphoryic acid.

The quantification limits were 38. 250 µg g- 1 for Zn, 4. 550 µg g- 1 for Fe, 1. 562 µg g- 1 for Pb, 1. 450 µg g- 1 for Ni, and 0. 439 µg g- 1 for Cu. The determinations, in lubricating oil, showed good precision and accuracy with recoveries between 90 and 110 %, indicating a negligible matrix effect in the experiments using addition of analyte, with relative standard deviation lower than 5 %. The results for analysis of wastewater contamined by theses lubricants showed a very high relative standard deviation...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{accurate}} and precise spectrophotometric method for the detn. of atenolol is described. The method {{based on the}} oxidization of drug by a known excess of chloramine-T followed by the estn. of the unreacted oxidant by a charge-transfer complexation reaction involving metol and <b>sulphanilic</b> <b>acid.</b> The reacted oxidant amt. corresponds to the drug content. The colored species exhibits max. absorbance at 520 nm. Beer's law is obeyed between for 2. 5 and 25 Î¼g ml- 1 with an apparent molar absorptivity of 3. 24 Ã� 103 1 mol- 1 cm- 1 and a Sandell sensitivity of 82. 10 ng cm- 2. The linear regression equation of the calibration graph is A = 0. 45 - 0. 012 C with a linear regression coeff. of - 0. 9715. The limits of detection and quantification are 2. 34 and 7. 79 Î¼g ml- 1, resp. The methods were applied satisfactorily to the detn. of atenolol in pure drug and in tablets. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Preparations of enzymically {{dispersed}} rat pancreatic cells hydrolyse {{externally added}} nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates at high {{rates in the}} presence of Mg 2 + or Ca 2 +. The lack of response to specific inhibitors and activators differentiates this hydrolytic activity from that of other well-characterized ion-transporting ATPases. Studies based on inactivation of this hydrolytic activity by the covalently reacting, slowly permeating probe diazotized <b>sulphanilic</b> <b>acid</b> indicated that this nucleoside tri- and di-phosphatase is primarily a plasma-membrane ecto-enzyme. It is the major ATPase activity associated with intact cells, homogenates and isolated plasma-membrane fractions. Concanavalin A stimulates this ATPase activity of intact cells and isolated plasma-membrane fractions. The insensitivity of this ATPase activity to univalent ions and inhibitors of pancreatic electrolyte secretion, taken together with the evidence that the active site is externally located, suggests that this enzyme is not directly involved in HCO 3 - secretion in the pancreas. Its actual function remains unknown...|$|E
