40|$|Targeted {{optimization}} of <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> {{can provide}} an additional program speedup over the highest default optimization level, such as-O 3 in GCC. The key challenge is how to automatically search for performance sensitive <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> in a given code, to which a customized sequence of optimization compiler options could be applied. In this {{paper we propose a}} method based on both program syntax and architecture-dependent behavioral similarity of <b>program</b> <b>segments,</b> which addresses the above challenge. First we create a <b>program</b> <b>segment</b> pattern database and a proxy segment template database which are built in the underlying compiler. The modified compiler identifies optimization-friendly <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> in input <b>programs</b> using the syntax structure similarity between the candidate <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> and the pre-build <b>program</b> <b>segment</b> patterns. The identified <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> are then filtered using the architecture-dependent behavior similarity to the pre-build proxy segment templates. These identified <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> are those pieces of input code, which can be custom optimized to improve the overall program performance. The method is evaluated and tested on the Intel XScale PXA 255 platform using randomly selected benchmarks. The experimental results show that our method can provide additional speedups over the highes...|$|R
40|$|Safe measurement-based WCET {{estimation}} This paper {{explores the}} {{issues to be}} addressed to provide safe worst-case execution time (WCET) estimation methods based on measurements. We suggest to use structural testing for the exhaustive exploration of paths in a program. Since test data generation is in general too complex {{to be used in}} practice for most real-size programs, we propose to generate test data for <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> only, using <b>program</b> clustering. Moreover, to be able to combine execution time of <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> and to obtain the WCET of the whole program, we advocate the use of compiler techniques to reduce (ideally eliminate) the timing variability of <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> and to make the time of <b>program</b> <b>segments</b> independent from one another. 1...|$|R

Programs can be any time, and can involve any number of chapters (including both AZA and BBG together).|$|R

50|$|The 80386 and its successors fully {{support the}} 16-bit {{segments}} of the 80286 but also segments for 32-bit address offsets (using the new 32-bit width of the main registers). If the base address of all 32-bit segments is set to 0, and segment registers are not used explicitly, the segmentation can be forgotten and the processor appears as having a simple linear 32-bit address space. Operating systems like Windows or OS/2 provide the possibility to run 16-bit (<b>segmented)</b> <b>programs</b> as well as 32-bit programs. The former possibility exists for backward compatibility and the latter is usually meant {{to be used for}} new software development.|$|R
