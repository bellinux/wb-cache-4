5|$|Music {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} musical production in Scotland between the early <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> and the mid-eighteenth century. In this period the court followed the European trend for instrumental accompaniment and playing. Scottish monarchs of the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> were patrons of religious and secular music, and some were accomplished musicians. In the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> the playing of a musical instrument and singing became an expected accomplishment of noble men and women. The departure of James VI to rule in London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, meant that the Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle largely fell into disrepair and {{the major source of}} patronage was removed from the country. Important composers of the early <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> included Robert Carver and David Peebles. The Lutheranism of the early Reformation was sympathetic to the incorporation of Catholic musical traditions and vernacular songs into worship, exemplified by The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567). However, the Calvinism that came to dominate Scottish Protestantism led to the closure of song schools, disbanding of choirs, removal of organs and the destruction of music books and manuscripts. An emphasis was placed on the Psalms, resulting in the production of a series of Psalters {{and the creation of a}} tradition of unaccompanied singing.|$|E

5|$|The {{lower portion}} of the river, from the sea to Ford, was navigable in the {{eleventh}} century {{at the time of}} the Norman conquest. In the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel built wharves at Ford, and improved the river channel below there, so that the town became a port. Over the 30 years from 1544, he also improved the river as far upstream as Pallingham Quay. Although the work involved a number of flash locks, which were not very successful, no tolls were charged for its use, and vessels of around 15 tons were used to carry timber. Attempts to make the river navigable up to Newbridge in the early <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> were not successful.|$|E

5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages, the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague, may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Almost half the years in the second half of the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597â€“1609.|$|E
