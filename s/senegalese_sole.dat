En equilibrio con el medio ambiente. 21 - 24 noviembre 2011, BarcelonaThe {{aquaculture}} of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> is {{hampered by}} the absence of methods to control reproduction, particularly of male fish reared in captivity. Teleost reproduction is regulated by the pituitary gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (Fsh) and luteinizing hormone (Lh), but the mode of action of these hormones during <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> spermatogenesis is poorly known. Here, we aimed at producing <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> single-chain recombinant Fsh (rFshsc) and Lh (rLhsc). The cDNAs encoding the recombinant gonadotropins were introduced into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and stably expressing clones were selected for their production efficiency. The rFshsc and rLhsc were found to be glycosylated when released in the culture medium. Transactivation assays using <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> gonadotropin receptors indicated that rFshsc and rLhsc are active on their cognate receptors but also some cross reaction is observed. This preliminary study demonstrates that CHO cells are useful systems for producing functional recombinant gonadotropins, and offers new tools for the aquaculture of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> and the investigation of its reproductive endocrinology.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole,</b> Solea senegalensis, is {{a highly}} prized {{flatfish}} of growing commercial interest for aquaculture in Southern Europe. However, despite the industrial production of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> being hampered primarily by lack {{of information on the}} physiological mechanisms involved in reproduction, growth and immunity, very limited genomic information is available on this species. Results Sequencing of a S. senegalensis multi-tissue normalized cDNA library, from adult tissues (brain, stomach, intestine, liver, ovary, and testis), larval stages (pre-metamorphosis, metamorphosis), juvenile stages (post-metamorphosis, abnormal fish), and undifferentiated gonads, generated 10, 185 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Clones were sequenced from the 3 '-end to identify isoform specific sequences. Assembly of the entire EST collection into contigs gave 5, 208 unique sequences of which 1, 769 (34 %) had matches in GenBank, thus showing a low level of redundancy. The sequence of the 5, 208 unigenes was used to design and validate an oligonucleotide microarray representing 5, 087 unique <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> transcripts. Finally, a novel interactive bioinformatic platform, Soleamold, was developed for the <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> EST collection as well as microarray and ISH data.

In the present work, we review recent studies addressing molecular, physiological and morphological aspects of the thermal plasticity of somatic growth in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> larvae and early juveniles, thus aiming to improve sole rearing in aquaculture production.

The vasa gene was characterised in turbot recipients using cDNA cloning. Smvasa mRNA was confirmed as a germ cell-specific molecular marker in this species. Smvasa expression analysis during turbot ontogeny was carried out before Senegalese soleTGCtransplants into turbot larvae. Turbot larvae at 18 days after hatching (DAH) proved to be susceptible to manipulation procedures. High survival rates (83. 75 ± 15. 90 - 100 %) were obtained for turbot larvae at 27, 34 and 42 DAH.

These parameters were assessed in larvae fed control and taurine supplemented microcapsules during the pelagic phase. Subsequently, a similar evaluation {{was carried out}} in newly settled larvae fed upon Artemia, in order to verify the effect of earlier dietary taurine supplementation in larvae reared under improved feeding conditions.

However, as for most fish species, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge concerning the influence of such biological rhythmon metabolic rate. The aim of this study was to determine whether individual variation in routine and fed metabolic rate was affected by daily light–dark rhythms in juveniles of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole.</b> The individual oxygen consumption measurements in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> juveniles were determined by flow-through respirometry, at fasted conditions and after the fish were fed a single meal, the meal time started at 0930 h and fish fed ad libitum for 30 min. The measurements were made during 22 h, of which 8 h was in the light and 14 h in the dark, and started immediately after transfer to the respiratory chambers at 1100 h. The results suggest an influence of light–dark cycles in routine metabolism. It was observed that oxygen consumption increased during the dark phase in fasted fish (FAST) but was higher during the light phase in fed fish (FEED).

40|$|Ponencia presentada en el Workshop "The Cultivation of Soles V" celebrado en Faro (Portugal) del 5 al 7 de abil de 2011 The {{reproduction}} of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> in captivity {{is not yet}} controlled. As a consequence, the timing of spawning {{as well as the}} viability of eggs and larvae, can not be predicted, which hampers the mass production of alevins of this species. The control of {{reproduction of}} captive males, specially of the F 1 generation, appears as one major bottleneck, since low or null fertilization rates as well as poor sperm quality are often encountered in hatcheries. The <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> presents unusual characteristics of testicular development showing spermatogenesis of a semi-cystic type (i. e., spermatocytes and spermatids are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, where they differentiate into spermatozoa) with production of only a few tens of microliters of sperm almost all-year around. Spermatogenesis in this species is thus `asynchronous¿ but the particularities of its hormonal control are poorly understood. This is partially caused by the absence of proper methods to determine the mode of action of the gonadotropins (FSH and LH), the main hormones regulating reproduction, in the gonad of this species. It is clear therefore that {{a deeper understanding of the}} endocrine regulation of spermatogenesis in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> is urgently needed. During the past few years, we have made significant advances in the knowledge of the reproductive biology of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> by isolating the cDNAs coding for the gonadotropin subunits and their gonad receptors. In addition, we determined their structural and functional features, and their expression patterns in the pituitary and testis, respectively, during spermatogenesis. These studies reported, for the first time in any teleost, the expression of the LH receptor in spermatids in addition to Leydig cells. This finding suggests that LH in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> might regulate the elongation of spermatids and transition to spermatozoa, thus allowing the recruitment of successive batches of spermatids, present in the testis of adult fish almost all year around, into spermiogenesis. The availability of the <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> cDNAs for gonadotropins and receptors has made it possible recently to produce single-chain recombinant gonadotropins (FSHsc and LHsc) through biotechnological methods. The sole FSHsc and LHsc may show improved stability and long half-life in vivo as it has been described for analogous hormones in mammals. Preliminary data indicate that sole FSHsc and LHsc can activate their cognate receptors in vitro, and therefore they may be useful tools to unravel the endocrine regulation of spermatogenesis in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole,</b> and to control gametogenesis and sexual maturation of captive animals.

The present {{study was conducted to}} establish the optimal level of dietary ARA for G 1 <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> broodstock, using as a reference the fatty acid profile of wild broodstock (gonads, liver and muscle). A total of 120 <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> broodstock were randomly distributed into 12 tanks (1 : 1 male and female) and fed in duplicate with six experimental diets containing increasing amounts of ARA (0. 7 %, 1. 6 %, 2. 3 %, 3. 2 %, 5. 0 %, and 6. 0 % of total fatty acids) for 9 months. The relative ARA levels in liver, muscle and male and female gonads {{at the end of the}} feeding period increased in a dose dependent manner. Dietary ARA was mainly incorporated and stored in testis or ovary, followed by liver and muscle. Fish fed 2. 3 % and 3. 2 % ARA showed no differences in the ARA content of testis, ovary and liver when compared to wild fish. In male fish, a significant increase in the levels of 22 : 4 n- 6 and 22 : 5 n- 6 fatty acids was also observed, which was consistent with the up-regulation of fatty acyl elongase (elovl 5) and desaturase (d 4 fad) transcript levels in the liver of fish fed 0. 7 %, 2. 3 % and 6 % ARA. These results suggest that dietary inclusion of 3. 2 % ARA during periods shorter than 9 months, or of 2. 3 % ARA for prolonged periods, can maintain optimal levels of tissue ARA in captive <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> broodstock. In addition, the data indicate that male <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> is able to elongate and desaturate ARA to 22 : 4 n- 6 and 22 : 5 n- 6, suggesting that these fatty acids may be important for male reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Aromatic {{amino acids}} (AA, {{phenylalanine}} and tyrosine) are the precursors of thyroid hormones, which regulate metamorphosis in all vertebrates. In fish, {{this is a}} critical developmental stage where physiological requirements for aromatic AA may increase. Therefore, it is possible that dietary aromatic AA supplementation may be beneficial to accomplish a successful transition from larvae to the juvenile stage. This work aimed to assess the effect of dietary aromatic AA supplementation on tyrosine metabolism in species with an accentuated (<b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole,</b> Solea senegalensis) and a less marked (gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata) metamorphosis. For this purpose, either species were fed Artemia and subsequently received or not an aromatic AA supplement through tube-feeding, together with a L-[U- 14 C] tyrosine marker, throughout metamorphosis. Tyrosine was elected as a tracer since the metabolic fate of this aromatic AA is directly linked to the production of thyroid hormones and metamorphosis. Results showed that dietary phenylalanine supplementation did not increase tyrosine retention in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> larvae during metamorphosis, suggesting that this species {{may not be able to}} biosynthesise tyrosine from phenylalanine at a sufficient rate to supply its physiological requirements until after metamorphosis. Furthermore, dietary tyrosine supplementation effectively increased tyrosine availability in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> body fluids at metamorphosis, most likely for coping with metamorphosis-related processes, such as production of thyroid hormones. Therefore, dietary tyrosine supplementation may be beneficial for <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> during metamorphosis. On the other hand, results indicated that gilthead seabream larvae do not seem to require an additional supply of aromatic AA during metamorphosis, probably because the physiological requirements for tyrosine do not increase during this developmental stage. The different results observed for <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> and gilthead seabream are probably related to the complexity of metamorphosis that each species undergoes and to the needs for production of thyroid hormones, which seems to affect aromatic AA requirements during this critical stage of development. These findings may be important for physiologists, fish nutritionists and for the flatfish aquaculture industry...|$|E

Moreover, it is intended to identify possible dietary AA imbalances occurring in normal hatchery conditions for both species.

Results The stability of 12 potential reference genes was examined during larval development in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea senegalensis) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) to determine the most suitable genes for qRT-PCR analysis. Transcription levels of genes encoding β-Actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde- 3 P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), annexin A 2 (ANXA 2), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT 1), ubiquitin (UBQ), elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF 1 A 1), 18 S ribosomal RNA, and the ribosomal proteins S 4 (RPS 4) and L 13 a (RPL 13 a) were quantitated. Two paralogous genes for ACTB were analyzed in each of both flatfish species. In addition, two paralogous genes for GAPDH were studied in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole.</b> RPL 13 a represented non-orthologous genes between both flatfish species.

Transcription levels of genes encoding 3 ̆b 2 -Actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde- 3 P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), annexin A 2 (ANXA 2), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT 1), ubiquitin (UBQ), elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF 1 A 1), 18 S ribosomal RNA, and the ribosomal proteins S 4 (RPS 4) and L 13 a (RPL 13 a) were quantitated. Two paralogous genes for ACTB were analyzed in each of both flatfish species. In addition, two paralogous genes for GAPDH were studied in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole.</b> RPL 13 a represented non-orthologous genes between both flatfish species. GeNorm and NormFinder analyses for expression stability revealed RPS 4, UBQ and eEF 1 A 1 as the most stable genes in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole,</b> Atlantic halibut and in a combined analysis. In all cases, paralogous genes exhibited differences in expression stability. Conclusion This work suggests RPS 4, UBQ, and eEF 1 A 1 genes as useful reference genes for accurate normalization in qRT-PCR studies in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> and Atlantic halibut larvae. The congruent results between both species in spite of the drastic differences in larval development suggest that selected housekeeping genes (HKGs) could be useful in other flatfish species. However, the finding of paralogous gene copies differentially expressed during development in some HKGs underscores the necessity to identify orthologous genes.

40|$|High {{levels of}} dietary lipids are {{incorporated}} in feeds for most teleost fish to promote growth and reduce nitrogen waste. However, in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea senegalensis) previous studies revealed that increasing {{the level of}} dietary lipids above 8 % negatively affect growth and nutrient utilization regardless of dietary protein content. It {{has been shown that}} glucose regulation and metabolism can be impaired by high dietary fat intake in mammals, but information in teleost fish is scarce. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the possible effect of dietary lipids on glucose metabolism in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> with special emphasis on the regulation of proteins involved in the muscle insulin-signalling pathway. <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> juveniles (29 g) were fed two isonitrogenous diets (53 % dry matter) for 88 days. These two diets were one with a high lipid level (, 17 %, HL) and a moderate starch content (, 14 %, LC), and the other being devoid of fish oil (4 % lipid, LL) and with high starch content (, 23 %, HC). Surprisingly, feeding <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> the HL/LC diet resulted in prolonged hyperglycaemia, while fish fed on LL/HC diet restored basal glycaemia 2 h after feeding. The hyperglycaemic phenotype was associated with greater glucose- 6 -phosphatase activity (a key enzyme of hepatic glucose production) and lower citrate synthase activity in the liver, with significantly higher liver glycogen content. Sole fed on HL/LC diet also had significantly lower hexokinase activity in muscle, although hexokinase activity was low with both dietary treatments. The HL/LC diet was associated with significant reductions in muscle AKT, p 70 ribosomal S 6 -K 1 Kinase (S 6 K- 1) and ribosomal protein S 6 (S 6) 2 h after feeding...|$|E

40|$|The interferon-stimulated gene 15 (Isg 15) is {{strongly}} induced by type I interferon (IFN I), viral infection, and double-stranded RNA (poly I:C) in several fish species, suggesting that Isg 15 protein {{could play a}} key role in fish innate immunity against viral diseases. Thus, the aim of the present study was to characterize the molecular structure and transcription pattern of the <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea senegalensis) Isg 15 gene in response to viral infections. The molecular characterization shows that the <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> Isg 15 gene codes for a typical Isg 15 protein of 165 aa, containing two ubiquitin-like domains and one conserved LRLRGG conjugating motif at the C-terminal end. The untranslated 5 ´-end region exhibited the structure of an IFN-stimulated gene promoter, with two interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE). Pairwise alignments based on deduced amino acid sequences showed homologous relationships (72. 5 - 74. 2 %) between the Isg 15 of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> and other pleuronectiforms. The Isg 15 transcription has been studied in head kidneys of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> inoculated with poly I:C and with different fish viruses: two Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia Virus (VHSV) isolates (highly pathogenic and non-pathogenic to sole), and one reassortant Viral Nervous Necrosis Virus (VNNV) isolate, composed of a RGNNV-type RNA 1 and a SJNNV-type RNA 2 (pathogenic to sole). These challenges showed that poly I:C induces Isg 15 transcription from 3 to 72 h post-injection (p. i.), whereas the induction in response to viral infections started at 24 - 48 h p. i. The fast induction of Isg 15 indicates the potential implication of this ISG in the antiviral state stablished by the IFN I system. On the other hand, the interaction between each virus and the IFN I system was evaluated in fish inoculated with poly I:C and subsequently (24 h later) challenged with the different viruses. This challenge showed a viral multiplication decrease in poly I:C treated animals compared with untreated fish. Besides, results showed that only both pathogenic isolates interfered negatively with the Isg 15 stimulation triggered by poly I:C. These results suggest that the Isg 15 might play an important role in host defense against RNA virus infection, and the pathogenic isolates used in this study may have mechanisms to evade or limit the <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> innate host defenses.

40|$|Fish tissues, {{particularly}} rich in n- 3 PUFA, {{are prone}} to lipid peroxidation that can damage cellular membranes, cause severe lesions and subsequently incidences of disease and mortality. However, fish possess antioxidant defences, such as vitamin E (VE) and antioxidant enzymes, to protect them against oxidative damage. This study investigated the effects of an increasing gradient of oxidized dietary lipid on the survival, growth performance, skeletogenesis and antioxidant defensive processes occurring in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea senegalensis) larvae. Four groups of fish were fed live prey enriched with experimental emulsions containing an increasing gradient of oxidized oil: non-oxidized, NO+VE, 34. 5 nmol MDA g(- 1) w. w.; mildly oxidized, MO+VE, 43. 1 nmol MDA g(- 1) w. w.; highly oxidized, HO+VE, 63. 3 nmol MDA g(- 1) w. w. and highly oxidized without VE, HO-VE, 78. 8 nmol MDA g(- 1) w. w. The oxidation levels increased in enriched rotifers following the oxidation gradient of the emulsions, but were not affected in enriched Artemia metanauplii. The oxidation status of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> larvae increased during development, {{but this was not}} related to the dietary treatments. The increasing dietary oxidation levels did not affect the fatty acid profile, survival, growth performance and metamorphosis processes of sole larvae. <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> seem to activate antioxidant defence mechanisms in response to the increasing amounts of dietary peroxidized lipids, in a manner efficiently enough to prevent detection of any alterations of these physiological processes. Antioxidant systems and detoxification mechanisms appeared to occur through the consumption of dietary a-tocopherol, the activation of the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase) and the retention of oxidized fat in the intestinal enterocytes for detoxification prior to their utilization. However, fish fed the highest oxidized diet presented a reduction in bone mineralization, but lower incidence of deformities in the vertebral and caudal regions than fish fed the other diets. This study exemplifies the importance of rearing <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> larvae on non-oxidized diets during the early larval development to avoid detrimental consequences in older fish, most notably in the process of skeletogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of restricted food access on Solea senegalensis behaviour and daily expression of clock genes in central (diencephalon and optic tectum) and pheripheral (liver) tissues. The <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> is a marine teleost fish belonging to the Class of Actinopterygii, Order Pleuronectiformes and Family Soleidae. Its geographical distribution in the Mediterranean sea is fairly broad, covering the south and east of the Iberian Peninsula, the North of Africa and Middle East until the coast of Turkey. From a commercial perspective Solea senegalensis has acquired in recent years, a key role in aquacolture industry of the Iberian Peninsula. The <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> is also acquiring an important relevance in chronobiological studies as the number of published works focused on the sole circadian system has increased in the last few years. The molecular mechanisms underlying sole circadian rhythms has also been explored recently, both in adults and developing sole. Moreover, the consideration of the Pleuronectiformes Order {{as one of the most}} evolved teleost groups make the <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> a species of high interest under a comparative and phylogenetic point of view. All these facts have reinforced the election of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> as model species for the present study. The animals were kept under 12 L: 12 D photoperiod conditions and divided into three experimental groups depending on the feeding time: fed at midlight (ML), middark (MD) or random (RND) times. Throughout the experiment, the existence of a daily activity rhythm and it synchronization to the light-dark and feeding cycles was checked. To this end locomotor activity was registred by means of two infrared photocells placed in pvc tube 10 cm below the water surface (upper photocell) and the other one was located 10 cm above the bottom of the tank (bottom photocell). The photocell were connected to a computer so that every time a fish interrupted the infrared light beam, it produced an output signal that was recorded. The number of light beam interruptions was stored every 10 minutes by specialized software for data acquisition...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the short and mid-term effects of a rise in temperature from 18 ºC to 24 ºC on the expression of genes related to the stress response regulation in juveniles of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole,</b> Solea senegalensis. The animals were exposed to a temperature increase of 6  °C, after 1 month of acclimation at 18 ºC. After this process, samples of different tissues were collected from a total of 96 fish at four sampling points: 1 hour, 24 hours, 3 days and 1 week. The transcript levels {{of a set of}} genes involved in the stress response such as glucocorticoid receptors 1 and 2, corticotrophin-releasing factor, corticotrophin-releasing factor binding proteins, proopiomelanocortin A and B, and cellular stress defense (heat shock protein 70, 90 AA and 90 AB) were quantified at these sampling points. Additionally, blood samples were also taken to measure the circulating plasma cortisol concentration.   Thermal stress induced by increasing temperature prompted an elevation of plasma cortisol levels in juvenile <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> after 1 h as a short-term response, and a consecutive increase after one week, as a mid-term response [...] <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> seemed to respond positively in terms of adaptive mechanisms, with a rapid over-expression of grs and hsps in liver and brain, significantly higher after one hour post stress, denoting the fast and acute response of those tissues to a rapid change on temperature. The ratio hsp 90 /gr also increased 24 h after thermal shock, ratio proposed to be an adaptive mechanism to prevent proteosomal degradation of GR. As a mid-term response, the elevation of brain crfbp gene expression one week after thermal shock could be an adaptive mechanism of negative feedback on HPI axis Taken together, these data suggested an initial up-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor complex linked genes in response to a temperature increase in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole,</b> with heat shock protein 90 potentially being a regulatory factor for the glucocorticoid receptor in the presence of cortisol...|$|E

40|$|Aromatic {{amino acids}} (AAs, {{phenylalanine}} and tyrosine) may be specifically required during fish metamorphosis, {{since they are}} the precursors of thyroid hormones which regulate this process. This project attempted to evaluate aromatic AA metabolism during the ontogenesis of fish species with a marked (Senegalese sole; Solea senegalensis) and a less accentuated metamorphosis (gilthead seabream; Sparus aurata). Fish were tube-fed with three l-[U- 14 C] AA solutions at pre-metamorphic, metamorphic and post-metamorphic stages of development: controlled AA mixture (Mix), phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr). Results showed a preferential aromatic AA retention during the metamorphosis of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole,</b> rather than in gilthead seabream. Senegalese sole’s highly accentuated metamorphosis seems to increase aromatic AA physiological requirements, possibly for thyroid hormone production. Thus, <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> seems to be especially susceptible to dietary aromatic AA deficiencies during the metamorphosis period, and these findings may be important for physiologists, fish nutritionists and the flatfish aquaculture industry...|$|E

A total of 61 juveniles and 59 breeders were subjected to five individual behavioural tests and two grouping tests. At the end of the individual tests, all animals were blood sampled in order to measure cortisol, glucose and lactate. Three tests (restraining, new environment and confinement) characterized the stress coping style behaviour of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> juveniles and breeders and demonstrated inter-individual consistency.

This study proposed for the first time three individual coping styles tests that reliably represented proactive and reactive personalities of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> juveniles and breeders. In addition, the three proposed tests met some basic operational criteria (rapid testing, no special equipment and easy to apply and interpret) that could result attractive for fish farmers to identify fish with a specific behaviour that give advantages in the culture system and {{that could be used to}} establish selection-based breeding programmes to improve domestication and productio...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this workwas to evaluate {{the effect of a}} dietary amino acid imbalance, originating from the use of a soy protein concentrate (SPC) as the major protein source, on the growth performance and amino acid metabolism of <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> (Solea senegalensis) postlarvae. <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> (85. 6724. 6 mg wet weight) were fed one of two experimental diets: one based on fish meal (FM) and another based on SPC. Diet were isonitrogenous (around 56 % crude protein) and isoenergetic. Diet acceptability was very good and the growth rate was 6. 9 %day 1 for sole eating the FM diet and 6. 0 %day 1 for sole eating the SPC diet. Mass-speci¢c ammonia excretion and the activities of selected amino acid metabolic enzymes (ALAT, ASATand GDH) did not present significant differences between treatments, although this may have been due to the high variability found for these parameters in the SPC treatment. This variability may suggest different capacities of individual fish to adapt to the possible methionine dietary deficiency. The utilization of amino acids as a substrate for lipogenesis {{does not seem to be}} affected by the dietary protein source, since NAPDH-generating enzymes (G 6 PD and ME) had similar activities in both treatments. Amino acid metabolism in <b>Senegalese</b> <b>sole</b> postlarvae seems to be slightly affected by the dietary protein source. Nevertheless, the changes induced by the SPC diet do not seem to impair growth, at least at the high dietary protein level used in this experiment...|$|E
