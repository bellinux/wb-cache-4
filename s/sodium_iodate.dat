Food Chemistry, 113, 600 - 601. This paper was {{to improve the}} production of calcium-induced alginate gels manufactured by a company in Auckland. Problems encountered included yield and syneresis of the beads post-gelation. Essentially the alginate, sugars and other ingredients were dissolved in water at 80 ºC. The pH of the solution was adjusted and the alginate beads were extruded into a 5 % CaCl 2 bath before being drained and dried. The chemical reaction between sodium alginate and calcium ions is dependent upon the solubility and availability of calcium ions. Some calcium salts (e. g., CaCl 2, calcium lactate) were readily soluble and fully dissociated in water and resulted in an immediate gelation of the alginate. Dicalcium phosphate (DCP) was sparingly soluble at pH 7 and calcium ions were not released significantly until the pH reached about pH 4. 2. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) is a chelating agent and this was used to soak up small quantities of Ca+ 2 to ensure no gelation occured while the alginate was being mixed. The optimum quantities of alginate, DCP and SHMP were defined in the laboratory trials. The use of SHMP, maltodextrin, and gums significantly affected the hardness and stickiness of gel beads.

METHODS: <b>Sodium</b> <b>iodate</b> at 35 mg/kg(body weight) was administered by tail vein injection into adult 6 - 8 wk C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Morphological and functional changes of the retina were assessed at 6 h, 1, 3, 5 and 8 d after injections by fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography(OCT), ERG and histology. Mice in control group were give tail vein injection of equivalent dose of normal saline. All the eyeballs were removed for paraffin section and H-E staining. RESULTS: The fundus photographs images at 6 h after injection showed obvious changes, which were light red in retina and showed retinal blood vessels radial arranged. At 6 h after injection, off-white drusen-like change was found at fundus. While there were no observable changes in OCT image and ERG. At 1 d after injection, the fundus lesion aggravated and the drusen increased gradually. There were retinal pigment epithelial(RPE) disorders, photoreceptors and outer nuclear layer(ONL) damage through OCT. At 3 d after injection, the retina lesion aggravated further and the retina became edema. At 5 d after injection, the retina edema cleared away, the optic nerve became white and the fundus lesions increased. At 8 d after injection, the RPE layer, photoreceptors and ONL were destroyed obviously. In the process, ERG showed the amplitudes of a- and b-wave decreased in a time-dependent manner. H-E staining showed that cells in retina of mice in control group were neatly arranged and well-distributed.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is characterized by}} malfunction and loss of retinal-pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells. Because the RPE transfers nutrients from the choriocapillaris to photoreceptor (PR), PRs are affected as well. Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of AMD characterized by severe vision impairment due to RPE loss over large areas. Currently there is no treatment to delay the degeneration of nutrient deprived PRs once RPE cells die.

40|$|This project {{initiated}} {{with the}} aim for improving the ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography (UHR-OCT) system performance by considering the limitations to the axial OCT resolution for in vivo imaging of human and animal retina. To this end, a computational model was developed to simulate the effect of wavelength-dependant water absorption on the detected spectral shape of the broad-bandwidth light source used in UHR-OCT at 1060 nm wavelength region, which effectively determines the axial OCT resolution in the retina. For experimental verification of the computational model, a custom built light source with a re-shaped spectrum (Superlum Inc.) was interfaced to the state-of-the-art UHR-OCT system. About 30 % improvement of the axial OCT resolution in the rat retina and ~ 12 % improvement of the axial OCT resolution in the human retina was achieved compared {{to the case of}} the almost Gaussian shaped spectrum of the standard, commercially available SLD. Although water absorption in the 1060 nm spectral region strongly affects the sample beam, selecting a suitable light source with specific spectral shape can compensate for the undesired water absorption effect and thus result in significantly improved axial resolution in in vivo OCT retinal images. To demonstrate the advantages of the state-of-the-art OCT technology for non invasive retinal imaging, an established animal model of outer retina degeneration (<b>sodium</b> <b>iodate</b> (NaIO 3) -induced retina degeneration) was employed for longitudinal monitoring of the degeneration and investigation of possible early and dynamic signs of damage undetected by other imaging modalities. The long-term (up to 3 months) and short-term (up to 12 hours) effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>iodate</b> toxicity on the layered structure of retina was monitored longitudinally and in vivo for the first time using OCT. An initial acute swelling of the retina, followed by progressive disruption and degeneration of outer retina was observed as a result of sodium iodate-induced damage.

Results from this project present the theoretical and practical limits to the highest axial OCT resolution achievable for retina imaging in the 1060 nm spectral range both in small animals and humans, and provided a framework for future development of novel light sources.
