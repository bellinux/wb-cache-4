Gerry Anderson and Fred Freiberger rallied and pitched the idea of a new series with the addition of an alien character to Moonbase Alpha, who would <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dynamic of interaction on the Moonbase and regain viewer interest in the United States. On the strength of Anderson and Freiberger's proposal of adding an alien character from the planet Psychon named , Mandell approved a renewal of the series for a second year.|$|E

During the running mate deliberations, McCain had favored Joe Lieberman, who shared his romantic sense of righteousness and honor. But the opposition from social conservatives, who objected to Lieberman's pro-choice views, was too strong, and a Lieberman pick might have caused a floor fight at the convention. McCain wanted someone who would <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> race and reinforce his image as a maverick, so he decided against more conventional choices on his short list including Romney and Governor Tim Pawlenty.|$|E
25|$|Landrith {{signed his}} {{contract}} for the 1961 season on February 11 for roughly $80,000. New general manager Alvin Dark warned veteran regulars {{that there would be}} battles for spots on the depth chart at every position for the upcoming season, and the catcher position was no exception. In February, Schmidt and Landrith had two new competitors thrown into the foray. Tom Haller and John Orsino were originally considered threats to <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> depth chart order. Haller was the strongest threat, going getting 10 hits, including 4 home runs, 2 doubles, and 2 triples in just his first 20 at-bats for spring training. Tom's impressive play continued through mid-April, earning him the opening day starting job over Schmidt and Landrith. Hobie retained his spot as the number two catcher, with Schmidt dropping all the way from first to third. Landrith played in only three games in April, but made the most of his season debut game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates were up 1-0 with 1 out {{in the bottom of the}} 11th when Landrith hit a game tying home run to deep right field off reliever Roy Face.|$|E

[...] Computer and Video Games also mentioned the game is [...] "better than Super Mario 64." [...] The game placed 46th in Official Nintendo Magazines 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time.

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add 20 pounds and bring his weight up to 250. Following {{the failure of the}} 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had to <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the {{pre-season}} market. They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds. Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games. The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto's all-time leader in total points scored. After pulling together a string of wins, Toronto were [...]500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double double. That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team, and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week. After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history). However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto's 40.|$|E

500|$|Just as {{they had}} been in 2010 under their former guise as [...] – when the team won two stages and the overall {{classification}} with Charteau – the team was very successful at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo in Africa. Gène took the team's first win of the year (and accordingly, first under their new name) in stage 2, the only stage that finished outside the race's primary host nation of Gabon, winning a field sprint in Ebolowa in Cameroon. In stage 4, the event's defending champion Charteau figured into a winning breakaway. Though he finished 24 seconds back on stage winner Daniel Teklehaymanot, he assumed the race leadership. He had a lead of four seconds over the man in second place and seven seconds over the man in third, but a good two minutes over the man in fourth, meaning it was virtually certain that he would at the very least finish on the podium. The next day, Gène added a second sprint win, as most of the field finished together and Charteau retained his advantage in the overall. While the final stage had the potential to <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> overall standings, with three large groups finishing four seconds after one another, Charteau held on to win the race overall for the second straight year by finishing in the first of these groups. In February, at the Étoile de Bessèges, Haddou won the sprint finish to the race's titular stage finishing in Bessèges. Later in February, Voeckler won the first stage of the Tour Méditerranéen. He had instigated the morning breakaway with four others, and they stayed away by a margin of three seconds over the fast-charging peloton. Voeckler won the two-day Tour du Haut Var later in February. He finished one second down on Samuel Dumoulin in stage 1, but in the hillier second stage, he finished 29 seconds clear of any other riders, along with breakaway companion Julien Antomarchi. He allowed Antomarchi to take the stage win, knowing that he had the race overall won. The team entered another African race in February, the Tour of South Africa. After winning La Tropicale Amissa Bongo, Charteau was expected to be a top contender for victory, but he broke his collarbone after a stage 1 crash and had to leave the race. The squad did pick up a win, with Gène taking stage 3 from a breakaway sprint, but their best-placed overall finisher was Quemeneur over two minutes down on race champion Kristian House.|$|E

In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised, [...] "the utterly demonic skill with which these foulmouthed characters carve one another up in futile attempts to stave off disaster. It's also because of the breathtaking wizardry with which Mr. Mamet and Mr. Foley have made a vivid, living film that preserves the claustrophobic nature of the original stage work".|$|E

2500|$|As Birds of Prey {{approached}} its hundredth issue, Simone used issues #99 and #100 to <b>shake</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lineup.

Again, the characters were chosen to provide a foil for each other, and affirmed her love for her characters: [...] "The team {{is a group of}} individuals, quite unlike the friendship between Dinah, Helena and Babs. And any team with Barda on it automatically has a certain bull in a China shop tremble, and I love that... The characters don't apologize for being asskickers, nor for being smart, nor for being sexy, nor for being sexual, for that matter. There {{are always going to be}} some people who find that not to their taste, but at the same time, Birds of Prey regularly brings in people who don't otherwise read mainstream comics, a whole audience that may not pick up any other superhero titles, and I love that niche, that little area between good taste and utter shamelessness." [...] Finally, Simone stated her agony of leaving the book: [...] "I miss the characters in all the books I've worked on. Writing the last issue of Birds of Prey I'm doing was actually physically painful." ...|$|E
