40|$|ABSTRACT A {{universal}} {{aspect of}} human behavior is the tendency to establish and negotiate <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> supporting power and status inequalities. Previous research linked the support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> to unethical behavior at the individual and societal levels of analysis. However, factors and processes supporting these associations have not been well understood. In {{a series of three}} studies, this dissertation investigates factors and processes supporting the relationship between the individual and institutional support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and unethical behavior. The first study presents a conceptual multilevel process framework grounded in social dominance theory. The framework suggests that the individual support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> (i. e., <b>social</b> dominance orientation) is associated with unethical behavior directly, supported by restricted perception and cognition, and mediationally by means of legitimizing rationalizations, ideologies, and logics. The institutional support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> is linked to unethical behavior directly, since hierarchies sustain the decoupling of processes and fragmentation of responsibilities, and interactively through person-environment fit processes (e. g., socialization). The second study empirically demonstrates that the individual support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> is indirectly related to unethical decision making by means of legitimizing rationalizations that help reduce accountability, responsibility, and selfsanctions. However, the positive relationships between the individual support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> propensity to use legitimizing rationalizations, and unethical decision making are attenuated among individuals with a greater ability to self-regulate. The third study presents and empirically investigates a culture-based model {{of the relationship between the}} support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and unethical decision making. The results of a crosscultural study involving participants from Australia and the U. S. reveal that individual cultural orientations in the form of social beliefs (e. g., social cynicism) are related to the individual support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and the propensity to use morally disengaging rationalizations. The individual support of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and propensity to use morally disengaging rationalizations, in turn, link the individual endorsement of social beliefs to the propensity to make unethical decisions.

5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria {{can be traced back}} to the Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of the earliest European societies.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason that}} <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> exist in human {{societies}} {{is that they}} were necessary for survival of inter-group competition during conflict over resources.

5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E
5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy</b> is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E

In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army.

5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy</b> often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the {{submissive}} turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E
50|$|Primates show {{distinct}} {{characteristics of}} social cognition {{in comparison to}} mammals. Mammals are able to identify members of their species, understand basic kinships and basic <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> make predictions about others’ behavior based on emotion and movement, and engage in social learning (Tomasello, 1999). Primates, however, show a more extensive understanding of these concepts. Primates not only understand kinship and <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> {{but they also have}} an understanding of relational categories. That is, primates are able to understand social relations that extend beyond their individual interaction with others. Mammals are able to form direct relationships based on <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> but primates have an understanding of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and relationships that extend beyond them personally. Researchers believe that this understanding of relational categories might have been the evolutionary precursor to humans’ deeper understanding of desires, beliefs, and goals underlying causal relationships, and thereby allowing humans to relate to and understand other individuals, making way for cultural evolution (Tomasello, 1999).|$|R

5|$|Soil types {{mentioned}} in records are black soil (Karimaniya) in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (Kebbayya mannu) Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land {{and to a}} lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called kalani, galde, nir mannu or nir panya and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water. The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms gosahasra (a thousand cows), gasara (owner of cows), gosasi (donor of cows), goyiti (cowherdess), gosasa (protector of cows) attest to this. Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy</b> based on this. Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (pendir-udeyulcal), abduction of women by bedas (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.|$|E
5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy</b> as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E
5|$|<b>Social</b> <b>hierarchy</b> {{in western}} jackdaw flocks is {{determined}} by supplanting, fighting, and threat displays—several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a <b>social</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E

That literature is increasingly focused psychosocial factors, working interactively with biological and brain-based mechanisms, to account for why those with low socioeconomic standing have poorer health. Our central question is whether and how these processes might vary by cultural context. We draw on emerging findings from two parallel studies, Midlife in the U.
