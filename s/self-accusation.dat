2500|$|Perhaps unsurprisingly, the {{ambiguity}} of the phrase {{has the potential to}} offend; some right-wing circles in Japan have interpreted the words as an admission of guiltimplicitly reading it as [...] "we (the Japanese people) shall not repeat the error"and they criticize the epitaph as a <b>self-accusation</b> by the Japanese empire. In July 2005, the cenotaph was vandalized by a 27-year-old Japanese affiliated with the Japanese right.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is argued}} that the [...] "servant" [...] {{represents}} the nation of Israel, which would bear excessive iniquities, pogroms, blood libels, anti-judaism, antisemitism and continue to suffer without cause (...) on behalf of others (Isaiah 53:7,11–12). Early on, the servant of the Lord is promised to prosper and [...] "be very high". The following evaluation of the Servant by the [...] "many nations, kings", and [...] "we" [...] is quite negative, though, and bridges over to their <b>self-accusation</b> and repentance after verse 4 ("our"). Then, the Servant is vindicated by God, [...] "because he bared his soul unto death". On the other hand, it {{is argued that}} the [...] "servant" [...] in this song might be an individual. And because of the references to sufferings, many Christians believe this song, {{along with the rest of}} the servant songs, to be among the Christian-messianic prophecies of Jesus. The anti-missionary rabbi Tovia Singer argues, by textual analysis, that the [...] "suffering servant" [...] of Isaiah 52:13 through 53:12 is not referencing an individual Christ Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|When the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong came {{to power}} in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after {{negotiations}} between the Soviet Union and China. Puyi was of considerable value to Mao, as Behr noted: [...] "In the eyes of Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders, Pu Yi, the last Emperor, was the epitome of all that had been evil in old Chinese society. If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party". Furthermore, Mao had often noted that Lenin had Nicholas II, the last Russian emperor, shot together {{with the rest of the}} Russian imperial family, as Lenin could not make the last tsar into a communist; making the last Chinese emperor into a Communist was intended to show the superiority of Chinese communism over Soviet communism. Puyi was to be subjected to [...] "remodeling" [...] (known in the West as [...] "brain-washing") to make him into a Communist. Behr observed that the Chinese Communist system was brutal, as millions of people were executed as [...] "kulaks", [...] "traitors" [...] and [...] "landlords" [...] during Mao's first years in power, but it had a very different approach to crime from the West, quoting from Jean Pasqualini's book Prisonnier de Mao: [...] "Prison is not prison, but a school for learning about one's mistakes". Pasqualini wrote that the aim of remodeling in China was [...] "not so much to make you invent nonexistent crimes, but to make you accept your ordinary life, as you led it, as rotten and sinful and worthy of punishment ... <b>self-accusation</b> is one of the masterpieces of the penal system ... the prisoner takes care to build the case against himself as skillfully as he can ... When a prisoner has finally produced a satisfactory statement the government holds a document with which, depending on the emphasis of interpretation, it can sentence him to virtually any desired number of years. It is the prosecutor's dream". Puyi was never tortured, as Behr noted that [...] "in the Chinese approach to the redemption of criminals, kindness too could become a weapon-at times an extraordinary effective one".|$|E

Aggressive safeguarding strategies include deprecation, accusations, or <b>self-accusations</b> and guilt, which are used as means for elevating a fragile self-esteem and safeguarding an overblown, idealized image of oneself.

60|$|Of her, {{as far as}} she is {{concerned}} in this fourth act, we have two additional points to notice: first, the low cunning and Jesuitical trick with which she deludes her husband into words of forgiveness, which he himself does not understand; and secondly, that everywhere she is made the object of interest and sympathy, and it is not the author's fault, if, at any moment, she excites feelings less gentle, than those we are accustomed to associate with the <b>self-accusations</b> of a sincere religious penitent. And did a British audience endure all this?--They received it with plaudits, which, but for the rivalry of the carts and hackney coaches, might have disturbed the evening- prayers of the scanty week day congregation at St. Paul's cathedral.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{was said}} by Captain Aylmer as to any {{proposed}} period for their marriage; {{but that was}} only natural. It was not probable that any man would name a day till he knew {{whether or not he was}} accepted. Indeed, Clara, on thinking over the whole affair, was now disposed to find fault rather with herself than with her lover, and forgetting his coldness and formality at Perivale, remembered only the fact of his offer to her, and his assurance now received that he had intended to make it before the scene which had taken place between him and his aunt. She did find fault with herself, telling herself that she had quarrelled with him without sufficient cause;--and the eager, loving candour of her letter to him was attributable to those <b>self-accusations.</b>|$|R
60|$|Saddening and {{impressive}} {{as was the}} prospect thus presented to {{the eyes of the}} young Goth, it failed to weaken the powerful influence that his evening's meditations yet held over his mind. As, during the hours that were passed, the image of the forsaken girl had dissipated the remembrance of the duties he had performed, and opposed the contemplation of the commands he was yet to fulfil, so it now denied to his faculties any impressions from the lonely scene, beheld, yet unnoticed, which spread around him. Still, as he passed through the gloomy streets, his vain regrets and <b>self-accusations,</b> his natural predilections and acquired attachments, ruled over him and contended within him, as sternly and as unceasingly as in the first moments when they had arisen with the evening, during his sojourn in the terrace of the deserted house.|$|R

60|$|Nor was Salvatierra entirely {{free from}} the baleful {{influence}} of his miraculous acquisition. Unconscious of its effect upon others, he only saw in their actions evidence of certain things that the crafty Peleg had hinted on that eventful New Year's eve. His most trusty retainers stammered, blushed, and faltered before him. <b>Self-accusations,</b> confessions of minor faults and delinquencies, or extravagant excuses and apologies met his mildest inquiries. The very children that he loved--his pet pupil, Paquita--seemed to be conscious of some hidden sin. The result of this constant irritation showed itself more plainly. For the first half-year the Commander's voice and eye were at variance. He was still kind, tender, and thoughtful in speech. Gradually, however, his voice took upon itself the hardness of his glance and its skeptical, impassive quality, and as the year again neared its close it was plain that the Commander had fitted himself to the eye, and not the eye to the Commander.|$|R

The school of men to whom he professes to belong, the Grantlys, the Gwynnes, and the old high set of Oxford divines, are afflicted with no such <b>self-accusations</b> as these which troubled Mr. Harding. They, as a rule, are as satisfied with the wisdom and propriety of their own conduct as can be any Mr. Slope, or any Dr. Proudie, with his own. But unfortunately for himself Mr. Harding had little of this self-reliance.

Faith it is which gives to that Psalm its peculiarly simple, deliberate, manly tone; free from all exaggerated <b>self-accusations,</b> all cowardly cries of terror. He is crushed down, it is true. The tone of his words shews us that throughout. But crushed by what? By the discovery that he has offended God? Not in the least. For the sake of your own souls, as well as for that of honest critical understanding of the Scriptures, do not foist that meaning into David's words. He never says that he had offended God.

Mr. Mildmay was of a softer temper, and would have suffered had he not been protected by the idolatry of a large class of his followers. Mr. Gresham has no such protection. With a finer intellect than either, and a sense of patriotism quite as keen, he has a self-consciousness which makes him sore at every point. He knows the frailty of his temper, and yet cannot control it. And he does not understand men as did these others. Every word from an enemy is a wound to him.

40|$|Ph. D. The thesis {{falls into}} two main sections. It {{endeavours}} to analyse the major aspects of Maltese {{society in the}} second half of the eighteenth century as they emerge from a close scrutiny of the Archives of the Inquisition in Malta. The approach is mainly that of the ethnologist, a social history written 'from below'. The ultimate purpose was to try to arrive at as clear and accurate a picture of the Maltese mentalite as the archives permitted. Unfortunately, the Archives of the Inquisition in Malta have hardly ever been seriously studied by the social historian. Their richness and diversity not only cast enormous insight into the mental habits and frame of mind of a wide cross-section of Maltese society; they even shed sufficient light on a wide range of the social life of the Maltese. The subject is also approached from the point of view of the legal historian. The Inquisition was a Tribunal of Faith set up to stop the onslaught of Protestantism, as well as to reform the superstitious accretions to popular religion practised by the remaining part of the Catholic Church. The thesis examines the events leading to the charge and possibly arrest of the accused. Most of the reports were <b>self-accusations</b> and those arrested were taken into custody only after much deliberation. If the Inquisitors did make use of torture the accused was assisted by the defence counsel and produced his own witnesses.

40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} find the {{prevalence}} of depressive symptoms among adolescents studying in schools in Chennai. Settings and Design: The study was a school based cross sectional survey in which data were collected through a self administered questionnaire from adolescents studying in classes X, XI and XII. Material: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to nine hundred and sixty four adolescents – boys (n= 509) girls (n= 455) – studying in twenty one schools spread across the city. Results: Based on the cut-off scores, 378 adolescents (39. 2 %) {{were found to be}} non-depressed, 358 (37. 1 %) were mildly depressed, 187 (19. 4 %) were moderately depressed and 41 (4. 3 %) severely depressed. In the present sample of adolescents, among the 21 depressive symptoms in the BDI, experience of emotional manifestations of depression like sadness, irritability, <b>self-accusations</b> and crying spells dominated over cognitive, behavioral and physical manifestations of depression There were no significant gender differences but a higher proportion of girls (27 %) reported moderate to severe depression than boys (21 %). There was an association between age and depression with increasing depression in older adolescents. Conclusion: Individual symptoms of depression and depressed mood are common in adolescents. Depressive symptoms are an unrecognized problem among adolescents that necessitates the need for recognition. Thus, understanding the prevalence of adolescent depressive symptoms is important for developing appropriate screening strategies, treatment planning, follow-up for those small proportion of adolescents who could become clinically depressed. Current poor understanding of the factors that influence depressive symptoms makes these efforts challenging. Key-words: prevalence, depressive symptoms, adolescent...|$|R

5000|$|She {{provided}} investigators with {{ever more}} far-fetched stories about alleged espionage for western powers and her Nazi past. She named Max Gewald, her former husband, as a closet American agent and, later, as Max Baer, a former commanding officer at Ravensbrück. All her allegations were {{passed on to}} the newly founded and rapidly developing Ministry for State Security (Stasi) and investigated with excruciating care, causing intense distress to Gewald. Finally she created an elaborate past for herself involving work for the Gestapo and the police during the Nazi years. At one stage she was released, presumably when interrogators concluded that there was no substance to her <b>self-accusations,</b> but elsewhere in the state hierarchy people evidently took a different view. After two weeks she was arrested on suspicion of crimes against humanity and then, on 21 May 1953, sentenced to a fifteen-year jail term by the district court at Halle. She had at one stage claimed to be a dog handler at Ravensbrück who had set dogs to tear apart camp inmates. It was apparently in this context that she said she had been {{responsible for the deaths of}} between eighty and ninety concentration camp inmates. However, she was convicted solely on the basis of her own submissions, and the court records consist almost exclusively of notes taken during her interrogation sessions, from which it is apparent that her interrogator, a Leutnant Bischoff, had reacted to her [...] "confessions" [...] with sustained unbelief. Had the evidence been persuasive and appropriately corroborated it seems likely that her sentence, having regard to the crimes against humanity for which she was convicted, should have been much harsher than a mere custodial one.|$|R

Was that, he asked himself, the sort of letter a lover should write to the beloved on her release, on the sudden long prayed-for opening of a way to her, on the end of her shameful servitude and his humiliations? He began to recall the cold and stilted sentences of that difficult composition. The gentility of it! All his life he had been a prey to gentility, had cast himself free from it, only to relapse again in such fashion as this. Would he never be human and passionate and sincere? Of course he was glad, and she ought to be glad, that Sir Isaac, their enemy and their prison, was dead; it was for them to rejoice together. He turned out of bed at last, when he could lie still under these <b>self-accusations</b> no longer, and wrapped himself in his warm dressing-gown and began to write. He wrote in pencil. His fountain-pen was as usual on his night table, but pencil seemed the better medium, and he wrote a warm and glowing love-letter that was brought to an end at last by an almost passionate fit of sneezing. He could find no envelopes in his bedroom Davenport, and so he left that honest scrawl under a paper-weight, and went back to bed greatly comforted. He re-read it in the morning with emotion, and some slight misgivings that grew after he had despatched it. He went to lunch at his club contemplating a third letter that should be sane and fine and sweet, and that should rectify the confusing effect of those two previous efforts. He wrote this letter later in the afternoon.|$|R
