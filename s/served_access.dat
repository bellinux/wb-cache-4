500|$|On {{the turnpike}} {{extension}} alignment proposed in 1994, Route 92 {{was to begin}} at a trumpet interchange with U.S. Route 1 in South Brunswick. The interchange would have also <b>served</b> <b>access</b> to Schalks Crossing Road (Middlesex CR 683). The highway was {{to head to the}} southeast and cross under Perrine Road, which was proposed to have a brand new overpass and a westbound interchange. (There was also to be an eastbound entrance ramp from Perrine Road.) After curving to the east, Route 92 was to enter Plainsboro, cross the New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor Line and Devil's Brook, and then re-enter South Brunswick. [...] The route was to continue eastward, passing to the north of McCormack Lake and begin following Friendship Road until the intersection with Miller Road. Route 92 was to turn to the southeast along with Friendship Road and cross through a toll station. It would have entered a large interchange with U.S. Route 130 and an access route to Friendship Road. Route 92's interchange with Route 130 was to be a cloverleaf interchange and from there, the highway was to follow current day Route 32 through Monroe Township. There, the highway was to continue southeastward, interchanging with local roads and continuing through an interchange with County Route 535 before merging into Interchange 8A with the New Jersey Turnpike, where Route 92 was to end.|$|E

40|$|Network {{densification}} {{along with}} universal resources reuse {{is expected to}} {{play a key role}} in the realization of 5 G radio access as an enabler for delivering most of the anticipated network capacity improvements. On the one hand, neither the expected additional spectrum allocation nor the forthcoming novel air-interface processing techniques will be sufficient for sustaining the anticipated exponentially-increasing mobile data traffic. On the other hand, enhanced ultra-dense infrastructure deployments are expected to provide remarkable capacity gains, regardless of the evolutionary or revolutionary approach followed towards 5 G development. In this work, we thoroughly examine global network coordination as the main enabler for future 5 G large dense small-cell deployments. We propose a powerful radio resources coordination framework through which interference management is handled network-wise and jointly over multiple dimensions. In particular, we explore strategies for pairing serving and <b>served</b> <b>access</b> nodes, partitioning the available network resources, as well as dynamically allocating power per pair, towards optimizing system performance and guaranteeing individual minimum performance levels. We develop new optimization formulations, providing network scaling performance upper bounds, along with lower complexity algorithmic solutions tailored to large networks. We apply the proposed solutions to dense network deployments, in order to obtain useful insights on network performance and optimization, such as rate scaling, infrastructure density, optimal bandwidth partitioning and spatial reuse factor optimization.

40|$|Abstract- Wireless Relay {{networks}} {{have become very}} important technologies in the future wireless systems. Current research works mostly focus on scenarios where relay stations are either stationary or mobile with uniform velocity. However, in many applications, relay stations are mobile with irregular patterns. In particular, when mobile relay stations (MRSs) are deployed to complement the cellular systems, many issues such as handoff should be carefully investigated. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} handoff problem and propose a new handoff decision algorithm based on the relative velocities of user equipment (UE) to the <b>serving</b> <b>access</b> point (AP) and the target AP. We have show that the proposed handoff algorithm can significantly improve the handoff successful rate when the mobile relay station changes its moving patterns...|$|R
40|$|This paper applies Marx' {{theory of}} {{alienation}} {{to the work}} of criminal legal aid lawyers to suggest that the lawyers might be best understood as alienated workers. It reports findings from an ethnographic study of the lawyer-client relationship in England and Wales whereby lawyers were seen to take a diminished professional role characterised by the routine processing of guilty pleas wherein lawyers lost respect for themselves as well as the clients they worked for. The concept of alienation is put forward as a valuable analytical tool for understanding this vision of a substandard legal practice, which may have potential for moving forward future debates on whether the lawyer-client relationship <b>serves</b> <b>access</b> to justice and, if not, how it might be improved to better do so...|$|R
