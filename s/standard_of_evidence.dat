25|$|The Muqaddimah {{emphasized}} {{the role of}} systemic bias in affecting the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Khaldun was quite concerned with the effect of raising the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> when confronted with uncomfortable claims, and relaxing it when given claims that seemed reasonable or comfortable. He was a jurist, and sometimes participated reluctantly in rulings that he felt were coerced, based on arguments he didn't respect. Besides al-Maqrizi (1364–1442), Ibn Khaldun's focused attempt to systematically study and account biases {{in the creation of}} history wouldn't be seen again until Georg Hegel, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche in 19th-century Germany, and Arnold J. Toynbee, a 20th-century British historian.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the end of}} the Allied occupation, the Japanese {{government}} has repeatedly apologized for its pre-war behavior in general, but specific apologies and indemnities are determined on the basis of bilateral determination that crimes occurred, which requires a high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Unit 731 presents a special problem, since unlike Nazi human experimentation which the U.S. publicly condemned, the activities of Unit 731 are known to the general public only from the testimonies of willing former unit members, and testimony cannot be employed to determine indemnity in this way.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideas of}} {{psychokinesis}} and telekinesis violate several well-established laws of physics, including the inverse square law, the second law of thermodynamics, and {{the conservation of}} momentum. Because of this, scientists have demanded a high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for PK, in line with Marcello Truzzi's dictum [...] "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof". The Occam's razor law of parsimony in scientific explanations of phenomena suggests that the explanation of PK in terms of ordinary ways — by trickery, special effects or by poor experimental design — is preferable to accepting that {{the laws of physics}} should be rewritten.|$|E

5000|$|On 18 January 2005, Ohio's Secretary of State filed {{a motion}} for {{sanction}} against the plaintiffs, alleging that the claim in Moss v.

2500|$|Reasonable {{suspicion}} {{is a low}} standard of proof {{to determine whether a}} brief investigative stop or search by a police officer or any government agent is warranted. It {{is important to note that}} this stop or search must be brief; its thoroughness is proportional to, and limited by, the low <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> A more definite standard of proof (often probable cause) would be required to justify a more thorough stop/search. In Terry v. Ohio, , the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime is afoot. A mere guess or [...] "hunch" [...] is not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion.|$|E
60|$|This {{dread of}} the {{categorical}} proposition might be creditable, if it sprang from attachment {{to a very}} high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> or from {{a deep sense of}} the relative and provisional quality of truth. There might even be a plausible defence set up for it, if it sprang from that formulated distrust of the energetic rational judgment in comparison with the emotional, affective, contemplative parts of man, which underlies the various forms of religious mysticism. If you look closely into our present mood, it is seen to be the product mainly and above all of a shrinking deference to the status quo, not merely as having a claim not to be lightly dealt with, which every serious man concedes, but as being the last word and final test of truth and justice. Physical science is allowed to be the sphere of accurate reasoning and distinct conclusions, but in morals and politics, instead of admitting that these subjects have equally a logic of their own, we silently suspect all first principles, and practically deny the strict inferences from demonstrated premisses. Faith in the soundness of given general theories of right and wrong melts away before the first momentary triumph of wrong, or the first passing discouragement in enforcing right.|$|E
6000|$|Thus Hume, first {{denies the}} {{existence}} of such evidence, given in such circumstances as he demands, and then he produces an example of that very kind of evidence. Having done this, he abandons (as Mr. Wallace observes) his original assertion that the evidence does not exist, and takes refuge in alleging 'the absolute impossibility' of the events which the evidence supports. Thus Hume poses as a perfect judge of the possible, in a kind of omniscience. He takes his stand on the uniformity of all experience that is not hostile to his idea of the possible, and dismisses all testimony to other experience, even when it reaches his <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> He is remote indeed from Virchow's position 'that what we call the laws of nature must vary according to our frequent new experiences.'[3] In his note, Hume buttresses and confirms his evidence for the Jansenist miracles. They have even a martyr, M. Montgeron, who wrote an account of the events, and, says Hume lightly, 'is now said to be somewhere in a dungeon on account of his book.' 'Many of the miracles of the Abbé Paris were proved immediately by witnesses before the Bishop's court at Paris, under the eye of Cardinal Noailles....' 'His successor was an enemy to the Jansenists, yet twenty-two curés of Paris ... pressed him to examine these miracles ... But he wisely forbore.' Hume adds his testimony to the character of these curés. Thus it is wisdom, according to Hume, to dismiss the most public and well-attested 'miracles' without examination. This is experimental science of an odd kind.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{one might}} use the legal degrees <b>of</b> certainty. These <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> ascend as follows: no {{credible}} evidence, some credible <b>evidence,</b> a preponderance <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> {{clear and convincing}} evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, and beyond any {{shadow of a doubt}} (i.e. undoubtable—recognized as an impossible standard to meet—which serves only to terminate the list).|$|R
50|$|However, pro-Fairtrade {{researcher}} Alastair Smith {{claims that}} while some of these criticisms are grounded in acceptable <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> (and deserve serious attention), others are less well elaborated, and {{that in a few}} cases, the criticisms presented are assertions with little or no credible evidence to support them. However, these claims have themselves been criticized on matters of fact, theory, methodology, use <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> and incorrect citations.|$|R

50|$|The quantum <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is {{the amount}} <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> needed; the quality of proof is how {{reliable}} such evidence should be considered.
