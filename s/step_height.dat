40|$|Isotachophoresis has {{the unique}} feature that both {{qualitative}} and quantitative information can be deduced from <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> in isotachopherograms, even for unknown ionic species. For strong cations and anions there exists a linear relationship between, respectively, the measured <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> and the response factor (RF) versus the specific zone resistance at 25 °C (SZR 25) for a specific leading electrolyte. Applying two standard components, e. g., the leading ion and Na+, the relationship between measured <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> and the SZR 25 values {{can be set up}} and from the <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> of the sample ionic species in the isotachopherograms the SZR 25 values can be obtained. With these values all other parameters such as the mobilities, the concentrations in the zones and the RF values can be calculated. In combination with the measured zone lengths, the molar fractions and mass fractions can be calculated. In this way, the number-average and weight-average molecular masses can be obtained for homologous series of anions/cations from the isotachopherograms of the mixtures. This procedure is applied to jeffamines D 230 and D 400 and the obtained molecular masses are comparable with the labelled values...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} the growth of a perfect crystal is {{outlined}} and a brief description is given of the development of this theory, taking into account the presence of imperfections, especially dislocations, in the crystal. The molecular 'growth spirals' and other features predicted by this theory put forward by Burton, Cabrera and Prank require improved experimental techniques for their study, which are described. The experimental study of the growth features divides itself into two parts: (1) Microscopic studies. (2) Interferometric studies. The different growth features observed on the faces of silicon-carbide (Si-C) crystals are illustrated and explained. The observed 'growth spirals' can be divided into three types: (1) Elementary spirals with <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> equal {{to the size of the}} X-ray unit cell. (2) Spirals originating from dislocations of multiple strength, the <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> being a multiple of the X-ray unit cell. (3) Interlaced spirals in which the <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> are a fraction of the unit cell. The microscopic studies illustrate the information about the shape of the spirals, the behaviour and interaction of growth fronts with one another, originating from different sources, the growth pattern for a number of screw dislocations emerging on the crystal face fault surfaces, and their statiscal properties such as density of dis-locations etc. From these studies the type of information obtainable about the conditions of growth is the size of the critical nucleus and the supersaturation. The interferometric techniques utilized for the measurement of <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> are discussed. A study of the measured <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> leads to an understanding of the interesting property of 'polytypism' as observed in silicon-carbide crystals which occur in different types as shown by X-ray diffraction data. The 'growth spirals' demonstrate the X-ray predictions and confirm them. <p...|$|R

In addition several non-uniform configurations with combinations of 5 and 10 cm high steps were investigated. For each configuration, the air-water flow properties were measured for several discharges. The study yielded some challenging outcomes in terms of energy dissipation and aeration on stepped spillways with non-uniform cavity sizes. A comparative analysis with the stepped spillways with uniform <b>step</b> <b>heights</b> showed that the energy dissipation rate, the residual head, the flow resistance and the mean air concentration were close for all geometries.
