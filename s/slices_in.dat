25|$|Lamotrigine {{does not}} have {{pronounced}} effects {{on any of the}} usual neurotransmitter receptors (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-asparate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak. Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex <b>slices</b> <b>in</b> vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, lamotrigine inhibited the release of glutamate and aspartate evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it had no effect on spontaneous or potassium evoked amino acid release.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Intro", {{which has an}} electro-funk {{production}} and bears resemblance to some of David Bowie's early work. [...] "Scream" [...] has elements of electro-rap, house, and electroclash, and its production contains a [...] "blade of blues melody [...] <b>slices</b> <b>in</b> atop a rinky-dink sampled piano." [...] It also has [...] "lots of sonic confusingness" [...] as the [...] "song evaporates in the middle ... then reassembles and feeds into a staccato spoken-word electroclash midsection." [...] Many of the critics stated how the song has split sections, sometimes like [...] "a beat-free beach house piano-based meditation" [...] whilst at other times, sounding like [...] "haughty electroclash ingenue". The verses are mainly house music while the choruses are electronica and have rap music stylings. [...] "Acapella" [...] is about being [...] "swept up in a new love, and transformed by the giddy thrill {{to such a degree}} that everything that happened before seems drab and gray by comparison".

2500|$|When {{encoding}} {{colors in}} a hue/lightness/chroma or hue/value/chroma model (using the definitions {{from the previous}} two sections) model, not all combinations of lightness (or value) and chroma are meaningful: that is, half of the colors denotable using , , and [...] fall outside the RGB gamut (the gray parts of the <b>slices</b> <b>in</b> figure 14).

For example, in a color selection interface {{with two of the}} dimensions in a rectangle and the third on a slider, half of that rectangle is made of unused space. Now imagine we have a slider for lightness: the user’s intent when adjusting this slider is potentially ambiguous: how should the software deal with out-of-gamut colors? Or conversely, If the user has selected as colorful as possible a dark purple [...] and then shifts the lightness slider upward, what should be done: would the user prefer to see a lighter purple still as colorful as possible for the given hue and lightness [...] or a lighter purple of exactly the same chroma as the original color ...|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} from these facts that the grains of chlorophyll, as they exist in living plants, cannot be attacked by the secretion; for these grains consist of protoplasm merely coloured by chlorophyll. My son Francis placed a thin slice of spinach leaf, moistened with saliva, on a leaf of Drosera, and other slices on damp cotton-wool, all exposed to the same temperature. After 19 hrs. the slice on the leaf of Drosera was bathed in much secretion from the inflected tentacles, and was now examined under the microscope. No perfect grains of chlorophyll could be distinguished; some were shrunken, of a yellowish-green colour, and collected {{in the middle of}} the cells; others were disintegrated and formed a yellowish mass, likewise {{in the middle of the}} cells. On the other hand, in the slices surrounded by damp cotton-wool, the grains of chlorophyll were green and as perfect as ever. My son also placed some <b>slices</b> <b>in</b> artificial gastric juice, and these were acted on in nearly the same manner as by the secretion. We have seen that bits of fresh cabbage and spinach leaves cause the tentacles to be inflected and the glands to pour forth much acid secretion; and there can be little doubt that it is the protoplasm forming the grains of chlorophyll, as well as that lining the walls of the cells, which excites the leaves.|$|E

6000|$|Not {{far from}} this machine the {{visitors}} were shown another, in which several circular saws of smaller dimensions {{than the first}} were at work in concert, and laid at different angles to each other, so that when a plank was given into their clutches it received cuts and <b>slices</b> <b>in</b> certain parts during its passage through the machine, and came out much modified and improved in form--all that the attendants had to do merely being to fit the planks in their places and guide them safely through the ordeal. Elsewhere Mrs Marrot and Bob beheld a frame--full of gigantic saws cut a large log into half a dozen planks, all in one sweep, in a few minutes--work which would have drawn the sweat from the brows of two saw-pit men for several hours. One thing that {{attracted the attention of}} Bob very strongly was the simple process of hole-boring. Of course, in forming the massive frames of railway carriages, it becomes necessary to bore numerous holes for large nails or bolts. Often had Bob, at a neighbouring seaport, watched the heavy work and the slow progress of ship-carpenters as they pierced the planks of ships with augers; but here he beheld what he called, [...] "augers and drills gone mad!"--augers small and great whirling furiously, or, as Bob put it, [...] "like all possessed." [...] Some acting singly, others acting together in rows of five or six; and these excited things were perpetually whirling, whether at work or not, ready for service at a moment's notice. While Bob was gazing at one huge drill--probably {{an inch and a half}} broad, if not more--a man came up to it with a plank, on the surface of which were several dots at various distances. He put the plank under the drill, brought it down on a dot, whizz went the drill, and straightway there was a huge round hole right through almost before Bob had time to wink,--and Bob was a practised hand at winking. Several holes were bored in this way, and then the plank was carried to another machine, where six lesser holes were drilled at one and the same time by six furious little augers; and thus the planks passed on from one machine to another until finished, undergoing, in the course of a few minutes, treatment that would have cost them hours of torture had they been manipulated by human hands, in addition to which the work was most beautifully, and perfectly, and regularly done.|$|E
6000|$|When to {{my house}} you come, dear Dean, Your humble friend to entertain, Through dirt and mire along the street, You find no scraper for your feet; At which you stamp and storm and swell, Which serves to clean your feet as well. By steps {{ascending}} to the hall, All torn to rags by boys and ball, With scatter'd fragments on the floor; A sad, uneasy parlour door, Besmear'd with chalk, and carved with knives, (A plague upon all careless wives,) Are the next sights you must expect, But do not think they are my neglect. Ah that these evils were the worst! The parlour still is farther curst. To enter there if you advance, If in you get, it is by chance. How oft by turns have you and I Said thus--"Let me--no--let me try-- This turn will open it, I'll engage"-- You push me from it in a rage. Turning, twisting, forcing, fumbling, Stamping, staring, fuming, grumbling, At length it opens--in we go-- How glad are we to find it so! Conquests through pains and dangers please, Much more than those attain'd with ease. Are you disposed to take a seat; The instant that it feels your weight, Out goes its legs, and down you come Upon your reverend deanship's bum. Betwixt two stools, 'tis often said, The sitter {{on the ground is}} laid; What praise then to my chairs is due, Where one performs the feat of two! Now to the fire, if such there be, At present nought but smoke we see. [...] "Come, stir it up!"--"Ho, Mr. Joker, How can I stir it without a poker?" [...] "The bellows take, their batter'd nose Will serve for poker, I suppose." [...] Now you begin to rake--alack The grate has tumbled from its back-- The coals all on the hearth are laid-- [...] "Stay, sir--I'll run and call the maid; She'll make the fire again complete-- She knows the humour of the grate." [...] "Pox take your maid and you together-- This is cold comfort in cold weather." [...] Now all is right again--the blaze Suddenly raised as soon decays. Once more apply the bellows--"So-- These bellows were not made to blow-- Their leathern lungs are in decay, They can't even puff the smoke away." [...] "And is your reverence vext at that, Get up, in God's name, take your hat; Hang them, say I, that have no shift; Come blow the fire, good Doctor Swift. If trifles such as these can tease you, Plague take those fools that strive to please you. Therefore no longer be a quarrel'r Either with me, sir, or my parlour. If you can relish ought of mine, A bit of meat, a glass of wine, You're welcome to it, and you shall fare As well as dining with the mayor." [...] "You saucy scab--you tell me so! Why, booby-face, I'd have you know I'd rather see your things in order, Than dine in state with the recorder. For water I must keep a clutter, Or chide your wife for stinking butter; Or getting such a deal of meat As if you'd half the town to eat. That wife of yours, the devil's in her, I've told her of this way of dinner Five hundred times, but all in vain-- Here comes a rump of beef again: O that that wife of yours would burst-- Get out, and serve the boarders first.
