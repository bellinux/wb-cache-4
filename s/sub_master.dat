40|$|Storey {{building}} on {{fire in the}} big city is still often the case with substantial levels of casualties. Fire alarm at the rise buildings functioned well, but it was only for first aid. If the fire alarm has been enlarged, it was not working. With a fairly large fire conditions would cause confusion for the victim to find a way out. Therefore, this project will provide an information system that makes it a sign of the victim to escape. Singlehop serial communications using RS 485 serial is capable for take data from node either under normal conditions and when there is a fire. This system consists of several nodes that are connected in multidrop. Node with LM 35 temperature sensor, smoke sensor AF- 30, and the water detector will be placed on parts of the building in order to monitor the location of each building. The data collection process undertaken by a <b>sub</b> <b>master</b> after receiving a request from the master. Data received by each node will be collected in advance by the master, and then data will be sent to the server. Master will wait for a response from the server, if within a period of 20 seconds the server does not respond then the master will request back to the sub-master. But if there is a response from the master server sends the response to sub-master for immediate execution. The system implemented is able to provide information solutions with 90 % success rate. Node with LM 35 temperature sensor, smoke sensor AF- 30, and water detector can be used as the information level of the building fire. Inter-node communication system supports data retrieval process by taking in one cycle time of 1. 5 second. The retrieval of data between nodes using a baud rate of 19 200. The checking of data between nodes using FCS can provide accurate data that is sent to the server. Keyword : Fire, LM 35, AF 30, water detector, RS 485, singlehop, FC...|$|E

5000|$|A single signal {{can pass}} through {{a large number of}} level {{controls}} - such as an individual channel fader, subgroup master fader, master fader and monitor volume control. According to audio engineer Tomlinson Holman, problems are created due to the multiplicity of the controls. Each and every console has their own dynamic range and it is important to utilize this correctly to avoid excessive noise or distortions. Attacking this problem - of the correct setting for the variety of controls - can be accomplished relatively quickly. Holman refers to the scale of the control as a clue for the solution of this problem. With 0 dB being the nominal setting of the controls, many have a [...] "gain in hand," [...] which goes above 0 dB. This means that one can turn it up from the nominal setting to have something that sounds clear. Other controls, such as <b>sub</b> <b>masters</b> and master level controls, are used for slight trims to the overall section-by-section balance or for the main fade-ins and fade-outs of the overall mix.|$|R
