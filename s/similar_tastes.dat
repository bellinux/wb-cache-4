5|$|Maniac Mansion was {{conceived}} in 1985 when Lucasfilm Games employees Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick {{were assigned to}} create an original game. Gilbert had been hired the previous year as a programmer for the game Koronis Rift. He befriended Winnick over their <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> in humor, film, and television. Company management provided little oversight {{in the creation of}} Maniac Mansion, a trend to which Gilbert credited the success of several of his games for Lucasfilm.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Peart was recruited to play drums for a St. Catharines band known as Hush, who {{played on the}} South Ontario bar circuit. Soon after, a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto-based band Rush, which needed a replacement for its original drummer John Rutsey. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition. His future bandmates describe his arrival that day as somewhat humorous, as he arrived in shorts, driving a battered old Ford Pinto with his drums stored in trashcans. Peart felt the entire audition was a complete disaster. While Lee and Peart hit it off {{on a personal level}} (both sharing <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> in books and music), Lifeson had a less favourable impression of Peart. After some discussion, Lee and Lifeson accepted Peart's maniacal British style of drumming, reminiscent of The Who's Keith Moon.|$|E
25|$|They {{had much}} in common: they shared <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> {{in art and}} literature, came from {{affluent}} backgrounds, had studied painting in Italy, and both were independent, never marrying. The degree of intimacy between them cannot be assessed now, as no letters survive, but it is unlikely {{they were in a}} relationship given their conservative social backgrounds and strong moral principles. Several of Vincent van Gogh's letters attest Degas' sexual continence. Degas introduced Cassatt to pastel and engraving, both of which Cassatt quickly mastered, while for her part Cassatt was instrumental in helping Degas sell his paintings and promoting his reputation in America.|$|E

500|$|In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens {{record store}} where Buck worked. The pair {{discovered}} that they shared <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and The Velvet Underground. Stipe said, [...] "It turns out that I was buying all the records that [...] was saving for himself." [...] Stipe and Buck soon met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that [...] "there was never any grand plan behind any of it". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing and played its first show on April 5, 1980, at a friend's birthday party held in a converted Episcopal church in Athens. After considering names like [...] "Twisted Kites", [...] "Cans of Piss", and [...] "Negro Wives", the band settled on [...] "R.E.M." [...] (which stands for the stage of sleep called rapid eye movement), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.|$|E
500|$|Chickasha, Oklahoma {{gave birth}} to avant garde, glam-punk bands Victoria Vein and the Thunderpunks in 1974 and Debris' in 1975 whose self-released {{underground}} classic Static Disposal was released in 1976. The album has been touted as an inspiration by numerous bands including Scream, Nurse With Wound, the Melvins and Sonic Youth. In 1975, the Suicide Commandos formed in Minneapolis. They {{were one of the}} first U.S. bands outside of New York to play in the Ramones-style harder-louder-faster mode that would define punk rock. Detroit's Death self-released one of their 1974 recordings, [...] "Politicians in My Eyes", in 1976. As the punk movement expanded rapidly in the United Kingdom that year, a few bands with <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> and attitude appeared around the United States. The first West Coast punk scenes emerged in San Francisco, with the bands Crime and the Nuns, and Seattle, where the Telepaths, Meyce, and the Tupperwares played a groundbreaking show on May 1. Rock critic Richard Meltzer cofounded VOM (short for [...] "vomit") in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, performer Alice Bag formed the punk music group the Bags in 1977. Alice influenced the Hollywood punk scene by incorporating Mexican and Chicano musical culture into her music through canción ranchera—which translates to [...] "country song" [...] and is associated with mariachi ensembles—as well as estilo bravío, a wild style of performance often seen in punk. In Washington, D.C., raucous roots-rockers the Razz helped along a nascent punk scene featuring Overkill, the Slickee Boys, and the Look. Around the turn of the year, White Boy began giving notoriously crazed performances. In Boston, the scene at the Rathskeller—affectionately known as the Rat—was also turning toward punk, though the defining sound retained a distinct garage rock orientation. Among the city's first new acts to be identified with punk rock was DMZ. In Bloomington, Indiana, the Gizmos played in a jokey, raunchy, Dictators-inspired style later referred to as [...] "frat punk".|$|E

2500|$|While {{out walking}} on New Years Day 1987, Drummond {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} make a hip-hop record. However, [...] "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said. [...] "...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew Jimmy , I {{knew he was a}} like spirit, we share <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said 'Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu'. And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'".|$|E

2500|$|Several {{sessions}} of experimentation in Boston, Massachusetts led friends Aaron Turner (guitar/vocals; also {{the owner of}} Hydra Head Records and its subsidiary, HH Noise Industries), Jeff Caxide (bass guitar), Chris Mereschuk (electronics/vocals) and Aaron Harris (drums) to form Isis in late 1997. As Turner states, [...] "Isis formed {{as a result of}} the dissatisfaction with past bands of the founding members. None of us were happy with what we were doing musically at the time, two of us lived together, we had <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> and similar record collections." [...] Isis released a demo and their first EP, Mosquito Control, in 1998, with this line-up. During a show at the Middle East in Boston, MA, they sold copies of Mosquito Control attached to a circular sawblade as a very limited print edition. After an East Coast tour in the summer of 1998 where they were joined by Randy Larsen of Cable on guitar, Mereschuk left the band. Jay Randall (now of Agoraphobic Nosebleed) soon replaced him, working on Red Sea (1999). However, his stay would not last long. Isis then recruited guitarist/keyboardist Bryant Clifford Meyer (formerly of The Gersch) and guitarist Michael Gallagher (formerly of Cast Iron Hike) in 1999. After releasing their full-length debut entitled Celestial and its sister EP, SGNL›05 (on Neurot Recordings), in 2000, Isis gained national underground attention in the metal/hardcore scene through tours with Cave In and Neurosis. Isis remained with this lineup until their dissolution in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Back in Melbourne, {{the couple}} formed Dave Graney with The White Buffaloes with Rod Hayward (ex-Little Murders) on guitar, Conway Savage (Boy Kings) on {{keyboards}} and Walsh (The Moodists) on bass guitar. Graney had adopted a cowboy image, wearing snake skin and brown suede, sporting a curled moustache and waxed goatee. The band released My Life on the Plains in 1989 with Phil Vinall producing. Vinall, {{a friend of}} Graney and Moore, later worked with The Auteurs, Placebo and Magic Dirt (among others). The album included tracks written by other artists, such as Gene Clarke, Fred Neil, Gram Parsons and the traditional [...] "Streets of Laredo". In their live shows they included songs by Doug Sahm, Lou Reed, Buffy Sainte Marie and Tim Rose. The title was from an autobiographical tome by George Armstrong Custer in 1876, the year he died at Little Big Horn. The cover featured images of a young Jesse James, Custer and ornate Edwardian lettering by London artist Dave Western, based on a Frederic Remington cowboy painting. It reflected Graney's current persona and obsession with wild western myth and late 1960s psychedelic bands with <b>similar</b> <b>tastes,</b> The Charlatans and Quicksilver Messenger Service from San Francisco. No singles were released from the album, although a video was shot by Tony Mahony for [...] "Robert Ford on the Stage". Savage left to join Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and they were joined on pedal steel guitar by Graham Lee (The Triffids). This line-up recorded, Codine, a live in the studio four-track extended play, which was issued late in the year. It was later added to the CD version of the I was the Hunter... and I was The Prey album. [...] "Codine" [...] was written by Sainte-Marie and had been performed by The Charlatans in swaggering space cowboy style while the Dave Graney with the White Buffaloes cover version was [...] "romantic, country-flavoured R". The EP sleeve was another Dave Western illustration.|$|E

60|$|Walter Blake was a {{finished}} gambler, {{and thus it}} was, that with about six hundred a year, he managed to live on equal terms with the richest around him. His father, Laurence Blake of Castleblakeney, in County Galway, was a very embarrassed man, of good property, strictly entailed, and, when Walter came of age, he and his father, who could never be happy in the same house, though possessing in most things <b>similar</b> <b>tastes,</b> had made such a disposition of the estate, as gave the father a clear though narrowed income, and enabled the son at once to start into the world, without waiting for his father's death; though, by so doing, he greatly lessened the property which he must otherwise have inherited.|$|E

A life of pleasure, unless it were shared by his fellows, did not appeal to him at all; {{personal}} ambition he was destitute of; his religion, he was very well aware, was not the sort which would enable him to enter with any prospect of happiness any of the established churches. For a time he had travelled, and had come back with only one definite idea in his mind. Chance had brought him, on his return, into contact with two young men of somewhat <b>similar</b> <b>tastes.</b> A conversation between them one night had given a certain definiteness to his aims.

60|$|The {{watch and}} the knife, {{to which they}} reverted later on, kept the {{lecturer}} and audience going till late in the evening, by which time our sailor had completely won {{the hearts of the}} Eskimos, and they had all become again so hungry that Okiok gave a hint to his wife to stir up the lamp and prepare supper. Then, with a sigh of relief, they all allowed their strained minds to relax, and the conversation took a more general turn. It is but fair to add that, as the sailor had won the hearts of the natives, so his heart had been effectually enthralled by them. For Angut, in particular, Rooney felt that powerful attraction which is the result of <b>similar</b> <b>tastes,</b> mutual sympathies, and diversity of character. Rooney had a strong tendency to explain and teach; Angut a stronger tendency to listen and learn. The former was impulsive and hasty; the latter meditative and patient. Rooney was humorously disposed and jovial, while his Eskimo friend, though by no means devoid of humour, was naturally grave and sedate. Thus their dispositions formed a pleasing contrast, and their tastes an agreeable harmony.|$|E
60|$|Aynesworth {{continued}} his dinner in silence. After all, {{he was beginning}} to fear that he had made a mistake. Lovell had somehow contrived to impart a subtly tragic note to his story, but the outcome of it all seemed to assume a more sordid aspect. These two would meet, there would be recriminations, a tragic appeal for forgiveness, possibly some melodramatic attempt at vengeance. The glamour of the affair seemed to him to be fading away, now that he had come into actual contact with it. It was not until he began to study his companion during a somewhat prolonged silence that he felt the reaction. It was then that he began to see new things, that he felt the enthusiasm kindled by Lovell's strangely told story begin to revive. It was not the watching for events more or less commonplace which would repay him for the step he had taken; it was the study of this man, placed in so strange a position,--a man come back to life, after years of absolute isolation. He had broken away from the chain which links together men of <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> and occupations, and which goes to the creation of type. He was in a unique position! He was in the world, but not of it. He was groping about amongst familiar scenes, over which time had thrown the pall of unfamiliarity. What manner of place would he find--what manner of place did he desire to find? It was here that the real interest of the situation culminated. At least, so Aynesworth thought then.|$|E
