Previous work indicates {{that there is a}} genetic component, principally from the dam. The proportion of males in a litter appears {{to be related to the}} anogenital distance of the gilts in the litter, possibly as a result of the intrauterine position effect. The present study investigated whether litter size, litter sex ratio, anogenital distance, crown=n- length, distance from base of skull to base of tail, and the number of teats on the dam and boar affected the number of teats on gilts. Stepwise multiple regression on litter mean values (adjusted r 2 = 0. 178) indicated that two factors were significant: the number of teats on the dam (<b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> 0. 311) and the proportion of males in the litter (<b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> =-. 282). A greater number of teats on the dam and a lower proportion of males in the litter resulted in a greater number of teats on the gilt. When the analysis was run using individual gilts as the independent units (adjusted r 2 = 0. 073), the number of teats on the dam (<b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> 0. 207), the proportion of males in the litter (<b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> =-. 135),and the weaning weight of the gilt(standard coefficient 0. 083) were all significant predictors of the number of teats.

Method: The cross-sectional study was completed with 226 adult patients with different health conditions who attended a Brazilian rehabilitation unit. The ICF components were measured with the following instruments: World Health Organization Disability Assessment Instrument II, Functional Independence Measure, Participation Scale, Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors, and a protocol designed to gather information on body structure and function and personal factors. Results: Structural equation modeling showed good model adjustment, GFI= 0. 863; AGFI= 0. 795; RMSEA= 0. 028 (90 % CI= 0. 014 - 0. 043). Significant relationships were found between activity and both body structure and function (standard coefficient= 0. 32; p< 0. 0001) and participation components (standard coefficient=– 0. 70; p< 0. 0001). Environmental and personal factors {{had a significant effect}} on the three functioning components (<b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> = 0. 39; p< 0. 0001; <b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> =- 0. 35; p< 0. 001, respectively). In contrast, body structure and function had no significant effect on participation (standard coefficient=– 0. 10; p= 0. 111) and health conditions had no significant effect on any of the functioning components, i. e., body structure and function, activity, and participation (standard coefficient=– 0. 12; p= 0. 128). Conclusion: Some of the ICF’s proposed relationships across domains were confirmed, while others were not found to be significant.

40|$|Passive {{samplers}} {{are often}} employed to collect ozone concentration data {{in remote areas}} such as mountain forests (e. g. Sanz et al., 2007); such data can be subsequently {{used to assess the}} potential ozone risk for vegetation by estimating the AOT 40 exposure index (e. g. Gerosa et al 2007). Lab sheets typically report ozone concentrations in mass unit per cubic meter (e. g. μg•m- 3) and these values are then converted to ppb since this unit let to appreciate the relative abundance of the pollutant molecules with respect to the other molecules in ambient air. Moreover the AOT 40 index to assess the vegetation exposure to ozone is based on this unit. Conversion from mass unit to ppb is usually carried out applying a <b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 1. 96, referred to SATP conditions (Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure = 25 °C and 100 kPa). However, such conditions can greatly vary with the elevation and the average temperatures of the measuring periods at each site. Moreover the temperature at a certain elevation site depends on the temperature gradient which is not always known. As a consequence, the blanket application of a <b>standard</b> <b>coefficient</b> may lead to substantial errors in reporting and mapping ozone concentration and in the assessment of potential risk in terms of AOT 40, particularly in mountain regions. In this paper, examples from two mapping exercises are presented, with regards to the ozone concentrations and the AOT 40 estimation errors in the Italian Alps. Adiabatic lapse rates for temperature and pressure were applied to derive P and T at each given elevated station, starting from the T and P values recorded at some station located in the valley bottom.

40|$|Abstract Evaluation of {{the effect}} of {{radiation}} on evapotranspiration estimates and drought indices The severity of drought can be inferred from water balance, of which evapotranspiration is a component. The evapotranspiration estimates are often based on the FAO 56 methodology with the net radiation as the main input. Usually, however, the latter is not directly measured. This study investigates to which extent can the direct solar radiation and the long-wave net radiation measurements be replaced by calculation according to FAO 56 with constant or locally optimised radiation coefficients or, for the long-wave net radiation, the coefficients according to Penman (1948). The problem is demonstrated on data from the Solar and Ozone Observatory in Hradec Králové for 2011 and 2012. On average, the estimates of solar radiation are satisfactory even with the <b>standard</b> <b>coefficients</b> and can be improved by local optimisation of the coefficients. The estimates for particular days may considerably differ from reality. The long-wave net radiation estimate according to FAO 56 is, on average, by about 30 % lower than the measured long-wave net radiation or an estimate thereof based on locally optimised or Penman's coefficients, with the average differences between any two of the last three methods much smaller (less than 9 %). The inaccuracy of estimates for particular days is considerable, too. The average reference crop evapotranspiration according to FAO 56 with <b>standard</b> <b>coefficients</b> is therefore considerably higher (by about 15 %) than analogous evapotranspiration obtained from the measured radiation or according to FAO 56 with optimised or Penman's radiation coefficients. The cause is that grass in the observatory was not irrigated. It therefore occasionally suffered from water stress and got overheated. The use of FAO 56 with the radiation inputs measured or calculated using other than the <b>standard</b> radiation <b>coefficients</b> may underestimate the evapotranspiration and the need for irrigation...|$|R
