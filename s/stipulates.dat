50|$|Law {{resource}} NOLO {{notes that}} people have a common confusion about <b>stipulated</b> removal, believing that <b>stipulating</b> to be removed improves a person's chances for re-entry, possibly due the conflation of <b>stipulated</b> removal with voluntary departure.

50|$|<b>Stipulated</b> removal was {{formally}} launched in 1995 with the stated goal of alleviating overcrowding in federal, state, and local detention centers. However, {{it began to}} be used in a significant way only starting 2004, when George W. Bush, the President of the United States at the time, started ramping up immigration enforcement. Between 1999 and 2003, a total of 6 people were subject to <b>stipulated</b> removal. On the other hand, the number of people subject to <b>stipulated</b> removal increased from 5,491 in 2004 to over 30,000 by 2007. Between 2004 and 2009, the detention facilities at Eloy and Chicago together accounted for over a third of the <b>stipulated</b> removal orders. The total number of <b>stipulated</b> removals exceeded 160,000 as of September 2011, and the majority of individuals targeted for <b>stipulated</b> removal hailed from Mexico.|$|R

The authors investigate a model in which the breaching party makes a specific investment and show that (1) the breaching party's overinvestment can be an effective commitment device without need to use <b>stipulated</b> damages, (2) the commitment through overinvestment does not suffer from the penalty doctrine nor from the possibility of renegotiation, and (3) the availability of <b>stipulated</b> damages creates no additional effect. ...|$|R

5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule <b>stipulates</b> that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also <b>stipulates</b> that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E

First, Harper bypassed parliament's supreme court selection panel, {{which was supposed to}} produce a list of three candidates for him to choose from. Second, Newfoundland justice minister Jerome Kennedy criticized the appointment, citing the Newfoundland government's belief that constitutional convention <b>stipulates</b> that a Newfoundlander should have been named to the court in the rotation of Atlantic Canadian supreme court representation.|$|E

A reborn artist can join the organization at any skill level, but members are asked to uphold a list of standards that were created by the IRDA's executive board.

5|$|The Municipal Act, 2001 is the {{legislation}} that enables incorporation and <b>stipulates</b> governance of Ontario's municipalities, excluding the City of Toronto, which {{is subject to the}} City of Toronto Act, 2006. The Municipal Act, 2001 provides lower and single-tier municipalities with the authority to incorporate as cities, towns, villages, townships, or generically as municipalities. There are no minimum population thresholds or other requirements for these municipal sub-types. A municipality can change its status to any of these so long as its resulting name is not being used by another municipality. For upper-tier municipalities, the act provides them with the authority to incorporate as counties, regions and district municipalities.|$|E

5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes <b>stipulates</b> that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Hosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat as President of Egypt {{following}} Sadat's assassination in 1981. While al-Azhar {{would continue}} to oblige the government in granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates, the mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under Mubarak's regime. Under Jad al-Haq, the sheikh of al-Azhar from 1982 {{until his death in}} 1994, al-Azhar asserted its independence from the state, at times criticizing policies of the state for instigating extremist Islamist sects. Al-Haq argued that if the government wished al-Azhar to effectively combat groups such as al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya then al-Azhar must be permitted greater independence from the state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference. Under Mubarak, a number of powers of the state were ceded to al-Azhar. During the 1990s, modifications to existing censorship laws gave al-Azhar the ability to censor both print and electronic media. Though the law <b>stipulates</b> that al-Azhar may only become involved following a complaint, in practice its role has been much more pervasive; for example, television scripts were routinely sent to al-Azhar for approval prior to airing.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Allied airmen {{who were}} {{captured}} after being {{shot down over}} Japan were mistreated. On 8September 1944, the Cabinet of Japan directed that indiscriminate bombing constituted a war crime despite the fact there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft at the time. As a result, captured Allied airmen were subject to trial and possible execution although the rules of war <b>stipulates</b> that only soldiers who engaged in combat or carry out acts of sabotage or espionage wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes behind enemy lines can be punished. The frequency of such executions differed between military districts, however. While no airmen were executed in the Tōbu district (eastern Musashi), which included Tokyo, those captured in the Tōkai, Chūbu and Seibu (western Musashi) districts were sometimes killed after a brief trial or summarily executed by the Kempeitai ("Military Police Corps"). For instance, 33 American airmen were killed by IJA personnel at Fukuoka, including 15 who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on 15 August. Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the men into custody. In addition to these killings, most captured B-29 crewmen were brutally interrogated by the Kempeitai.|$|E
