50|$|LHIIIB pottery is {{associated}} in the Greek mainland palaces with the Linear B archives. (Linear B {{had been in}} use in Crete since Late Minoan II.) Pulak's proposed LHIIIA/B boundary would make LHIIIB contemporary in Anatolia with the resurgent Hittites following Mursili's eclipse; in Egypt with the 19th Dynasty, {{also known as the}} Ramessides; and in northern Mesopotamia with Assyria's ascendancy over Mitanni. The end of LHIIIB {{is associated}} with the destruction of Ugarit, whose ruins contain the last of that pottery. The Tsoungiza date for the end of LHIIIB is 1200/1190 BCE. The beginning of LHIIIC, therefore, is now commonly set into the reign of Queen Twosret. The LHIIIC has been divided into LHIIIC:1 and LHIIIC:2 by Furumark, based on materials from tombs in Mycenae, Asine, Kephalonia, and Rhodes. In the 1960s, the excavations of the citadel at Mycenae and of Lefkandi in Euboea yielded <b>stratified</b> <b>material</b> revealing significant regional variation in LHIIIC, especially in the later phases.

The western part of the transverse ridge consists of fragments of uplifted oceanic crust and upper mantle.

Here we present reflection terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurements and matching transfer matrix simulations {{of the frequency}} dependent reflection coefficient of multi layer building materials in the frequency range from 100 to 500 GHz {{for a set of}} angles, both in TE- and TM-polarization. Two prominent stratified structures, a double pane window and white paint on plaster are investigated as they usually account for large areas in indoor environments. Communication systems located above 100 GHz are expected to be strongly affected by the variations of the reflectivity over the frequency and incident angle of such <b>stratified</b> <b>materials</b> as they will rely both on line of sight (LOS) and non line of sight (NLOS) propagation.

30|$|A unique {{feature of}} COSFLOW is the {{incorporation}} of Cosserat continuum theory in its formulation. In the Cosserat model, inter-layer interfaces {{are considered to be}} smeared across the mass, i.e., the effects of interfaces are incorporated implicitly in the choice of stress–strain model formulation. An important feature of the Cosserat model is that it incorporates bending rigidity of individual layers in its formulation and this makes it different from other conventional implicit models. In comparison with the conventional continuum model which has three independent degrees of freedom and six independent stress components in a three dimensional case, the Cosserat model for the <b>stratified</b> <b>material</b> will have six independent degrees of freedom and 10 independent stress components. The layer interfaces can exhibit three different modes of behaviour: (a) elastically connected with the interface normal and shear stiffness, (b) plastic with frictional sliding and (c) disconnected with tensile opening. Similarly the rock layer may either deform elastically or may sustain some plastic deformation as well.|$|E
40|$|A {{roughened}} seafloor may {{be expected}} to scatter incident sound at non-specular angles, but also to reflect coherently at the specular angle, with some loss of amplitude attributed to the scattering and some loss attributed to sound transmission into, and absorption within, the seafloor. Our initial expectation was that a reasonable estimation of the total coherent reflection loss, at a given grazing angle, might be obtained simply from a combination of the loss at-tributed to a flat seafloor based on its geoacoustic properties, and the separate coherent loss due to the roughness scat-tering described for a pressure release surface. To test this hypothesis, loss values obtained using this simple addition of model outputs were produced for several seafloor material types with prescribed roughness profiles. These results are compared with loss values obtained using the perturbation approach for rough surface scattering from stratified media described by Kuperman and Schmidt (JASA, 86, Oct. 1989). The latter is a model which describes the coher-ent plane wave reflection from a rough surface of <b>stratified</b> <b>material</b> which has specified geoacoustic properties...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{comprehensive}} {{reports on}} the utilization of SAW (surface acoustic wave) devices as micro/nano actuators, there are still unexplored potentials to be pursued. Most current SAW actuators utilize 128 ˚ Y-X cut lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) piezoelectric substrates due to the high electromechanical coupling coefficient in this crystal direction. However, these substrates have a major disadvantage of being highly anisotropic, the piezoelectric coupling is therefore exceptionally dependent on the propagation direction and cut. Utilization of LiNbO 3 -based SAW devices as linear microactuators has been extensively reported; however, work on extending the work to rotate a solid object has been limited. At the same time, SAW based microfluidics applications has been gaining interest in the past decade; however, extension of this work, using piezoelectric materials other than LiNbO¬ 3 has rarely been reported. Hence, {{there is a need}} to advance this field further. This thesis proposes the use of alternative—isotropic—piezoelectric materials for SAW actuators. The materials selected for this purpose are lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and a hybrid of zinc oxide (ZnO) and sapphire (Al 2 O 3) material. PZT and ZnO are common piezoelectric materials, but have not been used widely as SAW actuators. They are selected due to their isotropic piezoelectric properties in the plane of the substrate, which is essential for generating multi-axis actuation on the plane of the substrate The hybrid ZnO/Al 2 O 3 material is selected to exploit the collective benefits of these materials for the development of a high performance SAW device. A higher order harmonic wave, the Sezawa wave, can be induced in a <b>stratified</b> <b>material.</b> This mode of SAW propagation is generally perceived to have superior performance compared to the Rayleigh mode. The foremost aim of this thesis is to develop SAW based actuators for both solid and liquid objects: (1) the utilization of SAW generated on PZT material to drive a rotary motor, and (2) the utilization of a hybrid ZnO/Al 2 O 3 material for microfluidics applications. The first aim of the thesis is to develop a high speed SAW actuated motor prototype with the capability of rotating about an arbitrary axis. The following work was performed to achieve this goal: the fabrication and characterization of SAW devices made on the PZT substrate (the stator), the development of the SAW rotary motor operating with and without an external preload, and performance analysis of the motor with two different hole size configurations, specifically 0. 25 and 0. 45 mm. The main contribution of this work is an operational SAW actuated rotary motor with an arbitrarily chosen rotational axis. The motor has a simpler configuration and exhibits superior performance compared to SAW rotary motors reported in literature. The second aim of the project is to develop a SAW device exploiting the beneficial properties of a hybrid material for microfluidics applications, specifically SAW devices made on a ZnO/Al 2 O 3 <b>stratified</b> <b>material.</b> The following work was performed to achieve this goal: the fabrication and characterization of the performances of SAW devices made on ZnO/Al 2 O 3 hybrid material, verification and performance characterization of the generated Sezawa wave, and the utilization of the SAW device for microfluidics applications. The key finding of this work is that the wave vibration speed is the most influential parameter for acoustic streaming. As generally perceived, the Sezawa mode demonstrates better performance (it induces higher acoustic streaming speed) because it has higher electromechanical coupling (validated by the network analyzer data) and hence higher vibration speed for a given input power (validated by the LDV data). The main contribution of this work is the development of SAW devices based on a ZnO/Al 2 O 3 <b>stratified</b> <b>material</b> for microfluidics application. The devices performances are comparable to those based on the more common LiNbO 3 material; in addition, utilization of the Sezawa mode offers superior performances...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{uses the}} theme of stratification in relation to Karen Barad’s ‘agential cut’ (in Kember and Zylinska 2012 : 81) to argue for a discrete understanding of live media work {{within the field of}} intermediality. Live media performance encompasses modes where media elements are activated in real time and {{in the presence of the}} experiencers, including practices such as VJ-ing, live cinema, live coding and my own practice of live intermediality. The distinctive stratification of live media performance is revealed through its relation to the ‘cut’, which, in archaeological terms, is where an incision is made into the strata and a cross section of <b>stratified</b> <b>material</b> removed. Using such ideas as a lens through which to view the practice of live media performance, the real time formation of the intermedial space and successive events of stratification enacted by the performer are highlighted. In this work the strata, as they are formed, are held in a charged and composite intermedial moment, before their erasure, through the performer’s onstage ‘cut’ is enacted. As a result, live media work focuses attention on what Karen Barad calls the ‘agential cut’, in that the ‘intra-action’ (in Kember and Zylinska 2012 : 81) between performer and intermedial space is a present part of meaning-making within the work...|$|E

Our study investigates an array of out-of-plane microneedles to pierce the permeability barrier without reaching the nerves in the deeper layers. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the skin behavior during the insertion of a microneedle array through its different layers has not up to now been fully dealt with. In this paper, we assume skin to be similar to a <b>stratified</b> <b>material,</b> and approximate it as composed of three layers: the stratum corneum is described by a linear isotropic material model while a hyperelastic material model (Ogden) is used for the two deeper layers. The choice of the model is all the more important since we work at a microscopic scale. We prove that differences exist between the insertion of one microneedle and the insertion of an array of microneedles in terms of the skin deformation and value of the insertion force due to the interaction among microneedles. We simulate the insertion of a micro needles array using a finite element method and the results show a relation between the microneedle diameter, the array density and the microneedle length. Our arrays of microneedles are fabricated by deep reacting ion etching (DRIE) and coated by titanium out of biocompatibility concerns. In this paper, the dimensions of the microneedles are: 500 microns in length, 30 - 60 microns in inner channel diameter and 100 - 150 microns in outer diameter in order to be in agreement with our analytically analysis.

40|$|We {{review the}} major {{subglacial}} till forming processes as presently understood by glacial researchers and define the parameters within which tills are produced and reconcile them with sedimentary end members. Processes of deformation, flow, sliding, lodgement and ploughing coexist {{at the base}} of temperate glacier ice and act to mobilize and transport sediment and deposit it as various end members, ranging from glacitectonically folded and faulted <b>stratified</b> <b>material</b> to texturally homogeneous diamicton. The dominance of any one subglacial process varies both spatially and temporally, giving rise to the possibility that a till or complex till sequence contains a superimposed signature of former transportation/deposition at the ice-bed interface. We recommend that, while glacial geologists and geomorphologists should be able to recognize the sedimentary imprints of various subglacial processes, genetic fingerprinting of subglacial tills should be less process-specific and till classification must reflect the range of products encompassed by the subglacial till production continuum. Glacial geologists can presently unequivocally identify: a) glacitectonite (rock or sediment that has been deformed by subglacial shearing/deformation but retains some of the structural characteristics of the parent material); b) subglacial traction till (sediment deposited by a glacier sole either sliding over and/or deforming its bed, the sediment having been released directly from the ice by pressure melting and/or liberated from the substrate and then disaggregated and completely or largely homogenised by shearing); and support the theoretical case for c) melt-out till (sediment released by the melting of stagnant or slowly moving debris-rich glacier ice, and directly deposited without subsequent transport or deformation). Because observations on contemporary glaciers reveal that their beds {{are most likely to be}} mosaics of deformation and sliding and warm based and cold based conditions, the patterns of which change temporally and spatially, it is extremely unlikely that subglacial till end members in the geological record will be anything but hybrids produced by the range of processes operative in the subglacial traction zone. ...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{data have}} been used to {{determine}} the crustal and upper mantle structure of Tenerife, Canary Islands, a volcanic island of Tertiary age located on > 140 Ma oceanic crust. Reflection data show that oceanic basement dips gently towards the island, forming a flexural moat which is infilled by 2 - 3 km of well <b>stratified</b> <b>material.</b> The moat is characterised by a major angular unconformity, which we attribute to volcanic loading of pre-existing oceanic crust and overlying sediments and the subsequent infilling of the flexure by material that was derived, at least in part, from the islands. Refraction data show that the flexed oceanic crust has a mean thickness of 6. 41 ± 0. 42 km and upper and lower crustal velocities of 4. 8 - 5. 4 km s- 1 and 6. 7 - 7. 3 km s- 1 respectively. The flexure, which has been verified by gravity modelling, can be explained by a model in which Tenerife and adjacent islands have loaded a lithosphere with a long-term (> 106 yr) elastic thickness of approximately 20 km. Seismic and gravity data suggest that up to 1. 5 × 105 km 3 of magmatic material has been added {{to the surface of the}} flexed oceanic crust which, assuming an age of 6 - 16 Ma for the shield building stage on Tenerife, implies a magma generation rate of about 0. 006 to 0. 02 km 3 a- 1. This rate is similar to estimates from other African oceanic islands (e. g., Reunion and Cape Verdes), but is significantly less than that which has been calculated at Hawaii. There is no evidence in either the seismic or gravity data that any significant amount of magmatic material has "underplated" the flexed oceanic crust. The crustal and upper mantle structure at Tenerife therefore differs from other oceanic islands such as Hawaii and Marquesas where > 4 km of underplated material have been reported...|$|E
