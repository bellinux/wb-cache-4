5|$|Bird's nest fungi {{were first}} {{mentioned}} by Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia (1601). Over {{the next couple}} of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), erroneously suggested that peridioles were ejected from the fruiting bodies by some sort of <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism,</b> bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|Crossbow and repeating crossbow: According to British art {{historian}} Matthew Landruss and Gerald Hurley, Chinese crossbows {{may have been}} invented {{as far back as}} 2000 BC, while Anne McCants speculates that they existed around 1200 BC. In China bronze crossbow bolts dating as early as the mid 5th century BC were found at a State of Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Hubei. The earliest handheld crossbow stocks with bronze trigger, dating from the 6th century BC, comes from Tomb 3 and 12 found at Qufu, Shandong, capital of the State of Lu. Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, Hunan dated to the mid 4th century BC. Repeating crossbows, first mentioned in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, were discovered in 1986 in Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei dated to around the 4th century BC. The earliest textual evidence of the handheld crossbow used in battle dates to the 4th century BC. Handheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the Terracotta Army in the tomb of Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as cavalry units, and Han dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous battles against the Xiongnu to massed crossbow fire. In comparison, the ancient Greeks also had a crossbow known as the gastraphetes ("belly-bow", so named because the shooter had to draw the bow by pressing his stomach against the concave rear) also invented in the 5th century BC; other versions were the more portable Cheirobalista (hand balista), arcubalista and manubalista, this last Roman version was almost all metal composed (the <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the skeins). There was also the katapeltikon (399 BC), a siege weapon using similar mechanisms. Unlike the Chinese crossbow, the heavy weight and bulk of these weapons necessitated a prop to keep them standing.|$|E

50|$|Lantern clocks were {{originally}} weight-driven: usually one weight for time keeping {{and a second}} for striking. A few later lantern-style clocks were constructed with <b>spring</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and many surviving examples of the original weight-driven type have been converted to <b>spring</b> or pendulum <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most plough makers {{offer an}} {{automatic}} reset system for tough conditions or rocky soils. The re-set mechanism allows each body to move rearward and upward to pass over obstacle (e.g. rocks hidden below soil surface) without damage. A heavy leaf or coil <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which holds {{the body in}} its working position under normal conditions, resets the plough after the obstruction is passed.|$|E

After the turnover manoeuvre, {{they are no longer}} used and subsequent flight controlled via moving {{tail surfaces}}. A dual-mode solid-propellant rocket motor provides the missile with a maximum speed of Mach 4.5.|$|E

25|$|The {{safety pin}} is a {{fastening}} device, {{a variation of}} the regular pin, which includes a simple <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes, to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point. The safety pin was invented by Walter Hunt, and patented in April 1849. The rights to the invention were sold for $400.|$|E
25|$|The Panzerfaust 3 {{is light}} enough to be carried and fired by one person. It can be fired from {{enclosures}} since {{it does not have}} a significant backblast; the rear of the tube, filled with plastic granulate, minimises the blast effect by the so-called recoilless countermass principle. The booster propellant for the projectile in its tube is ignited by a bolt via a <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Once ejected from the launcher, the projectile coasts a safe distance and then the rocket motor is ignited, boosting it to its maximum speed, after which it coasts until impact. The gunner carries at least two rounds while the assistant grenadier carries an additional three rounds.|$|E
25|$|Testing of {{the first}} B-25 Mitchell armed with 75mm cannon was {{completed}} by the Air Proving Ground Command on 26 March 1943. It had first flown 2 October 1942. B-25C-1, 41-13296, c/n 82-5931, the final airframe of the -1 production block, was modified as the XB-25G prototype, fitted with a 75-mm M4 cannon which was 9 feet 6 inches long. The transparent nose was replaced with a shortened armored solid nose that reduced overall length to 51 feet. The cannon was mounted in a cradle in the lower left-hand side of the nose, which extended underneath the pilot's seat with a <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism</b> forming part of the gun mount {{to take up the}} 21-inch recoil. The cannon-armed Mitchell would enjoy success in the Southwest Pacific theatre.|$|E

50|$|The {{downside}} to drum magazines {{is that they}} increase the overall weight of the weapon {{in which they are}} being used. They are also more prone to jamming due to the complex <b>spring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> they contain.

40|$|<b>Sprung</b> {{translation}} <b>mechanisms</b> {{driven by}} electromagnetic force actuators {{are often used}} to produce controllable motions. This paper is concerned with one family of such devices incorporating linear <b>spring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> suitable for short-range, high-precision applications. In these, a permanent magnet {{is attached to the}} movable translating stage which is, in turn, surrounded by a solenoid coil attached to a fixed datum. Design considerations are discussed, principally an optimum dimensional design for a uniformly wound circular cylindrical coil. Design models are verijied by the construction of a simple device in steel and aluminium which demonstrates an open-loop positional accuracy of better than 0. 5 per cent over a displacement range of 100 nm to 50 pm. ...|$|R
25|$|Following {{successful}} {{trials of}} the initial locomotives, a production run of 43 locomotives were built by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry between 1965 and 1967. They were initially classified as Class JB and numbered E6007-E6049. They differed slightly from the six earlier machines, most notably having an increased tractive effort {{as well as a}} higher maximum speed (90mph as opposed to 80). Following the introduction of TOPS, they became Class 73/1 and were renumbered 73101-73142. One locomotive, E6027, had already been withdrawn following accident damage and so was not renumbered. Further changes were the use of large round Oleo buffers with a pneumatic withdrawal mechanism rather that the traditional coach style (oval) saddle buffer which relied on a pin and <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism.</b> As the JA examples came in for overhaul over the years, the saddle buffers were also replaced making visual identification of the differing machines almost impossible from a distance.|$|E
500|$|In {{species of}} Coleoptera (beetles), the only {{functional}} wings are the hindwings. The hindwings are {{longer than the}} elytra, folded longitudinally and transversely under the elytra. The wing is rotated forwards on its base into flight position. This action spread the wing and unfolded longitudinally and transversely. There is the <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the wing structure, sometimes {{with the help of}} abdomen movement, to keep the wing in folded position.

The structure and biology of the genus Cyathus was better known by the mid-19th century, starting with the appearance in 1842 of a paper by Carl Johann Friedrich Schmitz, and two years later, a monograph by the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne. The work of the Tulasnes was thorough and accurate, and was highly regarded by later researchers. Subsequently, monographs were written in 1902 by Violet S. White (on American species), Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1906, Gordon Herriot Cunningham in 1924 (on New Zealand species), and Harold J. Brodie in 1975.|$|E
50|$|At {{least one}} source claims that Messier's air {{suspension}} {{was the basis}} for the revolutionary Hydropneumatic suspension of later Citroën models including, most notably, the 1955 DS. The inventor of the Hydropneumatic suspension, Paul Magès, was born in 1908, so it is technically possible that he saw the glimmer of a good idea in the Messier and spent WW2 focused on intensive experimentation to improving the idea. He eventually used pressurized oil, not air, as the <b>springing</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the passage}} of the Switchblade Knife Act in the U.S. in 1958, it was {{discovered}} that some U.S. businesses were importing folding stiletto knives without <b>spring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which did not have a pronounced blade heel (internal surface) in the pivot area allowing the longer 11 and 13 inch-bladed models to easily flick open. Modern (post 1965) folding stilettos imported or distributed in the U.S. now have blade heels that are intentionally pointed and ratchet against the lockback mechanism, preventing inertia opening.|$|R
5000|$|The gun was a {{development}} of the previous standard howitzer, the 15 cm sFH 02. Improvements included a longer barrel resulting in better range and a gun shield to protect the crew. Variants were: the original [...] "kurz" [...] (L/14 - 14 calibre short barrel version), the lg. sFH13 with a longer barrel; and lg. sFH13/02 with minor modifications to simplify wartime manufacture of the lg. sFH weapons. Initially there were serious issues of weak recoil <b>spring</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that would break, and gun barrel explosions. The problems were solved with the upgrades.|$|R
2500|$|Automatic fly reels use a coiled <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{that pulls}} {{the line into}} the reel with the flick of a lever. [...] Automatic reels tend to be heavy for their size, and have limited line capacity. Automatic fly reels peaked in {{popularity}} during the 1960s, and since that time they have been outsold many times over by manual fly reels.|$|E
2500|$|Trolley poles {{are usually}} raised and lowered {{manually}} by a rope {{from the back}} of the vehicle. The rope feeds into a spring reel mechanism, called a [...] "trolley catcher" [...] or [...] "trolley retriever". The trolley catcher contains a detent, like that in an automotive shoulder safety belt, which [...] "catches" [...] the rope to prevent the trolley pole from flying upward if the pole is dewired. The similar looking retriever (see photo) adds a <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism</b> that yanks the pole downward if it should leave the wire, pulling it away from all overhead wire fittings. Catchers are commonly used on trams operating at lower speeds, as in a city, whilst retrievers are used on suburban and interurban lines to limit damage to the overhead at speed.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "shooting machine" [...] was {{designed}} to be loaded with two lethal rounds and a blank cartridge, each connected to a coiled <b>spring</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the firing area and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: [...] "I much obligated to you. You be good man to me." [...] Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant’s heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said [...] "I die like a soldier" [...] before he was shot to death.|$|E
5000|$|In total, {{approximately}} 15,000 Deringer pistols were manufactured. All {{were single}} barrel pistols with back action percussion locks, typically [...]41" [...] rifled bores, and walnut stocks. Barrel length varied from 1.5" [...] to 6", and the hardware was commonly a copper-nickel alloy known as [...] "German silver". The back action lock was a later, improved design among locks, {{which had its}} <b>spring</b> and <b>mechanism</b> located behind the hammer, where it was thereby protected from dirt, fired cap residue, and gunpowder residue unlike earlier front action locks that had their <b>springs</b> and <b>mechanism</b> located directly {{in the path of}} such residue in front of the hammer, under the tube.|$|R

50|$|The first models {{featured}} dark grey one-piece plastic {{wheels and}} chromed plastic bases. These cheaper bases made the models lighter and perhaps less durable than Matchbox cars (Rixon 2005, pp. 32-33). Still, their construction did {{allow for a}} simple suspension system to be installed {{by means of the}} axle being positioned to be sandwiched between the main base and a section of the plastic base which was cut away on three of sides to form a plastic tongue, which acted as a crude <b>springing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In 1969 Mettoy re-designed and improved the quality of the models. Die cast metal bases, better suspension and two-piece separate hub and tyre wheels were fitted to upgrade existing models along with a variety of new models that were added to the range.|$|R
