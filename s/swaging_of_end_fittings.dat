40|$|Insulators are the {{integral}} part of the power system. Among them polymeric insulators are essential for the better performance. Polymer insulators become popular due to various advantages offered such as light weight, ease of installation and lower cost. Despite numerous advantages offered, there are also some problems regarding the polymer insulators. One of the factors governing the electrical performance of polymeric insulator is characterized by its field distribution along their length. This thesis has been made to analyse insulator performance via their electric field distribution. By improving the electric field distribution, it will help in enhancing their long term performance of insulator. The COMSOL Multiphysics software has been employed to investigate the electric field stresss along the insulator‟s surface.. An 11 kV of polymeric insulator in clean and dry condition is modelled for simulation. For electric field‟s optimisation purpose, three different techniques are used to investigate its distribution along the insulator‟s surface. The techniques employed are as follow: i) different configuration <b>of</b> metal <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> design, ii) improve of insulator weather shed shape and iii) installation of corona ring at appropriate location. From the observation, all the techniques proposed have significant effect on electric field distributions. Simulation of insulator model has shown that the maximum value of electric field stress was found to be at the region <b>of</b> metal <b>end</b> <b>fittings.</b> After the application of all optimization techniques, the electric field stress performance of the proposed insulator is reduced by 83. 97 % to 9. 643 x 104 V/m from 6. 015 x 105 V/m at the beginning...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of sub- 2 -mu m particles, core shell particles, and monolithic columns has improved separation performance in liquid chromatography (LC) {{over the past}} 20 years. However, a key limitation that still prevents LC columns from reaching their full potential is the heterogeneity in the flow profile of solute bands as they travel through the chromatographic packing material within the column. Solutes travel through the column in bowl-like migration profiles, and, as a consequence, more separation power is needed to separate closely eluting solute bands. This limitation can be overcome by using {{a new type of}} column technology referred to as active flow technology (AFT). These columns use a new type <b>of</b> column <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> that negates the problems associated with the bowl-like solute profiles caused by heterogeneity in the fluid flow through the column, which improves efficiency, sensitivity, and therefore increases sample throughput.

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised {{to enable the}} {{fabrication}} of lightweight pressure vessels from multilayer composite materials. This method is related to, but not the same as, the method described in gMaking a Metal- Lined Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel h (MFS- 31814), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 3 (March 2005), page 59. The method is flexible in that it poses no major impediment to changes in tank design and is applicable {{to a wide range}} of tank sizes. The figure depicts a finished tank fabricated by this method, showing layers added at various stages of the fabrication process. In the first step of the process, a mandrel that defines the size and shape of the interior of the tank is machined from a polyurethane foam or other suitable lightweight tooling material. The mandrel is outfitted with metallic <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> on a shaft. Each <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> includes an outer flange that has a small step to accommodate a thin layer of graphite/epoxy or other suitable composite material. The outer surface of the mandrel (but not the fittings) is covered with a suitable release material. The composite material is filament- wound so as to cover the entire surface of the mandrel from the step on one <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> to the step on the other <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> The composite material is then cured in place. The entire workpiece is cut in half in a plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry at its mid-length point, yielding two composite-material half shells, each containing half of the foam mandrel. The halves of the mandrel are removed from within the composite shells, then the shells are reassembled and bonded together with a belly band of cured composite material. The resulting composite shell becomes a mandrel for the subsequent steps of the fabrication process and remains inside the final tank. The outer surface of the composite shell is covered with a layer of material designed to be impermeable by the pressurized fluid to be contained in the tank. A second step on the outer flange <b>of</b> each <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> accommodates this layer. Depending on the application, this layer could be, for example, a layer of rubber, a polymer film, or an electrodeposited layer of metal. If the fluid to be contained in the tank is a gas, then the best permeation barrier is electrodeposited metal (typically copper or nickel), which can be effective at a thickness of as little as 0. 005 in (. 0. 13 mm). The electrodeposited metal becomes molecularly bonded to the second step on each metallic <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> The permeation-barrier layer is covered with many layers of filament-wound composite material, which could be the same as, or different from, the composite material of the inner shell. Finally, the filament-wound composite material is cured in an o...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a computational {{study of the}} critical buckling pressure of pumpkin balloons, which consist of a thin, compliant membrane constrained by stiff meridional tendons. The n-fold symmetric shape of a pumpkin balloon with n identical lobes is exploited by adopting a symmetry-adapted coordinate system, {{which leads to the}} tangent stiffness matrix in an efficient block-diagonal form; the smallest eigenvalue of a particular block leads to the buckling pressure for the balloon. Two different types of balloon design are considered. Extensive results are obtained for the buckling pressures of a set of 10 m diameter experimental balloons and also for an 80 m diameter flight balloon. The key findings are as follows: the same type of buckling mode, forming four circumferential waves is critical for most of the balloons that have been analysed; balloons with flatter lobes are more stable, and the buckling pressure varies with an inverse power-law of the number of lobes; increasing the Young’s modulus, the Poisson’s ratio of the membrane, or the diameter <b>of</b> the <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> has the effect of increasing the buckling pressure; but increasing the axial stiffness of the tendons has the effect of decreasing the buckling pressure...|$|R
