40|$|A {{phase locked}} {{interference}} microscope capable of resolving depth differences to 30 A and planar displacements of 6000 A was constructed for {{the examination of}} the profiles of bearing surfaces without physical contact. This instrument was used to determine surface chemical reactivity by applying a drop of dilute alcoholic hydrochloric acid and measuring the profile of the solid surface before and after application of this probe. <b>Scuffed</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces reacted much faster than unscuffed ones, but bearing surfaces which had been previously exposed to lubricants containing an organic chloride reacted much more slowly. In a separate series of experiments, a number of stainless steel plates were heated in a nitrogen atmosphere to different temperatures and their reactivity examined later at room temperature. The change of surface contour {{as a result of the}} probe reaction followed an Arrhenius type relation with respect to heat treatment temperature. This result could have implications on the scuffing mechanism...|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} optical {{laser interferometer}} capable of resolving depth differences of {{as low as}} 30 A and planar displacements of 6000 A was constructed for the examination of surface profiles of bearing surfaces without physical contact. This instrument {{was used to determine}} topological chemical reactivity by applying a drop of dilute alcoholic hydrochloric acid and measuring the profile of the solid surface before and after application of this probe. It was found that <b>scuffed</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces reacted much faster than virgin ones but that bearing surfaces exposed to lubricants containing an organic chloride reacted much more slowly. In a separate series of experiments, a number of stainless steel plates were heated in a nitrogen atmosphere to different temperatures and their reactivity examined later at ambient temperature. The change of surface contour {{as a result of the}} probe reaction was found to follow an Arrhenius-type relation with respect to heat treatment temperature.

The contact area of the plate of a ball/plate sliding elastohydrodynamic contact run on trimethylopropane triheptanoate with or without additives was optically profiled periodically. As scuffing was approached, the change of profile within the contact region changed much more rapidly by the acid probe and assumed a constant high value after scuffing. A nonetching metallurgical phase was found in the scuff mark, which was apparently responsible for the high reactivity...|$|E
