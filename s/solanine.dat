25|$|When {{potato tubers}} {{are exposed to}} light, they turn green and {{increase}} glycoalkaloid production. This is a natural defense to help prevent the uncovered tuber from being eaten. The green colour is from chlorophyll, and is itself harmless. However, it {{is an indication that}} increased level of <b>solanine</b> and chaconine may be present. In potato tubers, 30–80% of the <b>solanine</b> develops in and close to the skin, and some potato varieties have high levels of <b>solanine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some, {{such as the}} California Poison Control System, {{have claimed}} that {{tomatoes}} and tomato leaves contain <b>solanine.</b> However, Mendel Friedman of the United States Department of Agriculture contradicts this claim, stating that tomatine, a relatively benign alkaloid, is the tomato alkaloid while <b>solanine</b> is found in potatoes. Food science writer Harold McGee has found scant evidence for tomato toxicity in the medical and veterinary literature.|$|E
25|$|Breeders {{try to keep}} glycoalkaloid levels below 200mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, {{when these}} {{commercial}} varieties turn green, they can still approach concentrations of <b>solanine</b> of 1000mg/kg (1000 ppmw). In normal potatoes, analysis has shown <b>solanine</b> levels may {{be as little as}} 3.5% of the breeders' maximum, with 7–187mg/kg being found. While a normal potato has 12–20mg/kg of glycoalkaloid content, a green tuber contains 250–280mg/kg, and green skin 1500–2200mg/kg.|$|E

25|$|Potatoes {{naturally}} produce <b>solanine</b> and chaconine, {{a related}} glycoalkaloid, {{as a defense}} mechanism against insects, disease, and herbivores. Potato leaves, stems, and shoots are naturally high in glycoalkaloids.|$|E
25|$|Because of the plant's {{relationship}} with various other nightshades, the fruit {{was at one}} time believed to be extremely poisonous. The flowers and leaves can be poisonous if consumed in large quantities due {{to the presence of}} <b>solanine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of <b>solanine</b> in {{moderate}} amounts {{can cause}} death. One {{study suggests that}} doses of 2 to 5mg/kg of body weight can cause toxic symptoms, and doses of 3 to 6mg/kg of body weight can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes contain toxic {{compounds}} {{known as}} glycoalkaloids, {{of which the}} most prevalent are <b>solanine</b> and chaconine. <b>Solanine</b> {{is also found in}} other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana), as well as eggplant and tomato. These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the roots). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel , stems, and tuber flesh).|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies show}} a {{correlation}} between the consumption of potatoes suffering from late blight (which increases <b>solanine</b> and other glycoalkaloid levels) and the incidence of congenital spina bifida in humans. However, other studies have shown no correlation between potato consumption and the incidence of birth defects.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{temperature}} of cooking (the boiling point of water) {{is a significant}} safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food in a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces {{the time needed to}} heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. <b>solanine)</b> levels. Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Solanine</b> {{poisoning}} {{is primarily}} displayed by gastrointestinal and neurological disorders.

[...] In more severe cases, hallucinations, loss of sensation, paralysis, fever, jaundice, dilated pupils, hypothermia, and death have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|New tubers {{may arise}} at the soil surface. Since {{exposure}} to light leads to greening of the skins {{and the development}} of <b>solanine,</b> growers cover such tubers. Commercial growers achieve this by piling additional soil {{around the base of the}} plant as it grows ("hilling", or in British English [...] "earthing up"). An alternative method used by home gardeners and smaller-scale growers involves covering the growing area with organic mulches such as straw or plastic sheets.|$|E
2500|$|After flowering, {{potato plants}} produce small green fruits that {{resemble}} green cherry tomatoes, each containing about 300 seeds. Like {{all parts of}} the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic alkaloid <b>solanine</b> and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called [...] "true potato seed", [...] "TPS" [...] or [...] "botanical seed" [...] to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be propagated vegetatively by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.|$|E

50|$|Leaves, stems, {{and green}} unripe {{fruit of the}} tomato plant contain small amounts of the toxic {{alkaloid}} tomatine. They also contain small amounts of <b>solanine,</b> a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family.

However, levels of tomatine in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed, for example, as greens. Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect, and the green fruit is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes. Compared to potatoes, the amount of <b>solanine</b> in green or ripe tomatoes is low; however, even in the case of potatoes while <b>solanine</b> poisoning resulting from dosages several times normal human consumption has been demonstrated, actual cases of poisoning resulting from excessive consumption of potatoes that have high concentration of <b>solanine</b> are rare.|$|E

50|$|Although fatal human poisonings are rare, {{several cases}} have been documented. The poison is {{believed}} to be <b>solanine.</b> Aggressive treatment of children ingesting limited amounts of ripened S. dulcamara berries appears to be unnecessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{possible}} {{risks of}} tomatine for humans {{have not been}} formally studied, so no NOAEL can be deduced. The toxicity of tomatine has only been studied on laboratory animals.

These symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, drowsiness, confusion, weakness, and depression. Generally, tomatine is regarded to cause less toxic effects to mammals than other alkaloids such as <b>solanine.</b> The amount of tomatine absorbed by the human body as well as the possible metabolism is unknown. There is no evidence that consumption of tomatoes causes acute toxic or genotoxic effects.|$|E
