5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories.

25|$|The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations {{require that}} all public {{passenger}} trains must {{be accessible to}} disabled people by 2020. Only one Pacer (the modernised 144e) currently meets this requirement, and the remainder will therefore need to be withdrawn by that date unless they receive an extensive refurbishment.

25|$|Selling {{human waste}} {{products}} as fertilizers became much less common after World War II, both for sanitary reasons {{and because of}} the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is now used for fertilization. Because of this history, Japan had a much higher historical standard of hygiene. For example, in Japan, the orderly disposal of human waste was common, while in Europe, sewage was simply dumped on the streets throughout much of the continent's early modern history.

Arguing that the AKP has a dream for a new Turkey, he claimed that anyone who did not <b>see</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> dream should be embarrassed. He also promised to not marginalise or polarise the electorate, and vowed to safeguard the union of the nation.

Sultan Mecid's other wives attended as well, scattering coins, Until evening {{they passed the}} time listening to the ensemble playing traditional Ottoman music, after which sherbet was served, followed by a banquet.

25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

500|$|On the {{announcement}} of his retirement in 2005, Bure was named Russia's Olympic general manager, succeeding Viacheslav Fetisov.

Only those who really want to play for Russia will be called into the team." [...] As general manager, Bure chose the team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. The Russians failed to win a medal, losing to the Czech Republic in the bronze medal match. Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, former Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak was named Bure's successor as Olympic general manager.|$|E

500|$|Alien: Isolation {{was first}} {{unveiled}} on 12 May 2011 when UK government minister Ed Vaizey visited the Creative Assembly and revealed on his Twitter account that the studio was hiring for an Alien game. Although no gameplay details were confirmed, the Creative Assembly did confirm to CVG {{that the game}} would be released for consoles, but did not specify any format. Sega boss Mike Hayes {{also said that the}} game was going to be [...] "very much a triple-A project. We want this to be a peer to the likes of Dead Space 2." [...] Although the game's name was anticipated following a trademark registration in October 2013 and some screenshots of the game were leaked in December 2013, Alien: Isolation was formally announced and confirmed for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One platforms with the release of a teaser trailer on 7 January 2014. The developers also stated that they were not worried about the fact that Sega's previous Alien game, , received a negative public reaction. According to Napper, [...] "It did completely reaffirm to us that there was a massive Alien fanbase out there [...] just to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> vocal reaction to the game, everything that they've said they want is something that we're building and we're very excited about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Children's comics such as The Rover, The Hotspur, Schoolgirls' Own, The Magnet and Adventure usually {{contained}} {{a mixture of}} adventure stories, presented as text rather than strip cartoons, and some British boys were buying American horror comics produced for G.I.s. Morris {{was impressed by the}} high standard of artwork in the US magazines, but disgusted by their content, which he described as [...] "deplorable, nastily over-violent and obscene, often with undue emphasis on the supernatural and magical as a way of solving problems." [...] He realised that a market existed for a children's comics periodical which featured action stories in cartoon form, but which also would convey to children the standards and morals he advocated. Morris was instrumental in launching the short-lived Society for Christian Publicity, formed to take control of The Anvil and to perhaps produce further Christian publications, and in January 1949 the Daily Mirror published an optimistic piece about the rumoured publication by the Society of a [...] "new children's comic". This intrigued local journalist Norman Price, and the following month he met Morris, and helped him express his desire to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> magazine by co-writing with him [...] "Comics that bring horror to the nursery", published in the Sunday Dispatch. [...] Morris's article provoked a strong reaction from its readers; letters of support flooded into his home.|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} festival led to Beaty {{being invited}} to play as a principal actor in a Washington, D.C., Shakespearean production organized by Davis. A company including Davis, Beaty, and amateur actors from the D.C. area performed Richard III almost in entirety, three scenes from Macbeth, and one scene from Ingomar, the Barbarian. Davis, the premier black Shakespearean actress of the time, was {{the star of the}} show and Beaty played opposite her as Macbeth, King Henry VI, and Ingomar. The May 7, 1884, production was played in Ford's Opera House to a full house of more than 1,100 people; among them was Frederick Douglass. There was some heckling during the play, primarily from some of the white attendees, however a reviewer from The Washington Post reported that [...] "the earnestness and intelligence of several of the leading performers were such as to command the respect of those most disposed to find cause for laughter in everything that was said or done". Washington newspapers praised the principal actors, but noted that the inexperience of some of the supporting cast was evident. Reviewers for African American newspapers were especially pleased to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> production in an important venue like Ford's Theater. The New York Globe wrote of the performance [...] "hus leap by leap the colored man and woman encroach upon the ground so long held sacred by their white brother and sister".|$|E

500|$|Morgan's {{letter of}} marque gave him {{permission}} to attack Spanish ships at sea; there was no permission for attacks on land. Any plunder obtained from the attacks would be split {{between the government and}} the owners of the ships rented by the privateers. If the privateers stepped outside their official remit and raided a city, any resultant plunder would be retained by the privateers. Rogoziński observes that [...] "attacks on cities were illegal piracy—but extremely profitable", although Zahedieh records that if Morgan was able to provide evidence of a potential Spanish attack, the attacks on cities were justifiable under the terms of his commission. Morgan's initial plan was to attack Havana, but, on discovering it was heavily defended, this was changed to Puerto Principe (now Camagüey), a town [...] inland. Morgan and his men took the town, but the treasure obtained was less than hoped for. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, who sailed with Morgan, [...] "It caused a general resentment and grief, to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> small booty". When Morgan reported the taking of Puerto Principe to Modyford, he informed the governor that they had evidence that the Spanish were planning an attack on British territory: [...] "we found seventy men had been pressed to go against Jamaica... and considerable forces were expected from Vera Cruz and Campeachy... and from Porto Bello and Cartagena to rendezvous at St Jago of Cuba [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Churchill's final {{departure}} from political office came some sixteen months later when, on 5 April 1955, he chaired his last cabinet, almost fifty {{years since he}} had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be Prime Minister, Churchill replied, [...] "It's always nice to be home". For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing bezique or sitting [...] "by the fish pond, feeding the golden orfe and meditating". Of his last years at the house, Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, recalled, [...] "in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'wheelbarrow' chair contemplating {{the view of the}} valley he had loved for so long". On 13 October 1964, Churchill's last dinner guests at Chartwell were his former principal private secretary Sir Leslie Rowan and his wife. Lady Rowan later recalled, [...] "It was sad to <b>see</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great man become so frail". The following week, increasingly incapacitated, Churchill left the house for the last time. His official biographer Martin Gilbert records Churchill was, [...] "never to see his beloved Chartwell again". After his death in January 1965, Lady Churchill immediately relinquished her lease and presented Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to the public in 1966, one year after Churchill's death.|$|E
