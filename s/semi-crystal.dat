5000|$|The term [...] "opaline" [...] {{in current}} times refers to {{many forms of}} opaque and colored glass. In France the term opaline is {{used to refer to}} {{multiple}} types of glass and not specifically antique colored crystal or <b>semi-crystal.</b> The idea that the term opaline is strictly antique French crystal is incorrect. For instance when shopping in France you may see a piece of American slag glass for sale labeled opaline in reference to the color of glass and not the age, origin or content of the glass.|$|E
5000|$|Opaline {{glass is}} also a {{decorative}} style of glass made in France from 1800 to the 1890s, though it reached its peak of popularity {{during the reign of}} Napoleon III in the 1850s and 1860s. The glass is opaque or slightly translucent, and can appear either white or brightly colored in shades of green, blue, pink, black, lavender and yellow. The glass has a high lead content which defined it as [...] "demi-crystal" [...] or <b>semi-crystal.</b> The primary influences on this style of glass were 16th century Venetian milk glass, and English white glass produced in 18th century Bristol.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new experimental platform at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) which combines simultaneous angularly and spectrally resolved x-ray scatteringmeasurements. This technique offers a new insights on the structural and thermodynamic properties of warm dense matter. The < 50 fs temporal duration of the x-ray pulse provides near instantaneous snapshots {{of the dynamics of}} the compression. We present a proof of principle experiment for this platform to characterize a shock-compressed plastic foil. We observe the disappearance of the plastic <b>semi-crystal</b> structure and the formation of a compressed liquid ion-ion correlation peak. The plasma parameters of shock-compressed plastic can be measured as well, but requires an averaging over a few tens of shots...|$|E
40|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the effect of operative conditions of injection molding process oil the morphology distribution inside the obtained moldings is performed, with particular reference to <b>semi-crystal</b> line polymers. The paper is divided into two parts: in the first part, {{the state of the art}} on the subject is outlined and discussed; in the second part, an example of the characterization required for a satisfactorily understanding and description of the phenomena is presented, starting from material characterization, passing through the monitoring of the process cycle and arriving to a deep analysis of morphology distribution inside the moldings. In particular, fully characterized injection molding tests are presented using an isotactic polypropylene, previously carefully characterized as far as most of properties of interest. The effects of both injection flow rate and mold temperature are analyzed. The resulting moldings morphology (in terms of distribution of crystallinity degree, molecular orientation and crystals structure and dimensions) are analyzed by adopting different experimental techniques (optical, electronic and atomic force microscopy, IR and WAXS analysis). Final morphological characteristics of the samples are compared with the predictions of a simulation code developed at University of Salerno for the simulation of the injection molding process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—III-nitride {{quaternary}} InxAlyGa 1 -x-yN alloys {{have experienced}} considerable interest as potential materials for optoelectronic applications. Despite these interesting applications and the extensive efforts {{to understand their}} fundamental properties, research on its fundamental surface property, i. e., surface phonon polariton (SPP) {{has not yet been}} reported. In fact, the SPP properties have been shown to provide application for some photonic devices. Hence, there is an absolute need for thorough studies on the SPP properties of this material. In this work, theoretical study on the SPP modes in InAlGaN quaternary alloys are reported. Attention is focus on the wurtzite (α-) structure In xAl yGa 1 -x-yN <b>semi-crystal</b> with different In composition, x ranging from 0 to 0. 10 and constant Al composition, y = 0. 06. The SPP modes are obtained through the theoretical simulation by means of anisotropy model. The characteristics of SP dispersion curves are discussed. Accessible results in terms of the experimental point of view are also given. Finally, the results revealed that the SPP mode of α-InxAlyGa 1 -x-yN semiconductors exhibits two-mode behavior.

40|$|Humidity induced {{change in}} the {{refractive}} index and thickness of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings are in situ investigated for a range from 10 to 95 %, using an optical waveguide spectroscopic technique. It is experimentally demonstrated that, upon humidity change, the optical and swelling characteristics of the PEG coatings can be employed to build a plastic fibre optic humidity sensor. The sensing mechanism {{is based on the}} humidity induced {{change in the}} refractive index of the PEG film, which is directly coated onto a polished segment of a plastic optical fibre with dip-coating method. It is observed that PEG, which is a highly hydrophilic material, shows no monotonic linear response to humidity but gives different characteristics for various ranges of humidity levels both in index of refraction and in thickness. It undergoes a physical phase change from a <b>semi-crystal</b> line structure to a gel one at around 80 % relative humidity. At this phase change point, a drastic decrease occurs in the index of refraction as well as a drastic increase in the swelling of the PEG film. In addition, PEG coatings are hydrogenated in a vacuum chamber. It is observed that the hydrogen has a preventing effect on the humidity induced phase change in PEG coatings. Finally, the possibility of using PEG coatings in construction of a real plastic fibre optic humidity sensor is discussed. (C) 2008 The Optical Society of Japan...|$|E
