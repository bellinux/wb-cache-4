The purpose of the <b>stacked</b> <b>plate</b> design is to withstand the enormous outward mechanical pressure produced by Lorentz forces due to the magnetic field acting on the moving electric charges in the plate, which increase with {{the square of the}} magnetic field strength. Additionally, water circulates through holes in the plates as a coolant, to carry away the enormous heat created in the plates due to resistive heating by the large currents flowing through them. The heat dissipation also increases with the square of the magnetic field strength.|$|E

The GTS is also equipped with generation 3 magnetic ride control or MRC. There are three modes for the MRC, tour, sport/performance and track. The GTS is equipped with a driver preference dial that has four modes to adjust the bi-model exhaust and MRC, these are Tour, Sport, Performance, Track.|$|E

Through the measurement, the effects of tool material on the drilling were analyzed from the aspects of drilling force, diameter, and burr. The results show that, compared with carbide drill and coated carbide one, the drilling force of high speed steel is larger. But, the application of high speed steel also has some advantages, e. g. a higher number of hole can be obtained, the height of burr is small, the exit is smooth and the slim burr is less, and the tool experiences wear but not fracture.

The work was aimed at promoting the application of microstructured chemical reactors in the chemical industry.

This opens the door to mass manufacturing capability, which is a common enabler for cost reduction and resource efficiency. Roll embossing is especially suited for automated mass production, particularly on the larger scale.

The first phase of this research project is to develop and test a micropump capable of moving the working fluid within the integrated device. This paper will discuss the design, development, testing, and evaluation of a micropump concept. The micropump which was developed is an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) injection pump. Fabrication of the pump was accomplished using laser micromachining technology, and two initial designs were examined for full fabrication. The first design has two silicon parts stacked vertically {{on top of each}} other. Gold is deposited on one side of each <b>stacked</b> <b>plate</b> to serve as electrodes for the electrohydrodynamic pump. A Nd:YAG laser is used to drill an array of circular holes in the {open_quotes}well{close_quotes} region of both silicon parts, leaving an open pathway for fluid movement.

Salt {{deposits}} are widespread around the summit crater of the active 3794 meter high Erebus volcano in Antarctica.

The greatest salt accumulations are located within 1 km of the active crater and are found under rocks and in crevices in the lava flows as white to yellow incrustations, massive deposits, efflorescences, and needles. Salt deposits are most abundant downwind of the crater where individual salt accumulations of 20 grams or more are common. The salts are not associated with fumaroles or fumarolic ice towers but form under the ambient- 15 to- 65 o C temperatures.

40|$|Thermoacoustics is a {{field of}} study which {{includes}} devices purpose-built to exploit the phenomenal interaction between heat and sound. Thermoacoustics has been demonstrated as an effective technology which can potentially serve a variety of purposes such as cryogenics, cost-effective domestic refrigeration or electricity generation, without adverse environmental impact or commercial drawbacks such as expensive construction or maintenance costs or high part counts. The mechanisms by which thermoacoustic devices operate at low amplitudes have been identified and effective design tools and methods are available, but the precise heat and mass transfer which occurs deep inside the core of thermoacoustic devices at high amplitudes cannot at present be precisely determined experimentally, and to date have been estimated using only relatively simple or one-dimensional computational domains. It is expected that thermoacoustic devices will need to operate at relatively high pressure amplitudes for commercial and practical applications, to achieve power densities similar to competing technologies. Clearly, advancement of these models and the methods used to investigate them will enable {{a better understanding of}} the precise heat and mass transfer that occurs within such devices. Previous numerical studies have modelled a ‘thermoacoustic couple’ which consists of a single or several plates (often modelled with zero thickness) and channels within an oscillatory pressure field. In this thesis several improvements to the ‘thermoacoustic couple’ modelspace are introduced and modelled, and compared with published results. Using the commercial CFD software Fluent, a two-dimensional, segregated and second-order implicit numerical model was developed which solves equations for continuity of mass, momentum and energy. These equations were computed using second-order and double-precision discretisation of time, flow variables and energy. A computational domain is presented which is capable of modelling plates of zero or non-zero thickness, is ‘self-resonant’ and able to capture the entrance and exit effects at the <b>stack</b> <b>plate</b> edges. Studies are presented in which the acoustic pressure amplitude, the thickness of the plate (‘blockage ratio’) and the shape of the plate are varied to determine their influence upon the rate of effective heat transfer, flow structure and overall efficiency. The modelling of thermoacoustic couples with finite thickness presented in this thesis demonstrates that the finite thickness produces new results which show significant disturbances to the flow field and changes to the expected rate and distribution of heat flux along the <b>stack</b> <b>plate.</b> Results indicate that the thickness of the plate, t[subscript]s, strongly controls the generation of vortices outside the stack region and perturbs the flow structure and heat flux distribution at the extremities of the plate. Increases in t[subscript]s are also shown to improve the integral of the total heat transfer rate but at the expense of increased entropy generation. Another contribution of this thesis is the study of the effect that leading and trailing edge shapes of <b>stack</b> <b>plates</b> have on the performance of a thermoacoustic couple. In practice, typical parallel or rectangular section <b>stack</b> <b>plates</b> do not have perfectly square edges. The existing literature considers only rectangular or zero-thickness (1 -D) plates. Hence a study was performed to evaluate the potential for gains in performance from the use of non-rectangular cross sections, such as rounded, aerofoil or bulbous shaped edges. Consideration of various types of <b>stack</b> <b>plate</b> edges show that performance improvements can be made from certain treatments to the <b>stack</b> <b>plate</b> tips or if possible, <b>stack</b> <b>plate</b> profiles. This thesis also considers the influence of thermophysical properties and phenomena associated with practical thermoacoustic devices to investigate the applicability of the numerical model to experimental outcomes. Comparisons made between results obtained using the numerical model, linear numerical formulations and experimental results suggest that the numerical model allows comparative study of various thermoacoustic systems for design purposes but is not yet of sufficient scope to fully characterise a realistic system and predict absolute levels of performance. However, the presented method of modelling thermoacoustic couples yields increased insight and detail of flow regimes and heat transportation over previous studies. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a proof of concept effort for development of a Nautilus Centripetal Capillary Condenser (NCCC or NC 3) used for microgravity compatible water recovery from moist air with integral passive phase separation. Removal of liquid condensate from the air stream exiting a condenser is readily performed here on Earth. In order to perform this function in space however, without gravity or mechanical action, other tactics including utilization of inertial, drag and capillary forces are required. Within the NC 3, liquid water forms via condensation on cold condenser surfaces as humid air passes along multiple spiral channels, each in its own plane, all together forming a <b>stacked</b> <b>plate</b> assembly. Non-mechanical inertial forces are employed to transfer condensate, as it forms, via centripetal action to the outer perimeter of each channel. A V-shaped groove, constructed on this outer edge of the spiral channel, increases local capillary forces thereby retaining the liquid. Air drag then pulls the liquid along to a collection region {{near the center of the}} device. Dry air produced by each parallel spiral channel is combined in a common orthogonal, out-of-plane conduit passing down the axial center of the stacked device. Similarly, the parallel condensate streams are combined and removed from the condenser/separator through yet another out-of-plane axial conduit. NC 3 is an integration of conventional finned condenser operation, combined with static phase separation and capillary transport phenomena. A Mars' transit mission would be a logical application for this technology where gravity is absent and the use of vibrating, energy-intensive, motor-driven centrifugal separators is undesired.

The absence of any refrigerant and a compressor to generate cooling is indeed desirable but the performance to date has yet to attain a competitive magnitude. Significant cooling effects are still difficult to achieve possibly due to the design and fabrication of the stack, the heart of the thermoacoustic cooling system.
