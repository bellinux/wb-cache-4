5|$|Many years later, Jack (Matthew Fox) visits his mother, (Veronica Hamel) {{who tells}} him that Christian has left for Australia, and asks Jack to bring his father back. Jack reluctantly agrees, and after {{arriving}} in Sydney searches the hotel at which his father was staying. The manager informs Jack that his father has not <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the hotel for several days following an incident at a bar, and Jack finds bottles of alcohol, pills, and his father's wallet in Christian's room.|$|E
5|$|The Blood Beast alien costume {{was also}} {{previously}} {{used in the}} Roger Corman film Teenage Caveman (1958), which was filmed just two weeks earlier. Art director Daniel Haller, who built the rocket-ship and other props, <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the sound stage between work sessions. Following dissatisfaction with his treatment by the Cormans, Varno pursued two successful arbitration cases, {{one of which was}} for underpayment. The other was in response to Gene Corman's original story writing credit, even though Varno claimed to have written the entire story himself.|$|E
5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} soft drugs and {{then moved on to}} using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with a sense of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E

5|$|She was {{scheduled}} {{to play the role}} of Madame Liang in the film production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Flower Drum Song, but was unable to take the role due to failing health. On February 3, 1961, at the age of 56, Wong died of a heart attack as she <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> home in Santa Monica, two days after her final screen performance on the television show The Barbara Stanwyck Show. Her cremated remains were interred in her mother's grave at Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles. The headstone is marked with her mother's Anglicized name on top, and the Chinese names of Anna May (on the right) and her sister Mary (on the left) along the sides.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and blame the deaths on the communists.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese began {{occupying the}} Indies in 1942, Sukarno– {{at the time}} a Dutch {{prisoner}} in Bengkulu– was evacuated to Kutacane. However, once they reached Painan they discovered that the Japanese forces had already occupied Bukittinggi; this quashed hopes of bringing Sukarno to Barus in Tapanuli. The Dutch left Sukarno in Painan. Hizbul Wathan members, at the time based out of Ganting, went to retrieve Sukarno and bring him to Padang by cart. For several days after arriving in Padang, Sukarno <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the mosque; he also delivered a speech. During the three-year Japanese occupation the mosque served as the military's headquarters in central and western Sumatra. It also functioned as a training camp for Gyugun and Heiho soldiers, military units formed by the Japanese which consisted of native soldiers; the Gyugun was formed by the ulamas, while the Heihos were taken from the santri.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his {{activities}} from then until early 545, by which time he was the garrison commander of Rome. Along with the general Conon {{he was responsible for}} the city's defence during the siege by Totila in 546. During the siege he restricted himself to passive defence, refusing to sally forth from the walls even when Belisarius, who had returned from the east and landed with reinforcements at the nearby Portus Romanus, ordered him to do so. As a result, Belisarius' attempts to succour the beleaguered city failed. Procopius heavily criticizes Bessas for his conduct during the siege. He neglected of the civilian population of the city and enriched himself by selling the starving populace the grain he had hoarded at exorbitant prices. The civilians were so exhausted by famine that when he finally allowed those who wanted to leave the city to do so, many simply died on the wayside, while others were killed by the Goths. Finally, he proved negligent in the conduct of the defence, and allowed security measures to grow lax: guards <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> their posts, and patrols were discontinued. This allowed four Isaurian soldiers to contact Totila, and on 17 December 546, the city was betrayed to the Goths. Bessas managed to escape with the greater part of the garrison, but the treasure that he had amassed was left behind for the Goths to enjoy. Following his dismal performance in Italy, Bessas was apparently recalled to Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks {{shared their}} beliefs with the Egyptians {{on how to}} {{interpret}} good and bad dreams, {{and the idea of}} incubating dreams. Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to those who <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> shrines and temples. The earliest Greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers, where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the divine message was given.|$|E
25|$|The first inquirers {{began to}} come to the Matterhorn. There is a record of a party of Englishmen who in the summer of 1800 crossed the Great St. Bernard Pass, {{a few months after the}} passage of Bonaparte; they came to Aosta and thence to Valtournanche, <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the chalets of Breuil, and traversed the Theodul Pass, which they called Monte Rosa. The Matterhorn was to them an object of the most intense and {{continuous}} admiration.|$|E

25|$|Colonel John C. McQueen, 17 November 1944 – 1 April 1946. Colonel McQueen, {{also known}} as JG, bought a jaguar kitten in the market of Nicaragua and named him Bill. Bill sat on JG's saddle as he led the troops on horseback through the jungles of Nicaragua, and then ran {{alongside}} them as he got bigger. He <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the foot of JG's bed until he met his demise (a local farmer's shotgun) when he was caught hunting the neighbor's chickens at night.|$|E
25|$|Thus Fairfax in {{his turn}} {{was free to}} move, thanks to the insubordination of Goring, who would neither relieve Oxford nor join the King for {{an attack on the}} New Model. The Parliamentary general moved from Oxford towards Northampton so as to cover the Eastern Association. On 12 June the two armies were only a few miles apart, Fairfax at Kislingbury, Charles at Daventry, and, though the Royalists turned northward again on the 13th to resume the Yorkshire project under the very eyes of the enemy, Fairfax {{followed}} close. On the night of the 13th Charles <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> Lubenham, Fairfax at Guilsborough. Cromwell, just appointed lieutenant-general of the New Model, had ridden into camp {{on the morning of the}} 13th with fresh cavalry from the eastern counties, Colonel Rossiter came up with more from Lincolnshire on the morning of the battle, and it was with an incontestable superiority of numbers and an overwhelming moral advantage that Fairfax fought at Naseby on 14 June. The result of the battle, this time a decisive battle, was the annihilation of the Royal army. Part of the cavalry escaped, a small fraction of it in tolerable order, but the guns and the baggage train were taken, and, above all, the splendid Royal infantry were killed or taken prisoners to a man.|$|E
500|$|During the Indonesian National Revolution from 1945 to 1949 Nugroho Notosusanto's {{family lived}} in the {{temporary}} national capital at Yogyakarta so that his father could work for the Ministry of Law. The younger Notosusanto fought for the revolutionaries. He first joined the 17th Brigade of Student Army (...) , later transferring to the People's Security Army (...) [...] [...] During this period he exclusively did reconnaissance and often <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the homes of local villagers. Historian Katherine McGregor suggests that this influenced his later short stories, which took humanist themes.|$|E

500|$|The party {{made good}} initial progress, {{travelling}} around [...] each day. The dogs ran {{so hard that}} several from the strongest teams were detached from the traces and secured onto the sledges to act as ballast. In their wolf-skin and reindeer-skin clothing the men could cope with the freezing temperatures while they kept moving, but when they stopped they suffered, and barely <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> night. The dogs' paws became frostbitten. On 12September, with temperatures down to , the party halted after only [...] and built igloos for shelter. Amundsen now recognised that they had started the march {{too early in the}} season, and decided they should return to Framheim. He would not risk the lives of men and dogs for reasons of stubbornness. Johansen, in his diary, wrote of the foolishness of starting prematurely on such a long and historic journey, and of the dangers of an obsession with beating the English.|$|E
500|$|The {{flights from}} Hong Kong to Chongqing began in early May 1946. At this time Chongqing had been {{isolated}} by Communist forces, and foreign embassies were being evacuated {{from the city}} ahead of its expected occupation by the Communists. No navigation aids were available to guide the Australian aircraft, and their crews had to use inaccurate road maps for navigation during the [...] trips between Chongqing and Hong Kong. The RAAF aircrew found the flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing to be challenging {{as a result of}} mountains around the Chinese city, as well as the expected lack of accurate weather forecasts and navigation aids. As the Australian legation was evacuated from Chongqing in early May, the RAAF aircrew <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the British embassy when they needed to overnight in the city. The detachment was successful in flying out the pig bristles within the two weeks available, with eight return flights being made to Chongqing. In his memoirs Balfe attributed this success to [...] "reasonable weather and everyone's enthusiasm". After completing their task, the three Dakotas left Hong Kong bound for Australia on 14 May.|$|E
500|$|Krulak {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} contrasting assessments {{by pointing out that}} Mendenhall had surveyed urban areas, while he ventured into the countryside [...] "where the war is". Krulak asserted that political issues in Saigon would not hamper military progress, stating [...] "We can stagger through to win the war with Nhu remaining in control." [...] Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman asserted that the difference between the contrasting reports [...] "was the difference between a military and a political view". During the debate over the differences in outlook, Mendenhall asserted that Saigon had suffered [...] "a virtually complete breakdown" [...] following the pagoda raids. Mendenhall reported that Vietnamese public servants feared being seen with Americans. He recalled one visit when he had to remain quiet while his Vietnamese host crept around the room, searching for hidden microphones. Mendenhall asserted that [...] "Saigon was heavy with an atmosphere of fear and hate" [...] and that the people feared Diệm more than the Viet Cong. He reported many public servants no longer <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> home due to a fear of midnight arrests by Nhu's secret police. Many officials had recently spent the bulk of their day negotiating the release of their children, who had been incarcerated for participating in pro-Buddhist protests. Mendenhall asserted that internal turmoil was now a higher priority than the war against the communists.|$|E

500|$|With {{help from}} a cold front, Waldo contributed to major {{flooding}} in Kansas that forced many rivers and creeks to overflow their banks. A total of [...] of rain fell in some locations. In the rural town of Raymond, a 52-year-old man died {{from a heart attack}} while moving to higher ground due to rising floodwaters. Approximately 15 people were evacuated from their homes in Easton due to the overflow of the nearby Stranger Creek. Some of the evacuated resident <b>slept</b> <b>at</b> the nearby senior center for the night where the American Red Cross delivered items such as blankets, food, and clothes to the victims of the flood. In Kansas City, Waldo produced [...] of water on roads, but none of the nearby homes received extensive damage. The Sedgwick County, the county fire department freed 35 trapped people from rising flood waters, six of which were rescued via helicopter. County workers were forced to use sandbags to prevent the dike along Cowskin creek from breaking. The Salt Creek overflowed its banks; subsequently, Highway 68 closed in Osage County. Within six days after the dissipation of Hurricane Waldo, the remnants had produced heavy rainfall as far north as Michigan with flooding recorded as far north as Iowa. Waldo's rain were comparable to Atlantic Hurricane Gloria though the wind speeds were much lower.|$|E
