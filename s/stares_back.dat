500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland {{smiles at}} himself in the mirror. BOB <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> at him from the {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|E
2500|$|Zeitgeist {{received}} mixed reviews, {{indicated by}} {{a score of}} 59/100 on Metacritic. Some negative criticism of the album stemmed from the absence of half of the original lineup, with Pitchfork Media's Rob Mitchum suggesting the name was revived for [...] "cash or attention or both." [...] Qs Paul Rees commented that [...] "at least half of Zeitgeist {{is made up of}} grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else," [...] and that Zeitgeists emotional range is [...] "limited and wearing", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he [...] "remains {{one of the most powerful}} drummers in rock." [...] In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains [...] "Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD." [...] NME gave it a score of five out of ten and said, [...] "It's best treated as a curio in the Smashing Pumpkins' legacy; and for those who grew up on 'Today', '1979' and 'Ava Adore', you're better left with your memories." [...] The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it [...] "ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form." [...] musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> at you with the appeal of an ex you'd rather not have bumped into." [...] Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, [...] "The best you can offer is that it’s not a disaster – now do you want to tell Billy or should I?" [...] Robert Christgau simply gave the record a [...] "Dud" [...] rating (...) [...] Slant Magazine gave it a score of two out of five and called it [...] "the Pumpkins' most aggressively metal album to date. But heaps of guitars, vocal overdubs, and ridiculous effects don't mask a lack of inventiveness or even plain ol' quality songwriting." [...] Canadian magazine Now also gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it [...] "no-frills rawk that's been dumbed down for mass consumption." [...] Melodic magazine gave it a score of three stars out of five, calling the album a disappointing return of the band. Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that [...] "the mixing problems extend far beyond Corgan's voice. The Band of a Hundred Murderous Guitars has turned into a modern-radio-rock band." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{far more}} {{singular}} walking fish {{than any of}} these is the odd creature that rejoices (unfortunately) in the very classical surname of Periophthalmus, which is, being interpreted, Stare-about. (If he had a recognised English name of his own, I would gladly give it; but as he hasn't, and as it is clearly necessary to call him something, I fear we must stick to the somewhat alarming scientific nomenclature.) Periophthalmus, then, is an odd fish of the tropical Pacific shores, with a pair of very distinct forelegs (theoretically described as modified pectoral fins), and with two goggle eyes, which he can protrude at pleasure right outside the sockets, so as to look in whatever direction he chooses, without even taking the trouble to turn his head to left or right, backward or forward. At ebb tide this singular peripatetic goby literally walks straight out of the water, and promenades the bare beach erect on two legs, in search of small crabs and other stray marine animals left behind by the receding waters. If you try to catch him, he hops away briskly much like a frog, and <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> at you grimly over his left shoulder, with his squinting optics. So completely adapted is he for this amphibious long-shore existence, that his big eyes, unlike those of most other fish, are formed for seeing in the air {{as well as in the}} water. Nothing can be more ludicrous than to watch him suddenly thrusting these very movable orbs right out of their sockets like a pair of telescopes, and twisting them round in all directions so as to see in front, behind, on top, and below, in one delightful circular sweep.|$|E

6000|$|YANK--[With a hard, bitter laugh.] Welcome to your city, huh? Hail, hail, de gang's all here! [At {{the sound}} of his voice the {{chattering}} dies away into an attentive silence. YANK walks up to the gorilla's cage and, leaning over the railing, stares in at its occupant, who <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> at him, silent and motionless. There is a pause of dead stillness. Then YANK begins to talk in a friendly confidential tone, half-mockingly, but with a deep undercurrent of sympathy.] Say, yuh're some hard-lookin' guy, ain't yuh? I seen lots of tough nuts dat de gang called gorillas, but yuh're de foist real one I ever seen. Some chest yuh got, and shoulders, and dem arms and mits! I bet yuh got a punch in eider fist dat'd knock 'em all silly! [This with genuine admiration. The gorilla, as if he understood, stands upright, swelling out his chest and pounding on it with his fist. YANK grins sympathetically.] Sure, I get yuh. Yuh challenge de whole woild, huh? Yuh got what I was sayin' even if yuh muffed de woids. [Then bitterness creeping in.] And why wouldn't yuh get me? Ain't we both members of de same club--de Hairy Apes? [They stare at each other--a pause--then YANK goes on slowly and bitterly.] So yuh're what she seen when she looked at me, de white-faced tart! I was you to her, get me? On'y outa de cage--broke out--free to moider her, see? Sure! Dat's what she tought. She wasn't wise dat I was in a cage, too--worser'n yours--sure--a damn sight--'cause you got some chanct to bust loose--but me--[He grows confused.] Aw, hell! It's all wrong, ain't it? [A pause.] I s'pose yuh wanter know what I'm doin' here, huh? I been warmin' a bench down to de Battery--ever since last night. Sure. I seen de sun come up. Dat was pretty, too--all red and pink and green. I was lookin' at de skyscrapers--steel--and all de ships comin' in, sailin' out, all over de oith--and dey was steel, too. De sun was warm, dey wasn't no clouds, and dere was a breeze blowin'. Sure, it was great stuff. I got it aw right--what Paddy said about dat bein' de right dope--on'y I couldn't get IN it, see? I couldn't belong in dat. It was over my head. And I kept tinkin'--and den I beat it up here to see what youse was like. And I waited till dey was all gone to git yuh alone. Say, how d'yuh feel sittin' in dat pen all de time, havin' to stand for 'em comin' and starin' at yuh--de white-faced, skinny tarts and de boobs what marry 'em--makin' fun of yuh, laughin' at yuh, gittin' scared of yuh--damn 'em! [He pounds on the rail with his fist. The gorilla rattles the bars of his cage and snarls. All the other monkeys set up an angry chattering in the darkness. YANK goes on excitedly.] Sure! Dat's de way it hits me, too. On'y yuh're lucky, see? Yuh don't belong wit 'em and yuh know it. But me, I belong wit 'em--but I don't, see? Dey don't belong wit me, dat's what. Get me? Tinkin' is hard--[He passes one hand across his forehead with a painful gesture. The gorilla growls impatiently. YANK goes on gropingly.] It's dis way, what I'm drivin' at. Youse can sit and dope dream in de past, green woods, de jungle and de rest of it. Den yuh belong and dey don't. Den yuh kin laugh at 'em, see? Yuh're de champ of de woild. But me--I ain't got no past to tink in, nor nothin' dat's comin', on'y what's now--and dat don't belong. Sure, you're de best off! Yuh can't tink, can yuh? Yuh can't talk neider. But I kin make a bluff at talkin' and tinkin'--a'most git away wit it--a'most!--and dat's where de joker comes in. [He laughs.] I ain't on oith and I ain't in heaven, get me? I'm in de middle tryin' to separate 'em, takin' all de woist punches from bot' of 'em. Maybe dat's what dey call hell, huh? But you, yuh're at de bottom. You belong! Sure! Yuh're de on'y one in de woild dat does, yuh lucky stiff! [The gorilla growls proudly.] And dat's why dey gotter put yuh in a cage, see? [The gorilla roars angrily.] Sure! Yuh get me. It beats it when you try to tink it or talk it--it's way down--deep--behind--you 'n' me we feel it. Sure! Bot' members of dis club! [He laughs--then in a savage tone.] What de hell! T' hell wit it! A little action, dat's our meat! Dat belongs! Knock 'em down and keep bustin' 'em till dey croaks yuh wit a gat--wit steel! Sure! Are yuh game? Dey've looked at youse, ain't dey--in a cage? Wanter git even? Wanter wind up like a sport 'stead of croakin' slow in dere? [The gorilla roars an emphatic affirmative. YANK goes on with a sort of furious exaltation.] Sure! Yuh're reg'lar! Yuh'll stick to de finish! Me 'n' you, huh?--bot' members of this club! We'll put up one last star bout dat'll knock 'em offen deir seats! Dey'll have to make de cages stronger after we're trou! [The gorilla is straining at his bars, growling, hopping from one foot to the other. YANK takes a jimmy from under his coat and forces the lock on the cage door. He throws this open.] Pardon from de governor! Step out and shake hands! I'll take yuh for a walk down Fif' Avenoo. We'll knock 'em offen de oith and croak wit de band playin'. Come on, Brother. [The gorilla scrambles gingerly out of his cage. Goes to YANK and stands looking at him. YANK keeps his mocking tone--holds out his hand.] Shake--de secret grip of our order. [Something, the tone of mockery, perhaps, suddenly enrages the animal. With a spring he wraps his huge arms around YANK in a murderous hug. There is a crackling snap of crushed ribs--a gasping cry, still mocking, from YANK.] Hey, I didn't say, kiss me. [The gorilla lets the crushed body slip to the floor; stands over it uncertainly, considering; then picks it up, throws it in the cage, shuts the door, and shuffles off menacingly into the darkness at left. A great uproar of frightened chattering and whimpering comes from the other cages. Then YANK moves, groaning, opening his eyes, and there is silence. He mutters painfully.] Say--dey oughter match him--wit Zybszko. He got me, aw right. I'm trou. Even him didn't tink I belonged. [Then, with sudden passionate despair.] Christ, where do I get off at? Where do I fit in? [Checking himself as suddenly.] Aw, what de hell! No squakin', see! No quittin', get me! Croak wit your boots on! [He grabs hold of the bars of the cage and hauls himself painfully to his feet--looks around him bewilderedly--forces a mocking laugh.] In de cage, huh? [In the strident tones of a circus barker.] Ladies and gents, step forward and take a slant at de one and only--[His voice weakening]--one and original--Hairy Ape from de wilds of--[He slips in a heap on the floor and dies. The monkeys set up a chattering, whimpering wail. And, perhaps, the Hairy Ape at last belongs.] ...|$|E

5000|$|A loose concept album, Replicas {{was based}} on a dystopian book Numan hoped to {{complete}} someday, set in a not-too-distant future metropolis where Machmen (androids with cloned human skin) and other machines keep the general public cowed on orders from the Grey Men (shadowy officials). While the album's setting and lyrics were directly inspired by the science fiction of Philip K. Dick, particularly his seminal work Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the title was not. Although Numan's Machmen were similar to Replicants, the term used for androids in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (based on Dick’s book), Scott’s film came out three years after Tubeway Army’s album and Dick never used the word [...] "Replicant" [...] in his original 1968 novel.

50|$|Faces in Fire: In a grove near Goddess Keep {{there is}} a spring {{surrounded}} by five pine trees. Each tree represents Child, Maiden/Youth, Woman/Man, Mother/Father, and Hag/Graybeard, respectively. Sunrunners go to this grove {{in the hope of}} seeing a vision of their future. They approach in the nude and kneel before the trees. They take Water from the spring and offer it to the appropriate trees. For example, the morning after the woman-making night, the Sunrunner offers the Water to the Child, Maiden, and Woman trees. She then calls Fire, blows Air onto it, and cuts a piece of her hair to represent Earth. She concentrates on the Womantree with her hands in the Water. The Sunrunner's reflection <b>stares</b> <b>back</b> at her, then the Fire leaps and reveals an older version of the Sunrunner. Often the Fire will flare again to reveal the face of the man with whom she will spend her life. However, these visions given by the Goddess can be changed as they can be warnings as well as promises.|$|E
