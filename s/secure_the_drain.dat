40|$|Breast {{reconstruction}} with autologous free tissue {{transfer is}} a widely established technique con-sidered to be the “gold standard. ” 1, 2 The leading cause of return to theater after deep inferior epi-gastric flap reconstruction is hematoma occurring in the chest wall, reported in 1. 2 – 2 % 1, 3 cases. Most breast reconstructive surgeons would therefore con-sider suction drains under the newly reconstructed breast a mandatory step to minimize this complica-tion from occurring, as a hematoma could compress the flap pedicle compromising venous output and possibly even arterial input leading to partial or total flap necrosis. The drains are commonly placed away from the pedicle and site of anastomosis; however, the drain tubing can in theory migrate directly injur-ing or compressing the pedicle and/or causing dam-age through the suction forces. We describe a simple technique to safely secure the breast drain tubing to prevent migration and hence protect the anastomotic site and pedicle af-ter free tissue transfer breast reconstruction. In this technique, two 10 -gauge suction drains are used, one for the upper breast mastectomy flap {{and one for the}} lower breast mastectomy flap. The drains are inserted before vessel exposure and after achiev-ing meticulous hemostasis of the breast mastectomy flaps. Each drain is secured to the inner aspect of the breast mastectomy flap by a loose loop of absorbable monofilament 3 / 0 suture under direct vision. The loop diameter is one fingerbreadth diameter: this is sufficient to <b>secure</b> <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> in the desired loca-tion {{yet at the same time}} facilitate easy removal. This same technique can be applied to any other free tissue transfer situation to protect the pedicle from inadvertent damage from the drain tubing (Figs. ...|$|E

40|$|Random dopant {{fluctuation}} {{effects of}} gate-all-around Si nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs) are investigated {{in terms of}} different diameters and junction gradients.

Shorter junction gradients form high potential barriers in the source-side lightly-doped extension regions at on-state, which determines the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents and fluctuates <b>the</b> <b>drain</b> currents greatly under thermionic-emission mechanism.
