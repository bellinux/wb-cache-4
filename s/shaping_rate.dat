40|$|Prior {{work has}} shown that two or more {{adaptive}} streaming players can be unstable when they compete for bandwidth. The root cause of the instability problem is that, in Steady-State, a player goes through an ON-OFF activity pattern in which it overestimates the available bandwidth. We propose a server-based traffic shaping method that can significantly reduce such oscillations {{at the expense of}} a small loss in bandwidth utilization. The shaper is only activated when oscillations are detected, and it dynamically adjusts the <b>shaping</b> <b>rate</b> so that the player should ideally receive the highest available video profile while being stable.

Dynamic <b>rate</b> <b>shaping</b> has been proposed to “shape ” the pre-compressed video {{to adapt to the}} fluctuating bandwidth. In our earlier work, <b>rate</b> <b>shaping</b> was extended to shape the channel coded pre-compressed video, {{to take into account the}} time-varying packet loss rate as well as the fluctuating bandwidth of the wireless networks.

In this paper, we propose “fine-grained <b>rate</b> <b>shaping</b> (FGRS) ” to allow for bandwidth adaptation over a wide range of bandwidth and packet loss rate in fine granularities. The video is precoded with fine granularity scalability (FGS) followed by channel coding. Utilizing the fine granularity property of FGS and channel coding, FGRS selectively drops part of the precoded video and still yields decodable bitstream at the decoder. Moreover, FGRS optimizes video streaming rather than achieves heuristic objectives as conventional methods. A two-stage rate-distortion (R-D) optimization algorithm is proposed for FGRS.

Within-a-cycle closed-loop feedback control techniques could prove to be a key enabler for this technology, but will require on-line estimation of the injected fuel flow rate to be realized because of the inability to measure the injector flow rate when used on an actual engine. ^ This thesis describes {{the development and implementation of}} a physics-based fuel flow estimator which can be used as feedback to a closed-loop controller. Available measurements on the piezoelectric injector rig are used for dynamic state estimation. The estimator is realized in hardware using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to reduce the loop computation time and provide a platform for within-a-cycle controller design. ^ Real-time estimator results are compared against measurement data from the rig for a variety of flow profiles at different toe heights and different operating rail pressures.

40|$|On the Internet, network routers are {{typically}} implemented to provide strategic controls over the growing demands on limited and expensive bandwidth for an increasingly diverse traffic spectrum. A router {{consists of two}} major components: a set of switch fabric and multiple linecards. The functionalities of a linecard can be categorized into three parts: packet classification, statistics accounting, and packet scheduling. Packet classification includes functionalities such as routing table lookup, admission control, and deep packet inspection. Statistics accounting is implemented to store essential information such as flow statistics and network counting sketches, {{for the purpose of}} traffic monitoring and traffic management. Packet scheduling includes functionalities such as packet buffering, packet <b>shaping,</b> <b>rate</b> control, and hierarchical queue management. Sophisticated algorithms have been developed to improve the throughput and fairness on the network, however, the costs of implementing the new algorithms constantly outweigh their performance gains. This dissertation focuses on bridging the gap between advanced algorithms and their implementations in real- world network equipments by adopting a throughput- and fairness-driven design of network traffic managers which incorporate most of the functionalities of statistics accounting and packet scheduling, while providing worst- case performance guarantees for the whole router system. First, we explore parallelism to design high throughput statistics counter arrays that are robust against adversarial traffic. Second, we develop robust pipelined memory systems with worst-case performance guarantees for network processing. In our new memory systems, memory operations are finished within a fixed delay, which greatly simplifies the designs of network processors. Third, we present novel succinct priority index data structures that can be implemented for scheduling packets maintained in a large number of priority queues at line rate, which is essential in providing quality-of-service for per-flow queueing. Last, we show several reservation- based packet buffer architectures with interleaved memories that take advantage of the known packet departure times to achieve simplicity and determinism. They are scalable to growing packet storage requirements in routers to provide fine-grained per-flow queue buffering, while matching increasing line rates. All these approaches significantly improve the overall system throughput while providing better fairness, quality-of-service and worst- case performance guarantees over existing solution...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} a new method, called RWTM (Receive Window Tuning Method) that shapes HTTP adaptive streams. It employs the flow {{control in the}} gateway {{to improve the quality}} of experience (QoE) of users. Our use case is when two HTTP Adaptive streaming clients are competing for bandwidth in the same home network. Results show that our proposed method considerably improves the QoE; it improves the video stability, the fidelity to optimal video quality level selection and the convergence speed to the optimal video quality level. Keywords— Traffic Shaping; Quality of Experience; HTTP Adaptive Streaming; TCP flow control; Bandwidth Management I. MOTIVATION HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is a streaming video technique based on downloading video segments of short duration (two seconds in general), called chunks, from a HAS server to a HAS client. Each chunk is encoded at multiple quality levels, also called encoding bit rates, or profiles. After filling its playback buffer with chunks, the player in the HAS client will request for chunk periodically in the steady-state phase. The Steady-State phase includes periods of activity (ON periods [1] or Active periods [2]) followed by periods of inactivity (OFF periods [1] or Idle periods [2]). The player estimates the available bandwidth during the ON period to select the video quality level for the next chunk. The Quality of Experience (QoE) of HTTP adaptive stream depends mainly on three criteria: 1 -Video quality level stability; because the frequent change of video quality level bothers the user; 2 -Fidelity to optimal quality level selection; the user prefers watching the highest feasible quality level that the available bandwidth allows. This quality level is called optimal quality level; 3 -Convergence speed: The user prefers to achieve watching the optimal quality level as soon as possible. The delay that the player takes to reach the optimal quality level is called convergence speed [3]. Our use case is when two HAS clients are competing for bandwidth in the same home network and they request chunks from the same HAS server. In this case, the two main causes of QoE degradation are congestion events and competition between HAS streams. In fact, congestion events-which occurs frequently in the home gateway [5]-reduces the bitrate of packets sent to the HAS clients which degrades the QoE. In addition, when two players compete, they may do false estimation of available bandwidth; for example, if the ON period of the first player coincides with the OFF period of the second player, the first player will overestimate its available bandwidth. As a consequence, it will not select the optimal quality level for the next chunk, hence the degradation of QoE. The objective of our study is to improve the three criteria of QoE cited above when HAS clients are competing for bandwidth. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present our method, called the " Receive Window Tuning Method " (RWTM). Section III presents the results of our experimentations. In Section IV we conclude the paper and give future directions for our work. II. RECEIVE WINDOW TUNING METHOD Our proposed method " Receive Window Tuning Method ", RWTM, is based on TCP flow control. In fact, TCP uses this flow control mechanism in order to prevent a sender from sending more packets than the receiver capacity. In each TCP segment the receiver specifies the maximum amount of data to be buffered. This specification is sent to the sender in the receiver's advertised window field, rwnd. The sender can not exceed the amount W=min(rwnd, cwnd) of bytes, called the sender's send window, when sending packets. Where cwnd is the congestion window size. As a consequence, if rwnd becomes constant and cwnd exceeds it, the send window will still be constant and equal to rwnd. Therefore, the theoretical sending rate will be always limited by the maximum bitrate rwnd/RTT, which can be considered as the <b>shaping</b> <b>rate.</b> Where RTT is the round-trip time between the client and the server. The idea is to modify the value of rwnd to have a sending rate limited by rwnd/RTT. For instance, in Linux, it is possible to set the parameter net. ipv 4. tcp_rmem in the client side. However, this sets the maximum socket buffer size for all TCP connections on the client [4], without regard to the specific needs or constraints of each connection. Instead, it is possible to modify the header of each Acknowledgment packet (ACK) sent from the HAS client to the HAS server at the gateway. Another advantage of using the gateway is that the gateway is the device that has information about incoming traffic of all clients of the same home network. So, it has the capability to manage the bandwidth of the home network. Moreover, the <b>shaping</b> <b>rate,</b> rwnd/RTT, requires RTT estimation. This estimation is possible in the gateway by using a passive estimation of RTT described in [7]. It uses only acknowledgments (ACKs) sent from clients to the server. We use this estimation only one time for each requested chunk...|$|E

The historical record about the park tells not only {{the history of the}} park but the city, district, local residents and art of gardening. As the historical story is documented the necessary base for establishment of any care plans in the future and the base for cultural and historical value the park is made. Beijers park can in such work be treated alone or as part of the context of parks that were built during the same era in Malmö's history. Beijers park origin from the era of the late 1800 s, when the entire green structure in Malmö changed. The park area today covers 12 hectares and is located in the district Kirseberg. In 1885 the parkland began to be constructed. Many of the changes that have occurred in Beijer's park over the years {{can be traced to the}} changes that took place simultaneously in the city's other parks. Malmö was a small town when the first public parks in the early 1800 s began to be built in many western cities. Malmö was surrounded by a landscape of arable land, the climate was favorable and the soil fertile. Most of the greenery in the city at that time was in private hands. Philanthropists among citizens in the rapidly growing industrial city talked about working people's need for greenery. Up to 1860 there were public parks only in a few cities in Sweden. Bourgeois middle class was crucial to the construction of the early public parks in Sweden and so was also the case in Malmö. Reasons for the parks can be traced to a desire for embellishment values, meeting places for citizens of the city and to be "tidy-reforms" "to the cities. Parks was also becoming an important element for a city to achieve a form of urbanity. Thoughts on sanitary and health improvements for the city and citizens also recorded. Kungsparken was the first major public park built in Malmö. It was public but acted as "an extended upper-class saloon" with park guards who kept order of the visitors. In 1881 the city appointed a park committee to review the park issues. The same year, a planting association was founded in Malmö, later renamed the Malmö beautification and planting of association (Malmö Förskönings- och planteringsförening), through private initiatives. The planting association came to mean a lot for the city's greenery and parks development. The concept and the possibility of a forest park in the city were discussed in Malmö in 1882 and also increased the pressure to build more public plantings. One of the initiators and founders of the plant association was merchant Gottfried Beijer. He applied with his brother, on his own initiative, on lease for a piece of land in the eastern suburb of Malmö and 1885 began with the construction of "a very attractive planting". The idea of this planting (Beijers Park) at the time was that it would be a counterpart to Kungsparken and was planned to accrue to the city for fifty years. The main events and years for Beijers park took place in 1901 when the city took over the park, 1914 when the park opened to the public and later, in 1917, when the park opened in its entirety. During the 1920 s and 1930 s the park had its <b>shaping</b> <b>rate</b> peak with a large "Mall" or promenade through the park's southern part and around it large open lawns. Following the current enlargement of the pond in the 1930 's the park went into its more modern look and today and currently the city sets biodiversity in focus for the park's development. For the residents in neighboring areas around the park and also for many residents in the rest of Malmö Beijers park today is as a very important part of their living environment, quality of life and amenity of the city. It is sometimes possible to talk about a symbiotic relationship between the park and it´s residents...|$|E

We propose a <b>rate</b> <b>shaping</b> method that drops not only the source-coding segments of the video bitstream, but also the channel-coding segments of the video bitstream, adaptively according to the network condition, in order to achieve the optimal rate-distortion performance. The proposed method is based on "discrete rate-distortion combination" to accomplish joint source-channel coding. We consider both the simulcast and multicast scenarios and show promising results...|$|R

In this paper, we present a scheme for <b>rate</b> <b>shaping</b> JPEG/MPEG-precompressed image /video with feature analysis in scale space. The proposed scheme draws its strengths from a technique for identifying perceptually important features based on geometry-driven diffusion, an interpolation scheme allowing many intentionally dropped blocks to be recovered faithfully from neighboring transmitted blocks, and some careful observations about the close interactions between block dropping and feature analysis. Compared with a successful <b>rate</b> <b>shaping</b> scheme based on joint block dropping and uniform coefficient truncation, the new scheme not only produces images of significantly higher visual quality, but also better PSNR at low bit rates. 1 Introduction Recently much attention has been focused on adapting the rate of pre-compressed video bitstreams to transmission media of lower rate capacity [...] ...|$|R

40|$|When multi-injection is {{implemented}} in diesel engine via high pressure common rail injection system, changed interval between injection pulses can induce variation of injection rate profile for sequential injection pulse, though other control parameters are the same. Variations of injection <b>rate</b> <b>shape</b> which influence the air-fuel mixing and combustion {{process will be}} important for designing injection strategy. In this research, CFD numerical simulations using KIVA- 3 V were conducted for examining the effects of injection <b>rate</b> <b>shape</b> on diesel combustion and emissions. After the model was validated by experimental results, five different shapes (including rectangle, slope, triangle, trapezoid, and wedge) of injection rate profiles were investigated. Modeling results demonstrate that injection <b>rate</b> <b>shape</b> can have obvious influence on heat release process and heat release traces which cause different combustion process and emissions. It is observed that the baseline, rectangle (flat), <b>shape</b> of injection <b>rate</b> can have better balance between NOx and soot emissions than the other investigated shapes. As wedge shape brings about the lowest NOx emissions due to retarded heat release, it produces the highest soot emissions among the five shapes. Trapezoid shape has the lowest soot emissions, while its NOx is not the highest one. The highest NOx emissions were produced by triangle shape due to higher peak injection rate...|$|R
