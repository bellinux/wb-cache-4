5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> (though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E

5|$|Her first Vietnam combat tour completed, New Jersey {{departed}} Subic Bay 3 April 1969 for Japan. She {{arrived at}} Yokosuka for a two-day visit, sailing for the United States 9 April. Her homecoming, however, {{was to be}} delayed. On the 15th, while New Jersey was still at sea, North Korean jet fighters shot down an unarmed EC-121 Constellation electronic surveillance plane over the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan,</b> killing its entire crew. A carrier task force was formed {{and sent to the}} <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan,</b> while New Jersey was ordered to come about and steam toward Japan. On the 22nd she arrived once more at Yokosuka, and immediately put to sea in readiness for what might befall.|$|E

5|$|While K-152 Nerpa was {{undergoing}} sea trials in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> on 8 November 2008, a {{fire suppression system}} was accidentally initiated. The accident killed 20 civilian specialists and navy crew members and injured 21 others.|$|E
5|$|According to Meek, Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore {{political}} boundaries.... The faint {{outline of}} the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{flathead}} flounder, Hippoglossoides dubius, is a flatfish of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that lives on bottoms in shallow coastal waters, at depths of between 10 and 600 m. Its native habitat is the northwestern Pacific, particularly the <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> and Okhotsk, and the coastlines of Kamchatka and Korea. It grows up to 45 cm in length.|$|R
5000|$|Other finds by Steve {{include an}} {{exceptionally}} preserved dragonfly wing, the oldest recorded barnacle displaying colour {{and a new}} genus of barnacle that has since been found living off the <b>Seas</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> A new holotype batoidea (Ray), Kimmerobatis etchesi has recently been named, a first from the Kimmeridge Clay. These specimens can all be seen in The Etches Collection museum.|$|R

The following notes which treat of these coral reefs are based upon observations made on my geological trip to those islands during the nine months from July 1899 to March 1900...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the JTWC {{assessed}} Wukong {{to have reached}} its initial peak intensity with winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds). The next day, the storm began to accelerate due to an interaction with the nearby Tropical Storm Sonamu. Wukong absorbed the weakening Sonamu {{later in the day}} before turning towards the west. On August16, the storm turned towards the northwest due to a weakness in the ridge near Japan. Wukong made landfall late on August17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū. As the storm made landfall, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have winds of 100km/h (65mph 1-minute winds). The cyclone slowly traveled across land, entering the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> about 24hours after landfall. Several hours after entering the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan,</b> the JMA downgraded Wukong to a tropical depression. The depression persisted for two more days before dissipating near the Russian coastline.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{described}} in 1935 by A. Schurin from specimens {{collected from the}} Peter the Great Gulf in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> It belongs to the genus Caprella in the subfamily Caprellinae of the family Caprellidae, a group of highly specialized amphipods commonly known as skeleton shrimp. Caprellids are classified under the superfamily Caprelloidea of the infraorder Caprellida.|$|E
5|$|On July13, Typhoon Nangka {{began moving}} northward toward Japan through {{a break in}} the ridge. The typhoon {{completed}} an eyewall replacement cycle, and according to the JTWC attained a secondary peak of 195km/h (120mph). The re-intensification was also aided by a decrease in wind shear, but was short-lived due to drier air from the north and west. As the eye became more ragged, the winds continued to decrease. At 14:00UTC on July16, Nangka made landfall along the Japanese island of Shikoku near Muroto, Kōchi, still at typhoon status. Four hours later, the typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm, and after crossing the Seto Inland Sea, Nangka made a second landfall on Honshu near Kurashiki, Okayama at 21:00UTC. The convection greatly weakened as it crossed Honshu into the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan,</b> and the storm deteriorated further due to lower water temperatures. At 12:00UTC on July17, the JMA downgraded Nangka to a tropical depression, and early the next day the JTWC discontinued advisories. On July18, Nangka dissipated in the central <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{species was}} {{described}} from Mukaishima, Inland <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Seto, <b>Japan.</b> Also reported from Mutsu Bay, Sagami Bay; Sugashima near Toba, Osaka Bay, Saeki Bay, Amakusa and Toyama Bay {{in the original}} description.|$|R
5|$|The {{climate of}} Japan is {{predominantly}} temperate, but varies greatly {{from north to}} south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan,</b> Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{four main}} Japanese islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido {{lie in a}} convex {{arrangement}} pointing to the Pacific Ocean, while the oceanic trenches that form the western boundary of the Pacific Plate are convex in the opposite direction, toward Eurasia. The continental crust above the subduction zones had previously {{been associated with the}} Eurasian Plate, but northern Honshu and Hokkaido have more recently been treated as part of the North American Plate, due to a poorly defined plate boundary between Eastern Siberia and Alaska and a newly forming boundary at the eastern perimeter of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> This portion of the crust has been known locally as the Okhotsk Plate. The southwestern border of the plate is called the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line. It is a region of faulting that traverses the width of central Honshu, but it has not generated any large earthquakes. Moving westward, though, the Atera, Miboro, Atotsugawa, and Nobi faults have all produced large events. Two of those events occurred beyond the terminus of the 1891 rupture: the 1945 Mikawa earthquake that hit near Nagoya on the Fukozu Fault and the 1948 Fukui earthquake that occurred near the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan,</b> off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|The {{flathead}} sole, Hippoglossoides elassodon, is a flatfish of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that lives on soft, silty or muddy bottoms at depths of up to 1050 m. Its native habitat is the northern Pacific, from the <b>seas</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> and Okhotsk, across the Bering Sea and to the coast of North America, {{as far south as}} Point Reyes, USA. It grows to 52 cm in length, and can weigh up to 1.56 kg; females are typically larger than males. Lifespan is at least 27 years for females and at least 30 years for males.|$|R
50|$|Cervimunida princeps is {{a species}} of squat lobster in the family Munididae. It {{is found in the}} East China <b>Sea</b> and off <b>of</b> <b>Japan,</b> Taiwan, and {{northern}} Luzon.|$|R
50|$|The 419 series (Yonhyaku-jūkyū-kei) is an {{electric}} multiple unit (EMU) train type introduced in 1985 by Japanese National Railways (JNR), and later operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR-West) on local services along the <b>Japan</b> <b>Sea</b> coast <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> until March 2011. They were converted from former 583 series sleeping car EMUs in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to a}} month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b>|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E
50|$|The {{powerful}} extratropical cyclone {{which passed}} over the <b>sea</b> south <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> caused heavy rainfall and snowfall in the country on January 14. In Tokyo, the blizzard dumped 8 cm of snow in nine hours. It also left 13 cm of snow in the neighbouring city Yokohama and 30 cm of snow in mountainous areas around Tokyo.|$|R
40|$|Liagora japonica {{is a red}} algal species {{distributed}} in temperate regions <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> This species has not been collected from its type locality on the Pacific coast <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> since 1927 and seems to have become extinct in this area. For molecular characterization of L. japonica, we extracted DNA from the topotype material of L. japonica collected in 1927, analyzed seven genes using Illumina next-generation sequencing, and compared these data with sequences from modern samples of similar red algae collected from the <b>Japan</b> <b>Sea</b> coast <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> Both morphological and molecular data from modern samples and historical specimens (including the lectotype and topotype) suggest that the specimens from the Pacific and <b>Japan</b> <b>Sea</b> coasts <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> {{should be treated as}} a single species, and that L. japonica is phylogenetically separated from the genus Liagora. Based on the phylogenetic results and examination of reproductive structures, we propose Otohimella japonica gen. et comb. nov., characterized morphologically by diffuse carposporophytes, undivided carposporangia, and involucral filaments initiated only from the cortical cell on the supporting cell...|$|R
50|$|Ikuchi is a yōkai <b>of</b> the <b>sea</b> in legends <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> It is {{described}} in Tankai (譚海) by Sōan Tsumura and in Mimibukuro by Negishi Shizumori among other written works of the Edo Period.|$|R
5|$|Goni {{maintained}} much of {{its strength}} while traversing the East China Sea, as low wind shear allowed convection to persist around the eyewall. Goni made landfall on southwestern Japan near Uki, Kumamoto, at 19:00UTC on August19, and shortly thereafter it struck Arao. The convection diminished while interacting with Japan's mountainous terrain, leaving the storm's center exposed once it entered the much cooler <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b> Around 12:00UTC on August25, Goni transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants turned northward and moved ashore near Vladivostok in the Russian Far East on August26. Former Typhoon Goni turned westward and entered northeastern China {{in the province of}} Heilongjiang. The storm stalled over northeastern China for several days, before dissipating on August30.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan</b> zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E
5|$|On July26, the typhoon turned {{towards the}} {{northwest}} and weakened somewhat. Late the next day, Judy struck {{the southern coast}} of Kyushu before moving over the Korea Strait. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island caused the storm to degenerate. Less than a day after moving over Kyushu, the system weakened to a tropical storm and soon made landfall in South Korea, roughly 205km (125mi) west of Pusan. Once onshore, rapid weakening took place with Judy being downgraded to a tropical depression within 12hours. The remnants of Judy were last noted on July29 over the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan.</b>|$|E
