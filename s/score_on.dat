40|$|Sixteen {{statements}} on physician attitudes in the physician-patient relationship {{were presented to}} {{a representative sample of}} Norwegian physicians (N= 990). Three moderately correlated theoretical dimensions were identified in a principal component analysis: paternalism, patient autonomy, and moral deliberation. The paternalism scores increased significantly with age, and psychiatrists scored significantly lower than physicians in somatic specialties. Psychiatrists had the highest <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the patient autonomy dimension, whereas surgeons scored the lowest. Moral deliberation scores increased slightly with age. To explore the pattern of scores across the three dimensions, the scores were dichotomized and combined in eight different ways. The resulting typology included five different physician profiles: (1) classical paternalists (high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> paternalism, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both patient autonomy and moral deliberation), (2) modern paternalists (high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both paternalism and deliberation, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> patient autonomy), (3) autonomists (high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> patient autonomy, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both paternalism and deliberation), (4) deliberationists (high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> deliberation and patient autonomy, low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> paternalism), and (5) ambivalents (high or low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> all dimensions, or high or low <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> both paternalism and patient autonomy). The four groups of physicians with 'consistent' attitudes contained between 12 and 19 % of the total sample, whereas 37 % belonged to the 'ambivalent' group. Laboratory doctors and surgeons belonged significantly more often in the group of classical paternalists than did general practitioners, whereas male physicians were more often modern paternalists than were female physicians. Among the autonomists, women were more numerous than men, doctors in their 40 s clearly more numerous than those in their 60 s, and psychiatrists clearly more numerous than residents.

After the next two drives ended with punts, Alshon Jeffery caught a ten-yard touchdown pass from Jay Cutler to draw the Bears within three points. On the following series, the Vikings responded when Teddy Bridgewater escaped a blitz to throw a pass to Jerick McMcKinnon, who beat Shea McClellin to <b>score</b> <b>on</b> the 17-yard play. To start the second half, the Bears attempted an onside kick, and Sherrick McManis recovered. However, after three plays, Brian Robison sacked and stripped Jay Cutler, recovering the fumble; Minnesota took advantage with Stefon Diggs beating Alan Ball to <b>score</b> <b>on</b> the 33-yard touchdown. The Bears decreased the margin to two touchdowns when Robbie Gould kicked a 51-yard field goal; the next three consecutive drives concluded with punts.
