5|$|The <b>Sounds</b> <b>are</b> also {{represented}} in the Southern League Hall of Fame. Larry Schmittou, who helped bring baseball to Nashville in 1978 and was the principal owner through 1996, was inducted in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} observe the {{movements}} of articulators has been of great importance {{to the study of}} phonetics {{in order to understand the}} way <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> produced.|$|E
5|$|Very low <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> also {{produced}} in various species of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Mantodea and Neuroptera. These low <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> simply the sounds {{made by the}} insect's movement. Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified {{and can be used}} to warn or communicate with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds. Some species in Hemiptera, such as the corixids (water boatmen), are known to communicate via underwater sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Intracranially heard <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> heard inside one's head but the <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> in fact outside. This {{can be solved}} by adding {{reverberation}} cues.|$|R
50|$|The drum <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> sampled {{together}} from various drum machines with an Akai S900. The tom <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> from an Oberheim DMX {{which had been}} used on First and Last and Always. The remaining drum <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> from a Yamaha RX-5.|$|R
5|$|When {{fin whale}} <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> first {{recorded}} by US biologists, {{they did not}} realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> the vocalizations of fin whales.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> produced using dampening techniques. The desired effect is produced after striking the knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and dampens its surface using their hands.|$|E
5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering display {{is made with}} the bill raised high and {{differs from that of}} the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{functions}} of the queen ant <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> to recruit workers, smell nestmates, and facilitate oral exchanges of food and pheromones. Most importantly, however, {{is the fact that}} distress noises made by the queen causes workers to raise their guard and bolster her protection.|$|E
5000|$|George VI <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> {{located at}} [...] George VI <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> largely {{covered by the}} George VI Ice Shelf and the ice varies from about 15 miles (24 km) to more than 40 miles (64 km) wide. George VI <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by Lincoln Ellsworth who flew over it in 1935. George VI <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> explored by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) in 1936-1937 and by the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) in 1940. George VI <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> named by John Riddoch Rymill, leader of the BGLE, for George VI, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.|$|R

50|$|York <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> a <b>sound</b> {{located in}} the Kimberley region of Western Australia opening into the Indian Ocean.The <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> bounded by Cape Pond to the North and Hardey Point with the Coronation Islands to the South.The nearest {{populated}} town to the <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> Kalumburu, 180 km to the North East.|$|R
5|$|Those {{species that}} make easily heard noises usually {{do so by}} rubbing a row of pegs on the hind legs against {{the edges of the}} {{forewings}} (stridulation). These <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> produced mainly by males to attract females, though in some species the females also stridulate.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E

5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air {{flow through the}} nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> defined {{by the way the}} tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville <b>Sounds</b> <b>are</b> a Minor League Baseball {{team of the}} Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A {{affiliate}} of the Oakland Athletics. They are located in Nashville, Tennessee, and are named for the city's association with the music industry. The team plays its home games at First Tennessee Park which opened in 2015 and is partially located {{on the site of}} the historic Sulphur Dell ballpark. The Sounds previously played at Herschel Greer Stadium from its opening in 1978 until the end of the 2014 season.|$|E
5|$|The god Bragi asks where a thundering {{sound is}} coming from, {{and says that}} the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had {{returned}} to Valhalla—and that {{it sounds like the}} movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.|$|E
50|$|At the articulatory level, a voiced <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> one {{in which}} the vocal cords vibrate, and a voiceless <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{one in which}} they do not.|$|R

50|$|Long Island <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> {{formed when}} the {{terminal}} moraine that dammed {{the waters of}} glacial Lake Connecticut failed, and sea water mixed with the lake's fresh waters. The first European to record the existence of Long Island <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> the Dutch navigator Adriaen Block, who entered the sound from the East River in 1614. The <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> known as The Devil's Belt in colonial times and the reefs that run across the <b>sound</b> <b>were</b> known as Devil's Stepping Stones, from which Stepping Stones Lighthouse got its name.|$|R
5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit widely on the {{acoustics}} {{spectrum and}} the <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; {{the nature of}} and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.|$|E
5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5000|$|Sound: TIA {{video and}} sound chip, {{same as the}} 2600. Only the <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> used in 7800 games. Both video and <b>sound</b> <b>are</b> used in 2600 games.|$|R
50|$|Croatan <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> an inlet in Dare County, North Carolina. It connects Pamlico Sound with Albemarle <b>Sound,</b> and <b>is</b> bordered to {{the east}} by Roanoke Island; Roanoke <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> {{on the other side}} of the island. Its name comes from the Croatan Indians who once {{inhabited}} the area. The Croatan <b>Sound</b> <b>is</b> crossed by two bridges, the older William B. Umstead Bridge, and the newer Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 64.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the [...] "tick tock" [...] <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> caused by this {{escapement}} mechanism. As the balance wheel rocks back and forth, the ticking <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> heard.|$|R
5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, {{the brain and}} auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{has been}} written {{with a number of}} {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day. However, the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern Hebrew alphabet. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, though these <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E
5|$|Electric vehicle warning <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> {{a series}} of sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians {{to the presence of}} electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can {{make it more difficult for}} pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E
5000|$|Musically {{the essence}} of the band <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> {{extracted}} from [...] "Dark, Hard, and Melodious". Their <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> characterized by Kouichi's unique chord progressions and aki's high-pitched vocals.|$|R
50|$|In places {{throughout}} the film, telemetry <b>sounds</b> from spacecraft <b>were</b> integrated {{so that they}} themselves became the music. None of these telemetry <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> from Apollo, because by that time telemetry was so rapid and of such frequency that even slowed down was inaudible to the ear. The telemetry <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> taken from Mariner IV which flew by Mars many years before, the last time such <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> audible.|$|R
30|$|Qualitative scoring of {{all sources}} of <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> done by two {{researchers}} listening continuously {{to each of}} the 24 -h recordings obtained with the Noxturnal 3.2 software (NoxMedical®, Reykjavik, Iceland), and scoring was performed every 30  s. The most clearly identifiable <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> classified into three main categories: monitor alarms, mechanical ventilator alarms and conversations. If none of these three categories <b>was</b> recognized, the <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> classified as “other.” If many different types of <b>sound</b> <b>were</b> monitored during a given period, the most prevalent source was the one selected by the researchers.|$|R
