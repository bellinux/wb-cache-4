5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has <b>shallow</b> <b>breathing.</b> Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E

25|$|In high doses, overdoses, {{or in some}} persons not {{tolerant}} to opioids, oxycodone {{can cause}} <b>shallow</b> <b>breathing,</b> slowed heart rate, cold/clammy skin, pauses in breathing, low blood pressure, constricted pupils, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest, and death.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} to middle stages of ketoacidosis, {{patients}} are typically flushed and breathing rapidly and deeply, but visible dehydration, pale appearance from diminished perfusion, <b>shallower</b> <b>breathing,</b> and a fast heart rate are often present when coma is reached. However these features are variable and not always as described.|$|R

25|$|A horse showing severe {{clinical}} signs, {{followed by}} a rapid and significant improvement, may have experienced gastrointestinal perforation. While this releases the pressure that originally caused so much discomfort for the horse, it results in a non-treatable peritonitis that requires euthanasia. Soon after this apparent improvement, the horse will display signs of shock, including an elevated heart rate, increased capillary refill time, rapid <b>shallow</b> <b>breathing,</b> and a change in mucous membrane color. It may also be pyretic, act depressed, or become extremely painful.|$|E
25|$|Early {{complications}} include shock, infection, systemic {{inflammatory response}} syndrome, low blood calcium, high blood glucose, and dehydration. Blood loss, dehydration, and fluid leaking into the abdominal cavity (ascites) {{can lead to}} kidney failure. Respiratory complications are often severe. Pleural effusion is usually present. <b>Shallow</b> <b>breathing</b> from pain can lead to lung collapse. Pancreatic enzymes may attack the lungs, causing inflammation. Severe inflammation can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, further impairing renal and respiratory function and potentially requiring management with an open abdomen to relieve the pressure.|$|E
25|$|Some {{symptoms}} of an overdose typically include sluggishness, incoordination, difficulty in thinking, slowness of speech, faulty judgement, drowsiness, <b>shallow</b> <b>breathing,</b> staggering, and, in severe cases, coma or death. The lethal dosage of barbiturates varies greatly with tolerance and from one individual to another. The lethal dose is highly variable among different {{members of the}} class with superpotent barbiturates such as pentobarbital being potentially fatal in considerably lower doses than the low-potency barbiturates such as butalbital. Even in inpatient settings, however, the development of tolerance is still a problem, as dangerous and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms can result when the drug is stopped after dependence has developed. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and sedative effects of barbiturates tends to develop faster than tolerance to their effects on smooth muscle, respiration, and heart rate, making them generally unsuitable for a long time psychiatric use. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects tends to correlate more with tolerance to physiological effects, however, meaning that they are still a viable option for long-term epilepsy treatment.|$|E
50|$|A {{metabolic}} acidosis soon produces hyperventilation, {{but at first}} it will tend to be rapid and relatively <b>shallow.</b> Kussmaul <b>breathing</b> develops as the acidosis grows more severe.

Another was the <b>Shallow</b> Underwater <b>Breathing</b> Apparatus ("SUBA"), a pressurized snorkel system permitting swimmers to breathe easily as deep as ten feet under water.|$|R
50|$|Sleep apnea (or sleep apnoea in British English; /æpˈniːə/) is a sleep {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} pauses in breathing or instances of <b>shallow</b> or infrequent <b>breathing</b> during sleep.

25|$|The {{principal}} item {{of equipment}} for a cavalryman was the horse {{and one of the}} reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster issued animals obtained though public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory. Union army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as <b>shallow</b> <b>breathing,</b> deformed hooves, spavin or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed. Cavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end. The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed. On both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and glanders to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military veterinary service failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.|$|E
500|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} the combination of obesity (body mass index above 30kg/m2), hypoxemia (falling oxygen levels in blood) during sleep, and hypercapnia (increased blood carbon dioxide levels) during the day, resulting from hypoventilation (excessively slow or <b>shallow</b> <b>breathing).</b> The disease has been known since the 1950s, initially as [...] "Pickwickian syndrome" [...] in reference to a Dickensian character but currently under a more descriptive name.|$|E
2500|$|The Rapid <b>Shallow</b> <b>Breathing</b> Index (RSBI, {{the ratio}} of {{respiratory}} frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously {{referred to as the}} [...] "Tobin Index" [...] after Dr. Martin Tobin of Loyola University Medical Center) {{is one of the best}} studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.|$|E
25|$|The hyper-vigilance {{response}} {{can lead}} to the creation of endogenous stimuli that contribute to the perceived threat. A similar process may explain hallucinations, with slight variations, in which an evil presence is perceived by the subject to be attempting to suffocate them, either by pressing heavily on the chest or by strangulation. A neurological explanation hold that this results from a combination of the threat vigilance activation system and the muscle paralysis associated with sleep paralysis that removes voluntary control of breathing. Several features of REM breathing patterns exacerbate the feeling of suffocation. These include <b>shallow</b> rapid <b>breathing,</b> hypercapnia, and slight blockage of the airway, which is a symptom prevalent in sleep apnea patients.|$|R
40|$|A {{cohort of}} {{survivors}} of {{congenital diaphragmatic hernia}} (CDH), with matched controls, was studied to assess growth, respiratory function, and exercise performance. Nineteen of 24 survivors from an 11 year period (79 %) were compared with 19 matched controls. Subjects had detailed auxology, performed spirometry and cycle ergometry, and completed questionnaires about respiratory symptoms and exercise. There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups for height, weight, sitting height, head circumference, or body mass index expressed as SD scores. The mean (95 % confidence interval) percentage predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) was 84. 7 % (79. 1 to 90. 3) in index cases and 96. 5 % (91. 4 to 101. 6) in controls (p < 0. 01). There was no significant difference in total lung capacity. Expiratory flow rates corrected for FVC were also similar between groups, suggesting normal airway function relative to lung size. Mean maximum oxygen consumption in ml/kg/min was 40. 1 (36. 8 to 43. 4) and 42. 2 (38. 5 to 45. 8) in index and control cases. These differences were not significant. Index cases achieved a similar minute ventilation to controls by more rapid and <b>shallower</b> <b>breathing.</b> Index cases had lower perception of their own fitness and lower enjoyment of exercise, although habitual activity levels were similar. Survivors of CDH repair have reduced functional lung volumes, but normal airway function compared with matched controls. They have no growth impairment nor significant impairment of exercise performance, although they have more negative perceptions of their own fitness. They should be encouraged and expected to participate fully in sport and exercise. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new real-time automated infrared video monitoring technique for detection of breathing anomalies, and its application {{in the diagnosis}} of obstructive sleep apnea. We introduce a novel motion model to detect subtle, cyclical breathing signals from video, a new 3 -D unsupervised self-adaptive breathing template to learn individuals' normal breathing patterns online, and a robust action classification method to recognize abnormal breathing activities and limb movements. This technique avoids imposing positional constraints on the patient, allowing patients to sleep on their back or side, with or without facing the camera, fully or partially occluded by the bed clothes. Moreover, <b>shallow</b> and abdominal <b>breathing</b> patterns do not adversely affect {{the performance of the}} method, and it is insensitive to environmental settings such as infrared lighting levels and camera view angles. The experimental results show that the technique achieves high accuracy (94 % for the clinical data) in recognizing apnea episodes and body movements and is robust to various occlusion levels, body poses, body movements (i. e., minor head movement, limb movement, body rotation, and slight torso movement), and breathing behavior (e. g., <b>shallow</b> versus heavy <b>breathing,</b> mouth breathing, chest breathing, and abdominal breathing).

50|$|The {{precooler}} adds {{mass and}} complexity to the system, {{and is the}} most aggressive and difficult part of the design, but the mass of this heat exchanger is {{an order of magnitude}} lower than has been achieved previously. The experimental device achieved heat exchange of almost 1 GW/m3. The losses from carrying the added weight of systems shut down during the closed cycle mode (namely the precooler and turbo-compressor) as well as the added weight of Skylon's wings are offset by the gains in overall efficiency and the proposed flight plan. Conventional launch vehicles such as the Space Shuttle spend about one minute climbing almost vertically at relatively low speeds; this is inefficient, but optimal for pure-rocket vehicles. In contrast, the SABRE engine permits a much slower, <b>shallower</b> climb, <b>breathing</b> air and using its wings to support the vehicle therefore increasing payload fraction.|$|R
