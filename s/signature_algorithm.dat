25|$|It is {{important}} to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital <b>signature</b> <b>algorithm</b> is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender himself, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity; and, therefore, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{we developed}} several algorithms that use information extraction techniques to achieve high-precision text categorization.

These algorithms relied on hand-coded training data, including annotated texts and a semantic dictionary.

The relevancy <b>signatures</b> <b>algorithm</b> uses linguistic phrases, the augmented relevancy <b>signatures</b> <b>algorithm</b> uses phrases and local context, and the case-based text classi#cation algorithm uses larger pieces of context. Relevant phrases and contexts are acquired automatically using a training corpus. Weevaluate the algorithms on the basis of two test sets from the MUC- 4 corpus.
