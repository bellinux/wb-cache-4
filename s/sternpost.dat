5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or <b>sternpost,</b> and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a <b>sternpost,</b> the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her <b>sternpost,</b> rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century <b>sternpost</b> rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E

5|$|The {{management}} of the construction was flawed from the start: the stem and <b>sternposts,</b> rudder frame, and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time, and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress. Verkhovsky, having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers, contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already loaded down with other Navy jobs. The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament {{that the government was}} willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop. The savvy admiral always blamed the suppliers but did not even attempt to fix the disarray in his own office.|$|R
5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with yellow pine planking {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of Muntz metal sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and <b>sternposts</b> {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the radical}} {{concept of the}} medieval pintle-and-gudgeon rudder did not come as a single {{invention}} into being. It presented rather a combination of ideas which each had been long around before: rudders mounted on the stern, iron hinges and the straight <b>sternpost</b> of northern European ships. While earlier rudders were mounted on the stern by the way of rudderposts or tackles, the iron hinges allowed {{for the first time}} to attach the rudder to the entire length of the <b>sternpost</b> in a really permanent fashion. However, its full potential could only to be realized after the introduction of the vertical <b>sternpost</b> and the full-rigged ship in the 14th century. From the age of discovery onwards, European ships with pintle-and-gudgeon rudders sailed successfully on all seven seas.|$|E
25|$|Transoms – These timbers extend {{across the}} low {{parts of the}} hull near the rudder, and are secured (notched and/or bolted) to the <b>sternpost.</b> The transom located {{at the base of}} the stern, and the {{uppermost}} of the main transoms, was typically called the wing transom; the principal transom below this and level with the lower deck was called the deck transom; between these two were a series of filling transoms. If the stern had transoms above the wing transom, they would no longer be affixed to the <b>sternpost.</b> The first of these might be called a counter transom; next up was the window sill transom; above that, the spar deck transom. The larger the vessel, the more numerous and wider the transoms required to support its stern.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in May 1853, work on {{assembling}} the timbers commenced, as the shipyard workers prepared to start {{construction of the}} new sloop-of-war. The vessel's keel was laid down on 25 June 1853, using material from the oak stockpile; her <b>sternpost</b> was erected on 27 August, and her stem followed {{a couple of weeks}} later. She was launched on 26 August 1854 at 11:45. Fitting-out work then commenced, which included the installation of her masts, rigging, and armament.|$|E
5000|$|Today {{the name}} Bassett-Lowke is mostly {{associated}} with detailed model trains {{but the company}} also {{had a long history}} of contracting skilled craftsmen to make scale military and civilian waterline ship models out of wood and wire. *Derick Head in his [...] "Bassett-Lowke Waterline Ship Models", states that before and during World War One, there was such a demand for these hand-made waterline wooden ship models that the company had to contract with a [...] "small metal casting company" [...] to supply more waterline ship models to meet the demand. The name of the metal casting company referred to in Mr. Head's book was Brighten Manufacturing Company, LTD 32, Great St. Helens, London, England. This metal casting company was within walking distance from the prominent glass display windows of the Bassett-Lowke shop located on High Holborn St. in London. The metal ship models supplied by this small company were referred to in the Bassett-Lowke sales literature simply as [...] "B.M.C.". The collaboration between Bassett-Lowke and B.M.C. produced the first metal ship models in a uniform scale to each other ever made. These B.M.C. models were the forerunners of all the scale metal recognition models made by companies in later years such as Tremo, Viking and Authenticast. The resulting model fleet in metal carried in the Bassett-Lowke catalog was of every class of ship in the British navy then in commission as of 1914. The models found in the collection range from the early 1882 Royal Sovereign class Pre-Dreadnoughts, some of which had been retained by the navy as bombardment ships, through the newest Revenge class Super-Dreadnoughts which had just come into service. The 1917 Bassett-Lowke catalogue makes the claim that [...] "Practically every ship in the Navy has been modeled, including Super-Dreadnoughts, Battleships, Battle Cruisers, Armored Cruisers, Light Cruisers, Destroyers, Torpedo Boats, Submarines, Mine Layers, Mine Sweepers, Troopships, Transports, Armed Liners and all Auxiliary Craft". The models were formed in lead with the wire masts cast into the hulls in a scale of one inch equals 150 feet or 1/1800. They were painted and issued in numbered boxed sets, paper flags supplied with each set to be cut out and applied to the masts and <b>sternposts.</b> Every class of vessel was easily recognizable by the funnels, guns and masts. While rudimentary by later standards, the B.M.C. production of over 101 different castings was the first scale metal ship model fleet ever produced and established the precedent all subsequent scale metal recognition ship models. In addition to the ship models, B.M.C. produced a fort with movable guns, four lighthouses and a game featuring a large fold-out map of the Dardanelles channel showing forts and minefields. The game was supplied with fifteen metal ship models including two mine sweepers and two submarines.|$|R
25|$|The stern is {{the back}} or aft-most {{part of a}} ship or boat, {{technically}} defined as the area built up over the <b>sternpost,</b> extending upwards from the counter rail to the taffrail. The stern lies opposite of the bow, the foremost part of a ship. Originally, the term only referred to the aft port section of the ship, but eventually came {{to refer to the}} entire back of a vessel. The stern end of a ship is indicated with a white navigation light at night.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 1924, Olympic was {{involved}} in another collision with a ship, this time at New York. As Olympic was reversing from her berth at New York harbour, her stern collided with the smaller liner Fort St George, which had crossed into her path. The collision caused extensive damage to the smaller ship. At first it appeared that Olympic had sustained only minor damage, but it was later revealed that her <b>sternpost</b> had been fractured, necessitating the replacement of her entire stern frame.|$|E
25|$|The vessel {{contained}} framing {{composed of}} various elements (keel, fore foot, stempost, cutwater, <b>sternpost,</b> inner post, false post), double planking (assembled entirely by mortise-and-tenon joints pegged from the inside) and {{was covered with}} a sheet of lead. What is referred to as a large keelson is actually a 7.5m long mast-step timber made of oak which doubles the axial frame. The stringers, nailed onto the frames, reinforced the hull longitudinally. Regularly alternated floor timbers and half frames comprised the framing of the vessel. The wreck indicates the vessel was about 40m long (35.10m remains preserved on the seabed), 9m wide, and 4.5m deep with a length-to-beam coefficient of 4.4(if L=40m, L/W=4.4). This coefficient of elongation-rate of length to width allows the ship to be much faster than those with a lower coefficient.|$|E
25|$|As {{ships of}} wooden {{construction}} {{gave way to}} iron and steel, the cruiser stern—another design without transoms and known variously as the canoe stern, parabolic stern, and the double-ended stern—became the next prominent development in ship stern design, particularly in warships of {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. The intent of this re-design was to protect the steering gear by bringing it below the armor deck. The stern now came to a point rather than a flat panel or a gentle curve, and the counter reached from the <b>sternpost</b> all the way to the taffrail in a continuous arch. It was soon discovered that vessels with cruiser sterns experienced less water resistance when under way than those with elliptical sterns, and between World War I and World War II most merchant ship designs soon followed suit.|$|E

500|$|The Han-era Chinese sailed in {{a variety}} of ships differing from those of {{previous}} eras, such as the tower ship. The junk design was developed and realized during Han. Junk ships featured a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or <b>sternpost,</b> and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels. Moreover, Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern, in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport, [...] allowing them to sail on the high seas.|$|E
500|$|Junk (ship): The Chinese junk, {{derived from}} the Portuguese term junco (which in turn was adapted from the Javanese djong meaning [...] "ship"), was a ship design unique to China, {{although}} many other ship types in China (such as the towered lou chuan) preceded it. Its origins {{could be seen in}} the latter half of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), when ship designs began to have square-ended bows and sterns with flat bottom hulls. Unlike the earliest shipbuilding traditions of the Western world and South Asia, the junk had a (flat or slightly rounded) carvel-shaped hull which lacked a keel and <b>sternpost</b> (necessitating block and tackle or socket-and-jaw attachment of the Chinese rudder). Since there is no keel in the design, solid transverse bulkheads take the place of structural ribs. There are many theories about the evolution of the junk. One suggests that it developed from the double canoe, another claims that the bamboo raft used by Taiwanese aboriginals was the source of the junk. Records by Western travelers in China during the Song Dynasty mention that junks could support 130 sailors. The size of junks grew during the Ming Dynasty. By the 14th century, junks could carry 2,000 tons. Archaeological evidence of the large size of the junk has been proven by a sunken junk discovered in 1973 near the coast of Southeastern China.|$|E
500|$|Rudder, stern-mounted and {{vertical}} axial: Lawrence V. Mott, who defines a steering oar as a rudder, states the ancient Egyptian use of stern-mounted rudders {{can be traced}} back to the 6th dynasty (2350–2200 BC). Mott states that the method of attachment for rudders in the Arab, Chinese, and European worlds differed from each other, leading him to doubt the spread of the Chinese system of attachment by socket-and-jaws or block and tackle (versus European pintle-and-gudgeon invented by c. 1180 AD). In regards to Mott's definition of a steering oar as a rudder, Joseph Needham, Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes, K.S. Tom, Chung Chee Kit, S.A.M. Adshead, Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that a steering oar is not a rudder; the steering oar has the capacity to interfere with handling of the sails (limiting any potential for long ocean-going voyages) while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow, rapid-water transport; the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails, took less energy to operate by its helmsman, was better fit for larger vessels on ocean-going travel, and first appeared in China. Leo Block writes of the use of the steering oar in the ancient Mediterranean world (specifically in regards to the Phoenicians, 1550–300 BC): [...] "A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a break." [...] The oldest depicted rudders at the back of a ship, without the use of oars or a steering oar, comes from several ceramic models of Chinese ships made during both the Western and Eastern eras of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). According to the scholars Zhang Zunyan and Vassilios Christides, there is literary evidence to suggest that the axial stern rudder existed in China since the 1st century BC, while Gang Deng asserts the first reference was made in the Huainanzi of the 2nd century BC, and K.S. Tom says the first clear reference dates to the 5th century AD. However, K.S. Tom points to the fact that all Chinese pottery models of ships before this Guangzhou tomb model show steering oars instead of a rudder, which he states is strong evidence for the rudder's invention only by the 1st century AD. Jacques Gernet states that while the Chinese had invented the rudder in the 1st century AD, it was not completely fixed to the <b>sternpost</b> of Chinese ships until the end of the 4th century. The bulkhead ship design of the junk, which appeared roughly the same time as the rudder, provided the essential vertical components for the hinged axial rudder. Deng points out that an Eastern Han (25–220) model distinctly shows a rudder located in its own separate cabin, suggesting that helmsmanship had already become an established profession. Following the invention of the balanced rudder pivoted on an axis, Tom and Deng state that the Chinese then innovated the fenestrated rudder by the Song Dynasty (960–1279), with deliberate puncturing and boring out of holes in shapes such as diamonds, which, according to Tom, made the rudder [...] "easier to steer, reduced turbulence drag, did not affect efficiency and was hydrodynamically sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|The stern of a {{classical}} sailing ship housed the captain's quarters and became increasingly large and elaborate between the 15th and 18th centuries, {{especially in the}} baroque era, when such wedding-cake-like structures became so heavy that crews sometimes threw the decoration overboard rather than be burdened with its useless weight. [...] But until {{a new form of}} stern appeared in the 19th century, the transom stern was a floating house—and required just as many timbers, walls, windows, and frames. The stern frame provided the foundational structure of the transom stern, and was composed of the <b>sternpost,</b> wing transom, and fashion piece.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} post-war years the war-worn Finnish {{state-owned}} icebreaker fleet, reduced to four steam-powered icebreakers and the diesel-electric Sisu, was overburdened with work. Due {{to the lack}} of modern tonnage, all available ships were taken into use, and during the winter months this meant a large number of older ships with low engine power and inadequate ice-strengthening. In 1946, Tarmo lost her rudder and the whole <b>sternpost</b> while assisting ships in the Archipelago Sea. Using the bow and stern propellers to steer the icebreaker, Captain Malmi managed to return to Helsinki — a voyage of [...] — and even enter the drydock without assistance from tugboats.|$|E

2500|$|Modelling {{precision}} and lightweight design {{can be achieved}} by creating a hollow hull.

Behind the pilot a curved top decking extended aft to the tail. The tail surfaces consisted of a half-oval horizontal stabiliser with a split elevator mounted above the upper longerons and an ovoid rudder hinged to the <b>sternpost.</b> There was no fixed vertical fin. The main undercarriage consisted {{of a pair of}} skids each carried on an inverted V-strut at their rear and a single raked strut at the front: an axle carrying the wheels was bound to the skids by bungee cords and restrained by radius rods.

Heke obtained an American ensign from Henry Green Smith, a storekeeper at Wahapu who had succeeded Mayhew as Acting-Consul. After the flagstaff was cut down for a second time the Stars and Stripes flew from the carved <b>sternpost</b> of Heke's war-canoe. Letters from William Williams record talks he had with Heke, and refer to American traders attempting to undermine the British both before and especially after the signing of the treaty. William Mayhew left New Zealand and Green Smith and Charles Berry Waetford then acted as unofficial American Consuls.

2500|$|The visual unpopularity of Seppings' {{circular}} stern {{was soon}} rectified by Sir William Symonds. In this revised stern, {{a set of}} straight post timbers (also called [...] "whiskers", [...] "horn timbers", or [...] "fan tail timbers") stretches from the keel diagonally aft and upward. It rests {{on the top of}} the <b>sternpost</b> and runs on either side of the rudder post (thus creating the [...] "helm port" [...] through which the rudder passes) to a point well above the vessel's waterline.

[...] The finished stern has a continuous curved edge around the outside and is raked aft. Other names for the elliptical stern include a [...] "counter stern," [...] in reference to its very long counter, and a [...] "cutaway stern." [...] The elliptical stern began use during the age of sail, but remained very popular for both merchant and warships well into the nautical age of steam and through the first eight decades of steamship construction (roughly 1840–1920), despite the fact that the design left the rudder exposed and vulnerable in combat situations.|$|E
