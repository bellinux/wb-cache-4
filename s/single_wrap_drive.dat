We then show how 1 /N corrections can be implemented, and we examine the sound speed and levels of non-Gaussianities in two distinct cases.

For AdS backgrounds we find that the signature is generally large and positive, although is no longer globally defined over the full phase space. We then investigate an inflationary mechanism using a representation cascade, whereby the transition from a reducible representation to the irrep drives inflation. ...|$|R

Subsequently, these were replaced by a special KVM cable which combined the keyboard, video and mouse cables in a <b>single</b> <b>wrapped</b> extension cable. The advantage of the last approach is in {{the reduction of the}} number of cables between the KVM switch and connected computers. The disadvantage is the cost of these cables.|$|R

5000|$|Vedic period (c. 1750 - 500 BCE) {{garments}} {{for both}} sexes included a <b>single</b> cloth <b>wrapped</b> around {{the whole body}} and draped over the shoulder. A lower garment called paridhana was pleated in front and tied with a belt (mekhala), and worn with a shawl-like upper garment called uttariya. Orthodox males and females usually wore the uttariya by throwing it over the left shoulder only, in the style called upavita. The lower garment was called 'nivi' or 'nivi bandha', while the upper body was mostly left bare. In cold weather a garment called pravara was worn. Sometimes the poor people wore the lower garment as a loincloth, while the rich wore foot-length pravara to show their prestige. Vedic women mainly wore the sari, which is derived from शाटी, the Sanskrit for 'strip of cloth' [...] Towards the later Vedic period, the choli and dupatta, a smaller version of sari, were introduced. The dupatta was worn with ghaghara (an ankle-length skirt). Vedic men wore lungi (a garment like a sarong and dhoti, a <b>single</b> cloth <b>wrapped</b> around the waist and legs which is still traditionally worn by men in villages. Wool, linen, silk and cotton were the main fibers used for making clothes, with woven stripes and checks. Gold jewellery remained very popular.|$|R
40|$|When {{compared}} with other summary statistics (mean size, size variance, orientation variance), visual estimates of average orientation are inefficient. Observers {{act as if they}} use information from no {{more than two or three}} items. We hypothesised that observers would attain greater sampling efficiency when their task was to perform a texture segmentation rather than a did not require an explicit representation of mean orientation. We tested this hypothesis using a texture-segmentation task. Two arrays of 32 wavelets each were presented; one left and one right of fixation. Orientations in the target array were sampled from wrapped normal distributions having two different means with the same variance. One distribution defined orientations above the horizontal meridian, the other defined orientations below the meridian. All orientations in the other array were defined by a <b>single</b> <b>wrapped</b> normal distribution having the same variance as each of the distributions in the target array. Contrary to our hypothesis, results indicate that observers effectively ignored all but one item from the top and bottom of each array. In fact, we found no change in the threshold difference between the target's two means when all but one item from the top and bottom of each array were removed. We are forced to conclude that the visual system does not compute the average of more than a few orientations, even for texture segmentation...|$|R
50|$|Tri-gate or 3D {{transistor}} (not to {{be confused}} with 3D microchips) fabrication is used by Intel Corporation for the nonplanar transistor architecture used in Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Skylake processors. These transistors employ a single gate stacked on top of two vertical gates (a <b>single</b> gate <b>wrapped</b> over 3 sides of the channel), allowing essentially three times the surface area for electrons to travel. Intel reports that their tri-gate transistors reduce leakage and consume far less power than current transistors. This allows up to 37% higher speed or a power consumption at under 50% of the previous type of transistors used by Intel.|$|R

40|$|Iranian flat breads {{generally}} have short shelf life. The {{result of this}} situation is usually enormous bread wastage. Among {{the most important factors}} involved are lack of proper packing and storage methods. In this study, the best temperature for bread packing was determined and the effects of three types of plastic wrapping on Taftoon bread baked of the typical flour were investigated after 72 hours of storage. These wrappings included a two-layer wrapping of oriented polypropylene and polyethylene (OPP/PE) with a thickness of 60 µ, a three-layer wrapping of PP/PE/PE with a thickness of 70 µ, and a two-layer polyethylene with a thickness of 70 µ together with cardboard and plastic. Bread packing was carried out at two different temperature ranges (20 - 25 oC and 45 - 50 oC). Results from moisture measurements and water activity test indicated that the characteristics of breads packed in different wrappings showed significant differences (p&lt; 0. 01). Moisture percentage and water activity (aw) were lower in layers with higher permeability to moisture and water vapor and, consequently, algal growths reduced in these wrappings. Reduced moisture content, however, reduced the final bread quality score. It was also found that employing cardboard covered in polyethylene had no significant effect on bread shelf life during 72 hours of bread storage. Another finding from the present study was that packing a large number of 10 × 10 cm bread pieces within one <b>single</b> <b>wrapping</b> with cardboard and plastic was satisfactory and that the presence of the cardboard helped maintain bread shape during transportation and storage...|$|R
