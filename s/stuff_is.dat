[...] He confirmed that [...] "the Iraq stuff and the Vietnam <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> there by design", adding that he did not think that the film was anti-military.

The second skit is called [...] "Spatula City" [...] and is an advertisement for a spatula outlet store. These short segments were used in the film as commercials; other commercial segments, such as [...] "Plots 'R Us" [...] and [...] "Conan the Librarian", were not used on the album.|$|E

It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film." [...] Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that [...] "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film." ...|$|E

[...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth.

Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective.

The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who also starred in the Icelandic language version of the film, Reykjavík-Rotterdam. The San Francisco Chronicle felt Beckinsale was [...] "stuck {{in a bit of a}} thankless role as the victimised wife, but she does try to infuse a harder edge to the character."

[...] Entertainment Weekly felt that the [...] "woman-in-peril <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> second-rate, giving off a whiff of exploitation" [...] while Variety found the repeated violence towards Beckinsale's character disturbing. The film had a production budget of $25million and has grossed over $96million worldwide.|$|E
