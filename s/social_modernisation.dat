Modernisation theory attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to social progress and development of societies, and seeks to explain the process of <b>social</b> evolution. <b>Modernisation</b> theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, world-systems theorists, globalisation theorists and dependency theorists among others. Modernisation theory not only stresses the process of change, but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies.|$|R

However, he says there was a cost {{in terms of a}} neglect in liberal-democratic values. That is, liberalism, pluralism, and respect for cultural diversity gave way to policies of exclusion and repression. He says the war turned a peaceful nation into [...] "one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval." [...] The nation was fearful of enemy aliens—especially Germans, regardless of how closely they identified with Australia. The government interred 2900 German-born men (40% of the total) and deported 700 of them after the war. Irish nationalists and labour radicals were under suspicion as well. Racist hostility was high against toward nonwhites, including Pacific Islanders, Chinese and Aborigines. The result, Fischer says, was a strengthening of conformity to imperial/British loyalties and an explicit preference for immigrants from the British Isles.|$|E

It concerns cultural imperialism whose most important manifestations are exposed on the grounds of contemporary postcolonial research.

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} {{development}} {{is included in}} the concept of <b>social</b> <b>modernisation.</b> In spatial analyses, including studies of rural space, it is most often used in the context of researching developmental stages. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present the most important concepts in assessing development and planning of rural areas in the context of <b>social</b> <b>modernisation.</b> Overview of different approaches showed that most of them used the premises of functional methodology. Functionalism in spatial studies (mainly economic geography and spatial management) was the most important trend in the identification and interpretation of social and economic phenomena. Reducing socio-economic reality mainly to the realm of spatial development and the adoption of methods of functional research has always accentuated the structural characteristics that emphasised the systemic coherence (harmony and spatial order). On the other hand, the concepts of modernisation in rural areas do not stress internal contradictions that cause social conflicts and tensions...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposition}} that western industrialised society {{is subject to}} fundamental change is hardly controversial. If trade unions are to remain {{actively involved in the}} context of this changing society, in the role of an emancipatory <b>social</b> movement, <b>modernisation</b> is imperative. This con-tribution outlines a number of changes in society and how they affect the position of trade unions. Subsequently, as regards the modernisation of trade unions themselves, the author for-mulates two priorities: the problem of participation and the concept of labour as used by the trade unions. Finally, he analyses the way in which the trade union movement in the Nether-lands has handled these priorities up to now. This analysis will focus primarily on the develop-ments within the federation of Dutch trade unions (Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging, FNV). With a membership of over a million, the FNV is the largest trade union in the Netherlands. 1 He also looks at the developments within the Christian federation (Christelijk Nationaal Vak-verbond, CNV), which has about 350, 000 members. At the outset two things should be stressed. Firstly, the author chose a critical approach, but in the firm conviction that a strong, modernised trade union movement is essential. Secondly, the present discussion is limited to outlining developments, which are dominant in the view of the author. Only brief reference will be made to new approaches that occur in concrete trade union practice...|$|R

From borough villages to {{abolition}} of corvee and its results (abstract) The {{aim of this}} doctoral thesis lies in its contribution to a complex problem of economic development of Czech landowning towns in the post-White Mountain period. The research is focused on a selected problem of town feudalisation, i. e. analysis of the importance as well as extent of their seignorial activities. Czech historiography has dealt with such a topic rather marginally, because towns used {{to be understood as}} a strange element in feudal environment, which on the contrary created conditions for <b>social</b> <b>modernisation.</b> Aristocratic (chamber) or church landed estates used to be studied as a matter of priority.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{considers}} the modernisation of education governance as {{implemented by the}} New Labour governments of the United Kingdom since 1997. The discussion focuses on the apparent contradiction between those elements of modernisation that require the measurement and management of performance; and those that promote greater fairness and responsiveness. It is argued that tensions between these elements of policy are resolved by New Labour policy makers {{through the use of}} ideas derived from <b>social</b> capital theory. <b>Modernisation</b> uses these ideas in pursuit of a transformation of politics that enhances governability by making beliefs and feelings quantifiable, and by equating social relations with capital accumulation.

He was always scrutinising working conditions, criticising claims to power and the hegemony of economically powerful players, and demanded participation opportunities for everyone. The focus of his attention were the ‘losers’ of <b>social</b> <b>modernisation</b> processes; young people and adults who had difficulty accessing socially valuable commodities, such as finding vocational training, further education, and gainful employment.

The article presents the findings of a research which explores the eventual differences between Slovenian and Croatian sample in agency-oriented and communion-oriented life goals and the analysis of significant predictors of above mentioned life goals on both samples. The research included 924 adults of both genders, aged between 21 and 70 years from Slovenia and Croatia. In the study we used the scale of Goals (Pohlman and Brunstein, 1997) and a set of questions regarding various participant&# 39;s life domains and their perceived importance. The results show significant differences on agency- oriented and communion-oriented life goals between the Slovenian and Croatian sample; in both cases croatian participants reach higher results than those from slovenina sample. As significant predictors in both samples were identified (a) age and importance of effective use of free time for agency-oriented goals, and (b) and gender, parenthood, importance of parenthood and importance of effective use of free time for communion-oriented life goals. The differences in results are explained by respective levels of <b>social</b> <b>modernisation</b> and social welfare, given the fact the Slovenian respondents are embedded in the social environment that offers more possibilities for fullfilment of their life goals, and are closer to postmaterialism and individualism. ...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge is fast {{becoming}} one of the main sources of wealth, yet it can also become a source of inequalities. The New Knowledge Economy in Europe attempts to determine whether it is possible to hasten the transition towards a knowledge-based economy and enhance competitiveness with increased employment and improved social cohesion across Europe. The book is an amalgamation of the scientific and political agendas which led to the European strategy for the knowledge-based economy adopted by the European Union. Its authors illustrate their own influence on European policy making with contributions on a broad range of subjects, including: • the potential for the growth of a knowledge-based global economy • new challenges for the welfare state • emerging trends in employment • the role of international benchmarking as a policy learning tool • the construction of European identity • the building of multilevel governance required to undertake reforms. The results of the European strategy for the knowledge economy have become apparent throughout the EU in policy areas including research, innovation, single markets, education and employment, amongst others. This is the new blueprint for economic and <b>social</b> <b>modernisation</b> in the EU.
