2500|$|In Europe, magpies {{have been}} {{historically}} demonized by humans, mainly {{as a result}} of superstition and myth. The bird has found itself in this situation mainly by association, <b>says</b> <b>Steve</b> Roud: [...] "Large blackbirds, like crows and ravens, are viewed as evil in British folklore and white birds are viewed as good". In European folklore, the magpie is associated with a number of superstitions surrounding its reputation as an omen of ill fortune. In the 19th century book, A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar, a proverb concerning magpies is recited: [...] "A single magpie in spring, foul weather will bring". The book further explains that this superstition arises from the habits of pairs of magpies to forage together only when the weather is fine. In Scotland, a magpie near the window of the house is said to foretell death.|$|E

In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood (which portray him as a representative of the company), the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent, because it would be unexpected, according to Martin Agency's Steve Bassett. In 2010s commercials, the gecko's accent is more working-class, perhaps in an effort to further [...] "humanize" [...] him. [...] "As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better, we did a few things," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Steve</b> Bassett, creative director at The Martin Agency. [...] "We wanted to make him a little more guy-next-door. And he looks a lot more real than he's looked before."

Xander found Nicole at Daniel's grave, and held her at gunpoint. Nicole and Deimos Kiriakis, Xander's uncle who had previously visited him, made a deal to let him go if he didn't hurt Nicole; Xander agreed to their terms. Deimos was supposed to lead Xander into a trap that would send him back to prison, but Deimos helped Xander fake his death, believing Xander could be useful to him in the future and told him to escape to Europe.|$|E
