40|$|Testing {{concurrent}} {{programs is}} {{challenged by the}} interleaving explosion problem — the problem of exploring {{the large number of}} interleavings a program exhibits, even under a single test input. Rather than try all interleavings, we propose to test wisely: to exercise only those <b>schedules</b> <b>that</b> lead to interleavings that are typical error patterns. In particular, in this paper we select <b>schedules</b> <b>that</b> exercise patterns of interaction that correspond to atomicity violations. Given an execution of a program under a test harness, our technique is to algorithmically mine from the execution a small set of alternate <b>schedules</b> <b>that</b> cause atomicity violations. The program is then re-executed under these predicted atomicity-violating schedules, and verified by the test harness. The salient feature of our tool is the efficient algorithmic prediction and synthesis of alternate <b>schedules</b> <b>that</b> cover all possible atomicity violations at program locations. We implement the tool PENELOPE that realizes this testing framework and show that the monitoring, prediction, and rescheduling (with precise repro) are efficient and effective in finding bugs related to atomicity violations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of <b>scheduling</b> {{flexible}} plans <b>that</b> is plans that enable robots to exploit unexpected opportunities and permit dynamic rescheduling. Unfortunately, generating optimal flexible plans requires planning methods to compute schedules with the highest expected utility for huge state spaces [...] - a computational task that cannot be accomplished within the resource bounds set by robot problem solving. We propose PPSD as a scheduling technique for quickly generating "good" <b>schedules,</b> <b>that</b> is <b>schedules</b> <b>that</b> {{are not likely to}} cause behavior flaws. To expedite the generation of schedules, PPSD uses a heuristic <b>schedule</b> generator <b>that</b> might propose flawed <b>schedules.</b> To ensure <b>that</b> <b>schedules</b> are "good," PPSD then iteratively detects and eliminates schedule flaws. Detecting possible flaws requires PPSD to reason through the operation of flexible plans.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and {{keyboard}} player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he {{did not wish to}} continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, {{was in the process of}} setting up a grueling concert <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Albert Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his four}} {{consecutive}} championships with Simeon, Parker (and Chicago's Simeon) {{were compared to}} McClain (and Peoria's Manual). Peoria's Journal Star emphasized that McClain was 32–0 as a starter in IHSA play because in the 1994–97 time period the IHSA was only divided into two classes. Thus, Manual had to wade through an 8-round tournament instead of the 7-round modern 4-class format. However, Simeon won 6 of its 7 games in its final championship by more than 10 points, while Manual only won 3 of its 8 by such a margin. In the postgame press conference, Simeon Coach Smith emphasized that his team had to endure the pressure of playing a national <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> included games against elite teams in distant venues. Note, that with the 4-class system rather than the 2-class system of the past, the 2013 Class 3A IHSA champion was CPL runner-up Morgan Park, who split 2 neutral court 2013 games with Simeon. As noted above, Rose-era Simeon teams only won 2 championships in the 2-class era. Adding Parker's 55-11 start to a 33–1 junior year and a 30–3 senior season gives him a 118–15 legacy compared to Rose's 120–12.|$|E

5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led his brigade, which had spent much of the {{previous}} weeks in defensive lines, in an attack on Miteirya Ridge during which it achieved all of its objectives. In contrast to three months earlier at Ruweisat Ridge, he took care to establish his headquarters as far forward as possible prior to the commencement of the battle to minimise communication difficulties with the units of the brigade. Despite this, he still lost contact with the leading 23rd Battalion which quickly overwhelmed its opposition. In fact, the battalion had advanced so quickly that it arrived at its final objective so far ahead of <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> it believed it had only reached its first objective and so advanced even further. The battalion's commander blamed his unit's eagerness for a rapid advance on Kippenberger's inspirational pre-battle speech which particularly enthused his men.|$|E
5|$|The {{schedule}} was initially quite irregular, {{with the first}} two issues, in Summer and Winter 1950, followed almost a year later by a Winter 1951–52 issue. Spring and Autumn 1952 were followed by Spring 1953 and then another long delay to the seventh issue which was dated 1954, without a month or season given. The schedule became more regular thereafter, with May 1954 inaugurating a bimonthly <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> lasted till November 1955, except that September 1954 {{was followed by a}} December issue, and June 1955 was followed by September. After February, May and August 1955, the December 1956 issue began a regular bimonthly sequence that was marred only by the appearance of a November 1959 issue between the August and December issues. After the switch to paperback, the sequence ran as follows: June–July 1964, July–August 1964, September–October 1964, December 1964 – January 1965, January–February 1965, and then monthly from March 1965 to the end.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{previous}} Bond films, {{the production}} of Moonraker was not based at Pinewood, as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons, although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood, with the special effects team of Derek Meddings active in the UK throughout production. Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris. The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (approximately 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average). Much of the film {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida and Rio de Janeiro. Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979, a 28-week <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> had allowed Roger Moore only three days off. John Barry was again asked to score an Eon film.|$|E
5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
5|$|Big Brother 11 was {{broadcast}} on CBS from July 9, 2009 to September 15, 2009. This season lasted {{a total of}} 73 days, making it the third shortest season of the series to date. This season featured no changes to the <b>schedule</b> <b>that</b> {{was used in the}} previous edition, with episodes airing on Tuesdays, Thursday, and Sunday each week. The Thursday episode, which aired at 9 PM Eastern time, featured the live eviction and subsequent Head of Household competition taking place. During the live eviction, the show was hosted by Julie Chen. The Sunday episode, which aired at 8 PM Eastern time, featured the food competition and nomination ceremony, as well as some highlights from the previous days. The Tuesday episode featured the Power of Veto competition and the Power of Veto ceremony, along with more highlights of recent events in the game. Some changes to the scheduling format were made. Chima's expulsion from the game, for example, led to various changes in the formatting of the television broadcasts, and led to the cancellation of the upcoming Double Eviction week.

30|$|De Donder and Hindriks [15] and Curt et al.

Curt et al. [21] analyze the same problem for tax <b>schedules</b> <b>that</b> are not purely redistributive. For income distributions with the median less than the mean, in case a Condorcet winner exists then it implies maximum marginal progressivity. In the next theorem, we prove that, when a Condorcet winner does not exist, for sufficiently right-skewed income distribution functions, the least core is characterized by marginal progressivity as well (however, not necessarily maximal). The proof is for purely redistributive taxations, however it can be adapted for tax <b>schedules</b> <b>that</b> are not purely redistributive.|$|R
