30|$|To {{understand}} {{the system as}} a whole, relevant data need to be collected. Usually this information is obtained through <b>surveys</b> <b>that</b> are carried out at different places. The movement of cargo in a region can be captured basically from three types of freight <b>surveys</b> <b>that</b> complement each other (1) establishment <b>surveys</b> <b>that</b> target the producers and consumers of goods to estimate freight production and attraction inside the urban area; (2) distributor <b>surveys</b> <b>that</b> capture information on goods movements through intermediaries but sometimes are difficult to conduct because of the confidentiality of the data; and (3) carrier <b>surveys</b> <b>that</b> quantify freight patterns in terms of commercial vehicle flows in the transportation network [2]. Considering the information that can be captured from different type of surveys, professionals in charge of estimating freight demand in urban regions must identify the commercial characteristics of the city in order to select the best type of freight surveys to be conducted. It is important to note <b>that</b> typically one <b>survey</b> type cannot capture all the freight information in a region. For example, origin-destination surveys—which are the most common method to obtain information of truck travel patterns in a city—do not allow to draw a complete picture of all the freight patterns in a city because they miss freight data (e.g., traffic counts, freight generation) to represent the freight traffic flows on the transportation network.|$|R
5|$|During several {{independent}} {{field studies}} cracks and other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian and Saudi Arabian sides of the gulf. During a field <b>survey</b> <b>that</b> was done there in 1996, a series of cracks were discovered between 28°35' N and 29°05' N on the Saudi Arabian coast. A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority. The most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road.|$|E

The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking <b>survey</b> <b>that</b> showed not all voters knew how to vote for candidates of the new DPD, or were even aware it existed.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone <b>survey</b> <b>that</b> touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E

5|$|Human {{factors are}} the {{physical}} or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems {{as well as}} human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, {{and the consequences of}} these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors {{are more likely to have}} catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a <b>survey</b> <b>that</b> suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic <b>survey</b> <b>that</b> does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
