5|$|On July 3, 1863, {{reports of}} a <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> Confederate wagon train in the {{vicinity}} of Fairfield, Pennsylvania, attracted the attention of newly commissioned Union Brigadier General Wesley Merritt of the Reserve Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps. He ordered the 6th U.S. Cavalry under Major Samuel H. Starr to scout Fairfield and locate the wagons, resulting in the Battle of Fairfield.|$|E
50|$|The {{viscosity}} of gases is {{the result}} in the transfer of each molecule of gas as they pass each other from layer to layer. As gases tend to pass one another, the velocity, {{in the form of}} momentum, of the faster moving molecule speeds up the <b>slower</b> <b>moving</b> molecule. As the <b>slower</b> <b>moving</b> molecule passes the faster moving molecule, the momentum of the <b>slower</b> <b>moving</b> particle <b>slows</b> down the faster moving particle. The molecules continue to enact until frictional drag causes both molecules to equalize their velocities.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium is a {{radioactive}} actinide metal whose isotope, plutonium-239, {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary fissile isotopes (uranium-233 and uranium-235 are the other two); plutonium-241 is also highly fissile. To be considered fissile, an isotope's atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He lived long enough to see the theory of plate tectonics become widely accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E

5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are <b>slow,</b> <b>moving</b> at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E
5|$|As a {{commander}} Marlborough preferred battle over <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (particularly his carefully selected aides-de-camp such as Cadogan), {{as well as}} enjoying a close personal relationship with the talented Imperial commander, Prince Eugene, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often far ahead of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy's characteristics in battle. Marlborough {{was more likely to}} manoeuvre than his opponents, and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet the Duke qualifies more as a great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his predilection for fire, movement, and co-ordinated all-arms attacks, lay at the root of his great battlefield successes.|$|E
5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is thought to have been a <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or may have played a role in vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Wukong was a <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> {{tropical}} cyclone which produced torrential rains over Japan. The tenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Wukong developed {{out of a}} tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On August13, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the depression as a tropical storm. The storm traveled along a curving path south of Japan, absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Sonamu on August15 before turning towards the west. Wukong made landfall at peak intensity late on August17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū. The cyclone remained over land for about 24hours before moving out over the Sea of Japan. The storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating on August21. Due to the slow movement of the storm, it produced heavy rains, peaking at 516mm (20.3in). Two people were killed due to rough seas produced by the storm and three others were injured.|$|E
5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} from Narooma in {{southern}} New South Wales {{north to the}} Rocky River in Cape York, though it is uncommon in eastern Cape York. It lives in small, generally <b>slow</b> <b>moving,</b> streams to estuaries, as well as dune lagoons and salt marshes. It {{is also found in}} brackish and marine waters on some Queensland offshore islands such as Hinchinbrook Island, Lizard Island, Low Island and Dunk Island. It has been recorded as far as 300km (185mi) upstream in the Mary and Dawson Rivers in Queensland. Numbers can be prolific in some locations, such as the Mary River. Conversely it is uncommon in the Elliott and Kolan Rivers. Fish species it is commonly found with include Marjorie's hardyhead (Craterocephalus marjoriae), crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi), Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and western carp gudgeon (Hypseleotris klunzingeri).|$|E

5|$|The {{red maple}} can grow {{in a variety}} of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps. While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect, the red maple {{does not appear to have}} a preference. Its ideal {{conditions}} are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of <b>slow</b> <b>moving</b> streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern Michigan and New England, the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps. Additionally, Red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.|$|E

50|$|These units could thus be mobilized quickly, {{unlike the}} army, which was slower {{to recruit and}} <b>slower</b> <b>moving.</b> They were formed of {{soldiers}} on annual service, with an obligation to gather for brief training periods four times a year, and accounted in total for about 30,000 men.|$|R
40|$|Nine of {{the twelve}} known {{variants}} of human transferrin have been resolved {{by the action of}} neuraminidase into stepwise patterns of four additional <b>slower</b> <b>moving</b> components whose relative intensities depended upon the concentration of enzyme. These components appeared to represent the stepwise removal of the four sialic acid residues from the transferrin molecule, and at large enzyme concentrations, almost all of the transferrin was reduced to the position of the <b>slowest</b> <b>moving</b> component. In contrast, the electrophoretic mobilities of haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, and α 2 -macroglobulin showed a gradual decrease with increasing neuraminidase concentration. The transferrins of chimpanzees, rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys, and cattle were resolved by neuraminidase into two <b>slower</b> <b>moving</b> components. These experiments suggested that the primate and cattle transferrins contained only two sialic acid residues accessible to the enzyme. Transferrins C, B 2, and D 1 and a cynomolgus monkey transferrin were purified from serum by starch block electrophoresis and cellulose chromatography. Ultracentrifugal analysis could detect no difference in sedimentation rate between transferrin C, the primate transferrin, and neuraminidase-treated transferrin C. The human transferrins showed no variation in amino acid composition, but the cynomolgus transferrin was approximately 20 per cent higher in serine content and 50 per cent lower in glucosamine than human transferrin C. Reactions of antigenic identity were obtained among five human transferrin variants but a reaction of only partial identity was obtained between transferrin C and the cynomolgus transferrin. The transferrin pattern of cord blood showed a prominent band in the position of transferrin C, accompanied by four faint <b>slower</b> <b>moving</b> bands which coincided with the four transferrin components produced by the action of neuraminidase on transferrin C. The transferrin pattern of cerebrospinal fluid in individuals homozygous for serum transferrin C showed two principal components, one of which appeared to contain no sialic acid. Haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, and α 2 -macroglobulin were also present in cerebrospinal fluid...|$|R
