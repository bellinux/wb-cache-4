2500|$|While {{he wrote}} criticism, Rivette {{continued}} his filmmaking career; {{during the summer}} of 1952, he made his third short film, Le Divertissement. Charles Bitsch called it [...] "a Rohmer-esque Marivaudage between young men and women." [...] Rivette, an assistant to Jacques Becker and Jean Renoir, was a cinematographer on Truffaut's short film Une Visite and Rohmer's short Bérénice. Eager to make a feature film, he talked about elaborate adaptions of works by André Gide, Raymond Radiguet and Ernst Jünger. With financial support from Chabrol and producer Pierre Braunberger, Rivette made the 35mm short film Le Coup du Berger in 1956. Written by Rivette, Chabrol and Bitsch, the film is about a young girl who receives a mink coat from her lover and must hide it from her husband; <b>spoken</b> <b>commentary</b> by Rivette describes the action like moves in a chess game. Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Jean-Claude Brialy appeared in the film, with Godard, Truffaut, Bitsch and Robert Lachenay as extras. Shot in two weeks in Chabrol's apartment, the budget went entirely to purchasing film stock. It was distributed by Braunberger in 1957. Truffaut called Le Coup du berger the inspiration for him, Chabrol, Alain Resnais and Georges Franju to make their first films: [...] "It had begun. And it had begun thanks to Jacques Rivette. Of all of us, he was the most fiercely determined to move." [...] Rohmer praised the film's mise-en-scene and wrote that it had [...] "more truth and good cinema than in all the other French films released in the past year." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{temporal}} patterning {{and its relationship}} with discourse structure has received considerable attention within recent research on tense and aspect. Most analyses of spoken data involve 'narratives' of various types, while work on written texts has explored literary narrative as well as different types of journalistic text. With specific reference to sports journalism, a small of amount of corpus-based research {{has been carried out}} on macrostructural features and tense usage in journalistic sports reports. By contrast, there are very few linguistic analyses of <b>spoken</b> sports <b>commentaries,</b> although the literature on tense and aspect generally views live sports commentary as prototypical 'Current Report' and contains many anecdotal comments regarding the dominance of the present tense. Based on a transcribed and encoded corpus of television and radio rugby commentaries, and drawing on the vast body of work on tense and aspect in discourse, this thesis analyses the macro-structure of <b>spoken</b> sports <b>commentary</b> and proposes a framework that can capture the key global features of the discourse. It examines the temporal patterns attested and explores the link between macro-structure and temporal patterning. The investigation of temporal patterning focuses on tense usage (particularly of the present tense), but also expands into broader questions prevalent in current research around temporal cohesion, such as the role of temporal connectors, as well as the functions of distinctive elements of sports commentary such as temporal reminders. The discussion includes a detailed analysis of the temporal features of 'Current Report' sections of sports commentaries and proposes that 'Current Report' can be considered a discourse mode. with distinctive temporal properties. Finally, the thesis analyses the differences between radio, television and written sports commentaries, arguing that both oral media share a set of distinctive linguistic features which are very different from those of written sports reports.
