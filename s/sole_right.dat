5|$|The {{election}} {{resulted in}} Mugabe securing 56% {{of the vote}} to Tsvangerai's 42%. In {{the aftermath of the}} election Mugabe declared that the state-owned Grain Marketing Board had the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to import and distribute grain, with the state distributors giving food to ZANU-PF supporters while withholding it from those suspected of backing the MDC. In 2005, Mugabe instituted Operation Murambatsvina ("Operation Drive Out the Rubbish"), a project of forced slum clearance; a UN report estimated that 700,000 were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> {{to issue}} trading {{privileges}} anywhere in Albany County rested {{with the mayor}} and Common Council. Albany County encompassed all of Upstate New York north and west of Ulster County at that time, {{as well as the}} state of Vermont. All residents of New York, except those of Albany, were specifically banned from trading with any Iroquois nation, or with any other native tribe to the west, east, or north of the city of Albany, or with native tribes anywhere within Albany County.|$|E
5|$|In 115 BC {{the central}} government's mint was {{transferred}} from the Minister Steward's ministry to the park managed by the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks. In 113 BC the central government closed all commandery-level mints; private minting had previously been outlawed in 144 BC. The Superintendent's imperial mint in the park outside Chang'an had the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to issue coinage throughout the empire. However, Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25–57 AD) abolished the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks and revived his post annually during autumn to conduct a ritual sacrifice. The imperial mint became {{the responsibility of the}} Minister of Finance and the imperial park located outside Eastern-Han Luoyang was administered by a prefect.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the legislators}} would become {{prominent}} figures during the territorial years of Oregon. At first {{the body was}} a small committee of nine people, but the group was altered when the Organic Laws of Oregon were revised in 1845 with the legislative branch of the Provisional Government becoming the Oregon House of Representatives {{with a minimum of}} 13 members. Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, because it was in conflict with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E
5|$|The emperor, or huangdi, was {{the supreme}} {{head of state}} during the {{imperial}} era of China (221 BC – 1912), including the Song dynasty. He was a hereditary ruler who shared executive powers with civilian officials appointed to various levels of office according to their performance in bureaucratic examinations. The growing importance of the civilian bureaucracy and national gentry class during the Song dynasty led to a much more limited role for the emperor in shaping public policy, although he still maintained his autocratic authority. He had the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to establish new laws, although {{he was expected to}} respect legal precedents set forth by previous emperors of his dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The emperor, {{who enjoyed}} {{paramount}} social status, {{was the head}} of the government administration. His rule was virtually absolute, although civil officials, representing the competing interests of different state organs, scrutinized his decisions. Although the Grand Commandant had a nominal role as commander-in-chief, the emperor served as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The emperor had the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to appoint central government officials whose salary-rank was 600-dan or higher. The emperor also appointed the leading officials at the provincial, commandery, and county levels of government. Appointees to office were usually recommended men from the commanderies, family relatives of high officials, or student graduates of the Imperial University. This institution was established in 124 BC, and provided a Confucian-based education for those entering civil service.|$|E

5|$|When {{the emperor}} died without officially {{appointing}} a successor, his widow, the empress dowager, had the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to appoint {{one of the}} late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position. Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a father or brother, would assume control of the Imperial Secretariat. Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice and acceptance of the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also {{had the right to}} override his decisions. The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction—the consort clan— was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under house arrest.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli {{agreed to}} Wood's {{proposed}} changes, {{but before he}} could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since Thunderball, Kevin McClory had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with Sean Connery and novelist Len Deighton. McClory got wind of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's most {{powerful}} relative was the empress dowager, widow {{to the previous}} emperor and usually the natural mother of the emperor. If the grandmother of an emperor—the grand empress dowager—was still alive during his reign, she enjoyed a superior position over the empress dowager. Emperors often sought {{the approval of the}} empress dowager for their decisions. If an emperor was only a child, he acted merely as a figurehead while the empress dowager dominated court politics. She not only had the right to issue edicts and pardons, but if the emperor died without a designated heir, she had the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to appoint a new emperor. Below the empress dowager were the empress and imperial concubines. Although she was the wife of the emperor, the empress's position at court was not secure and she could be removed by the emperor. However, the empress did enjoy the submission of concubines as her subordinates, who advocated the elevation of their sons over the empress's at their own peril.|$|E
50|$|In 1892, Hjorth {{acquired}} <b>sole</b> <b>rights</b> {{to another}} Swedish invention, the Primus stove, patented by Frans Wilhelm Lindqvist. In 1918, Hjorth acquired the Primus factory on Lilla Essingen island in western Stockholm.|$|R
50|$|In 1711, {{there was}} a dispute over who had the rights to produce oysters in the two lucks, which went to court. John Redston and Edward Faulkner were farming them, with the {{permission}} of the land-owners. However, as a fisherman by the name of William Cave had been granted <b>sole</b> <b>rights</b> by the Borough of Newport to fish the whole of the River Medina, he believed that he also had the <b>sole</b> <b>rights</b> to the lucks as well. He confiscated 2000 oysters, as well as firing a warning shot over the head of one of Redston and Faulkner's workers.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the {{aforementioned}} operating companies each own concurrent {{rights to the}} Bell trademarks. Bell Canada retained <b>sole</b> <b>rights</b> to the marks in that country after its spinoff from AT&T in 1975.|$|R
5|$|While {{religion}} {{played a}} role in politics, politics also {{played a role}} in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to distribute sutras to the laity. In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative Inexhaustible Treasury, which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their banking practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Household (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given <b>sole</b> <b>right</b> to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|E
