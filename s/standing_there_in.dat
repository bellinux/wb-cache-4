500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Honey, the way {{you play}} guitar makes me feel so... makes me feel so...masochistic. The way you go down low deep into the neck... and I would do anything... and I would do anything. And Patty Hearst, you <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread. I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, {{what goes on in}} your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty? He said... he said... he said.... "Well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child. Now here she is, with a gun in her hand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... (He {{pauses and}} looks toward the doorway, right. DR. JONATHAN [...] <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> holding <b>in</b> his hand a yellow envelope. ASHER [...] starts forward.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I must have looked gaunt and ghastly <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could almost hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
60|$|Looking {{back from}} the turning, Felix saw him still <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} empty street.|$|E
60|$|Blinky was <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the starlight}} holding {{the girl in}} his arms. His head was bowed over her wan face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm with ye, lads!" [...] came a {{voice from}} behind them, and turning swiftly they beheld Sam Barringford <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> rifle <b>in</b> hand, and with his throat done up in a bandage.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{better come}} in," [...] said Hiram. [...] "It's no good <b>standing</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the cold." [...] He stood aside {{and the girl}} entered, swiftly, gratefully.|$|R
60|$|And quite {{suddenly}} {{he pulled the}} door open to disclose Giuliana <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> erect but <b>in</b> a listening attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} to do here on my brother's ground?" [...] again asked Sophy, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> her straw bonnet and pink cotton frock.|$|E
6000|$|The dreamer {{spoke to}} her: [...] "Who are you, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the {{darkness}} with those eyes that I can hardly {{bear to look}} at? Who are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not reply}} categorically. <b>Standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the {{sheltering}} dark, she said, [...] "Papa, I wasn't very candid with you, this afternoon. I am engaged to Mr. Burnamy." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{he opened}} the door to find his wife <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> dressed <b>in</b> her burial clothes, blood {{dripping}} from her finger but very much alive, he dropped dead to the floor. He was buried in the plot Marjorie had vacated.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Some day, thought I, I {{will have}} an {{inscription}} <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> right <b>in</b> {{the midst of the}} hollow. It came to me, if only this teeming world within knew of the full import of the moment, how furious its tumult would become! ...|$|R
60|$|He inquired for Miss Everdene. Liddy's manner was odd, {{but he did}} {{not notice}} it. She went <b>in,</b> leaving him <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> and <b>in</b> her absence the blind of the room {{containing}} Bathsheba was pulled down. Boldwood augured ill from that sign. Liddy came out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why else, indeed?" [...] {{returned}} Asad, {{and then}} he swung upon Oliver <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the entrance of the}} poop-house. [...] "What sayest thou, Sakr-el-Bahr?" [...] he appealed to him.|$|E
6000|$|Everyone wheeled {{round and}} stared at us <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the shadow of the}} gateway tunnel, for the sun behind us was still low. My word, how they did stare! A voice cried: ...|$|E
60|$|The mysterious Marquis {{lifted his}} {{hands with a}} desperate gesture. He was a strange {{scarecrow}} <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the sun with half his old face peeled off, and half another face glaring and grinning from underneath.|$|E
60|$|But looking round, he saw {{her still}} <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> half buried <b>in</b> parcels, gazing after him. Raising his hat, he turned into the High Street towards home....|$|R
6000|$|... 'You look well <b>{{standing}}</b> <b>there,</b> singing <b>in</b> God's holy house,' {{came the}} loud, angry female shout. Everybody turned electrified. A stoutish, red-faced {{woman in a}} black bonnet was standing up denouncing the soloist. Almost fainting with shock, the congregation realized it. 'You look well, don't you, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> singing solos <b>in</b> God's holy house, you, Goodall. But I said I'd shame you. You look well, bringing your young woman here with you, don't you? I'll let her know who she's dealing with. A scamp as won't take the consequences of what he's done.' The hard-faced, frenzied woman turned {{in the direction of}} Fanny. 'That's what Harry Goodall is, if you want to know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Smashed? Ah, {{what did}} you do that for?' Mrs. Capadose asked, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> before him <b>in</b> all her clear, rich beauty. Now that she looked at him she was impenetrable.|$|R
60|$|Then all passed, and he {{saw them}} mighty as ever, but deserted, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the desert, the monuments of a {{forgotten}} greatness, till at length a new people came and stripped off their marble coverings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I {{should never have}} left you, Craig dear. I know that you never saw that girl before in your life--but I {{did not know it}} until I saw you <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> the wheat, this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At Lady Holmhurst's. Come to-morrow morning; I have {{something}} to tell you," [...] she answered, and in another minute the carriage was gone, leaving him <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a condition of mind which really [...] "can be better imagined than described." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps he}} doesn't," [...] said Lanigan; [...] "but if I were you, Mrs. Petter, I {{would take him}} out a shawl or {{something}} to put over his shoulders. He oughtn't to be <b>standing</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the night wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|Two {{men were}} <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> hat <b>in</b> hand {{whispering}} to the butler. The butler, leaving them, {{went into the}} dining-room--came out again with Sir Patrick--and said to the two men, [...] "Step this way, please." [...] The two men came out into the light. Murdoch, the station-master; and Duncan, the valet! News of Anne! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{eyed the}} jug. Uncle Tom's {{photograph}} {{had fallen into}} the fender, and it was <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> right out <b>in</b> the open, where Gussie couldn't have helped seeing it. Mercifully, it was empty now.|$|R
60|$|Valerie {{looked at}} her enemy, and then her eyes strayed round the room and took stock of the men <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> silence, of the Abbot who still {{remained}} at the table-head, a pale, scarce-interested spectator of this odd scene.|$|E
60|$|There he was, Frank Gresham himself <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> her {{immediate}} presence, beautiful as Apollo. Her next thought {{was how she}} might escape from out of his arms. How it happened that she had fallen into them, she never knew.|$|E
60|$|Her {{lips parted}} {{as though in}} an {{answering}} greeting, but it was inaudible. As I looked round {{at the top of}} the street I saw her still <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the little flood of yellow light, gazing across towards the old market-hall.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{was about}} to speak when a {{footstep}} sounded in the hall, and {{a knock on the}} door followed. Sam opened the portal, to behold Flockley <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> hat <b>in</b> hand. The dudish student was as white as the wall, his clothing looked dishevelled, and his shoes were un-blacked, a great contrast to the Flockley of old.|$|R
60|$|The room seemed {{suddenly}} to become darker. He {{raised his head}} and remained staring, like a man who looks upon some impossible vision. Lady Letitia, bare-headed, a little paler than usual, a little, it seemed to him, more human, was <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> looking <b>in</b> upon him. He managed to rise to his feet, but he had no words.|$|R
6000|$|WANDA {{throws up}} {{the window as}} if to call to him, checks herself, [...] closes it and runs to the door. She opens it, but recoils into [...] the room. KEITH is <b>standing</b> <b>there.</b> He comes <b>in.</b>|$|R
