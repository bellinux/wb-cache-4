25|$|Reconciling with Lizaveta Prokofyevna, the Prince {{visits the}} Yepanchins at their dacha. He is {{beginning}} {{to fall in love}} with Aglaya, and she likewise appears to be fascinated by him, though she often mocks or angrily reproaches him for his naiveté and excessive humility. Myshkin joins Lizaveta Prokofyevna, her daughters and Yevgeny Pavlovich for a walk to the park to hear the music. While listening to the high-spirited conversation and watching Aglaya in a kind of daze, he notices Rogozhin and Nastassya Filippovna in the crowd. Nastassya Filippovna again addresses herself to Yevgeny Pavlovich, and in the same jolly tone as before loudly informs him that his uncle—a wealthy and respected old man from whom he is expecting a large inheritance—has shot himself and that a huge sum of government money is missing. Yevgeny Pavlovich <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in shock as Lizaveta Prokofyevna makes a hurried exit with her daughters. Nastassya Filippovna hears an officer friend of Yevgeny Pavlovich suggest that a whip is needed for women like her, and she responds by grabbing a riding-whip from a bystander and striking the officer across the face with it. He tries to attack her but Myshkin restrains him, for which he is violently pushed. Rogozhin, after making a mocking comment to the officer, leads Nastassya Filippovna away. The officer recovers his composure, addresses himself to Myshkin, politely confirms his name, and leaves.|$|E
500|$|Sophie Muller {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Love Is a Camera", which {{was released on}} 30 May 2014. The video commences with Ellis-Bextor, who impersonates an [...] "eerie temptress" [...] {{dressed in a black}} [...] "ankle-length, lace-trimmed" [...] gown, walking and dancing slowly inside a classical mansion. Exploring the divisions of her house, she starts adjusting picture frames, which hold monochromatic photographs of individuals. One of those pictures depicts a short-haired woman, dressed in white—also played by Ellis-Bextor—who starts mimicking the song, whilst in the frame. The story of the woman in the frame is told throughout the video—after crossing a field, she finds the mansion. Her photograph is taken by the dressed-in-black Ellis-Bextor, and she is trapped in the frame. Whilst walking down a staircase, the [...] "temptress" [...] passes by a bearded man who <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> interestingly. Both enter the mansion, where they drink; the dressed-in-black Ellis-Bextor holds his hand. She convinces him to take his photograph, and after realizing it is a trap, he tries to escape. However, the [...] "temptress" [...] finds him running and takes his photograph; trapping him in a frame as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on her knees and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E

2500|$|Constable Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is Dog River's ambitious, {{sometimes}} neurotic junior police officer. Before {{becoming a}} police officer, she ranked fifth in Canada {{in the sport}} of static apnea, with a personal best of more than six minutes. She's a very good cook, but does not like {{to bring it up}} for fear it will stereotype her. She does not want to admit that she does not know how to ride a bike. She is also at least 10 years younger than most of the other characters, turning 30 in the sixth season. Karen possesses a variety of skills including cooking, martial arts, drums, drawing, and table hockey; but when she wins a raffle in the sixth season, she says it's the first time she ever won anything. She tends to take her police position very seriously, unlike her partner Davis, and treats even the most minor problem officially. On one occasion, when she mentions to Davis that she feels she has a good lead on a cold case, he <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dumbfounded and asks [...] "Why?" [...] Karen frequently becomes annoyed with Davis' willingness to obey the mayor in everything and bend rules. They differ greatly on their views of what a police officer should portray; on one occasion, Karen states that [...] "a police officer should be respected by the community", to which Davis casually replies [...] "Who said that?" [...] Many episodes see them engaged in petty disputes and going to great lengths to one-up each other. Despite their differences, Karen and Davis get along well although they don't spend much time together outside of work. In the episode [...] "Hook, Line and Sinker" [...] Karen goes fishing with Hank and is seduced by his [...] "sexy fish talk". After the end of the series, she falls in love and marries; in , Karen's husband {{is said to be a}} soldier stationed off the Mediterranean coast, and they are expecting their first child.|$|E

But this morning I thought--well--I thought: 'You're her father. It's time she was getting used to you.' So I let them be a minute; and when I came back--I was only just across to the bathroom--he was comin' out lookin' quite fierce and white, and baby--oh, screamin'! And except for sleepin', she's hardly stopped cryin' since." ...|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE. John, am I to go? {{or are you}} to keep me on? [She is now {{a little}} bundle near his feet.] I'm willing to stay because I'm useful to you, if it can't be for a better reason. [His hand feels for her, and the bundle wriggles nearer.] It's nothing unusual I've done, John. Every man who is high up loves {{to think that he}} has done it all himself; and the wife smiles, and lets it go at that. It's our only joke. Every woman knows that. [He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in hopeless perplexity.] Oh, John, if only you could laugh at me.|$|E

6000|$|Slowly {{the knives}} and forks sink from the upright. Down they get (Bob and Barbara), hold out hands stiffly; {{back again to}} their chairs, staring between the resumed mouthfuls. [But this we'll skip; ornaments, curtains, trefoil china plate, yellow oblongs of cheese, white squares of biscuit--skip--oh, but wait! Halfway through luncheon one of those shivers; Bob <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> spoon in mouth. [...] "Get on with your pudding, Bob;" [...] but Hilda disapproves. [...] "Why should she twitch?" [...] Skip, skip, till we reach the landing on the upper floor; stairs brass-bound; {{linoleum}} worn; oh, yes! little bedroom {{looking out over the}} roofs of Eastbourne--zigzagging roofs like the spines of caterpillars, this way, that way, striped red and yellow, with blue-black slating]. Now, Minnie, the door's shut; Hilda heavily descends to the basement; you unstrap the straps of your basket, lay on the bed a meagre nightgown, stand side by side furred felt slippers. The looking-glass--no, you avoid the looking-glass. Some methodical disposition of hat-pins. Perhaps the shell box has something in it? You shake it; it's the pearl stud there was last year--that's all. And then the sniff, the sigh, the sitting by the window. Three o'clock on a December afternoon; the rain drizzling; one light low in the skylight of a drapery emporium; another high in a servant's bedroom--this one goes out. That gives her nothing to look at. A moment's blankness--then, what are you thinking? (Let me peep across at her opposite; she's asleep or pretending it; so what would she think about sitting at the window at three o'clock in the afternoon? Health, money, hills, her God?) Yes, sitting on {{the very edge of the}} chair looking over the roofs of Eastbourne, Minnie Marsh prays to God. That's all very well; and she may rub the pane too, as though to see God better; but what God does she see? Who's the God of Minnie Marsh, the God of the back streets of Eastbourne, the God of three o'clock in the afternoon? I, too, see roofs, I see sky; but, oh, dear--this seeing of Gods! More like President Kruger than Prince Albert--that's the best I can do for him; and I see him on a chair, in a black frock-coat, not so very high up either; I can manage a cloud or two for him to sit on; and then his hand trailing in the cloud holds a rod, a truncheon is it?--black, thick, thorned--a brutal old bully--Minnie's God! Did he send the itch and the patch and the twitch? Is that why she prays? What she rubs on the window is the stain of sin. Oh, she committed some crime! ...|$|E
