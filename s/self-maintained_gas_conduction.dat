In this work, the architecture of hen's eggshell at different length scales has been systematically investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and environmental SEM (ESEM). It is found that the skeleton of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) has hierarchical structures at nano- to micro-scales: primary nano-particles of ~ 10 nm loosely congregate giving a porous and rough texture, and compose the upper-level morphologies including submicro spheres, nano-rods, rhombohedral-cleavage pattern and slices, which are elaborately arranged in a surface layer, palisade layer and mammillary layer along the radial direction. Accordingly, the pore system exhibits a three-level hierarchy, namely nano-scale pores (between nano-rods and primary nano-particles), submicro-scale pores ("bubble pores") and micro-scale pores (opening of "gas pores"). Further investigation shows that hen's eggshell regulates <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> through adjusting the sizes and numbers of submicro-scale "bubble pores". Based on our observations, a new description of hen's eggshell is presented, which amends the conventional view of micro-scale, straight and permeating "gas pores", and reveals the role of hierarchical pores in <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> and contamination resistance.

40|$|Simple {{analytical}} {{methods have been}} employed for heat transfer analysis of experimental data obtained through calorimetric investigations on multilayer insulation (MLI). Sectional heat transfer analysis {{has shown that the}} effective thermal conductivity of the MLI varies from section to section of the insulation structure and it has a peak which lies between the middle and warm boundary regions of the MLI. This could be attributed to a peak in residual <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> in this region. The theoretical estimation of heat flux through MLI, using a simple analytical model, is also discussed in this paper. This model takes into consideration the non-linear temperature profile of the insulation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} {{to gain a better understanding}} of the various mechanisms of heat transfer through fibrous materials and to gain insight into how fill-gas pressure influences the effective thermal conductivity. By way of first principles and some empiricism, two mathematical models are constructed to correlate experimental data. The data are obtained from a test series measuring the effective thermal conductivity of Nomex using a two-sided guarded hot-plate heater apparatus. Tests are conducted for certain mean temperatures and fill-gases over a range of pressures varying from vacuum to atmospheric conditions. The models are then evaluated to determine their effectiveness in representing the effective thermal conductivity of a fibrous material. The models presented herein predict the effective thermal conductivity of Nomex extremely well. Since the influence of <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> is determined to be the most influential component in predicting the effective thermal conductivity of a fibrous material, an improved representation of <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> is developed. Finally, some recommendations for extension to other random-oriented fiber materials are made concerning the usefulness of each model depending on their advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|Freeze-drying {{is often}} used in {{manufacture}} of pharmaceuticals to remove a solvent {{in such a way}} that the sensitive molecular structure of the active substance of a drug is least disturbed, and to provide a sterile powder that can be quickly and completely rehydrated. In this work heat transfer rates in a laboratory-scale freeze-dryer have been measured to investigate the contribution of different heat transfer modes. Pure water was partially dried under low-pressure conditions and sublimation rates were determined gravimetrically. The heat transfer rates were observed to be independent of the separation distance between a product vial and a dryer shelf and linearly dependent on the pressure in the free molecular limit. However, under higher pressures the heat transfer rates were independent of pressure and inversely proportional to the separation distance. Previous heat transfer studies in conventional freeze-drying cycles have attributed a dominant portion of the total heat transfer to radiation, the rest to conduction, whereas the convection has been found insignificant. While the measurements revealed the significance of the radiative and <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> components, the convective component was found to be comparable to the <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> contribution at pressures greater than 100 mTorr. The current investigation suggests that the convective component of the heat transfer cannot be ignored at typical laboratory-scale freeze-drying conditions...|$|R

40|$|An {{infrared}} (IR) detector {{is simply}} a transducer of radiant energy, converting radiant energy into a measurable form. Since radiation does not rely on visible light, it offers the possibility of seeing in the dark or through obscured conditions, by detecting the IR energy emitted by objects. One of the prime applications of IR detector systems for military use is in target acquisition and tracking of projectile systems. The IR detectors also have great potential in commercial market. Typically, IR detectors perform best when cooled to cryogenic temperatures {{in the range of}} nearly 120 K. However, the necessity to operate in such cryogenic regimes makes the application of IR detectors extremely complex. Further, prior to proceeding on to a full blown transient thermal analysis it is worthwhile to perform a steady-state numerical analysis for ascertaining the effect of variation in viz., material, <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> coefficient, h, emissivity, ε, on the temperature profile along the cryo chamber length. This would enable understanding the interaction between the cryo chamber and its environment. Hence, the present work focuses on the development of steady-state numerical models for thermal analysis of IR cryo chamber using MATLAB.

30|$|Nowadays, vacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIPs) {{are regarded as}} one of the optimum thermal adiabatic materials for the energy conservation purpose on the market. The thermal insulation performances observed, even ten times better than common heat insulation materials can be achieved by applying VIPs, resulting in a great potential for the reduction of energy loss in thermal space with slim exterior-protected walls (Fricke et al. 2008; Baetens 2010; Nussbaumer et al. 2006; Nussbaumer et al. 2005; Brunner et al. 2012; Caps et al. 2001). The flat VIPs contain a porous core material which withstands the atmospheric air pressure, a gas-tight barrier envelope that is optimized for low air & moisture leakage rate and for a long service life to maintain the internal vacuum level, and getter or gas absorption materials, if necessary, to absorb internal gas from leakage or other sources. That is, the VIPs make use of vacuum to suppress heat transfer due to rarefied gaseous conduction (Bouquerel et al. 2012 a; Bouquerel et al. 2012 b; Alam et al. 2011). So the thermal adiabatic property of VIPs dramatically depends on the core materials and the internal gas pressure. The porous materials, such as, micro-open foam, nano-structured power and fine fiber, are commonly used as core materials of VIPs, which are easily evacuated and have minimum thermal conduction effect (Kwon et al. 2009). The heat transfer processing in VIPs is via solid <b>conduction,</b> rarefied <b>gas</b> <b>conduction,</b> radiation and convection occurring at interface of gas and solid wall which is nearly zero, is always ignored in calculation. The solid conduction and radiation depends on the structure, the porosity and properties of core materials, while the <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> by the residual gases embraced in the caves depends on the internal gas pressure which maybe increased with time. So the ETC. of VIPs must be function of the variables mentioned above.|$|R

The thermal conductivity of the insulation can then be estimated at any temperature and pressure in any gaseous media. The methodology was validated by comparing estimated thermal conductivities with published data on a rigid high-temperature silica reusable surface insulation tile.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for computing the effective thermal conductivity of a rigid fibrous refractory insulation. The insulation is modeled as a 3 -dimensional Cartesian network of thermal conductance. The values and volume distributions of the conductance {{are assigned to}} reflect the physical properties of the insulation, its constituent fibers, and any permeating gas. The effective thermal conductivity is computed by considering the simultaneous energy transport by solid <b>conduction,</b> <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> and radiation through a cubic volume of model insulation; thus the coupling between heat transfer modes is retained (within the simplifications inherent to the model), rather than suppressed by treating these heat transfer modes as independent. The model takes into account insulation composition, density and fiber anisotropy, {{as well as the}} geometric and material properties of the constituent fibers. A relatively good agreement, between calculated and experimentally derived thermal conductivity values, is obtained for a variety of rigid fibrous insulations...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to {{conventional}} HWCVD, the power {{consumption in the}} iCVD process is dominated by heat conduction rather than radiation. This {{is due to the}} fact that while the typical wire temperature for HWCVD is about 1750 – 2200 °C, for iCVD the temperature is only 250 – 500 °C. Typical deposition pressures are in the transition regime between the collision free regime, where the conduction is pressure dependent, and the collision mediated regime, where the conduction is pressure independent. The power loss due to heat conductivities of molecular nitrogen, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and tert-butylperoxide (TBPO) gases have been determined experimentally for these pressure regimes. The necessary power input to the filaments can be explained to be due to mainly heat dissipation by radiation and by <b>gas</b> <b>conduction.</b> This means that the dissociation process requires only very little power, about 2 % of the total power consumption in a typical iCVD process...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to describe the heat flux through multilayer insulation (MLI).

The model describes the MLI behaviour considering a layer-to-layer approach and is based on an electrical analogy, in which the three heat transfer modes are treated as parallel thermal impedances. The values of each of the transfer mode vary from layer to layer, although the total heat flux remains constant across the whole MLI blanket. The model enables the optimisation of the insulation with regard to different MLI parameters, such as residual gas pressure, number of layers and boundary temperatures.

Because human diseases are tightly connected with regional immunity, researchers have recently begun {{to focus on the}} regional immunity of organs such as the lung, intestine, liver, and skin. The lung is an open organ that is involved in <b>gas</b> <b>conduction</b> and exchange. Approximately 8, 000 to 9, 000 liters of air are breathed into the lung every day. Compared with the gut and the skin, the lung has a wider surface area, up to 90  m 2. A single layer of pulmonary epithelial cells covers the alveoli (Kopf et al., 2015). Because of these characteristics, the lung is constantly exposed to environmental stressors, such as pathogens, allergens, and airborne toxins, e.g., cigarette smoke. In the battle between the mucosal immune cells and the invaders, the innate immune cells are the first line of defense, fortifying the trenches. The innate immune cells in the lung mainly comprise lung-resident macrophages, lung-resident dendritic cells (DCs) (Holt et al., 2008; Kopf et al., 2015), and emerging sets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (Spits and Di Santo, 2011; Spits and Cupedo, 2012; Eberl et al., 2015).|$|R

Heated AFM cantilevers were developed for high-density data storage, where the heated cantilever tip can form and detect 20 nm indents made in a thermoplastic polymer. The scan height of the cantilever heater platform is typically near 500 nm, but could be made much smaller to improve reading sensitivity. Under atmospheric conditions the continuum models used in previous studies to model the gas phase heat transfer are invalid for the smallest operating heights.

An array of small support pillars separates the sheets; fused solder glass forms the edge seal.

Infrared thermography was used to analyze the thermal performance of prototype vacuum glazings, and, for comparison, atmospheric pressure superwindows. Research focused on mitigating the edge effects of vacuum glazings through the use of insulating trim, recessed edges, and framing materials.

The hot gas remains in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, at approximately the virial temperature of the dark matter halo. It is heated by compression and shock dissipation and is cooled by bremsstrahlung emission and conductive losses into the cool clouds. The cool fragments are photoionized and heated by the extragalactic UV background and nearby massive stars. The smallest clouds are evaporated due to conductive heat transfer from the hot gas. All are subject to disruption due to hydrodynamic instabilities. They also gain mass due to collisions and mergers and condensation from the hot <b>gas</b> due to <b>conduction.</b> The size distribution of the fragments in turn determines the rate and efficiency of star formation during the early phase of galactic evolution. We have performed one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the hot and cool gas. The cool clouds are assumed to follow a power-law size distribution, and fall into the galactic potential, subject to drag from the hot gas. The relative amounts of the hot and cool gas is determined by the processes discussed above, and star formation occurs at a rate sufficient to maintain the cool clouds at 10 $^ 4 $ K.

These processes have been investigated using thermal analyses, optical and electronic microscopies, x-ray diffraction, as well as other techniques. Properties of the reacting feed, such as heat conductivity and density, were measured as functions of temperature. Investigating the structure of quenched cold caps produced in a laboratory-scale melter complemented the crucible studies. The cold cap consists of two main layers. The top layer contains solid particles dissolving in the glass-forming melt and open pores through which gases are escaping. The bottom layer contains bubbly melt or foam where bubbles coalesce into larger cavities that move sideways and release the gas to the atmosphere. The feed-to-glass conversion became sufficiently understood for representing the cold-cap processes via mathematical models. These models, which comprise heat transfer, mass transfer, and reaction kinetics models, have been developed with the final goal to relate feed parameters to the rate of glass melting...|$|R
