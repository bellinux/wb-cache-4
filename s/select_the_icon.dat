40|$|Brain {{computer}} interface systems use brain {{signals to}} enable the control of external devices, such as: wheelchairs, communicators, neuro-prosthesis, among others; in people with severe motor disabilities. In this study two young men with motor disabilities were trained {{to learn how to}} control a brain computer interface (BCI) using the P 300 evoked potential recorded by electroencephalography (EEG). This interface enables the verbal communication through a stimulation matrix (4 x 3 rows and columns) that contains the picture of current football players and a sound related to each one which reproduced the name of them. Initially, we did the preparation stage that allowed the users to learn how to control the BCI. After this, the real probes were performed in two stages: the training tests and the online tests, where <b>the</b> participant could <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> that he wanted through his brain signals. The average percentages of success for each participant were: 95 % and 85 %, respectively. The average time for an icon selection was 36 seconds (i. e. 1. 67 letters/minute) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sophisticated}} software {{written by}} John Ridges for this synthesizer {{was the first}} to implement graphical entry for a personal computer music product. At the time, his music entry program was the largest Assembly Language program available for the Apple II (even larger than the entire Applesoft BASIC language interpreter), {{and one of the few}} programs to utilize Apple's hi-resolution graphics. It was also perhaps the first software for an Apple computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI) with icons and pointing elements (the [...] "IMP" [...] portion of WIMP interfaces); several years ahead of Apple's Macintosh. Since the Apple II had no mouse, the GUI was implemented using the Apple's [...] "game paddles"; one moved an arrow to <b>select</b> <b>the</b> desired <b>icon,</b> and <b>the</b> other moved <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>icon</b> to <b>the</b> desired position on the musical staff on the screen display. When entering a musical note, the sound of the note was simultaneously played by the synthesizer for confirmation that the correct pitch had been selected.|$|R
50|$|An artist, song, or mood can be {{excluded}} from playing entirely. Within the section located directly under the music player, titled “We recommend you,” listeners can indicate which songs, artists, or moods to add or remove from their station by <b>selecting</b> <b>the</b> gray <b>icon</b> directly to <b>the</b> right of the words “We recommend you.” This brings up a search bar where listeners can type {{in the name of}} a song, artist, or mood that can then either be added in order to provide variety to the listener’s station, or excluded from their station entirely.|$|R
5000|$|Legacy Amiga Icons {{can have}} two-state icons, using two {{different}} bitmap images. The first bitmap contains {{the data of}} the [...] "quiet" [...] icon, {{also known as the}} [...] "quiet state" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> <b>The</b> second bitmap image contains data of the [...] "selected" [...] state of <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> When <b>the</b> user clicks on an icon and activates it, then <b>the</b> quiet <b>icon</b> bitmap data is suddenly replaced by <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>icon</b> bitmap data. Such behaviour gives <b>the</b> Amiga <b>icons</b> <b>the</b> effect of moving cartoons. In case this second bitmap does not exist in the [...] ".info" [...] file (it is not mandatory to create both bitmaps), then an inverse color effect is used when <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> is <b>selected.</b>|$|R
50|$|Plaza México has {{a unique}} {{architectural}} recreation of Mexican regional and national <b>icons.</b> <b>The</b> architecture is based off traditional Mexican towns and contains a variety of Mexican cultural symbols from different eras. The Korean owners hired two Mexican public relations coordinators that are highly knowledgeable and passionate about Mexican national culture to <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>icons,</b> cultural symbols and events that are portrayed. <b>The</b> coordinators also <b>selected</b> unique types of construction materials to build Plaza México {{in order to produce}} quality and Mexican authenticity. The architectural decorations like the plaza, kiosk, fountains and monuments are similar to that of many Mexican cities. For example, Plaza México has replicas of the Angel of Independence of México City and the kiosk of the Zócalo of San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato. The plaza was reproduced with characteristics based on the appearance of the Palace of Jalisco at Guadalajara. The plaza’s pavement is made of adoquín stone and the benches are made of crafted iron, like the ones found in the provinces of México. Plaza México was actually constructed using original materials from México such as stone from Zacatecas and talavera from Puebla. The mall is physically structured with open streets and a plaza to reconstruct the environment as a traditional Mexican town where the visitors can walk around or participate in cultural and recreational events just like in México.|$|R
50|$|The {{interactive}} Map Viewer {{shows the}} locations of geo-tagged project sites, research studies, and documents gathered from across the world. More than 2100 items appear on the map, {{a subset of the}} information available in the Knowledge Base. Users may interact with the map with zooming and panning functions, facet box selection, and a keyword search. <b>Selecting</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> will reveal a specific page with more in-depth information.

50|$|The PlayStation 3 {{uses the}} XrossMediaBar (XMB) as its {{graphical}} user interface, {{which is also}} used in the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console, a variety of Sony BRAVIA HDTVs, Blu-ray disc players and many more Sony products. XMB displays <b>icons</b> horizontally across <b>the</b> screen that be seen as categories. Users can navigate through them using {{the left and right}} buttons of the D-pad, which move <b>the</b> <b>icons</b> forward or back across the screen, highlighting just one at a time, as opposed to using any kind of pointer to select an option. When one category is selected, there are usually more specific options then available to select that are spread vertically above and below <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>icon.</b> Users may navigate among these options by using the up and down buttons of the D-pad.|$|R
40|$|How do {{you make}} a {{decision}} {{if you do not}} know the rules of the game? Models of sensory decision-making suggest that choices are slow if evidence is weak, but they may only apply if the subject knows the task rules. Here, we asked how the learning of a new rule influences neuronal activity in the visual (area V 1) and frontal cortex (area FEF) of monkeys. We devised a new icon-selection task. On each day, the monkeys saw 2 new icons (small pictures) and learned which one was relevant. We rewarded eye movements to a saccade target connected to <b>the</b> relevant <b>icon</b> with a curve. Neurons in visual and frontal cortex coded the monkey's choice, because the representation of <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> curve was enhanced. Learning delayed the neuronal selection signals and we uncovered the cause of this delay in V 1, where learning to <b>select</b> <b>the</b> relevant <b>icon</b> caused an early suppression of surrounding image elements. These results demonstrate that the learning of a new rule causes a transition from fast and random decisions to a more considerate strategy that takes additional time and they reveal the contribution of visual and frontal cortex to the learning proces...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} optimal user interface design practices for differing age demographics and mobile operating systems. Specifically, users at three different age groups were administered a test to gauge their preference of mobile app <b>icons.</b> <b>The</b> style of the first set of icons, commonly known as flat design, was minimal and simple, with few colors, bevels or gradients. The second style of icons was a more realistic and detailed style known as skeuomorphic design. Users <b>selected</b> <b>the</b> preferred <b>icons,</b> and then took a brief survey to gauge their opinion. After the data was collected, it was analyzed to screen for trends among the users’ ages and mobile operating system. The results have helped identify the importance of age consideration when developing mobile applications for particular audiences. It was found that at 27 to 45 years of age, users tend to strongly prefer a flat design approach to mobile application icons with a strong majority of 65 % choosing flat design over skeuomorphic design. A significant 68 % of users with Google Android phones preferred flat design as well...|$|R
40|$|While most e-mail clients allow {{users to}} file {{messages}} into folders, the process they {{must go through}} to file each message is often tedious and slow. For each message, the user must first decide which folder is most appropriate. Then, the user must inform the e-mail reader of that choice by <b>selecting</b> <b>the</b> appropriate <b>icon</b> or menu item from among what is typically a set of several dozen choices. The combined effort of choosing a folder and conveying that choice to the application often discourages users from filing their mail, resulting in unmanageable inboxes that contain hundreds or even thousands of unfiled messages. SwiftFile encourages users to file their mail by simplifying the task. Using an adaptive classifier, it predicts the three folders that {{are most likely to}} be appropriate for a given message and provides shortcut buttons that permit the user to effortlessly file it into a predicted folder. For typical users, SwiftFile's predictions are accurate over 80 % to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{cultural}} characteristics exert a strong influence on icon preference and recognition. Nevertheless, no study has been done to investigate the Korean cultural context in icon design. This study <b>selected</b> <b>the</b> most preferred <b>icon</b> among newly designed cultural icons based on Korean mental schemas for this study and two prevalent word processing software icons (one from a global brand and the other from a local brand) for the ten most popular word processing functions. The results showed that culturalization or localization were necessary to help enhance icon recognition because four new Korean cultural contexts based on Korean mental schemas were collected in this study. However, <b>the</b> newly designed <b>icons</b> with <b>the</b> most prevalent Korean mental schemas were not necessarily <b>selected</b> as <b>the</b> most preferred <b>icons</b> because of <b>the</b> training effect from long-term usage or the repetitive usage effect. When recognizing icons, subjects seemed to prefer a familiar icon, even in preference to a new one with a better representation of their mental model.
