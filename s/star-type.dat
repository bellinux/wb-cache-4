Only one ferrite rod is required to be inserted in our structure. Firstly, the performances of circulator based on the <b>star-type,</b> circle, and square ferrite rod are compared, showing that the circulator with the <b>star-type</b> ferrite rod performs {{better than the other}} two ones. And then, based on the <b>star-type</b> ferrite rod circulator, four cases of improvement, in which the background rods around the center ferrite rod are replaced respectively by the backward-triangle, forward-triangle, backward-semicircle, and forward-semicircle rods, are investigated to modulate the coupling between the center magneto-optical micro-cavity and the corresponding waveguides. The results show that, with proper parameters, all the four cases can greatly improve the output properties of the circulator, and different cases have its own advantages. The mechanism behind these improvements is also discussed. Finite-element method is used to calculate the characteristics of the circulator and Nelder-Mead optimization method is employed to obtain the optimized parameters. The ideas presented here are useful for designing broadband, low insertion loss, and high-isolation circulators which have potential application in integrated photonic crystal devices.

Objects are repre-sented through flexible <b>star-type</b> planar arrangements of binary local fea-tures {{which are in}} turn <b>star-type</b> planar arrangements of oriented edges. Candidate locations are detected over a range of scales and other de-formations, using a generalized Hough transform. The flexibility of the arrangements provides the required invariance. Training involves select-ing {{a small number of}} stable local features from a predefined pool, which are well localized on registered examples of the object. Training there-fore requires only small data sets. The parallel architecture is constructed so that the Hough transform associated with any object can be imple-mented without creating or modifying any connections. The different ob-ject representations are learned and stored in a central module. When one of these representations is evoked, it “primes ” the appropriate lay-ers in the network so that the corresponding Hough transform is com-puted. Analogies between the different layers in the network and those in the visual system are discussed. Furthermore, the model can be used to explain certain experiments on visual selection reported in the litera-ture. ...|$|E

40|$|Scope and Purpose-The {{two-level}} {{hierarchical network}} structure with {{the upper level}} hub-ring and the lower level <b>star-type</b> connections is found {{in a wide variety}} of application areas such as communications, transportation, physical distribution, etc. Topological design of such networks, despite its practical importance, has not been effectively dealt with in the literature, owing to the associated computations complexity. This work is inspired by some recent successes of other network design studies which incorporate the dual-based approach in a unified framework different from the conventional approach of partitioning the whole problem into two easy subprob~ems. The design problem is formulated into a mixed O-l integer programming model in such a way that its special structure can be exploited to deveiop an efficient dual-based heuristic. The computational experience with the heuristic strongly suggests that it is effective enough to be applicable even to fairly large real-world network problems. Abstract-This paper deals with topological design of a hie~rchical two-levef network where the upper-level hub network is of ring type and the lower-level local access networks are of <b>star-type.</b> The problem is modeled as a mixed 0 - 1 integer programming, the special structure of which is exploited for the development of a dual-based lower bounding procedure. A heuristic procedure is developed to construct a primal feasible solution from the dual solution obtained by the dual procedure. The performance of our method is well demonstrated by the computational experiments conducted with a variety of test problems ranging up to 20 hub nodes and 50 user nodes. 1...|$|E
