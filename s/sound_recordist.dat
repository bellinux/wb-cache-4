5|$|Several of the {{services}} featured in the film were one-off events. For example, the wedding was shot at Lyng, where the bride's father was the rector. The bridegroom, Nigel McCulloch, {{went on to become}} the Bishop of Manchester. The production encountered difficulties with obtaining some footage; while filming a Seaman's Mission from Great Yarmouth, a wave flooded the boat, ruining the sound-recording equipment, and a sequence featuring an open-air service taking place at daybreak on Easter Sunday at the most easterly point of the UK — at Ness Point, Lowestoft — was nearly missed after the <b>sound</b> <b>recordist</b> overslept.|$|E
5|$|In early 1929 Robey {{returned}} to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with Bits and Pieces, {{after which he}} started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences {{over the course of}} a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance Fête, and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a <b>sound</b> <b>recordist</b> in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.|$|E
5|$|After he {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} civil engineering from Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada, Ram Gopal Varma opened a video-rental shop in Ameerpet. Noting his son's interest in films, Penmatsa Krishnamraju (a former <b>sound</b> <b>recordist</b> for Annapurna Studios) helped Varma join the teams of Collector Gari Abbai (1987) and Rao Gari Illu (1988) as an assistant director. Varma befriended actor Akkineni Nagarjuna, and filmmakers Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra. He presented his script for Raathri to them. When Nagarjuna rejected it, Varma presented another script based on his life as a student in Vijayawada. He earlier narrated this script to filmmaker Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao who suggested few changes because of its serious tone. Varma watched Rao's Kaliyuga Pandavulu (1986) and backed out after understanding Rao's point of view.|$|E

50|$|The cameras {{themselves}} are generally considered by most <b>sound</b> <b>recordists</b> {{to be quite}} noisy in operation, possibly because the amount of computer processing power, and subsequent generated heat leads to cooling fans being used to keep the camera at a reasonable temperature.|$|R
50|$|In typical {{practice}} for Nagra analogue tape recorders, Alignment Level {{is regarded as}} −8 and maximum level 0. Thus <b>sound</b> <b>recordists</b> using location mixers would typically send a tone at 0 VU or PPM 4 (British) and adjust the Nagra recorder's gain to read −8 on the modulometer.|$|R

25|$|Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family {{are widely}} {{considered}} to be important early country musicians. Their songs were first captured at a historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee, on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and <b>sound</b> <b>recordist.</b> A scene in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? depicts a similar occurrence in the same timeframe.|$|E
50|$|Sherbrooke Forest {{is famous}} for its {{population}} of superb lyrebirds and was an early, and still important, site for the study and conservation of this species. One of the early lyrebird researchers and <b>sound</b> <b>recordists</b> of the 1930s was Raymond Littlejohns. Another researcher who analysed lyrebird song was Konstantin Halafoff.|$|R
5000|$|The stories covered many subjects. Two researchers, two cinematographers, two <b>sound</b> <b>recordists,</b> four {{reporters and}} four editors {{worked on the}} time {{equivalent}} of a feature film every week - about eighty minutes of screen time shot on 16mm reversal film. Stories were not scripted, relying upon the ingenuity of the reporter and the two-person crew.|$|R

She {{had a relationship}} with cast member Matthew Perry at the time and an audience member said about their on-screen kiss, [...] "Julia looked at Matt and said 'I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend'." [...] A <b>sound</b> <b>recordist</b> commented: [...] "I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They really went at it." [...] Roberts thought her appearance on the show was [...] "the most nerve-wracking thing" [...] she had done since auditioning for Pretty Woman. [...] "I wanted to be the best I could be.

500|$|Alex Thompson, the episode's <b>sound</b> <b>recordist,</b> {{arranged}} the phones {{so that the}} actors could {{speak to each other}} in real-time. Pemberton and Shearsmith wanted this so that the voices would not have to be recorded in a studio later and added in ADR. The voice of [...] "Chloe"—the identity of whom is key to the story—presented a particular technical challenge, as the writers wanted to ensure that her identity was not revealed the first time her voice is heard. First, the production team recorded Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe, and then a number of actresses recorded their versions of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe. Of these, one—Hall—was chosen to lend her voice to Chloe. Shearsmith then re-recorded his voice, imitating Hall's version of George-as-Chloe. Hall and Shearsmith's respective performances of George-as-Chloe could then be merged together for the final episode. The first time viewers hear [...] "Chloe", her voice is mostly Hall's; as the episode progresses, more of Shearsmith's voice is audible. For Shearsmith, this did not represent the production team cheating the viewers, as viewers' experiences are filtered through Andy's experiences. The first time viewers hear Chloe, they—like Andy—experience her as a teenage girl. As most of the episode was filmed in real-time, George is visible making calls as Chloe, meaning that he hides in plain sight. Footage of Shearsmith playing George-as-Chloe in George's office—used in the final episode—was filmed separately {{to the rest of the}} episode, as a camera set-up in George's office would have been visible on one of the main cameras.|$|E

2500|$|Sony {{worked as}} a <b>sound</b> <b>recordist</b> (for many foreign {{networks}} including ABC, CBS, BBC [...] ) covering the defiance campaign and consequently the release from prison of Nelson Mandela in February 1990. He has used some of the recordings he made as a journalist in his musical work. He worked with Donald Woods on a documentary at this time. Sony worked with Lloyd Ross at Shifty Records from 1992, mostly concentrating on developing and promoting foreign African music in South Africa. He bought the studios first 16-track recording machine and became {{a partner in the}} company when Ivan Kadey emigrated.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{historical}} documentation and musicological research and analysis of Virgin Islander music. The <b>sound</b> <b>recordist</b> Mary Jane Soule and ethnomusicologist Margot Lieth-Philipp collaborated on an annotated CD, Zoop Zoop Zoop: Traditional Music and Folklore of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John; these liner notes are among the comprehensive descriptions of folk music known. Lieth-Phillipp has also published some other material, on bamboula (which she refers to as a [...] "forgotten" [...] style of Caribbean music) and other topics. The loca and the Smithsonian Institution have also documented some folk traditions, but their research remains largely unpublished. [...] Carmen Nibbs-O'Garra, wife of well-known Antiguan calypsonian Figgy, {{is the author of}} In de Calypso Tent, which, though perhaps no longer available, contains information of calypso competitions of St. Thomas and also reproduces the lyrics of popular Virgin Islands calypsos, and historical programs from past calypso tents on the islands. While not a scholarly history of the islands' musical life, The Memoirs of Alton Augustus Adams, Sr.: First Black Bandmaster of the United States Navy were recently published by the University of California Press in a scholarly edition by Mark Clague. This book offers a first-hand account of musical life in the Virgin Islands from the 1900s through the 1950s. Adams's remembrances are surprisingly precise as in addition to his musical activities, he worked as a journalist and much of his writing is based upon the articles and notes he penned for The St. Thomas Times and The Bulletin as well as The Pittsburgh Courier.|$|E

2500|$|When {{creating}} {{sound effects}} for films, <b>sound</b> <b>recordists</b> and editors do not generally concern {{themselves with the}} verisimilitude or accuracy of the sounds they present. [...] The sound of a bullet entering a person from a close distance may sound nothing like the sound designed in the above example, but since very few people are aware of how such a thing actually sounds, the job of designing the effect is mainly an issue of creating a conjectural sound which feeds the audience's expectations while still suspending disbelief.|$|R
