5|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps {{to reduce speed}} and shorten his turn radius, rather than the <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> of using full throttle throughout.|$|E
5|$|Turret One fired first, {{beginning}} at 09:33. Turret One's left gun misfired and its crew {{was unable to}} get the gun to discharge. Moosally ordered Turret Two to load and fire a three-gun salvo.

5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E

5|$|While {{entering}} the landing pattern, crash trucks would {{travel to the}} runway and await landing. This was <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew was interrogated prior to being released, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted {{to the performance of}} the plane and other items that the crew might have noticed during their flight. After release, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rubdown.|$|E
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E

5|$|Evacuation plans already existed as a <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> for American embassies. At the {{beginning}} of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation. As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter evacuation and provide air support if required. In the event, air support was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts of Saigon, possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 registered N110AA. It {{had been}} delivered on February 25, 1972, {{and at the}} time of the crash, it had logged just under 20,000 hours of flying time over seven years. The jet was powered by three General Electric CF6-6D engines. A review of the aircraft's flight logs and maintenance records showed that no mechanical discrepancies were noted for May 11, 1979. On the day of the accident, in violation of <b>standard</b> <b>procedure,</b> the records were not removed from the aircraft, and were destroyed in the accident.|$|E

5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E

East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The <b>standard</b> <b>procedure</b> of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E

5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a <b>standard</b> <b>procedure,</b> with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on {{the mental health of}} his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by Colin Cowdrey, the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead twelfth man. In his place, England chose a fast bowler to {{strengthen}} their bowling attack. While the game was taking place, Doug Insole, the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's. The replacement for D'Oliveira, Barry Knight, performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, but critics believed his chance had gone. In July, as part of a <b>standard</b> <b>procedure,</b> the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted. According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.|$|E
