50|$|The industry's spurt {{of growth}} in the late 70s was {{accompanied}} by a growing <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> whole-plane charter <b>seats,</b> which was further exacerbated by Laker Airways' decision to kerb its short- to medium-haul charter activities, {{as a result of that}} airline's increasing focus on its long-haul, transatlantic Skytrain scheduled no frills services, as well as by British Caledonian's decision to withdraw completely from the market.|$|R
50|$|Laker {{proposed}} a daily Skytrain linking Gatwick and Hong Kong via Sharjah {{to be operated}} with single-class, 380-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s. At the CAA hearing the airline proposed larger, higher capacity Boeing 747s {{as soon as this}} was justified by increased demand. The company tried to convince the CAA that its additional all-economy class discount service was the best option to alleviate the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> on this route. Its analysis showed the bottom end of the economy market was the most under-served segment because of the scarcity of low fares. The other airlines used Laker's analysis in support of their claims that Skytrain would flood the market with cheap seats that risked undermining profitability without doing anything to alleviate the shortage of premium seats. Laker retorted that low fares would stimulate the market by meeting untapped demand from people who could not afford to fly this route because of British Airways's high fares, rather than taking market share from competitors. It pointed to the success of its transatlantic Skytrain in helping create demand while maintaining that its rivals' proposals would do little to meet the unsatisfied demand for low-fare seats.|$|E
40|$|School {{districts that}} adopt the Deferred Acceptance (DA) {{mechanism}} to assign students to schools face the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency when selecting {{how to break}} ties among equivalent students. We analyze a model with with random generated preferences for students and compare two mechanisms differing by their tie-breaking rules: DA with one single lottery (DA-STB) and DA with a separate lottery for each school (DA-MTB). We identify that the balance between supply and demand in the market is a prominent factor when selecting a tie-breaking rule. When there is a surplus of seats, we show that neither random assignments under these mechanisms stochastically dominates each other, and, the variance of student’s assignments is larger under DA-STB. However, we {{show that there is}} essentially no tradeoff between fairness and efficiency when {{there is a shortage of}} seats: not only that DA-STB (almost) stochastically dominates DA-MTB, it also results in a smaller variance in student’s rankings. We further find that under DA-MTB many pairs of students would benefit from directly exchanging assignments ex post when there is a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats,</b> while only few such pairs exist when there is a surplus of seats. Our findings suggest that it is more desirable that “popular ” schools use a single lottery over a separate lottery in order to break ties, while in other schools there is a real tradeoff. ...|$|E

At the Race of China, he finished ninth in the race one provisional classification but along with four other drivers was issued with a 30-second penalty after the race, for missing a chicane to avoid a pileup. A late season improvement in form, including a double points finish at Macau, saw Boardman finish 17th in the drivers' standings.|$|R

40|$|The {{profession}} {{is facing a}} unique <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty. Schools of Nursing {{have always had a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> doctorally prepared nursing faculty. The academic norm for faculty teaching in baccalaureate and graduate programs to hold earned doctoral degrees was established later in nursing than for other disciplines. At best, 50 % of nursing faculty in such programs have met this academic standard. In addition, the shortage is predicted to escalate in the next decade due to the retirement of a "graying professoriate" of nursing faculty. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty is interwoven with the current national <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nurses. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nurses requires the educational programs of the profession to supply more graduates. But the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty will limit student enrollments and likely decrease the number of graduates. Conversely, the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nurses will offer many opportunities and choices to nurses and may decrease the number selecting graduate studies and an academic career, thus contributing to the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty will also have consequences for the generation of the knowledge base for nursing practice. With a decreased number of individuals to conduct research and the loss of senior investigators through retirement, continuing development of nursing's knowledge base may be curtailed. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty will also limit the professional leaders who are able to shape health policy in the state, national, and international arenas. This article outlines a number of factors influencing the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty. Several institutional School of Nursing strategies are suggested for countering the shortage situation. In addition, several national professional and policy strategies are suggested. More creative strategies need to be developed and evaluated by Schools of Nursing and by the profession...|$|R

Administrators in this study placed enthusiasm for teaching and the use of community relations skills as the most important factors they look for when hiring an agricultural education teacher. This supports Cantrell’s (2003) research which found that administrators sought candidates who could orally present their knowledge of agriculture in an enthusiastic manner and who could develop rapport with members of the community.
