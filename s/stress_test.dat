After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity in the exchange of military officers and students, and in the following years, several German military officers were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing power and influence also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to increased financial instability {{in many countries}} in the 1990 s, policy makers became interested in better understanding vulnerabilities in financial systems, and particularly in banks. One of the key techniques for quantifying vulnerabilities is <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> This article reviews the literature on <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> of banking systems. The first section introduces the concept of <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> The second section overviews <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> performed by international financial institutions, central banks, and other researchers. The third section describes the implementation of <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> The fourth section discusses specific issues relating to individual shock factors. The fifth section provides a conclusion. 1. The Concept of Macroprudential <b>Stress</b> <b>Testing</b> In the context of financial sector analysis, the term <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> refers {{to a range of}} techniques used to help assess the vulnerability of financial institutions or the financial system to exceptional but plausible events. 1 <b>Stress</b> <b>tests</b> were originally developed for use at the portfolio level, to understand how the value of a portfolio changes if there are large changes to its risk factors (such as asset prices). They have become widely used as a risk management tool by financial institutions. 2 In recent years, the techniques have started to be applied in a broader context, with the aim of measuring the sensitivity of a group of financial institutions or even an entire financial system to common shocks. This article focuses on macroprudential (system-focused) <b>stress</b> <b>tests,</b> which are based on applying a common set of shocks and scenarios to a set of financial institutions, in order to analyze both the aggregate impact and the distribution of the impact across the institutions.

40|$|<b>Stress</b> <b>testing</b> is {{a general}} term for {{framework}} that assesses possible impact of an adverse shock on the financial health and a capital adequacy of a bank, other financial institution or the whole financial system.

Credit risk <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> methods developed in the last years very dynamically especially thanks to the requirements on <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> under the Basel II regulatory framework and a fact that further improvement of these methods is expected to ensure higher financial stability of institutions and financial sector to adverse shocks and enable to withstand severe crisis.
