5000|$|A {{variant of}} the time base {{corrector}} is the frame synchronizer which allows devices that cannot be [...] "steered" [...] by an advanced <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> to also be time base corrected and/or timed into a system. Satellites, microwave transmitters and other broadcast signals as well as consumer VTRs cannot be sent an advance <b>sync</b> <b>signal.</b> A frame synchronizer stores at least a full frame of video. If the buffer over or under fills, the Frame Sync will hold the last good frame of video until another full frame's worth of video is received. Usually this is undetectable to viewers.|$|E

50|$|Even though 13W3 is a {{standard}} connector the <b>sync</b> <b>signals</b> are maintained on different pins based on the display and system. Sun Microsystems, Intergraph, IBM RISC and SGI have {{a different set of}} pins used for the monitor sense IDs and the <b>sync</b> <b>signals.</b> Sun and SGI even have two different pin configurations, with and without Display Data Channel support. The Sun DDC connector was used at least on the UPA graphics adapters (Creator 3D, Expert 3D) and for the corresponding monitors (GD5410, GD5510). This can make matching the correct cable to the monitor virtually impossible. Many monitors with 13W3 connectors do not support separate sync as supplied on most PC systems. Other converters exist to allow connecting newer monitors with VGA connectors to the older systems and workstations. The most popular of these is a cable that allows you to set the <b>sync</b> <b>signals</b> with a series of DIP switches built into the cables.|$|R
40|$|DE 2538637 C UPAB: 19930901 The central {{telephone}} exchange, {{for digital}} decentralised exchanges, has incoming signals {{passed on to}} the receive cable alone that is connected to the subscriber for whom the incoming information is destined. The incoming information is temporarily stored in a memory using special switches. For time multiplexed operations, synchronisation {{at the beginning of a}} time frame ensures that the <b>sync.</b> <b>signals</b> appear on the transmit cable at the same time. This is achieved by holding the <b>sync.</b> <b>signals</b> in delay lines at each node in the telephone network until they all have the same phase...|$|R
50|$|The {{horizontal}} synchronization pulse (horizontal sync HSYNC), separates the scan lines. The horizontal <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> {{is a single}} short pulse which indicates the start of every line. The rest of the scan line follows, with the signal ranging from 0.3 V (black) to 1 V (white), until the next horizontal or vertical synchronization pulse.|$|E
5000|$|In standard-definition applications, a bi-level <b>sync</b> <b>signal,</b> {{often with}} a colorburst signal in {{facilities}} that have analog equipment. Typically, this is either in NTSC or PAL format. As the resulting signal is usually indistinguishable from an all-black television signal of the same format, this sort of reference {{is commonly known as}} black or black burst.|$|E
5000|$|Internally, the {{pipeline}} of the 65CE02 was redesigned {{to reduce the}} number of cycles required to execute an instruction. The 65CE02 can recover faster from engagement of the <b>SYNC</b> <b>signal,</b> which reduces the minimum instruction execution time from 2 cycles to 1 cycle. [...] These improvements allow the 65CE02 to execute code up to 25% faster than previous 65xx models.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 5154 EGA monitor has {{a special}} IBM 5153 CGA {{compatibility}} mode when operating with CGA <b>sync</b> <b>signals,</b> and it will automatically change to the CGA pinout to avoid all of the mentioned problems when operating in this mode.|$|R
50|$|The {{other problem}} {{presented}} by latency variation {{is that it}} makes synchronization more complex by making the recovery of the underlying timing of the video signal far more difficult. This is typically solved by genlocking both ends of the system to external station <b>sync</b> <b>signals,</b> typically generated from sources such as GPS or atomic clocks, thus only requiring the extraction of coarse timing information at the receiving end in order to achieve high-quality video synchronization. The extraction of coarse timing data is typically done using a phase locked loop with a long time constant.|$|R
2500|$|RGB is {{also the}} term {{referring}} to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry. [...] It consists of three signals—red, green, and blue—carried on three separate cables/pins. RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS-170 and RS-343 standards for monochrome video. This type of video signal is widely used in Europe {{since it is the}} best quality signal that can be carried on the standard SCART connector. This signal is known as RGBS (4 BNC/RCA terminated cables exist as well), but it is directly compatible [...] with RGBHV used for computer monitors (usually carried on 15-pin cables terminated with 15-pin D-sub or 5 BNC connectors), [...] which carries separate horizontal and vertical <b>sync</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nagra IV-S - Stereo Nagra, {{recording}} two-track stereo. It had dual level pots, limiters, and equalizer presets. It {{was introduced}} in 1971. It originally employed a 14 kHz <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> that is not compatible with the earlier Neopilot sync. This signal is recorded employing FM modulation on a third or center track that could simultaneously be employed as an additional but lower quality [...] "cue" [...] track.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the GX4000, all CPC models lack an RF television or composite video output and instead shipped with a 6-pin RGB DIN connector, also used by Acorn computers, to connect the supplied Amstrad monitor. This connector delivers a 1v p-p analogue RGB with a 50 Hz composite <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> that, if wired correctly, can drive a 50 Hz SCART television. External adapters for RF television were available as a first-party hardware accessory.|$|E
50|$|MTS {{signals are}} {{indicated}} {{to the television}} receiver by adding a 15.734 kHz pilot tone to the signal.The MTS pilot is locked or derived from the horizontal <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> used to lock the video display. Variations in phase or frequency of the horizontal sync are therefore transferred to the audio. UHF transmitters in use in 1984 generally had significant phase errors introduced in this signal making the transmission of stereo audio on UHF stations of that time nearly impossible. Later refinements in UHF transmitters minimized these effects and allowed stereo transmission for those stations.|$|E
5000|$|All Apple II {{machines}} featured an RCA jack {{providing a}} rough NTSC, PAL, or SECAM composite video output (on non-NTSC machines before the Apple IIe this output is black-and-white only). This enabled {{the computer to}} be connected to any composite video monitor conforming to the same standard for which the machine was configured. However the quality of this output was sketchy; the <b>sync</b> <b>signalling</b> was close enough for monitors—which are fairly forgiving—but did not conform closely enough to standards to be suitable for broadcast applications, or even input to a video recorder, without intervening processing. (The exception was the Extended Back version of the Bell & Howell branded black II Plus, which did provide proper video sync, as well as other media oriented features.) ...|$|R

50|$|To get {{an analog}} trigger or clock from the DIN <b>syncs</b> clock <b>signal</b> {{one has to}} use digital {{frequency}} division or frequency multiplication. There are no dedicated industrial devices which provide a division. The Roland SBX10 can convert into a 48, 96, and 120 PPQN clock.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> is {{a series}} of much longer pulses, indicating {{the start of a new}} field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).|$|E
50|$|Sync on Green (SoG) is less common, {{and while}} some VGA {{monitors}} support it, most do not. Sony is a big proponent of SoG, and most of their monitors (and their PlayStation line of video game consoles) use it. Like devices that use composite video or S-video, SoG devices require additional circuitry to remove the <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> from the green line. A monitor that is not equipped to handle SoG will display an image with an extreme green tint, if any image at all, when given a SoG input.|$|E
5000|$|The {{connector}} contains 10 standard signal {{pins and}} 3 larger positions {{that can be}} fitted with either special pins with two concentric contacts for coaxial cable or with special high current pins. When used for video signals on the computer side, the pins are female but the coaxial connectors in the large positions are male. The coaxial connectors carry the video signal split into red, green/gray, and blue; the standard signal pins carry four grounds, three [...] "sense" [...] pins used {{to communicate with the}} monitor, vertical sync, horizontal sync, and a composite <b>sync</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
40|$|Control signals for phase-delay rectifiers, {{which require}} a {{variable}} firing angle {{that ranges from}} 0 deg to 180 deg, are derived from line-to-line 3 -phase signals and {{both positive and negative}} firing angle control signals which are generated by comparing current command and actual current. Line-to-line phases are transformed into line-to-neutral phases and integrated to produce 90 deg phase delayed signals that are inverted to produce three cosine signals, such that for each its maximum occurs at the intersection of positive half cycles of the other two phases which are inputs to other inverters. At the same time, both positive and negative (inverted) phase <b>sync</b> <b>signals</b> are generated for each phase by comparing each with the next and producing a square wave when it is greater. Ramp, sync and firing angle controls signals are than used in combinational logic to generate the gate firing control signals SCR gate drives which fire SCR devices in a bridge circuit...|$|R

5000|$|The MPU-401 {{can work}} in two modes, normal mode and UART mode. [...] "Normal mode" [...] would provide the host system with an 8-track sequencer, MIDI clock output, <b>SYNC</b> 24 <b>signal</b> output, Tape <b>Sync</b> and a metronome; {{as a result of}} these features, it is often called [...] "intelligent mode". Compare this to UART mode, which reduces the MPU-401 to simply {{relaying}} in-/outcoming MIDI data bytes.|$|R
5000|$|Image {{synchronization}} {{is achieved}} by transmitting negative-going pulses; in a composite video signal of 1 volt amplitude, these are approximately 0.3 V below the [...] "black level". The horizontal <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. Two timing intervals are defined - the front porch {{between the end of}} displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the back porch after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the horizontal blanking (or retrace) interval and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning {{to the start of the}} next display line.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1985 {{with the}} video release of The Cotton Club, Macrovision {{licensed}} to publishers {{a technology that}} exploits the automatic gain control feature of VCRs by adding pulses to the vertical blanking <b>sync</b> <b>signal.</b> These pulses do not affect the image a consumer sees on his TV, but do confuse the recording-level circuitry of consumer VCRs. This technology, which is aided by U.S. legislation mandating the presence of automatic gain-control circuitry in VCRs, is said to [...] "plug the analog hole" [...] and make VCR-to-VCR copies impossible, although an inexpensive circuit is widely available that will defeat the protection by removing the pulses. Macrovision has patented methods of defeating copy prevention, giving it a more straightforward basis to shut down manufacture of any device that descrambles it than often exists in the DRM world.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{meantime}} MOS had started selling the 6502, a chip capable of operating at 1 MHz in September 1975 {{for a mere}} $25 USD. It was nearly identical to the 6501, {{with only a few}} minor differences: an added on-chip clock oscillator, a different functional pinout arrangement, generation of the <b>SYNC</b> <b>signal</b> (supporting single-instruction stepping), and removal of data bus enablement control signals (DBE and BA, with the former directly connected to the phase 2 clock instead). [...] It outperformed the more-complex 6800 and Intel 8080, but cost much less and was easier to work with. Although it did not have the 6501's advantage of being able to be used in place of the Motorola 6800 in existing hardware, it was so inexpensive that it quickly became more popular than the 6800, making that a moot point.|$|E
50|$|Camera Link uses one {{to three}} Channel-link {{transceiver}} chips with four links at 7 serial bits each.At a minimum, Camera Link uses 28 bits to represent up to 24 bits of pixel data and 3 bits for video <b>sync</b> <b>signals,</b> leaving one spare bit.The video sync bits are Data Valid, Frame Valid, and Line Valid. The data are serialized 7:1, and the four data streams and a dedicated clock are driven over five LVDS pairs. The receiver accepts the four LVDS data streams and LVDS clock, andthen drives the 28 bits and a clock to the board.The camera link standard calls for these 28 bits to be transmitted over 4 serializeddifferential pairs with a serialization factor of 7. The parallel data clock is transmittedwith the data. Typically a 7× clock must be generated by a PLL or SERDES block in order to transmit or receive the serialized video. To deserialize the data,a shift register and counter may be employed. The shift register catches each of the serialized bits, one at a time, then registers the data out into the parallel clock domain - oncethe data counter has reached its terminal value.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} initial {{downlink}} synchronization (sync) and cell identification algorithms for the 3 rd generation partnership project (3 GPP) {{long term evolution}} (LTE) systems are presented. The frequency division duplex (FDD) mode {{is used in the}} downlink radio frame structure. A user equipment digital receiver architecture is proposed. The orthogonality of signals in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) may be lost due to some impairments such as frequency, time, and phase offsets. Therefore, major parts of this research are involved in restoring the orthogonality at the user equipment (UE) by using some techniques to estimate the sync parameters, and to detect cell identity among candidate cells based on <b>sync</b> <b>signals.</b> A Farrow structure interpolator is used to compensate the fractional timing offset. Both inter site synchronous and inter site asynchronous networks are presented. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes with multipath Rayleigh fading channel, frequency offsets, timing offsets, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Results show high probability of cell identification {{in a very short time}} 20 ms in both multi cell model scenarios, especially when multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technique, oversampling at the UE, and high order Farrow structure interpolator are used...|$|R
5000|$|Analog {{and digital}} pay {{television}} have several conditional access {{systems that are}} used for pay-per-view (PPV) and other subscriber related services. Originally, analog-only cable television systems relied on set-top boxes to control access to programming, as television sets originally were not [...] "cable-ready". Analog encryption was typically limited to premium channels such as HBO or channels with adult-oriented content. In those cases, various proprietary video synchronization suppression methods were used to control access to programming. In some of these systems, the necessary <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> was on a separate subcarrier though sometimes the sync polarity is simply inverted, in which case, if {{used in conjunction with}} PAL, a SECAM L TV with a cable tuner can be used to partially descramble the signal though only in black and white and with inverted luminance and thus a multi standard TV which supports PAL L is preferred to decode the color as well. This, however will lead to a part of the video signal being received as audio as well and thus another TV with preferably no auto mute should be used for audio decoding. Analog set-top boxes have largely been replaced by digital set-top boxes that can directly control access to programming as well as digitally decrypt signals.|$|E

The digital <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> and the digital coded signals are generated by a single crystal controlled clock {{so that they are}} always in synchronism with each other. In demultiplexing the signals are utilized for shifting the digital coded signals into a shift register. The shift register, in turn, activates a decoder according to the code stored in the shift register for selecting the proper recording disk or receiver for storing the video signal...|$|E

A programmable sync detector for monitoring {{the contents of the}} shift register and for generating a <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> when the shift register contains a predetermined sync code is included. A counter is described for counting the data bits input to the shift register after the <b>sync</b> <b>signal</b> is generated and for generating a count complete signal when a selected number of data bits have been input to the register. A data storage device is used for storing the contents of the shift register at the time the count complete signal is generated...|$|E
50|$|Actually {{accomplishing}} this in hardware is not {{as difficult}} as it may sound. If one knows that the signal is rotated at 25 RPM, {{as it was in the}} Würzburg radar, the jammer is built to fade from maximum to zero at the same speed, 25 times a minute. Then all that is needed is to <b>sync</b> the <b>signals</b> up, which is accomplished by looking for the low point in the signal (which is generally easier to find) and triggering the pattern at that point. This system, known as inverse gain jamming, was used operationally by the Royal Air Force against the Würzburg radar during World War II.|$|R
50|$|VGA {{connectors}} and cables carry analog component RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical <b>sync)</b> video <b>signals,</b> and VESA Display Data Channel (VESA DDC) data. In {{the original}} version of DE-15 pinout, one pin was keyed by plugging the female connector hole; this prevented non-VGA 15 pin cables from being plugged into a VGA socket. Four pins carried Monitor ID bits, which were rarely used; VESA DDC redefined some of these pins and replaced the key pin with +5 V DC power supply. Devices that comply with the DDC host system standard provide 5V ±5% and supply a minimum of 300 mA {{to a maximum of}} 1 A.|$|R
