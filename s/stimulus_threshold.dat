We measured the cellular basis for these relative decreases in tissue excitability during the recovery phase by performing parallel experiments on rabbit left papillary muscle and isolated rabbit ventricular cells in addition to conducting theoretical studies with numerical simulations of action potential initiation.

Ubiquitous molecular chaperones from the heat shock protein (HSP) superfamily confer neuronal protection that can be blocked by antibodies. Recent {{research has focused on}} the interactions between the molecular sensors that affect the increased expression of neuroprotective HSPs above constitutive levels. An examination of the conditions under which the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) was up regulated in a hypoxia and anoxia tolerant tropical species, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), revealed that up-regulation was dependent on exceeding a <b>stimulus</b> <b>threshold</b> for an oxidative stressor. While hypoxic-preconditioning confers neuroprotective changes, there was no increase in the level of Hsp 70 indicating that its increased expression was not associated with achieving a neuroprotected state in response to hypoxia in the epaulette shark. Conversely, there was a significant increase in Hsp 70 in response to anoxic-preconditioning, highlighting the presence of a <b>stimulus</b> <b>threshold</b> barrier and raising the possibility that, in this species, Hsp 70 contributes to the neuroprotective response to extreme crises, such as oxidative stress. Interestingly, there was a synergistic effect of coincident stressors on Hsp 70 expression, which was revealed when metabolic stress was superimposed upon oxidative stress. Brain energy charge was significantly lower when adenosine receptor blockade, provided by treatment with aminophylline, was present prior to the final anoxic episode, under these circumstances, the level of Hsp 70 induced was significantly higher than in the pair-matched saline treated controls. An understanding of the molecular and metabolic basis for neuroprotective switches, which result in an up-regulation of neuroprotective Hsp 70 expression in the brain, is needed so that intervention strategies can be devised to manage CNS pathologies and minimise damage caused by ischemia and trauma. In addition, the current findings indicate that measurements of HSP expression per se may provide a useful correlate of the level of neuroprotection achieved in the switch to an autoprotected phenotype.

40|$|Autoimmunity in the NOD mouse is a {{paradigm}} of dysregulated T cell tolerance where anti-islet T cells selectively destroy pancreatic β cells causing diabetes. This breakdown of T cell tolerance {{results from a}} sequence of events beginning with the thymic positive selection of a repertoire containing islet-reactive T cells. The present work is focused on elucidating the mechanisms which allow peripheral anti-islet T cells to differentiate into diabetogenic effectors. ^ By characterizing B cell deficient NOD mice, the presented studies established that B lymphocytes are required for the progression of T cell mediated anti-islet autoimmunity. More specifically, the contribution of B cell mediated antigen presentation to the activation of diabetogenic T cells was assessed. NOD mice with a selective MHC class II deficiency confined to the B cell compartment were generated. These mice were resistant to spontaneous autoimmune diabetes demonstrating a central role of B cell APC function in mediating the activation of a diabetogenic T cell response. Consistent with this finding, a series of in vitro studies demonstrated the dependence of NOD CD 4 T cell activation upon B cell costimulation. Specifically, B cell mediated cognate costimulation {{was found to be}} required for driving anti-CD 3 mediated NOD CD 4 T cell activation. This finding suggested that B cells may be more competent than the non-B cell APC compartment at providing the costimulation necessary for anti-CD 3 mediated CD 4 T cell activation in NOD mice. The stringent dependence of CD 4 T cell activation on B cell costimulation in NOD mice is characterized by: (1) an increased TCR <b>stimulus</b> <b>threshold</b> required for triggering activation and (2) a premature termination of division. An increase in the <b>stimulus</b> <b>threshold</b> required for CD 4 T cell activation could protect a range of antigen-reactive TCR specificities from activation-induced regulation. Furthermore, the prematurely aborted process of cell division does not allow activated NOD CD 4 T cells to efficiently achieve the threshold number of divisions required for susceptibility to activation-induced deletion. Thus, in NOD mice, B cells appear to be most competent at delivering the costimulation required for CD 4 T cell activation. This cognate B cell mediated CD 4 T cell costimulation, while sufficient for activation of diabetogenic T cells, may not promote optimal activation-induced regulation of NOD CD 4 T cells. ...|$|E

But {{although it is}} known that mechanical stimulations of these organisms trigger the bioluminescent response, the exact mechanism that involves some cell membrane excitations by fluid motions is not yet fully understood and is still controversial. We show in this experimental study that the accelerated shear flow, created by abrupt rotations of one or both co-axial cylinders of a Couette shearing chamber excites the light emission from cultured dinoflagellates Pyrocystis lunula. Following our first results published earlier that state that pure laminar shear does not excite the main bioluminescent response in dinoflagellates, our present experiments show that both shear and acceleration in the flow are needed to trigger the bioluminescent response. Besides, the probability to stimulate this bioluminescent response under acceleration and shear is deduced from the response curves. This response follows a Gaussian distribution that traduces an heterogeneity in individual cell thresholds for the stimulation of bioluminescence in a dinoflagellate population. All these results will have a repercussion in the possible applications of dinoflagellate bioluminescence in flow visualizations and measurements.

In addition, firing activity was evoked in SNs by stimulation of the primary motor cortex, and SNs exhibited significantly decreased <b>stimulus</b> <b>threshold,</b> increased firing rates, and reduced latency. The expression of Cav 1. 3 and p-CaMKII (Thr 286) in the striatum were enhanced in PD rats. However, these effects were reversed by treadmill exercise. These findings suggest that treadmill exercise inhibits CGP hyperactivity in PD rats, which may be related to improvement of PS...|$|E
40|$|Elements of a contour {{are often}} easier to detect when they possess collinearity, with their local orientations {{matching}} the global {{orientation of the}} contour. We recently reported attentional modulation of such lateral interactions between a central near-threshold target Gabor patch and flanking high-contrast patches (Freeman et al, 2001 Nature Neuroscience 4 1032 - 1036). Here, we examined whether such attentional effects reflect specific modulation of mechanisms sensitive to collinear configurations, or instead more general modulation of sensitivity to either the global or local orientation-components of the <b>stimulus.</b> <b>Thresholds</b> for detecting a central Gabor target were measured, while observers also judged the Vernier alignment between one pair of flankers and ignored a second flanker pair (when present). Target contrast-thresholds were facilitated only when attending collinear flankers. There was no facilitation when attending flankers that shared only local orientation with the target, or flankers that fell on a global axis aligned with target orientation but having orthogonal local orientation. Ignored collinear flankers {{had no effect on}} target thresholds. These results demonstrate strong and specific attentional modulation of contour-integration mechanisms in early vision sensitive to collinear configurations...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the use of}} proboscis-extension reflex conditioning, we {{demonstrate}} that honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) bred for hygienic behavior (a behavioral mechanism of disease resistance) are able to discriminate between odors of healthy and diseased brood at a lower stimulus level than bees from a non-hygienic line. Electroantennogram recordings confirmed that hygienic bees exhibit increased olfactory sensitivity to low concentrations of the odor of chalkbrood infected pupae (a fungal disease caused by Ascosphaera apis). Three-week-old hygienic bees were able to discriminate between the brood odors significantly better than three-week old non-hygienic bees. However, the differential performance in brood odor discrimination was primarily genetically based, not {{a direct result of}} age, experience, or the temporary behavioral state of the bee. Lower <b>stimulus</b> <b>thresholds</b> for both the olfactory and behavioral responses of hygienic bees may facilitate their ability to detect, uncap and remove diseased brood rapidly from the nest. In contrast, non-hygienic bees, possessing higher response thresholds, {{may not be able to}} detect diseased brood as easily. Our results provide an example of how physiological and behavioral differences between the hygienic and non-hygienic honey bee lines, operating at the level of the individual, could produce colony-specific behavioral phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to use {{spectral}} smearing to evaluate the efficacy of a spectral ripple test (SRt) using stationary sounds and a recent variant with gliding ripples called the spectro-temporal ripple test (STRt) in measuring reduced spectral resolution. In experiment 1 the highest detectable ripple density was measured using four amounts of spectral smearing (unsmeared, mild, moderate, and severe). The thresholds worsened with increasing smearing and were similar for the SRt and the STRt across the three conditions with smearing. For unsmeared <b>stimuli,</b> <b>thresholds</b> were significantly higher (better) for the STRt than for the SRt. An amplitude fluctuation at the outputs of simulated (gammatone) auditory filters centered above 6400 Hz was identified as providing a potential detection cue for the STRt stimuli. Experiment 2 used notched noise with energy below and above the passband of the SRt and STRt stimuli to reduce confounding cues in the STRt. Thresholds were almost identical for the STRt and SRt for both unsmeared and smeared stimuli, indicating that the confounding cue for the STRt was eliminated by the notched noise. Thresholds obtained with notched noise present could be predicted reasonably accurately using an excitation-pattern model. 9 page(s...|$|R
