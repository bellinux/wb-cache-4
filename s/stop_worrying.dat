25|$|That {{evening at}} the ball, {{everyone}} makes their grand entrances and the couples dance. Henry has developed a crush on a girl named Violet and, after encouragement from David, introduces himself and shares his iPod Nano with Violet. Leroy is able to convince Belle to <b>stop</b> <b>worrying</b> about Rumpelstiltskin and gets her to join the dance. However, the event is about to end early when Percival reveals that he had witnessed Regina slaughter his entire family as a child. He also reveals that knows {{that she is the}} Evil Queen and not the Savior, a fact he confirmed earlier by observing her through the enchanted necklace, and that he kept all of this from Arthur because he would have prevented him from killing Regina. Percival tries to kill Regina, but Robin steps in and fights him, only to be stabbed in the process before David kills Percival. Regina is desperate to save Robin, but her magic does not work due to an enchantment spell placed on Percival's sword. This prompts Regina to ask Emma to help save Robin by using her magic, but Hook does not want Emma to trigger her dark side. Meanwhile, King Arthur does not blame them for Percival's death, saying that his action was inexcusable, and admits that he suspected Regina's identity, but says that Camelot is a place of second chances. He later confesses to Guinevere that he thinks that there is something suspicious about the new arrivals, but he has to trust them, as they are his only hope of freeing Merlin and finding the missing piece of Excalibur. Emma eventually decides to help Regina despite the risk, but the magic triggers her vision of Rumpelstiltskin, who warns her that a price has to be paid if she saves Robin's life. Emma ignores the manifestation and uses her magic to save Robin, but in the process it triggers the darkness in her, as forewarned by Hook, with Emma's hand beginning to resemble that of a Dark One's.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums, Subterranean Jungle {{shifted the}} band's sound output focus towards {{getting back to}} their punk rock roots, {{rather than trying to}} expand fan-base by releasing more pop-oriented songs. This change is due to guitarist Johnny Ramone obtaining more priority over the style choice. Johnny felt as though the band needed to [...] "be focused and <b>stop</b> <b>worrying</b> about getting played [...] and just make a good record." [...] Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, the album lacks the sense of pop-influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.|$|E

Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it will take time before it's clear whether we should mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, or learn to <b>stop</b> <b>worrying</b> and love the Net".|$|E

500|$|Amy Benfer of Salon.com {{wrote in}} 2010 that, {{according}} to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008, meaning that [...] "the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture", and that {{if there had been}} {{such a thing as a}} [...] "Juno effect", it would have caused pregnancies to go down, not up. She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too?

500|$|Regarding the book's achievement, Shone remarks [...] "He {{now stands}} at year zero – creatively, psychologically." [...] However, typical {{features}} of Ellis' earlier works remain intact; for example, in its depictions of violence. Commenting on its self-referential aspects, Janelle Brown of the San Francisco Chronicle recommends [...] "for his next endeavor, Ellis should <b>stop</b> <b>worrying</b> and start looking for the exit of his own personal rabbit hole." [...] The Buffalo News awarded the novel its Editor's Choice. Jeff Simon comments that it [...] "brings an excessive Reaganesque flavor to Obama America". With regards to the novel's writing style, he comments [...] "The first-person sentences run on and on, but the individual sections of the book are nothing if not minimal... ghastly narcissism or not, Bret Easton Ellis has a fictional territory all his own and, heaven forbid, a mastery there." [...] The Wall Street Journal on the other hand, described this prose style as [...] "flat and fizzless". Such is the book's violent aesthetic that, for Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times, [...] "the book is closer to his remarkable third novel, American Psycho". She further compliments Ellis as [...] "a bizarrely moral writer who specializes in evoking the amoral." [...] Concerning his writing, she notes its [...] "despair is blunt, factual and seldom approaches the laconic unease of JG Ballard." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Pick {{from the}} Saturday Review wrote [...] "it isn't even humorous at all". Bodley later {{said that his}} talents as a writer lay in non-fiction, adding that of [...] "the many novels (...) and several plays [...] had written, four were {{published}} and two produced, and all failed to arouse any interest." [...] He wrote an essay entitled I Lived in the Garden of Allah, which was included in Dale Carnegie's 1948 self-help book How to <b>Stop</b> <b>Worrying</b> and Start Living. In 1953 he wrote The Warrior Saint, a biography on Charles de Foucauld. John Cogley from The New York Times said Bodley had [...] "written a clean, poetic and frankly admiring account" [...] of Foucauld's life. In 1955 he wrote the partly-autobiographical self-help book In Search of Serenity. Elsie Robinson from The Index-Journal and Phyllis Battle from the Tipton Tribune gave favourable reviews, with Robinson calling it [...] "a must for every rasped spirit". His next and final book, The Soundless Sahara, was published in 1968; according to the book's back cover he spent part of his years living in Massachusetts, and the rest in either England or France. He provided information for the book The Secret Lives of Lawrence of Arabia, by Phillip Knightley and Colin Simpson, which was published by Thomas Nelson in 1969. He died on 26 May 1970 {{in a nursing home}} in Bramley, Surrey.|$|E
