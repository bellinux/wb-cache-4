5|$|In King Arthur and King Cornwall, the Green Knight again {{features}} as Bredbeddle, and {{is depicted as}} one of Arthur's knights. He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious sprite (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber. When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> its master's head.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, British miners went {{on strike}} over their appalling working conditions. The {{situation}} soon escalated into the General Strike, but the Trade Union Congress, ostensibly worried about reports of starvation in the pit villages, called the <b>strike</b> <b>off.</b> The miners tried to continue alone, but without TUC support had eventually to give in.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, {{the company}} may elect to simply be struck off the Register as a cheaper {{alternative}} to a formal winding-up and dissolution. In such cases an application is made to the Registrar, who may <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> the company if there is reasonable cause {{to believe that the}} company is not carrying on business or has been wound-up and, after enquiry, no case is shown why the company should not be struck off.|$|E

25|$|At {{a special}} {{convention}} of the AA on June 13, Green convinced the AA to call the <b>strike</b> <b>off.</b> The Rank and File Movement's inadequate organization, the obstructionist policies of the Amalgamated's national leadership, strong opposition from the steel industry {{and the promise of}} enhanced governmental protection cut the legs out from the nascent organizing drive. Tighe exacted his revenge: Throughout the rest of the year, he suspended locals that called for aggressive action.|$|E
25|$|In {{complete}} {{contrast to}} the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side of the fence, {{and the other two}} steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> into the next stride.|$|E
25|$|Like a canter, {{the horse}} will <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> with its non-leading hind foot; {{but the second}} stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with the {{striking}} off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.|$|E

To begin with, the operative was instructed to create trouble between the leaders of the union. This he accomplished, and soon the union was divided into a number of hostile camps... The operative was next instructed to agitate the question of strike benefits among the men, so that they would demand financial aid from the Western Federation of Miners, and he was also told to intrigue against some of the leaders, so that the union would expel them. The chiefs being out of the way, Mr. McParland hoped that the rank and file would call the <b>strike</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On March 21, the House of Representatives {{tackled the}} committee's report. Tupas, Daza, Fariñas and Tañada {{delivered}} their sponsorship speeches {{in support of}} the committee report. After the sponsorship speeches, Representatives Lagman, Suarez, Marcoleta, Carlos M. Padilla, Syjuco, Albano, Mitos Magsaysay and Cagas served as interpellators. In the period of interpellation, Tupas gave way to Fariñas when it was Syjuco's turn to interpellate. Syjuco then accused Tupas of vested interest; Deputy Speaker Arnulfo Fuentebella (NPC, Camarines Sur–4th) reminded him [...] "to avoid attacking personalities," [...] and motioned to <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> Syjuco's remarks from the record for being [...] "unparliamentary language." [...] Syjuco, who called Tupas [...] "a coward," [...] was about to divulge the meeting among Tupas, Tupas Sr., and Gutierrez; Tupas said that as being his godfather at his wedding, he could not face Syjuco. Syjuco later cut short his interpellation, but after accusing Tupas anew of using the impeachment as part of his senatorial ambitions.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1932, May was {{involved}} in another manhunt, this time for Albert Johnson, soon known as the [...] "Mad Trapper of Rat River." [...] While serving a search warrant for illegal trapping on the Rat River, Constable King of the RCMP was shot and wounded by Johnson, sparking off a long chase that became front-page news across the continent. Johnson killed Constable Edger Millen. May was again hired {{to see if he}} could find Johnson, who had seemingly disappeared. On February 13, May solved the mystery when he noted a set of footprints leading off from caribou tracks in the middle of the frozen river. Johnson had been following their tracks to hide his own, but had to <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> the path to set up camp at night. Following the trail over the next few days, the RCMP rounded a bend on the river on February 17 to find Johnson in the middle of the trail again, unable to dodge for the bank without his snowshoes on. A firefight broke out during which one of the RCMP officers was seriously wounded and Johnson killed. May arrived just after the action ended. He landed beside the injured officer and flew him [...] to a doctor and was credited with saving his life.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{one side}} of a table stands a grave-looking elderly gentleman with the ballot-box before him; on the other side sits a second still more grave, with an open book; in the book is written, each several number, on the margin, and {{opposite}} the number the name of the juror thereby denoted. The first grave gentleman shakes the box, puts in his hand, and takes out a card, from which he reads the number—then the other grave gentleman turns to that number in the book, and pronounces the name of the juror so numbered, whose name and address are then taken down as one of the forty-eight; and this process is repeated forty-eight times... it is said—I say nothing, but it is said—that those two gentlemen know each juror just as well by his number as by his name: and so, when the first takes out a card and finds 253, for example, written on it—if he knows that 253 would vote for the people, and against the Crown, it is said he gives out (as solemn as he looks), not 253, but, say, 255, or some loyal number; and thus a safe man is put on the list. Or, if anyone is standing by, and has an opportunity of seeing the card, he cries 253, and winks, or otherwise telegraphs to this other grave gentleman. Then the onus is upon the man with the book, who has nothing to do but call out a loyal man for the disloyal number, and so you have safe voters still. They never make the mistake, these elderly gentlemen, of turning out the whole forty-eight all of the right sort there is no need: there is a margin to the extent of twelve: and so they generally leave about nine or ten dubious names amongst the forty-eight. The Crown has afterwards the right to <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> twelve peremptorily, without reason assigned, and always gets rid of the men who would vote for the people.|$|E
