500|$|The {{second draft}} was begun on 25 September 1877, {{just a few}} days after the first: at this point in his career Wagner liked to work on both drafts simultaneously, {{switching}} back and forth between the two so as not to allow too much time to elapse between his initial <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> and the final elaboration of the music. The [...] of act 3 was completed on 16 April 1879 and the [...] on the 26th of the same month.|$|E
500|$|Bach based {{the music}} of the opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (There are joyful songs of victory), on the final {{movement}} of his secular , which had been his first cantata using [...] "modern" [...] recitatives and arias in 1713. The polyphonic movement is described by Simon Crouch as being a [...] "high-octane start". Gardiner notes that in comparison to earlier works for the same occasion, this movement is [...] "festive rather than combative". Bach reworked the earlier movement considerably to adjust from the court music context to joyful songs of victory: he replaced two horns with three trumpets and timpani, transposed the music from F major to D major, and expanded it [...] "on every level", as Hofmann notes. The beginning of a different <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> hints at the fact that the idea to use the early music as a base was not planned from the start.|$|E

40|$|A song cycle may be loosely {{defined as}} a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> works for solo voice and piano {{intended}} for performance as a whole, and in a predetermined order. Established by such composers as Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann, cycles are typically characterized by a deliberate structure, <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> <b>of</b> which are almost without exception by the same author. So conventional is <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> containing <b>the</b> settings <b>of</b> a single poet, it may be considered a prerequisite. Song cycles are also distinguished, therefore, {{by one or more}} unifying elements originating in the poetry, such as literary themes or narration. It is thus inherent that a composer takes a deliberate approach to writing a cycle, both in his selection and <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts.</b> <b>The</b> result is a cohesive musical form with an obvious structure dependent on the aforementioned elements, <b>the</b> musical expression <b>of</b> which is influenced by <b>the</b> <b>text...</b>|$|R

50|$|An earlier <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> also {{entitled}} Erwin und Elmire, {{was made}} by Johann André and first performed in May 1775 in Frankfurt. After Anna Amalia's, several more settings were to follow, including ones by Carl David Stegmann (Hamburg, 1776), Ernst Wilhelm Wolf (Weimar, 1785) and Karl Christian Agthe (Ballenstedt, 1785). The most recent was by the Swiss composer Othmar Schoeck (1886-1957) which premiered in 1915.|$|E
50|$|This text has {{frequently}} been set to music. The earliest is the plainsong version {{found in the}} Liber Usualis (used as the opening of Benjamin Britten's Curlew River); another, from the Sarum Rite, is much used in England. Thomas Tallis composed a memorable <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> among many others. Henry Balfour Gardiner composed the anthem Evening Hymn on both the Latin text as an English translation, for mixed choir and organ.|$|E
50|$|Smith's anthems {{employ the}} {{prevalent}} device of imitative verse sections, and exhibit his predilection for lengthy verse sections and short choruses. For example, in 'Almighty and everlasting God', a concise and effective <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> of the Collect for the Purification, the first chorus lasts {{a total of}} just eight minim beats. Smith took this verse/chorus proportion to its extreme in his Second Creed which is entirely a verse setting apart from the final ‘amen’.|$|E

50|$|Pepping uses {{polyphony}} and a modal tonality {{to achieve}} a characteristic colourful sound (""). A reviewer of a recording notes that the first reactions saw a relation of the disturbing ("") <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> {{to the time of}} its creation - full of uncertainty and dread of the future - while Pepping refused to acknowledge a relation between his music and his life. The mass shows brittle, jagged sections ("") in complex formality and composition technique, especially in the fugues. Other sections show a rather meditative sound of only four parts.|$|E
50|$|Vespers is {{composed}} around several Biblical texts that are traditionally used as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liturgy for several Marian feasts in the Roman Catholic church: the introductory Deus in adjutorium (Psalm 69), five Psalm settings, sacred motets (called “concerti”) between the Psalms, a traditional Hymn, a <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat <b>text</b> and <b>the</b> concluding Benedicamus Domino.|$|R

5000|$|The musical <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> of Mateo Falcone has a declamatory-melodic character, {{in keeping}} with the composer's veneration, if not slavish emulation, of Alexander Dargomyzhsky's method of [...] "melodic recitative," [...] which had been most {{thoroughly}} demonstrated in The Stone Guest. There are no extractable [...] "numbers" [...] from this opera to speak of, although highlights include the orchestral passages that suggest the rustic scenery with a kind of barcarolle, and the intimate Latin prayer near the end (a setting of [...] "Ave Maria"), which is reminiscent of the composer's art songs.|$|E
50|$|One of {{his most}} {{important}} commissions (by the Bishops' Conferences of England & Wales and of Scotland) was to write a new mass setting for choir and congregation to be sung at {{two of the three}} masses celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI during his Apostolic and state visit to Great Britain in 2010. First sung at mass at Bellahouston Park, Glasgow, on 16 September it was sung again at the mass and beatification of John Henry Newman at Cofton Park, Birmingham, on 19 September). He was also commissioned to write a <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> Tu es Petrus (Matthew 16:18) for the Pope's entry at mass at Westminster Cathedral on 18 September.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of the chorus is {{used to create a}} church-like atmosphere in this piece as well as to appropriately set the Psalm. It enters with a minor 2nd motif, which is used both to emphasize the C/D octatonic scale and set the pleading text. The minor second motif in the chorus is continued throughout the movement. The use of the octatonic scale and the church modes pervade the sound of the movement, contributing to both the ritual feel of the piece and the plaintive <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> \relative c { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 e4(\mf f) f2 | e2~ e4~ e8 r } \addlyrics { E- xau- di } ...|$|E
