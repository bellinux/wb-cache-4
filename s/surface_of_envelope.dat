Developed nests were spherical, or hemispherical when built under flat surfaces, consisted of several {{to more than}} 10 horizontal combs with oval or irregular shapes. Each comb was suspended by many pedicels from the upper one. Since several combs were simultaneously constructed at the same story, they often produced irregular interconnections that caused complex stair-like, or “semispiral” structures. Combs were entirely surrounded by an outer envelope with a small entrance hole at the lower tip. The envelope was probably constructed after {{the first group of}} combs had been completed. Materials for both cells and envelope were plant fibers glued together with salivary secretion. The <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>envelope</b> was more thickly coated with the secretion than cell walls.

40|$|Abstract. We {{have used}} a {{combination}} of immunogold staining, optical sectioning light microscopy, intermediate voltage electron microscopy, and EM tomography to examine the distribution of lamin B over the nuclear envelope of CHO cells. Apparent inconsistencies between previously published light and electron microscopy studies of nuclear lamin staining were resolved. At light microscopy resolution, an apparent open fibrillar network is visualized. Colocalization of lamin B and nuclear pores demonstrates that these apparent fibrils, separated by roughly 0. 5 /~m, are anti-correlated with the surface distribution of nuclear pores; pore clusters lie between or adjacent to regions of heavy lamin B staining. Examination at higher, EM resolution reveals that this apparent lamin B network does not correspond to an actual network of widely spaced, discrete bundles of lamin filaments. Rather it reflects a quantitative variation in lamin staining over a roughly 0. 5 -/~m size scale, superimposed on a more continuous but still complex distribution of lamin filaments, spatially heterogeneous on a 0. 1 - 0. 2 -/zm size scale. Interestingly, lamin B staining at this higher resolution is highly correlated to the underlying chromatin distribution. Heavy concentrations of lamin B directly "cap " the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>envelope</b> associated, large-scale chromatin domains. w ~ the last 15 years {{the concept of a}} karyskeleton, or nuclear scaffolding, has emerged (Fisher, 1989). To date, however, the only nuclear proteins established as filamentous proteins are the nuclear lamins, a major component of the nuclear lamina. Initial identification of lamins as a new class of intermediate filament proteins came largely from sequence homology data (Fisher et al., 1986; McKeon et al., 1986) and structural studies on in vitro reconstituted lamin filaments (Aebi et al., 1986).

40|$|A {{computer}} modeling {{process of}} three-dimensional forced convection proceeding from computation of thermodynamic parameters of pneumo basic buildings (pneumo supported structures) is presented. The mathematical model of numerical computation method of temperature and velocity fields, pressure {{profile in the}} object is developed using the package Solid works and is provided by grid methods on specified software. Special Navier–Stokes, Clapeyron–Mendeleev, continuity and thermal-conductivity equations are used to calculate parameters in the building with four supply and exhaust channels. Differential equations are presented by algebraic equation systems, initial-boundary conditions are changed by differential conditions for mesh functions and their solutions are performed by algebraic operations. In this article the following is demonstrated: in pneumo basic buildings convective and heat flows are identical structures near the surfaces in unlimited space, but in single-multiply shells (envelopes) circulation lines take place, geometrical sizes of which depend on thermal-physical characteristics <b>of</b> gas(air) in <b>envelopes,</b> radiation reaction with heated <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>envelopes</b> with  sphere, earth surface, neighboring buildings.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to work out a methodological foundation for the evaluation of an energy efficient technology by designing the thermonergetic parameters of buildings. A multicriterial method is offered for the choice of thermal characteristics and calculation <b>of</b> the <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> an energy-efficient building using the target function. As the main target function a possibility should be mentioned to employ the requirements of ensuring comfort conditions and microclimate in the rooms of the building.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{recently}} {{shown that the}} level <b>of</b> cell <b>surface</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>envelope</b> glycoproteins derived from various human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) primary isolates (PI) was lower than those <b>of</b> <b>envelope</b> glycoproteins derived from T-cell laboratory-adapted (TCLA) HIV- 1 (D.

We investigated this phenomenon by comparing the cell <b>surface</b> expression <b>of</b> chimeric <b>envelope</b> glycoproteins constructed by swapping the gp 120 surface and gp 41 transmembrane glycoproteins of the TCLA HIV- 1 MN and the PI HIV- 1133, HIV- 1 G 365, or HIV- 1 EFRA.

Thus, the difference in cell surface expression observed between TCLA viruses and various PI is probably due to a signal located in gp 41.

This paper presents a simple method to consider the radiative heat on the inner <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> external <b>envelopes</b> for improving the accuracy of the "air-to-air" conduction method. A simplified analytical model is developed for evaluating the impact of inner radiant heat effect on cooling load. Five case studies are conducted in EnergyPlus to validate the model and to assess the radiative heat impact under different conditions. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the procedures of using the developed method to evaluate the inner radiation effect in a real building in Hong Kong. It is found that the most important factors determining the inner radiation effect are the radiative heat conditions and the building zoning configurations, and oversimplifying the zoning configuration might result in errors of up to 10 % in cooling load calculations.
