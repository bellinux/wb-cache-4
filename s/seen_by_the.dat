5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} distortions of the spiral pattern {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} with galaxy satellites M32 and M110. This can be <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{shareholders}} {{decided to}} open the property year-round; it had only previously opened for the summer season. Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater and installed a helicopter pad on the roof.

5|$|As for The Five, {{the group}} had long since dispersed, Mussorgsky had died in 1881 and Borodin had {{followed}} in 1887. Cui continued to write negative reviews of Tchaikovsky's music but was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> composer as merely a critical irritant. Balakirev lived in isolation and was confined to the musical sidelines. Only Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} early adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his simplification of the narrative, addition of women characters (especially a romance for Jekyll) and highlighting of the moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play Jekyll and Hyde, with the transformation <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> audience. Several early film versions relied more on Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.|$|E

5|$|Berneray and Mingulay form an {{important}} breeding site for around {{a hundred thousand}} pairs of seabirds, and are especially important for the razorbill, the two islands having at least 2.0% of the UK's breeding population in 1985. Other species present include a variety of gulls, guillemots, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and (since 1899) fulmars. The island is largely covered by maritime grassland, with some machair and heath. Primrose, violets, yellow flag iris and celandine grow abundantly and grey seals are regularly <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> landing cove. The island is designated as an SSSI and (with Mingulay) is a Special Protection Area.|$|E
5|$|Burgoyne's failed campaign, {{as may be}} <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{titles of}} some of the books that cover it in detail, marked a major turning point in the war. After the battle, he withdrew his men 10–15 miles north, near present-day Schuylerville, New York. General Burgoyne {{returned}} to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{performed}} {{strongly in}} other races; {{he won the}} Polish and Monza Grands Prix and the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, and took five more hillclimbs to win that Championship for {{the third and final}} time. He was, however, beaten by the Mercedes-Benz of Manfred von Brauchitsch at the Avusrennen (the yearly race at the AVUS track). Von Brauchitsch drove a privately entered SSK with streamlined bodywork, and beat Caracciola's Alfa Romeo, which finished in second place. Caracciola was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German crowd as having defected to the Italian team and was booed, while von Brauchitsch's all German victory drew mass support.|$|E

5|$|Despite its later {{importance}} to Britain, Gibraltar was initially <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Government {{as more of}} a bargaining counter than a strategic asset. Its defences continued to be neglected, its garrisoning was an unwelcome expense, and Spanish pressure threatened Britain's vital overseas trade. On seven separate occasions between 1713 and 1728 the British Government proposed to exchange Gibraltar for concessions from Spain, but on each occasion the proposals were vetoed by the British Parliament following public protests.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} he joined an amateur theatre company, {{in which he}} acted and wrote plays. The {{manuscript}} {{of one of these}} early plays, Amoroso, King of Little Britain, was by chance <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> comic actor John Pritt Harley, who, recognising its potential, brought about (and acted in) its performance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Its favourable reception launched Planché on his theatrical career.|$|E
5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> positioning of arrowslits.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated {{by their}} defeats in the judiciary, the Relief Party turned its {{attention}} to the gubernatorial election of 1824, where they backed General Joseph Desha. Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of}} the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Irish influences, Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Icelandic sagas. Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> musicologist Julian Herbage as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift that Winter Legends, composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.|$|E

5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, as can be <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of}} the 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E
5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying. Although {{it has never}} been played at the Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future. Its absence from the Olympics has been <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and funding sources. Some funding sources became available with {{recognition in}} 1995, including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E
5|$|Noh {{masks are}} treasured by Noh {{families}} and institution, {{and the powerful}} Noh schools hold {{the oldest and most}} valuable Noh masks in their private collections, rarely <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> public. The most ancient mask is supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was carved by the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572-622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's Style and the Flower written in the 14th century.|$|E
