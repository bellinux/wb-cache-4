50|$|David <b>Slagger</b> (born June 22, 1962) is a Native American {{politician}} in Maine. <b>Slagger</b> {{served as a}} member of the Maine House of Representatives, representing the newly recognized Maliseet Tribe. <b>Slagger</b> was sworn-in as the appointed representative to the House of Representatives on January 4, 2012. He held the seat temporarily until a tribal election could be conducted to elect a Maliseet Tribal Representative, which the Maliseet Tribe then did on December 22, 2012 when tribal members elected Henry John Bear as their first elected Tribal Representative to the Maine House of Representatives. <b>Slagger</b> did not seek another term as Maliseet representative.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} numerical algorithms {{and parallel}} implementations of a time-dependent, incompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver and a multigrid elliptic solver {{which is also}} used as a computation kernel in the flow solver. ~’he flow solver {{is based on a}} second-order projection method (Bell et. al [2]) applied to a <b>slaggered</b> finite-difference grid. The multigrid elliptic solver uses the full V-cycle scheme (13 riggs, [4]) and was designed to be a general-purpose elliptic solver working on several types of finite-difference grids and for different boundary conditions. A domain-decomposition strategy is used in the parallel implementations for both the flow solver and the mtdtigrid elliptic solver on all tine and coarse grids. The implemented solvers are numerically stable and computational] y efficient, and they scale very well to a large number of processors on Intel Paragon and Cra y T 3 D for problems with moderate granularity. The solver codes are portable to parallel systems that support MPI, PVM and NX for interproccssor communications. 1. 1 ntroduction The motivation for our work is to develop efficient and reusable parallel partial differential equation (PDF?) solvers that are portable across distributed-memory, message-passin...|$|R

50|$|<b>Slagger</b> did {{not seek}} another term as the Maliseet {{representative}} due to the limitations placed on tribal representatives, including the inability to vote and sponsor bills without co-sponsors. <b>Slagger</b> was humiliated when, during a tie vote in the Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee on which he sat, Slagger's deciding vote was recorded but cast aside by the committee chair. In May 2012, <b>Slagger</b> announced a bid for the non-tribal seat in which he lived, District 22. Still running as a non-party (independent) candidate, he challenged incumbent Republican incumbent Stacy Guerin with no Democrat in the race. He received 1,299 votes (26%) and lost.|$|E

5000|$|Isaiah {{initially}} took up {{the name}} <b>Slagger,</b> but his father suggested another codename, Joto, which is Swahili for [...] "heat". During a battle with Haze (Jarrod Jupiter), he was badly burned. Before he died, he touched Prysm on the cheek, sending out a heat pulse with his life essence into her. Later, the H'san Natall had repaired his body, although he was a mindless killing machine in this state. When Prysm came within close proximity of him, his life essence transferred back into his body and he regained control. Together, the Titans and Superman were able to talk the H'san Natall out of further aggression. The team disbanded and went their own ways. Joto would later aid the Titans during the Technis Imperative conflict, which also involved the Justice League and all past Titan members.|$|E
5000|$|Interviewing Kelly in 1997 for The Irish Times, Deirdre Falvey said of him: [...] "In {{person he}} could not be further from Father Jack. Urbane, articulate, thoughtful, fit (he swims and hikes), charming company, full of stories, and quite serious, though his {{conversation}} is punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter—he is reputably a great <b>slagger</b> with colleagues, and is very well liked." [...] Kelly himself said:I like humour — but I'm very suspicious of people who laugh all the time, because they never listen to what you're saying, they always — have another agenda and they generally have no sense of humour. The most untrustworthy body language I know is that of the person who laughs all the time. That terrifies me. People with no sense or a very limited sense of humour I am very wary of too, because it's not a sign of great intelligence to be without a sense of humour. If you've no sense of irony you haven't a great decision making capacity because you must see the possibilities of the downside of any decision. Without perspective you can't have any wisdom, so it frightens me when I meet captains of industry or whatever who have virtually no sense of humour. That's the kind of person I find dismaying.|$|E
5000|$|Bill's gang {{included}} {{his brothers}} Al, George and Floyd, a brother in law named Adam <b>Slagger,</b> {{and two other}} unidentified men. Of the nine man posse, only Henry Barrett had any combat experience, having fought with Theodore Roosevelt at the Battle of San Juan Hill in 1898. At a place 300 yards away from camp, the posse dismounted their horses and tied them up to some trees in order to confront the outlaws on foot. The posse then headed to the camp from the west, which meant that the lawmen would have to fire into the sunlight if a firefight began. The deep canyon was shadowed and it provided a good defensive position for the Smith Gang. When the posse reached the camp, Tofolla, Hamblin and Bill Maxwell continued forward into a clearing to demand the outlaws' surrender while Barrett and the five others remained behind the cover or a ridge. After Bill Maxwell called out the demand, Bill Smith replied: [...] "All right, which way {{do you want us}} to come out?" [...] Maxwell responded: [...] "Come right out this way." [...] About this time, Barrett, who could see what was going on from the ridge, yelled out for Tofolla and the two others to lie down for cover, but only Hamblin took the advice.|$|E
5000|$|The gang {{was formed}} {{no later than}} 1898 and {{included}} Bill Smith, his younger brothers Al, George and Floyd, a brother in law named Adam <b>Slagger</b> and two other unidentified men. Before moving to Arizona, Bill was a rustler in the Indian Territory where he worked with the Dalton Gang. In 1898 the Smith brothers were living with their mother and sisters at a ranch located near the Blue River in northeastern Graham County, Arizona. That year the brothers were arrested for stealing unbranded calves from ranchers Henry Barrett, a former Rough Rider, and Bill Phelps. Bill assumed full responsibility for the crime so his brothers were released. Bill spent {{the next several months}} in jail at St. Johns and he was said to have developed a grudge against Henry Barrett. Eventually Bill planned to make his escape from police custody. The jailer at St. Johns, Tom Berry, found Bill to be such a hard sleeper that it was necessary to enter his cell every morning to wake him up. One morning when Berry walked into the cell, Bill Smith revealed a [...]45 caliber revolver which had been smuggled to him by his brother Al. Bill then locked Berry in the cell and escaped to New Mexico Territory for a year. By 1900 the gang was well known in the Southwest for their thievery along the Mogollon Rim.|$|E
