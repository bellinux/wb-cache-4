40|$|Provide a brief {{description}} of the issue and reason for the proposed amendment. If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Some station service loads are supplied by a Local Distribution Company (LDC). The majority of these locations have pre-market opening, non-compliant metering installed. Market rules dictate these meters must be upgraded as Registered Wholesale Meters (RWM) to be Market Rule compliant. Hydro One has 6 station <b>service</b> <b>meter</b> points due for upgrade in 2005. The cost (based on a class A estimate) to bring this into full compliance with RWM standards would be $ 800, 000. Wholesale Revenue metering Standard – Hardware Issue 4. 0, Section 3. 3. 3 does allow for separate revenue metering to be installed to meter station service supply. This amendment proposes clarification that energy metering can be used to provide the basis for an energy estimate at considerable cost savings.

40|$|A {{corporate}} headquarters complex located in Dallas, TX {{consists of four}} buildings served by a central utility plant. The Continuous Commissioning? (CC?) process was applied to one building with approximately 688, 000 square feet of primarily of data floor space. This building {{was identified as a}} candidate for the CC process because it consumed 58 % of the 132 million kWh of electricity used by the complex in 2010 and had recently received several HVAC upgrades. CC is an ongoing process for existing buildings and central plant facilities to resolve operating problems, improve comfort, optimize energy use, and identify retrofits based on current building usage rather than original design intent [1]. The data floor optimization process consisted of three components: traditional commissioning activities, CC measure implementation, and low cost retrofits. Various M&V strategies were also utilized to quantify the resulting energy savings in a building whose energy use is dominated by data equipment load. Using six months of pre- and post- implementation HVAC equipment electrical <b>service</b> <b>meter</b> trend data, a savings of 948, 700 kWh was achieved. When these savings are extrapolated to twelve months, this project is expected to reduce the 2010 HVAC electricity usage by 25 % ($ 133, 000). Once the central plant savings are included, the overall savings of this project is approximately $ 146, 000 /year...|$|E

50|$|<b>Metered</b> <b>service</b> (also called pay-per-use) {{is another}} {{strategy}} utilized to change Internet pricing other than tiered service. This model represents a usage-based pricing scheme that charges users {{based on their}} packet usages. <b>Metered</b> <b>service</b> contrasts with the model of paying a flat fee on a recurring basis to have unlimited access to a given good or <b>service.</b> This <b>metering</b> scheme not only satisfies ISPs in terms of recovering cost, but also enables users to rethink their usage patterns with a price signal. This pricing plan can benefit low-volume users because <b>metered</b> <b>service</b> might create new and possibly lower price points for those users. On the other hand, research shows that price {{is the most important}} factor for users, among other factors such as Internet speed, which indicates that broadband users are price-sensitive. Price-sensitivity explains why few consumers like having to think about how much they are using the Internet. In addition, from the users’ perspective, one study suggested that consumers might have far less tolerance for unsolicited advertising, spam emails, banner advertising, and third party users of throughput when they are required to consider the cost for the amount of traffic. However, from the ISPs’ perspective, one study indicates that a usage-based pricing scheme does not cause ISPs’ discrimination incentives against content providers because ISPs are able to gain sufficient profits for the network investment to meet market needs.|$|R

Two linear regression equations, one for an A. M. peak-hour adjustment and one for a P. M. peak-hour adjustment, were developed using vehicle trip counts and easily measured site and surrounding area context variables from a sample of 50 smart-growth sites in California. Many of the contextual variables that were associated with lower vehicle trip generation at the smart-growth study sites were correlated. Therefore, variables representing characteristics such as residential population density, employment density, transit <b>service,</b> <b>metered</b> on-street parking, and building setback distance from the sidewalk were combined into a single “smart-growth factor” {{that was used in}} the linear regression equations. The A. M. peak-hour and P. M. peak-hour adjustment equations are only appropriate for planning-level analysis at sites in smart-growth areas. In addition, the method is only appropriate for single land uses in several common categories, such as office, mid- to high-density residential, restaurant, and coffee/donut shop. The method uses data from California, but the methodological approach could provide a framework for adjusting ITE trip-generation estimates in smart-growth areas throughout the United States...|$|R
