40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. seams <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> <b>threads</b> of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. seams <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight stitch. 3. seams stitched (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. seams <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun <b>thread</b> produced seams <b>with</b> greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed <b>with</b> polyester/cotton core-spun <b>thread</b> also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable seams <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> the zigzag <b>stitch,</b> Stitch length affected seam breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|R

She is making the craft work {{in the form of}} specific motifs embroidered {{on both sides of the}} product. On one face of the fabric the motifs express the women's anguish to the form of the violent behavior of drunk men towards his wife, act of giving dowry seeking a groom during marriage, village men gathered at a village meeting place, and women covered with a veil. The other face of the product depicts a woman's ambition of earning a living by selling her product in a market place or a woman lecturing in an assembly of people, a woman holding court and showing her prowess. The materials used in making this product now are expensive cotton such as [...] "Salita" [...] or cheaper variety of white or coloured markeen, Tussar silk, casement cloth, and embroidery threads such as moon thread or rangoli or anchor thread. The motifs are designed by the women sewing the quilt, usually of their choice. The embroidery is done as a fine running <b>stitch</b> <b>with</b> <b>thread</b> of the same colour as the back ground cloth. For the main outline of the proposed pattern, chain stitch using black, brown and red thread is used.|$|R
50|$|Right-Angle weave stitch, {{also known}} as RAW, is an off-loom bead weaving technique. Beads are <b>stitched</b> {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>thread</b> only making right angle turns, hence the name. The result is an almost fabric like piece of beadwork. Right-Angle weave can be woven with either one needle or two. With single needle right-angle weave, the thread path moves in a figure-eight pattern. For double needle right-angle weave, the threads cross each other along the center bead of each stitch as they head in opposite directions. RAW can be formed into flat pieces, tubes, or 3 dimensional figures. There are also variations on the basic stich like cubic right angle weave, or CRAW. Seed beads, fire polished beads and crystal beads are common choices in pieces using right-angle weave.|$|R

It was sheathed in a crimson scabbard, and the belt of Spanish leather studded with silver bosses was wound crosswise around it. From the hilt of the sword dangled the gilt spurs of his coming knighthood. At a little distance behind his squire followed Myles, the centre of all observation. He was clad in a novitiate dress, arranged under Lord George's personal supervision. It had been made somewhat differently from the fashion usual at such times, and was intended to indicate in a manner the candidate's extreme youthfulness and virginity in arms. The outer garment was a tabard robe of white wool, embroidered at the hem with fine lines of silver, and gathered loosely at the waist with a belt of lavender leather <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> <b>thread</b> of silver. Beneath he was clad in armor (a present from the Earl), new and polished till it shone with dazzling brightness, the breastplate covered with a juppon of white satin, embroidered with silver. Behind Myles, and upon either hand, came his squires of honor, sponsors, and friends--a little company of some half-dozen in all.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{reinforcement}} {{by stitching}} {{is effective in}} improving the impact resistance of composites. Stitching, however, adversely affects the composite's in-plane mechanical responses, and alters its damage mechanisms due to stitch-induced irregularities. We experimentally investigate the effect of two important stitch parameters, stitch density and thread diameter, on the damage characteristics of 3 D stitched multidirectional composites under in-plane tension using X-ray radiography, X-ray micro-computed tomography and digital image correlation (DIC). Our study shows that composites <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> thicker <b>thread</b> exhibit improved tensile strength due to effective hindrance of edge-delamination. We also found that stitch thread affects damage behaviors. A higher number of transverse cracks develops in the middle portion of thin 90 ° fiber tows; the inter-crack distance is reduced by dense stitching.

40|$|Background: A {{large number}} of women undergo {{caesarean}} section throughout the world. These women pass {{through a period of}} post operative pain and a morbidity period. These women translate into a substantial portion of population and hence there is a load on the financial resources of healthcare system. Use of the appropriate technique to approximate the wound after caesarean section would not only avoid financial load but also help in early recovery of the patient. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the effects of alternative techniques for closure of subcutaneous fat and skin on maternal health and use of healthcare resources in caesarean section. Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing Caesarean section were divided in two groups of one thousand patients each. Patients with hematological disorders or a malignancy, diabetes, septicemia or chorioamnionitis were excluded from the study. In all the patients, after stitching the uterus, the rectus sheath was <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> <b>thread</b> vicryl No. 1 (synthetic absorbable braided sutures with polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone and calcium stearate coating), using a round body needle. Then the patients were divided into two groups. In group I, vicryl No. 1 thread used in stitching of the rectus sheath was continued into the skin with application of subcuticular stitches, after securing the edges with a knot. In group II, after stitching the rectus sheath with vicryl No. 1, the thread was cut and interrupted sutures were applied in subcutaneous fat <b>with</b> <b>thread</b> vicryl No. 2. Skin was <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> subcuticular <b>stitches</b> using proline 2, a non-absorbable propylene suture. The two groups of patients were observed for the duration of surgery, post-operative pain in stitches, patient satisfaction about removal of stitches, evidence of wound infection or seroma, and cosmetic results. Results: It was noted that the duration of surgery in group I was on average 7. 5 minutes less as compared to the duration in group II. Patients in group I were more satisfied with the results of the surgery and were relieved to know that their stitches did not need to be removed. Conclusion: Although no difference was found in the rates of wound infection and formation of scar tissue between the group I and group II, the duration of surgery was less and the patients were more satisfied in group I...|$|R

This is {{a rather}} sadistic and gory version of the story, though in this respect it resembles the original novel more than some more romantic versions. There is a Faustian motif throughout and the film features extracts from Gounods opera Faust - as in the original novel. In this version, the Phantom was a handsome young man who sold his soul to the Devil in return for being loved for his music - his disfigurement is the Devils way of making sure he is loved for no other reason. An additional innovation is that, instead of putting on masks, the Phantom <b>stitches</b> his disguises <b>with</b> <b>thread</b> and needle into his skin.|$|R

40|$|The {{embroidery}} cloth called suzani {{has been}} widely produced and used in Central Asia. Prepared by female member of a family for a girl's marriageable age, it originally constituted {{a crucial part of}} dowry in which a bride brought some ten pieces of suzani with her. The making process of a suzani work is unique: firstly, a rough sketch is drawn on a narrow cloth. Secondly, the design on the cloth is <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> silk <b>thread.</b> Lastly, several pieces of embroidered cloth are sewed together into a single large work. This large suzani is used in various ways such as a wall-hanging, a prayer rug, and a table cloth. This paper is a preliminary report on ai palak or palak, one of the regional types of suzani centred at Tashkent and Pskent in Uzbekistan. In general, an ai palak cloth represents one or more than one red roundel motif. While smaller motifs show stars, larger ones indicate the moon and moonlight even though there are several similar motifs. In other words, ai palak represents the night sky in which the moon and stars are shining. In addition to the above report, the paper introduces recent circumstances of the suzani production both in handmade and machine-made industry...|$|R
