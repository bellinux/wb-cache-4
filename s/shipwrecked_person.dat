Anyhow, I'm sure they would kill you. You see, Ralph, I've been a good while in them parts, and I've visited the {{different}} groups of islands oftentimes as a trader. And thorough-goin' blackguards some o' them traders are--no better than pirates, I can tell you. One captain that I sailed with was not a chip better than the one we're with now. He was trading with a friendly chief one day aboard his vessel. The chief had swam off to us with the things for trade tied atop of his head, for them chaps are like otters in the water. Well, the chief was hard on the captain, and would not part with some o' his things. When their bargainin' was over they shook hands, and the chief jumped overboard to swim ashore; but before he got forty yards from the ship, the captain seized a musket and shot him dead. He then hove up anchor and put to sea, and as we sailed along the shore he dropped six black fellows with his rifle, remarkin' that `that would spoil the trade for the next-comers.' But, as I was sayin', I'm up to the ways o' these fellows. One o' the laws o' the country is that every <b>shipwrecked</b> <b>person</b> {{who happens to be}} cast ashore, be he dead or alive, is doomed to be roasted and eaten. There was a small tradin' schooner wrecked off one of these islands when we were lyin' there in harbour during a storm. The crew was lost--all but three men, who swam ashore. The moment they landed, they were seized by the natives and carried up into the woods. We knew pretty well what their fate would be; but we could not help them, for our crew was small, and if we had gone ashore they would likely have killed us all. We never saw the three men again. But we heard frightful yelling and dancing and merrymaking that night; and one of the natives, who came aboard to trade with us next day, told us that the long pigs, as he called the men, had been roasted and eaten, and their bones were to be converted into sail-needles. He also said that white men were bad to eat, and that most o' the people on shore were sick." ...|$|E

Their treatment of Zeppa, therefore, must have been owing to some feeling of respect or awe, inspired by his obvious insanity, coupled, no doubt, with his commanding size and presence as well as his singular conduct on the occasion of their first meeting.|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1791 John Bell (1747-1798) had devised an {{apparatus}} for throwing {{a line to}} ships from the shore; and, concurrently with Trengrouse, Captain George William Manby was engaged in perfecting an apparatus very similar to Bell's. The idea occurred to Manby in February 1807, after the grounding of HMS Snipe a mere 50 yards off shore in a storm and the subsequent loss of 67 lives, and in August he exhibited some experiments {{to the members of}} the Suffolk House Humane Society. He sought to establish communication between the shore and the shipwreck by means of a line fastened to a barbed shot which was fired from a mortar on the shore. By means of this line a hawser was drawn out from the shore to the ship, and along it was run a cradle in which the <b>shipwrecked</b> <b>persons</b> were landed. This invention had been recommended by various committees, and adopted to some extent before 1814.|$|R

40|$|On March 31 1854 {{representatives of}} Japan and the United States signed a {{historic}} treaty. A United States naval officer, Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry [April 10, 1794 – March 4, 1858], negotiated tirelessly {{for several months}} with Japanese officials to achieve the goal of opening the doors of trade with Japan. For two centuries, Japanese ports were closed to {{all but a few}} Dutch and Chinese traders. The United States hoped Japan would agree to open certain ports so American vessels could begin to trade with the mysterious island kingdom. In addition to interest in the Japanese market, America needed Japanese ports to replenish coal and supplies for the commercial whaling fleet. On July 8, 1853 four black ships led by USS Powhatan and commanded by Commodore Matthew Perry, anchored at Edo (Tokyo) Bay. Never before had the Japanese seen ships steaming with smoke. They thought the ships were 2 ̆ 2 giant dragons puffing smoke. 2 ̆ 2 They did not know that steamboats existed and were shocked by the number and size of the guns on board the ships. At age 60, Matthew Perry had a long and distinguished naval career. He knew that the mission to Japan would be his most significant accomplishment. He brought a letter from the President of the United States, Millard Fillmore, to the Emperor of Japan. He waited with his armed ships and refused to see any of the lesser dignitaries sent by the Japanese, insisting on dealing only with the highest emissaries of the Emperor. The Japanese government realized that their country was in no position to defend itself against a foreign power, and Japan could not retain its isolation policy without risking war. On March 31, 1854, after weeks of long and tiresome talks, Perry received what he had so dearly worked for [...] a treaty with Japan. The treaty provided for: Peace and friendship between the United States and Japan. Opening of two ports to American ships at Shimoda and Hakodate Help for any American ships wrecked on the Japanese coast and protection for <b>shipwrecked</b> <b>persons</b> Permission for American ships to buy supplies, coal, water, and other necessary provisions in Japanese ports. After the signing of the treaty, the Japanese invited the Americans to a feast. The Americans admired the courtesy and politeness of their hosts, and thought very highly of the rich Japanese culture. Commodore Perry broke down barriers that separated Japan {{from the rest of the}} world. Today the Japanese celebrate his expedition with annual black ship festivals. Perry lived in Newport, Rhode Island, which also celebrates a Black Ship festival in July. In Perry 2 ̆ 7 s honor, Newport has become Shimoda 2 ̆ 7 s sister city. ” U. S. Navy Museum (see notes).

6000|$|... § 3. There {{is another}} {{distinction}} often neglected {{in the discussion}} of this subject, which it is extremely important to observe. The theory of the subjection of social progress to invariable laws, is often held in conjunction with the doctrine, that social progress can not be materially influenced by the exertions of individual persons, or by the acts of governments. But though these opinions are often held by the same persons, they are two very different opinions, and the confusion between them is the eternally recurring error of confounding Causation with Fatalism. Because whatever happens will be the effect of causes, human volitions among the rest, it does not follow that volitions, even those of peculiar individuals, are not of great efficacy as causes. If any one in a storm at sea, because about the same number of persons in every year perish by shipwreck, should conclude that it was useless for him to attempt to save his own life, we should call him a Fatalist; and should remind him that the efforts of <b>shipwrecked</b> <b>persons</b> to save their lives are so far from being immaterial, that the average amount of those efforts is one of the causes on which the ascertained annual number of deaths by shipwreck depend. However universal the laws of social development may be, they can not be more universal or more rigorous than those of the physical agencies of nature; yet human will can convert these into instruments of its designs, {{and the extent to which}} it does so makes the chief difference between savages and the most highly civilized people. Human and social facts, from their more complicated nature, are not less, but more, modifiable than mechanical and chemical facts; human agency, therefore, has still greater power over them. And accordingly, those who maintain that the evolution of society depends exclusively, or almost exclusively, on general causes, always include among these the collective knowledge and intellectual development of the race. But if of the race, why not also of some powerful monarch or thinker, or of the ruling portion of some political society, acting through its government? Though the varieties of character among ordinary individuals neutralize one another on any large scale, exceptional individuals in important positions do not in any given age neutralize one another; there was not another Themistocles, or Luther, or Julius Cæsar, of equal powers and contrary dispositions, who exactly balanced the given Themistocles, Luther, and Cæsar, and prevented them from having any permanent effect. Moreover, for aught that appears, the volitions of exceptional persons, or the opinions and purposes of the individuals who at some particular time compose a government, may be indispensable links in the chain of causation by which even the general causes produce their effects; and I believe this to be the only tenable form of the theory.|$|R

The ocean covers 71 per cent of the Earth's surface and contains 97 per cent of the planet's water, yet more than 95 per cent of the underwater world remains unexplored. These waters have separated but also connected civilizations over thousands of years and have been the carrier of many human adventures. As civilizations grew more advanced humans began to explore the vast oceans. In 1488 Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, establishing the possibility of a sea route to the Far East. In 1492, Columbus's voyage to the New World is regarded as the moment of birth for westward exploration. Bristol merchants first probed the Atlantic in 1480 in search of an island they called Brasile and they continued to send two or three ships west every year. During such expeditions, over centuries, with population explosions, {{and the use of the}} sea for the transportation of both goods and people, not to mention wars and sea battles, ships have sunk all around the world.
