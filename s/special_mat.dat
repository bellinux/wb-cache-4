40|$|Taekwon-do as {{a combat}} sport {{technique}} has a characteristic feature – very fast element execution, {{and it is}} one of the factors that determine how successful is a fight. One of the main tasks of the training process is to develop kick speed both in attack and counterattack, where an athlete should react adequately and execute a purposeful element as fast as possible to overtake his opponent. In the training process a coach tries to perfect an athlete’s technique and increase his speed ability. But the question arises how to test whether the applied method and means have increased the speed of the element execution by the trainee. In many cases the result will be stated subjectively observing the kick imitation or element execution in training or competition fights. In the best case the result will be measured using a stopwatch, the fighter executing several kicks, taking the total execution time and dividing it with the number of kicks. To evaluate objectively both the execution of the element technique (trajectory) and speed and acceleration in different kicking phases, it is necessary to apply more effective instrumental methods and carry out a detailed movement analysis. Nowadays technologies with high-speed video (100 Hz and higher) allow us to evaluate these parameters objectively. In many countries research is carried out in different combat sports as karate, taekwondo WTF (World Taekwondo Federation) etc. Unfortunately in Latvia such research is not so widespread and is done only in some kinds of sport. So, it is valuable to introduce new technologies to research technique and speed ability in taekwon-do ITF (International Taekwondo Federation), that will help to organize, perfect and control the study-training process better. The aim of the research was stating of the attack element execution speed in taekwon-do ITF. The data registration was done in LASE wrestling hall on taekwon-do ITF <b>special</b> <b>mat.</b> Movement analysis was performed using two high speed Basler A 602 fc cameras (100 Hz) and SIMI Motion software. Light-reflecting markers were placed on three body landmarks: hip (Trochanter Major), knee (Condylus Lateralis) and ankle (Malleolus Lateralis). The research subject was a black belt (dan 1) taekwondo fighter (age: 26 years; height: 165 cm; weight: 60. 1 kg; experience in sport: 15 years), first, second and third place winner at national and international tournaments.

50|$|Aerialists {{train for}} their jumping {{maneuvers}} {{during the summer}} months by skiing on specially constructed water ramps and landing in a large swimming pool. An example of this is the Utah Olympic Park training facility. A water ramp consists of a wooden ramp covered with a <b>special</b> plastic <b>mat</b> that when lubricated with sprinklers allows an athlete to ski down the ramp towards a jump. The skier then skis off the wooden jump and lands safely in a large swimming pool. A burst of air is sent up {{from the bottom of the}} pool just before landing to break up the surface tension of the water, thus softening the impact of the landing. Skiers sometimes reinforce the skis that they use for water-ramping with 6mm of fiberglass or cut holes in the front and back in order to soften the impact when landing properly on their skis.|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the content}} of solute {{elements}} in cold rolled ferritic steels constitutes an important aspect in metallurgy, since the interstitial elements have a harmful effect on the anisotropy properties (i. e. texture) of the final product, usually steel sheets for automotive applications. Both the carbon and nitrogen contents in solid solution depend on the chemical composition and thermomechanical parameters, such as the coiling temperature (CT) and the cold reduction degree. In the present paper, thermoelectric power measurements technique {{has been applied to}} study the relationship between the process variables such as CT and cold rolling reduction, and the amount of interstitial elements in solid solution. It was shown that at high CTs the value of the thermoelectric power only depends on the carbon content in solid solution, meanwhile at low CTs, a second contribution should be considered due to the presence of nitrogen in solid solutionfinancial support from the European Union through the European Coal and Steel Community programme (ECSC- 7210 -PR- 368) and from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (<b>Special</b> Action <b>MAT</b> 2002 - 10810 -E) Peer reviewe...|$|R
