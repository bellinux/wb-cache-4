40|$|Elimination of the {{onchocerciasis}} vector Simulium neavei through larvicidal {{operations in}} focal areas of Kenya in 1946, 1953, and 1955 achieved complete interruption of transmission. Since no treatment {{was administered to}} the infected population, the areas provided an opportunity for studying the natural course of the infection in man {{in the absence of}} reinfection, with particular emphasis on its average duration and the effect of duration of exposure to the infection. In a follow-up survey conducted in 1964 in four focal areas, approximately 2000 people were examined parasitologically and clinically; slightly over half this group were also given a thorough ophthalmological examination. The results showed that, 11 years after interruption of transmission, live Onchocerca volvulus adults were present in nodules and microfilariae were present in the skin; after 18 years, however, microfilariae were no longer found in the skin. Assuming that in hyperendemic areas parasites are acquired until shortly before interruption of transmission, it can thus be postulated that O. volvulus worms lose their reproductive potentiality after 16 years or possibly earlier. A comparison of recent microfilarial rates with adjusted rates found in earlier surveys seems to indicate that the onchocercal infection, after interruption of transmission, follows a <b>straight</b> <b>regression</b> <b>line,</b> theoretically reaching zero after about 13 - 17 years...|$|E

This study makes a development of the barymetric equations of females and males of Ndama of birth in 20 months of age. By age group, the thoracic perimeter (Pt) and the live weight (PV) have collected for 253 males and 405 females. The males are born with an average weight from 19. 5 ± 0. 5 kg and females with 18. 14 ± 0. 5 kg (td> 1. 96). In the 16 th month the live weight is not different but significant (114. 5 ± 10 kg and 90. 1 ± 5 kg).

40|$|For {{explanation}} of the mechanism of microfilarial periodicity, it is a basic problem to know the survival time of microfilaria in the host. Therefore, there have been reported several papers concerning the experimental investigations on it. Viewing these papers reported in the past, however, there is found a great difference in the survival times obtained by each investigator. This disagreement may due to the irrationality of procedual method employed in these studies. In the present study, the author attempts to discuss the longevity and viability of microfilaria in various conditions from the results obtained by using a new method originated by us. When the heparinized blood containing microfilaria is maintained in a test-tube, living microfilariae swarm together near the boundary area between the blood plasma and the blood cell sediment. Microfilariae were isolated from there by pippett, removed to the various kind of media in the watch-glass and then incubated in the glass capillaries. Under microscope, the activity of each microfilaria was checked until all microfilariae died and the numbers were counted every 8 hours. When the commulative mortality was drawn on logarithmic scale. a <b>straight</b> <b>regression</b> <b>line</b> could be obtained. The theoretical mean survival time can be represented by the 50 per cent value of mortality on this regression line. For this observation, microfilaria of Dirofilaria immitis and Wuchereria bancrofti were used and the total numbers in each group of the experiment were approximately 1, 000 - 3, 000. First of all, the viability was tested at various temperatures and in various media such as distilled water, physiological saline solution, and the blood plasma of animals and human beings. When one compares the mortality curves given by different temperatures from 5 ℃ to 37 ℃, {{it becomes clear that}} the survival time in vitro of microfilaria depends much on the temperature. Generally speaking, the survival time was longer in refrigerator at 5 ℃ than at room temperature of 20 ℃, while it was signifcantly short at 37 ℃. In physiological saline solution, the mean survival time of D. immitis microfilaria expressed by 50 per cent value was 216 hours at 5 ℃, 61 hours at 21 ℃, 9 hours at 37 ℃ respectively, but in each group, the last microfilaria was remained alive for 426 hours, 352 hours and 48 hours after all others died out. The survival time was also influenced by the kind of media in which microfilariae were incubated, for example, the mean survival time of D. immitis microfilaria at room temperature was approximately 74 hours in distilled water, 61 hours in physiological saline solution and 216 hours in the rabbit blood plasma, and it was longest in the blood plasma of non-infected dogs as long as 254 hours. It was of interest to note that the blood plasma of infected dog tend to reduce the survival time of D. immitis microfilaria. The survival time of bancroftian type microfilaria in vitro as compared to that of dog heart worm was relatively short in any conditions, especially the viability was found markedly inhibited in the blood plasma of animals other than human being. This finding suggest that bancroftian filarial worm has the high specificity in adaptation to the host. In order to see the longevity of microfilaria in vivo, the living microfilariae were transfused intraveneously into fresh animals. In the dogs received intraveneous transfusion of the blood containing about 950, 000 - 5, 700, 000 microfilariae of D. immitis, the microfilaria continued the emigration into the peripheral circulation for a long time at least more than 50 days, showing a nocturnal sub-periodic fluctuation in the number. However, the microfilariae transfused into rabbits disappeared from the peripheral blood within 21 days, during which the periodicity was rather indistinct. On the other hand, it was noticed that W. bancrofti microfilaria could not be demonstrated in the blood streams of recipient dog and rabbit, even if a large number of the larvae were given. However, of the animals which were autopsied immediately after tte transfusion, a moderate number of the living larva was usually recovered in the various organs such as the lung, liver and kidney. 1) 体外での仔虫の死亡経過は時間の対数と関係があり, 50 %値(MfMD_) を求め,その仔虫群の平均生存時間とすることが出来る. 2) 仔虫の生存時間は 5 ℃で最も長く, 37 ℃になると早く死亡する. 3) 夫々対応宿主の血漿内で最も長く生存するが,感染宿主血漿は抑制的に働く. 4) いかなる条件のもとでもバンクロフト仔虫は犬糸状虫のそれより生存時間が短く,人以外の動物血漿では早く死亡する. 5) 犬糸状虫仔虫は犬に移注されると長期にわたり末梢血中に出現し,夜間出現性を最後まで維持する. 家兎の場合はにれより速やかに消失し,早期より夜間出現性の乱れがみられる. 6) バンクロフト糸状虫仔虫は犬,家兎に移注を行っても末梢血内に出現せず,一部内臓や大血管に集積される. 本論文要旨の一部は第 21, 22 回日本寄生虫学会南日本支部大会(1968, 1969) 及び第 38 回日本寄生虫学会総会において報告した. 稿を終るに当り,終始御指導,御校閲頂いた恩師片峰大助教授に深甚の謝意を表します...|$|E
40|$|Approximation of {{the plane}} point finite system {{is not only a}} {{theoretical}} problem. It exists also in engineering and economy. The points on the plane are the result of investigation and experience. So, it is highly probable to obtain results – points that are “not congruent” with the others. Sometimes it happens just accidentally, it may, however, be also the evidence of some anomalies. In this article, we consider a finite plane points the system dispersed along the straight line, including the points “not congruent” with the system. While seeking the regression curve describing a given plane point system, we often ask ourselves to what extent the curve course is influenced by those “not congruent” points. The method proposed previously assumed that the curve course is not influenced substantially by those “not congruent” points and approximated the whole system by a straight line or eliminated those points and the remaining system was approximated by the straight line. In the method described below no point is rejected. As an approximating curve there was assumed a figure being the sum of point and straight lines, and afterwards its parameter were determined. The straight line obtained in this way – called the resistant <b>regression</b> <b>line</b> – does not depend on the “not congruent” points described by the point determined.

Since such the relationship seems to show a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>regression,</b> it has generally been ac-cepted that the scale increases in size proportionally with the increase in length of the fish.

In fact, it has frequently been sug-gested that in many fishes the "scale size-body length " relationship shows a curvilinear character when traced throughout their lives (reviews by Kubo and Yoshihara, 1957, and by Nikolsky, 1963). Furthermore, one might expect that the relative growth rate of scales would vary according to seasons even within a year.

In highly concentrated levels of porosity, both yield strength and elongation values decrease markedly. Correlation coefficients were obtained by simple <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>regression</b> analysis between the variables of ultimate tensile strength and pore level.

These results indicate that for equivalent RMP dosages adult patients reach a lower Cmax than adult volunteers and that adults, both volunteers and patients established on RMP reach higher Cmax values than children; children established on RMP require approximately twice the mg/kg body weight dosage of RMP to reach serum concentrations equivalent to those of adults. It is noteworthy that many adult patients receiving currently recommended RMP dosages also do not reach the often recommended RMP 2  h serum concentration of 8  μg/mL. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Belgian External Quality Assessment Scheme for Flow Cytometry {{evaluates the}} {{long-term}} analytical performance of participating laboratories by calculating a <b>regression</b> <b>line</b> between {{the target and}} reported values of each parameter for each laboratory during the past 3 years. This study aims to develop a method to find laboratories with aberrant variability or bias using robust techniques and to obtain robust estimates of the variability. METHODS: A method is proposed to find outliers {{with respect to the}} individual <b>regression</b> <b>line,</b> followed by a step to find <b>regression</b> <b>lines</b> with excessive variability and finally a step to find <b>regression</b> <b>lines</b> with high bias. RESULTS: The model was applied to the results obtained by 52 laboratories for CD 4 %. From the 1340 data points, 35 were determined to be regression outliers. The second step revealed one <b>regression</b> <b>line</b> with excessive variability; the third step detected three <b>regression</b> <b>lines</b> with exceeding bias. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology allows assessment of the long-term performance of laboratories, taking into account samples with different target values. Outliers in the first step indicate accidental mistakes, outliers {{in the second and third}} step point to high analytical variability or bias. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Três lotes de vacinas contra o sarampo, produzidos com a cepa de vírus Biken CAM- 70, sob as formas liofilizada e reconstituída, pertencentes ao estoque da rede de vacinação da Secretaria de Estado da Saúde de São Paulo, Brasil, foram submetidos a testes de sensibilidade à luz, à temperatura de 2 a 8 °C, e de termoestabilidade (protegidos da luz) às temperaturas de 28, 36, 5 e 45 °C, objetivando verificar por quanto tempo retinham sua potência, isto é, a concentração ideal recomendada para a cepa de vírus presente (3, 70 log 10 DICT 50 ou 5. 000 doses infectantes de cultura de tecidos 50 % por dose). A análise de retas de regressão ajustadas demonstrou que, de modo geral, tanto os lotes de vacinas liofilizados como os reconstituídos, mantidos às referidas temperaturas, expostos ou protegidos da luz, apresentaram queda de potência no decorrer do experimento, a qual foi mais acentuada para vacinas expostas à luz. Reconstituídos e mantidos a 2 a 8 °C, os lotes não apresentaram homogeneidade no referente à sensibilidade à luz. Quando a fotossensibilidade de lotes de vacinas liofilizadas foi testada a 2 a 8 °C eles mostraram-se mais sensíveis à degradação térmica quando expostos à luz do que quando protegidos dela. Entretanto, expostos ou protegidos, a potência foi {{inferior}} à minima aceita para a cepa Biken CAM- 70. Às demais temperaturas, mesmo ao abrigo da luz, os dois lotes não retiveram potência mínima. Quanto às vacinas do lote 3, conservadas a 2 a 8 °C, mantiveram-se de acordo com os requerimentos mínimos de potência durante 60 dias quando protegidas da luz, e durante 40 dias quando expostas a ela. A degradação térmica às demais temperaturas foi mais acentuada (28 °C: 5 dias; 36, 5 °C: 2 dias; 45 °C: 0, 5 dia). Considerando a concentração viral mínima que vacinas produzidas com a cepa Biken CAM- 70 devem conter para induzir efetiva resposta imunológica, os lotes de vacinas pesquisados (sob a forma liofilizada ou reconstituídos para administração) apresentaram, além de baixa estabilidade ao calor, pouca homogeneidade com relação a este parâmetro. Three different lots of measles vaccines {{produced with}} the Biken CAM- 70 virus strain were requested {{from the central}} cold store of the Public Health Department of the State of S. Paulo, Brazil, and assays on photosensitivity at 2 - 8 ° C, and on stability at 28, 36. 5 and 45 ° C were carried out {{to find out for}} how long these vaccines would maintain their minimum potency, established as being 3. 70 log 10 or 5000 TCID 50 (50 % tissue culture infective dose) per human dose. The analysis of the adjusted <b>straight</b> <b>regression</b> <b>lines</b> indicated that, with the passage of time, the potency of lyophilized or reconstituted vaccines, as well as of vaccines exposed to or protected from light decreased. Light-exposed vaccines, however, became less potent than vaccines protected from the light. None of the vaccine lots studied, reconstituted and stored at 2 - 8 ° C, exhibited homogeneity as to sensitivity to light. When freeze-dried vaccines had their photosensitivity studied at 2 - 8 ° C, lots 1 and 2 presented greater thermal degradation when exposed to light than when protected from it. However, in both instances, it was found that potency fell bellow that taken as minimum for the Biken CAM- 70 virus strain. At all other temperatures considered, even when protected from light, lots 1 and 2 did not retain the minimum potency. Lot 3 kept the expected stability for 60 days at 2 - 8 ° C when protected from light and for 40 days when unprotected, but its thermal degradation at other temperatures was more intense (28 ° C: 5 days; 36. 5 ° C: 2 days; 45 ° C: 0. 5 day). Taking into account the potency that measles vaccines produced with the Biken CAM- 70 virus strain are required to contain in order to induce effective immunity, the three vaccine lots studied were found to possess low thermal stability and to lack homogeneity both in the freeze-dried {{as well as in the}} reconstituted form...|$|R
