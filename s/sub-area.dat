5|$|Following {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} {{that had been}} required to provide effective coverage {{in response to the}} crises caused by the initial Japanese movements a review of the makeshift organisation was undertaken. In October 1942, the NGAWW Company was officially formed as part of New Guinea Force Signals to consolidate the Army, RAAF and Coastwatcher stations. Meanwhile, efforts were made to standardise equipment across the network and to implement common procedures. The company subsequently came under command of New Guinea Force Signals and its headquarters was established at 9-mile near Port Moresby. Captain Thomas Warren was in command of the company at this time. The establishment of the company at this time included a headquarters, a Moresby area section, a <b>sub-area</b> section, and a spotting station. <b>Sub-area</b> sections were raised as required and at various times were located at Milne Bay, Dobodura, Wau, Bena Bena, Bulolo, Nadzab, Gusap, Hollandia and Aitape. By the end of 1942 the company was maintaining 61 operational stations and had a strength of 180 men. In mid-1943, Warren was transferred to Milne Force and he handed over command temporarily to Captain Gordon King.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{alleviate}} the traffic congestion and reduce the complexity of traffic control and management, {{it is necessary to}} exploit traffic <b>sub-areas</b> division which should be effective in planing traffic. Some researchers applied the K-Means algorithm to divide traffic <b>sub-areas</b> on the taxi trajectories. However, the traditional K-Means algorithms faced difficulties in processing large-scale Global Position System(GPS) trajectories of taxicabs with the restrictions of memory, I/O, computing performance. This paper proposes a Parallel Traffic <b>Sub-Areas</b> Division(PTSD) method which consists of two stages, {{on the basis of the}} Parallel K-Means(PKM) algorithm. During the first stage, we develop a process to cluster traffic <b>sub-areas</b> based on the PKM algorithm. Then, the second stage, we identify boundary of traffic <b>sub-areas</b> on the base of cluster result. According to this method, we divide traffic <b>sub-areas</b> of Beijing on the real-word (GPS) trajectories of taxicabs. The experiment and discussion show that the method is effective in dividing traffic <b>sub-areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceData {{quality and}} budget are two primary {{concerns}} in urban-scale mobile crowdsensing applications. In this paper, we leverage the {{spatial and temporal}} correlation among the data sensed in different <b>sub-areas</b> to significantly reduce the required number of sensing tasks allocated (corresponding to budget), yet ensuring the data quality. Specifically, we propose a novel framework called CCS-TA, combining the state-of-the-art compressive sensing, Bayesian inference, and active learning techniques, to dynamically select a minimum number of <b>sub-areas</b> for sensing task allocation in each sensing cycle, while deducing the missing data of unallocated <b>sub-areas</b> under a probabilistic data accuracy guarantee. Evaluations on real-life temperature and air quality monitoring datasets show the effectiveness of CCS-TA.
