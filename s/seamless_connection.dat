While these operators are largely independent, provisions are being made to integrate them under Metrolinx, which manages transportation planning including public transport in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. GO Transit, which merged with Metrolinx during the late 2000s, is Ontario's only intra-regional public transit service, linking the communities in the GTA and the city of Hamilton, as well {{as the rest of the}} Greater Golden Horseshoe.

However, these plans were stalled when the distribution company for Perfect Blue (Rex Entertainment) went bankrupt. Coincidentally, Kon's next work would also feature {{the theme of}} the blending of imagination and reality. In 2002, Kon's second film, Millennium Actress, was released to the public. The film centers on a retired actress who mysteriously withdraws from the public eye at the peak of her career. Having the same estimated budget as Perfect Blue (approximately 120,000,000 yen), Millennium Actress garnered higher critical and financial success than its predecessor and earned numerous awards. The screenplay was written by Sadayuki Murai, who utilized a <b>seamless</b> <b>connection</b> between illusion and reality to create a [...] "Trompe-l'œil kind of film". Millennium Actress was the first Satoshi Kon film to feature Susumu Hirasawa, of whom Kon was a long-time fan, as composer.|$|E

Talking through signal nodes, MSE established a <b>seamless</b> <b>connection</b> from the battlefield even back to commercial telephone lines.

2500|$|Despite the {{presence}} of a passageway linking the Fulton Street complex and the Cortlandt Street BMT station, there is no free connection between the two stations. There was a plan to implement a now-canceled free transfer to connect the Cortlandt Street platforms to the Chambers Street–World Trade Center [...] station; there will still be paid transfers to the Fulton Street complex and the two Cortlandt Street stations when the WTC Transportation Hub is opened. The connection will still be possible via an out-of-system transfer through the WTC Transportation Hub when it is completed. According to the MTA's Final Environmental Impact Statement, the Dey Street Passageway is intended to provide a <b>seamless</b> <b>connection</b> from the Fulton Center to the WTC Transportation Hub and Brookfield Place (formerly the World Financial Center) without the need to cross Church Street and Broadway, both of which are busy traffic arteries in Lower Manhattan.

40|$|Soft handoff {{techniques}} in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems provide mobile calls with <b>seamless</b> <b>connections</b> between adjacent cells. Channel reservation schemes {{are used to}} give high priority to more important soft handoff attempts over new call attempts. However, since the number of soft handoff attempts varies according to environmental conditions, fixed reservation schemes for handoff attempts can be inefficient. An adaptive channel reservation scheme is herein proposed to control the size of reservation capacity according to varying the number of soft handoff attempts. The proposed scheme also includes a balancing procedure between soft handoff failure and new call blocking to maximize the system capacity. To evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed scheme, a Markovian model is developed that considers the interference-limited capacity effect of DS-CDMA systems. Analytical result shows that the proposed scheme yields a considerable enhancement in terms of new call blocking and soft handoff failure probabilities when compared with the conventional fixed channel reservation scheme...|$|R
