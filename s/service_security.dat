The RSHA was divided into main departments, including the Kripo, which became Department V of the RSHA. Department V was also known as the Reich Criminal Police Office (Reichskriminalpolizeiamt, or RKPA). Kripo's stated mission, which Nebe embraced, was to [...] "exterminate criminality". Under his leadership, equipped with arbitrary powers of arrest and detention, the Kripo acted more and more like the Gestapo, including the liberal use of so-called protective custody and large-scale roundups of [...] "asocials".|$|E

40|$|Web <b>Services</b> (WS) <b>security</b> has {{undergone}} an enormous development, as {{carried out by}} the major organizations and consortiums of the industry over the last few years. This has brought about the appearance of a huge number of WS security standards. Such a fact has made organizations remain reticent about adopting technologies based on this paradigm, due to the learning curve which is inevitable in the integration of security into their practical deployments. In this paper we present PWSSec (Process for Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security),</b> which enables the integration of a set of specific security stages into the traditional phases of WS-based systems development. PWSSec defines three stages, WSSecReq (Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security</b> Requirements), WSSecArch (Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security</b> Architecture) and WSSecTech (Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security</b> Technologies). These facilitate, respectively, the definition of WS-specific security requirements, the development of a WS-based security architecture and the identification of the WS security standards that the security architecture must articulate in order to implement the <b>security</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|Web <b>Services</b> (WS hereafter) <b>Security</b> is {{a crucial}} aspect for {{technologies}} based on this paradigm to be completely adopted by the industry. As a consequence, a lot of initiatives have arisen during the last years setting as their main purpose the standardization of the security factors related to this paradigm. In fact, over the past years, the most important consortiums of Internet, like IETF, W 3 C or OASIS, are producing {{a huge number of}} WS-based security standards. Despite of this growing, there’s not exist yet a process that guides developers in the critical task of integrating security within all the stages of the development’s life cycle of WS-based software. Such a process should facilitate developers in the activities of web service-specific security requirements specification, web services-based security architecture design and web <b>services</b> <b>security</b> standards selection, integration and deployment. In this article we briefly present the PWSSec (Process for Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security)</b> process that is composed of three stages, WSSecReq (Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security</b> Requirements), WSSecArch (Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security</b> Architecture) and WSSecTech (Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security</b> Technologies) that accomplishes the mentioned activities, respectively. We also provide a thorough explanation of the WSSecArch (Web <b>Services</b> <b>Security</b> Stage) stage intended to design the web services-based security architecture.

In particular the current implementations of message-level Web <b>services</b> <b>security</b> are very slow and therefore extremely vulnerable to even the simplest types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
