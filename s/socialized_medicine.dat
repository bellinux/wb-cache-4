25|$|In the {{political}} philosophy of healthcare, {{the debate between}} universal healthcare and private healthcare is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives {{by the federal government}} to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine,</b> many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage. Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.|$|E

25|$|A poll {{conducted}} for KSTP-TV in the Twin Cities in October showed Oberstar ahead of Cravaack {{by only one}} point, 47 to 46 percent. Cravaack received the endorsement of former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as the polls tightened. He was also endorsed by Minnesota's largest pro-life organization, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, and the largest newspaper in the district, the Duluth News Tribune. In the November 2 election, Cravaack scored {{one of the biggest}} upsets in Minnesota political history, defeating Oberstar by only 4,400 votes, 48 percent to 47 percent. Cravaack believed the abortion issue was crucial to his victory; he had argued that the health care legislation that Oberstar had voted for allowed for the payment of abortions with taxpayer funds, and encouraged euthanasia for the elderly. By the time he won the election, Cravaack characterized the bill as an example of <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine</b> that will result in the rationing of medical care.|$|E

In his speech, Reagan purports that Social Security is a socialist attempt to supplant private savings, and eventually concludes that, [...] "Pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or {{what he will do}} for a living.

In 1997, Pason called auto insurance [...] "a regressive tax against working people". Moore was also vocal of his support for public healthcare and <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine.</b> Moore believes that capitalism is a system based on both exploitation and selfishness, which operates to serve the interests of corporations and the ruling class, at the expense of workers and the poor. During his presidential campaign he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon [...] "greed", and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon economic democracy through social ownership and workers' control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions.|$|E

An associate pastor of the Collingswood church, Charles Richter, known to listeners as [...] "Amen Charlie," [...] regularly [...] "amened" [...] his support of McIntire's statements. During the 1960s, the program may have been heard on as many as 600 radio stations—although McIntire's inaccuracy with numbers became legendary.

He describes four tiers of taxes in his potential presidency, the top bracket being taxed at fifteen percent on income above US$ one million per year. Trump writes he would abolish Corporate tax in the United States. With regards to Social Security, Trump recommends lifting {{the age at which}} individuals retire in order to save the government money to spend elsewhere. Trump describes himself as for increased military spending, critical of free trade, and for curtailing immigration to the United States.

2500|$|Burgess was a Conservative (though, as he {{clarified}} in {{an interview}} with The Paris Review, his political views could be considered [...] "a kind of anarchism" [...] since his ideal of a [...] "Catholic Jacobite imperial monarch" [...] wasn't practicable), a (lapsed) Catholic and Monarchist, harbouring a distaste for all republics. He believed that socialism for the most part was [...] "ridiculous" [...] but did [...] "concede that <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine</b> is a priority in any civilized country today." [...] To avoid the 90% tax the family would have incurred because of their high income, they left Britain and toured Europe in a Bedford Dormobile motor-home. During their travels through France and across the Alps, Burgess wrote {{in the back of the}} van as Liana drove. In this period, he wrote novels and produced film scripts for Lew Grade and Franco Zeffirelli. His first place of residence after leaving England was Lija, Malta (1968–70). The negative reaction from a lecture that Burgess delivered to an audience of Catholic priests in Malta precipitated a move by the couple to Italy. The Burgesses maintained a flat in Rome, a country house in Bracciano, and a property in Montalbuccio. On hearing rumours of a mafia plot to kidnap Paolo-Andrea while the family was staying in Rome, Burgess decided to move to Monaco in 1975. Burgess was also motivated to move to the tax haven of Monaco as the country did not levy income tax and widows were exempt from death duties, a form of taxation on their husband's estates.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the goals}} of <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine</b> systems is {{ensuring}} universal access to health care. Opponents of <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine</b> say that access for low-income individuals can be achieved by means other than <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine,</b> for example, income-related subsidies can function without public provision of either insurance or medical services. Economist Milton Friedman said the role of the government in health care should be restricted to financing hard cases. Universal coverage can also be achieved by making purchase of insurance compulsory. For example, European countries with <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine</b> in the broader sense, such as Germany and The Netherlands, operate in this way. A legal obligation to purchase health insurance is akin to a mandated health tax, and the use of public subsidies is a form of directed income redistribution via the tax system. Such systems give the consumer a free choice amongst competing insurers whilst achieving universality to a government directed minimum standard.|$|E
50|$|Opponents {{of reform}} invoke the term <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine</b> {{because they say}} {{it will lead to}} health care {{rationing}} by denial of coverage, denial of access, and use of waiting lists, but often do so without acknowledging coverage denial, lack of access and waiting lists exist in the U.S. health care system currently or that waiting lists in the U.S. are sometimes longer than the waiting lists in countries with <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine.</b> Proponents of the reform proposal point out a public insurer is not akin to a <b>socialized</b> <b>medicine</b> system because it will have to negotiate rates with the medical industry just as other insurers do and cover its cost with premiums charged to policyholders just as other insurers do without any form of subsidy.|$|E
