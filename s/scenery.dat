40|$|Different <b>sceneries</b> {{fitted in}} the stage-house of an opera house may yield {{different}} room-acoustics {{conditions for the}} listeners.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a counter example to a {{conjecture}} mentioned in Benjamini and Kesten (1996) about distinguishing <b>sceneries</b> by observing them along a simple random walk, giving an explicit construction of 2 @ 0 <b>sceneries</b> {{that are all}} pairwise indistinguishable. 1. Introduction The basic problem we consider is how well can we distinguish two infinite words (<b>sceneries)</b> by observing these words along a simple random walk. This problem was introduced independently by I. Benjamini and by F. den Hollander and M. Keane, and has stimulated {{a considerable amount of}} research (Benjamini and Kesten (1996), Howard (1996), Howard (1997), Kesten (1996), Matzinger (1997)). Most of the results proved so far show that many <b>sceneries</b> can be distinguished by these observations. The result presented in this paper is a negative result, and gives some bounds to just how far the positive results can be pushed. A general survey about problems related to observing <b>sceneries</b> along random walks can be fou [...] ...|$|R

Three window models, which can be used for rendering in Radiance, are described and compared in this paper.

The show was designed for a revolving stage, with Arjona performing while the <b>scenery</b> changed with the songs being performed.

5|$|Wanting {{to escape}} the Western themes that {{influenced}} Dr. Slump, Toriyama used Oriental <b>scenery</b> in Dragon Ball, referencing Chinese buildings and <b>scenery.</b> The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled on Bali, which he visited in 1985. The area around Bobbidi's spaceship was inspired by photos of Africa. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid the difficulties of drawing residents and destroyed buildings. The author said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies appear very fast, and that the fights were similar to the ones in the Tenkaichi Budōkai, just not in a tournament setting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{article was}} {{motivated}} by a question of Kesten. Kesten asked for which random walks periodic <b>sceneries</b> can be reconstructed. Among others, he asked the question for random walks which at each step can move by one or two units to the right. Previously, Howard [How 97] proved that all periodic <b>sceneries</b> can be reconstructed provided they are observed along {{the path of a}} simple random walk. We prove that for a large class of random walks it is possible to reconstruct periodic <b>sceneries.</b> Among others, we provide a positive answer in the case, when the random walk can only move by one or two units to the right at each step, with a two unit step being less likely, than a one unit step. ...|$|R
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the <b>scenery.</b> Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing <b>scenery</b> collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
