Cell proliferation and cell death are opposing processes in tumor growth, with tumor progression reflecting {{the balance between}} proliferating and apoptotic cells. We investigated cell proliferation and cell death using MIB- 1 staining and nick-end labeling in 13 germinomas in comparison with 11 glioblastomas. Expression of BAX and Bcl- 2, which regulate apoptosis, were studied by immunohistochemistry. Although germinomas showed strong MIB- 1 immunostaining similar to that seen in glioblastomas, germinomas included significantly more apoptotic cells. The ratio of apoptotic ratio to MIB- 1 labeling index for germinomas was 72. 9 +/- 36. 9 (mean +/- SD), a higher, <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>ratio</b> as compared with glioblastomas (14. 5 +/- 11. 2; P < 0. 01). Furthermore, germinomas showed greater expression of BAX than did glioblastomas, while the expression of Bcl- 2 was weak in both tumor types. A comparison of these apoptotic-related proteins showed that immunoreactivity for BAX was relatively higher in germinomas than in glioblastomas (P < 0. 01), corresponding well to numerous apoptotic cells identified in germinoma tissues. These findings {{may account for the}} prognostic difference between germinoma and glioblastoma {{in the face of a}} similar proliferation potential according to MIB- 1 immunostaining.

40|$|Over the Past {{two and a}} {{half years}} banks have failed at the fastest pace since the Great Depression. These rapidly {{mounting}} bank failures have rekindled a debate surrounding the use of fair value accounting, with many arguing that fair value has exacerbated the severity of the recent financial crisis through asset devaluation and the forced sale of assets in an effort to meet capital requirements. This paper seeks to test if an entity’s exposure to fair value which includes assets available-for-sale, trading assets, and loans held-for-sale as a percent of total assets increases the probability of bank failure through testing different prediction models of bank failure that use ratios generated from publicly available Call Report data. Two models are generated from these ratios, one to determine the significance of an entity’s fair value exposure in predicting risk of failure, and the other to determine if a better model can be generated in the absence of the Fair Value Exposure/Total Assets ratio. The first model shows that Fair Value Exposure/Total Assets is a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>ratio,</b> and that the model employing Fair Value Exposure/Total Assets has greater bank failure predictive power than the second model that excludes this ratio. Contrary to expectations, the study determines that greater fair value exposure actually decreases a bank’s risk of failure, rather than increases it. A number of possibilities as to why this may be are presented in the conclusion of the paper...|$|E

While facilities have been implemented to address this problem they are underused due to a lack in help-seeking behavior. This study investigates factors related to the help-seeking behavior of mothers for children with acute {{respiratory infection}} using data from the 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey. Data on 11, 030 children aged 0 - 59 months obtained through interviewing women aged 15 - 49 years throughout Ethiopia was available. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine which factors are related to help-seeking behavior for acute respiratory infection. In the two weeks prior to the survey, 773 (7 %) of the children were reported to have symptoms of acute respiratory infection while treatment was sought for only 209 (27. 2 %). The odds ratio for acute respiratory infection was 1. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 0) for rural residence with only 25. 2 % of these mothers seeking help compared to 46. 4 % for mothers with an urban residence.

We planned to to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis spp. in patients who applied to the same internal medicine-gastroenterology clinic with or without gastrointestinal complaints to reveal the association of this parasite with diagnosed IBS and IBD. Methods A total of 2334 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms composed the study group, which included 335 patients with diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease and 877 with irritable bowel syndrome. Patients without any gastrointestinal symptoms or disease (n[*]=[*] 192) composed the control group. Parasite presence was investigated by applying native-Lugol and formol ethyl acetate concentration to stool specimens, and trichrome staining method in suspicious cases. Results Blastocystis spp. was detected in 134 patients (5. 74 %) in the study group and 6 (3. 12 %) {{in the control group}} (p[*]=[*] 0. 128). In the study group, Blastocystis spp. was detected at frequencies of 8. 7 % in ulcerative colitis (24 / 276), 6. 78 % in Crohn’s disease (4 / 59), 5. 82 % in irritable bowel syndrome (51 / 877), and 4. 9 % in the remaining patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (55 / 1122). Blastocystis spp. was detected at a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>ratio</b> in the inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 2. 824; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 149 - 6. 944; p[*]=[*] 0. 019) and ulcerative colitis (OR[*]=[*] 2. 952; 95 % CI: 1. 183 - 7. 367; p[*]=[*] 0. 016) patients within this group compared to controls.

The Treadway Commission recommended that the Auditing Standards Board require the use of analytical review procedures to improve the detection of fraudulent financial reporting. This research is an exploratory study to determine if the financial statements of fraudulent companies differ from those of non-fraudulent companies. Fraudulent firms were identified by examining the SEC’s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases issued between 1982 and 1995. The fraudulent firms (n = 79) were then matched with non-fraudulent firms on the basis of firm size and industry. Using this matched-pairs design, ratio analysis for a seven-year period (i. e., the fraud year-/+ 3 years) was conducted on 21 variables. Overall, 16 ratios were found to be significant. Of these, only three <b>ratios</b> were <b>significant</b> for three time periods. Of the 16 <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>ratios,</b> only five were significant during the period prior to the fraud year. Using discriminant analysis, misclassifications for fraud firms ranged from 41 % to 76 %.

40|$|Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is a {{clinical}} syndrome caused by neurodegeneration and {{characterized by a}} progressive deterioration in cognitive ability and capacity for independent living. Cognitive reserve (CR) describes {{the capacity of the}} adult brain to cope with the effects of the neurodegenerative process and to minimize the clinical manifestation of pathology of dementia. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association of CR and the severity of AD. Method This study was cross-sectional. Functional and neuropsychological abilities of 75 outpatients with probable AD diagnosis were evaluated. Patients completed two questionnaires, &# 8220;Participation in leisure activities throughout life&# 8221; and CR Questionnaire. Result The relationship between Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the level of CR was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> (likelihood <b>ratio</b> (LR), p = 0. 015). Conclusion The level of CR influenced the severity of dementia. This study suggests that AD patients with higher CR may benefit against cognitive decline after diagnosis of AD...|$|R
40|$|Intravascular {{coagulation}} {{is considered}} a major pathogenetic mechanism for nontraumatic osteonecrosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association of thrombophilic factor V G 1691 A mutation (factor V Leiden) and G 20210 A prothrombin mutation with the disease. Mutation presence was investigated by polymerase chain reaction techniques in a study population of 72 adult Caucasian patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head and 300 healthy Caucasian control subjects. The disease was considered idiopathic in 23 patients and secondary in 49. The factor V Leiden mutation was present in 18 % of patients, compared with 4. 6 % of control subjects, resulting in a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> of 4. 5. The prothrombin mutation was not significantly increased in the idiopathic osteonecrosis subgroup (8. 7 % versus 2. 6 %) with an odds ratio of 3. 5. Overall, either of these coagulation disorders was present in 22. 2 % of patients and in 7. 3 % of control subjects resulting in a <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratio</b> of 3. 6. Factor V Leiden, a genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis, is associated with nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, supporting the hypothesis that intravascular coagulation disease...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{define the}} {{prognostic}} value of Doppler ultrasonographic morphology of ductus venosus (DV) waveform on canine neonatal mortality. Materials and Methods: Fifty-four healthy pregnant bitches underwent fetal ultrasonographic assessment. The DV waveforms {{were classified as}} diphasic (dDVw) or triphasic (tDVw) and compared with neonatal mortality. Results: Ninety-three fetuses were evaluated. Twenty fetuses belonged to litters with neonatal mortality, in which tDVw was observed. Seven fetuses belonged to litters without neonatal mortality, in which tDVw was observed. Fifty-eight fetuses belonged to litters without neonatal mortality, in which only dDVw was observed. Eight fetuses belonged to litters with neonatal mortality, in which only dDVw was observed. The correlation between tDVw and neonatal mortality was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR], 20. 7; p< 0. 0001). Considering only pregnancies {{with one or two}} fetuses with the same DV waveform: Two fetuses with tDVw belonged to litters with neonatal mortality; 1 foetus with tDVw belonged to litter without neonatal mortality and 26 fetuses showed dDVw without neonatal mortality. The correlation between tDVw and neonatal mortality even in litters up to two pups was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> (OR, 88. 3; p= 0. 01). Conclusion: Echo-Doppler assessment of DV is feasible in canine fetuses, and the presence tDVw seems to be related to neonatal mortality...|$|R

Qualitative data were uttered as numbers and percentages and quantitative data were uttered as means[*]±[*]SD. To test significance {{of difference between}} two means, unpaired t test was used; while to test significance of difference between qualitative data, chi-square was used. A probability value (p value)[*]<[*] 0.05 was considered statistically significant; while a probability value (p value)[*]<[*] 0.01 was considered <b>statistically</b> highly <b>significant.</b> Odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were assessed using ordinal regression analysis model to test the best fitting predictors.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Our {{goal was}} to {{quantify}} the short-term effects of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm (PM 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) on respiratory health of asthmatic children from published panel studies, and to investigate the influence of study and population characteristics as effect modifiers. Dat a e x t r a c t i o n: After a systematic literature review, we extracted quantitative estimates {{of the association of}} PM 10 and/or NO 2 with respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Combined effect estimates for an increase of 10 µg/m 3 were calculated by random effects meta-analysis for all studies and for different strata defined by study characteristics. The effect of publication bias was investigated with Egger’s and Begg’s tests and “trim-and-fill ” analyses. Data synthesis: We identified 36 studies; 14 were part of the European Pollution Effects on Asthmatic Children in Europe (PEACE) study. Adverse associations of PM 10 with asthma symptoms were <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> [odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) = 1. 028; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 006 – 1. 051]. There were also associations, although not <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> of PM 10 with cough (OR = 1. 012; 95 % CI, 0. 997 – 1. 026) and on PEF (decrease of – 0. 082 L/min; 95 % CI, – 0. 214 to 0. 050).

40|$|Forty female {{patients}} with either primary anti-phospholipid syndrome (n = 26) or {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (anti-phospholipid syndrome positive) (n = 14) were investigated for levels of factor XII, the presence of lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to cardiolipin, beta 2 -glycoprotein I and factor XII. Twenty-one patients {{had a history of}} recurrent fetal loss (> 2, mean = 2. 6). Lupus anticoagulant positivity showed a weak association with recurrent fetal loss (odds ratio = 1. 1). While there was no association between the presence of antibodies to cardiolipin or beta 2 -glycoprotein I with recurrent fetal loss, antibodies to factor XII showed a strong and <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> association (odds <b>ratio</b> = 5. 4, P = 0. 025) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This article uses {{meta-analysis}} methodology {{to examine}} the statistical consistency and importance of random variation among results of epidemiologic studies of residential magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia. METHODS: A variety of meta-analytic statistical methods were applied to all available studies combined and on sub-groups of studies chosen by exposure characteristics. Sample sizes and fail-safe n's were calculated to determine the robustness of results and the potential role of publication bias. RESULTS: Most studies show elevated but not <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> odds <b>ratios.</b> Results for exposures assessed by wire codes, distance, and/or historically reconstructed fields are relatively consistent, homogeneous, and positive, while those for direct magnetic field measurements are consistent, homogeneous, and marginally protective. Several unpublished studies, or a single unpublished study with several hundred subjects, {{would be needed to}} nullify the observed data. CONCLUSIONS: The observed results identify a consistent risk that cannot be explained by random variation. The data supporting magnetic fields as the principal risk factor are suggestive but inconsistent. Additional studies using innovative designs that focus on highly exposed children offer the most hope of untangling this issue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Uncontrolled {{trials are}} criticized as unreliable. This study aimed to {{establish}} how {{the number of}} published reports from uncontrolled clinical trials compares to that of controlled trials for directly placed restorations in vital teeth and whether their annual number is increasing, stable or decreasing. PubMed was searched and suitable citations of uncontrolled and controlled trial reports published between 1990 – 2016 were included. Reference check and hand searching were conducted. The median annual report number with 25 and 75 % percentile was calculated for both types of trials. 695 reports were found. The median number of reports per year was 4 (3 – 7) and 22 (15 – 26) from uncontrolled and controlled trials, respectively. A <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> decreasing <b>ratio</b> of uncontrolled to controlled trial reports was observed (p = 0. 01) by linear regression analysis. The number of reports of uncontrolled clinical trials listed in PubMed over the last 27 years appears {{at least five times}} smaller than that of controlled clinical trials and its number in relation to that of controlled trials seems to decrease over time...|$|R
