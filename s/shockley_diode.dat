2500|$|In 1952, Jewell James Ebers from Bell Labs {{developed}} a prototype solid-state analog of thyratron – a four-layer transistor, or thyristor. William Shockley simplified its design to a two-terminal [...] "four-layer diode" [...] (<b>Shockley</b> <b>diode)</b> and attempted its industrial production.

25|$|Bo Lojek, {{based on}} the {{archives}} of Shockley, believes that Shockley Labs never worked on bipolar transistors; that <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes</b> were <b>Shockley</b> and Beckman's original target, for which Beckman Instruments received military R contracts; and that <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes</b> could have found widespread use in telephony if Shockley had improved their reliability.|$|R
2500|$|According to Noyce and Moore, {{as well as}} David Brock and Joel Shurkin, {{the shift}} from bipolar {{transistors}} to <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes</b> was unexpected. <b>Shockley</b> initially planned {{to work on the}} mass production of diffusion bipolar transistors, but then set up a [...] "secret project" [...] on <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes,</b> and in 1957 stopped all works on bipolar transistors. The reasons for this turn are unknown. According to Beckman's biographer, <b>Shockley</b> regarded his <b>diode</b> as an interesting scientific problem, and chose it, neglecting Beckman's commercial interests.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout 1956 {{most members}} of the lab were {{assembling}} and tuning the equipment, and [...] "pure scientists" [...] Hoerni and Noyce carried out individual applied research. Shockley refused to hire technical staff, believing that his scientists should be able to handle all technological processes. After resettlement, he focused on fine-tuning <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes</b> for mass production, and five employees, led by Noyce, continued the work on a field effect transistor for Beckman Instruments. Shockley refused to work on bipolar transistors, which later was proven a strategic mistake. Because the work on <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes</b> took so much effort the produced devices were commercial failures.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Shockley {{worked on}} his magnum opus, Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors which was {{published}} as a 558-page treatise in 1950. The tome included Shockley's critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals. <b>Shockley's</b> <b>diode</b> equation is also described. This seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though the}} {{commonly}} used 5 -p model can achieve acceptable level of accuracy, the saturation current of the photovoltaic cell is the linear superposition of charge diffusion and recombination in the space-charge layer (Luque and Hegedus 2011) {{and therefore the}} more accurate electrical representation of the PV cell {{can be done by}} two <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes</b> in parallel with a current source and associated series and shunt resistances (Castaner and Silvestre 2002). This model is more relevant at low-voltage bias, i.e., at low irradiance level operation of the PV cell (Luque and Hegedus 2011). Figure  3 d illustrates the circuit of this model.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Shockley</b> ideal <b>diode</b> {{equation}} or the diode law {{is derived}} {{with the assumption}} that the only processes giving rise to the current in the diode are drift (due to electrical field), diffusion, and thermal recombination–generation (R–G) (this equation is derived by setting n = 1 above). It also assumes that the R–G current in the depletion region is insignificant. This means that the <b>Shockley</b> ideal <b>diode</b> equation doesn't account for the processes involved in reverse breakdown and photon-assisted R–G. Additionally, it doesn't describe the [...] "leveling off" [...] of the I–V curve at high forward bias due to internal resistance.

50|$|In electronics, diode {{modelling}} {{refers to}} the mathematical models used to approximate the actual behaviour of real diodes to enable calculations and circuit analysis. A diode's I-V curve is nonlinear (it is well described by the <b>Shockley</b> <b>diode</b> law). This nonlinearity complicates calculations in circuits involving diodes so simpler models are often required.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1954–1955, William Shockley, an {{inventor}} of the transistor and a visiting professor at Stanford University, decided to establish his own mass production of advanced transistors and <b>Shockley</b> <b>diodes.</b> He found a sponsor in Raytheon, but Raytheon discontinued the project after a month. In August 1955 Shockley turned for advice to the financier Arnold Beckman, the owner of Beckman Instruments. Shockley needed one million dollars. Beckman knew that Shockley had no chance in the business, but believed that Shockley's new inventions would be beneficial for his own company {{and did not want}} to give them to his competitors. Accordingly, Beckman agreed to create and fund a laboratory under the condition that its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Shockley</b> ideal <b>diode</b> {{equation}} {{characterizes the}} current across a p-n junction {{as a function}} of external voltage and ambient conditions (temperature, choice of semiconductor, etc.). To see how it can be derived, we must examine the various reasons for current. The convention is that the forward (+) direction be pointed against the diode's built-in potential gradient at equilibrium.|$|R
5000|$|Shockley derives an {{equation}} for the voltage across a p-n junction {{in a long}} article published in 1949.Later he gives a corresponding equation for current {{as a function of}} voltage under additional assumptions, which is the equation we call the <b>Shockley</b> ideal <b>diode</b> equation. He calls it [...] "a theoretical rectification formula giving the maximum rectification", with a footnote referencing a paper by Carl Wagner, Physikalische Zeitschrift 32, pp. 641-645 (1931).|$|R
50|$|Under {{reverse bias}} (when the n side is put {{at a more}} {{positive}} voltage than the p side) the exponential term in the diode equation is near zero and the current is near a constant (negative) reverse current value of −IS.

5000|$|The <b>Shockley</b> <b>diode</b> (named after {{physicist}} William Shockley) is a four-layer semiconductor diode, {{which was}} one of the first semiconductor devices invented. It was a [...] "pnpn" [...] diode. It is equivalent to a thyristor with a disconnected gate.Shockley Diodes where manufactured and marketed by Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in the late 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Shockley</b> <b>diode</b> {{equation}} has an exponential of , {{which would}} {{lead one to}} expect that the forward-voltage increases with temperature. In fact, this is generally not the case: as temperature rises, the saturation current [...] rises, and this effect dominates. So as the diode becomes hotter, the forward-voltage (for a given current) decreases.|$|E
5000|$|The {{equation}} {{is called the}} <b>Shockley</b> ideal <b>diode</b> equation when n, the ideality factor, is set equal to 1. The ideality factor n typically varies from 1 to 2 (though can in some cases be higher), depending on the fabrication process and semiconductor material and is set equal to 1 for {{the case of an}} [...] "ideal" [...] diode (thus the n is sometimes omitted). The ideality factor was added to account for imperfect junctions as observed in real transistors. The factor mainly accounts for carrier recombination as the charge carriers cross the depletion region.|$|R
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the <b>Shockley</b> ideal <b>diode</b> equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|R
40|$|Difficulties in {{relating}} observed current-voltage {{characteristics of}} individual silicon solar cells to their physical and material parameters were {{underscored by the}} unexpected large changes in the current-voltage characteristics telemetered back from solar cells on the ATS- 1 spacecraft during their first year in synchronous orbit. Depletion region recombination was studied in cells exhibiting a clear double-exponential dark characteristic by subjecting the cells to proton irradiation. A {{significant change in the}} saturation current, an effect included in the Sah, Noyce, <b>Shockley</b> formulation of <b>diode</b> current resulting from recombination in the depletion region, was caused by the introduction of shallow levels in the depletion region by the proton irradiation. This saturation current is not attributable only to diffusion current from outside the depletion region and only its temperature dependence can clarify its origin. The current associated with the introduction of deep-lying levels did not change significantly in these experiments...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the field-effect {{transistor}} (see below), the BJT is a low-input-impedance device. Also, as the base-emitter voltage (VBE) is increased the base-emitter current {{and hence the}} collector-emitter current (ICE) increase exponentially according to the <b>Shockley</b> <b>diode</b> model and the Ebers-Moll model. Because of this exponential relationship, the BJT has a higher transconductance than the FET.|$|E
5000|$|The latter {{approximation}} {{assumes that}} the bias current [...] is large enough so that the factor of 1 in the parentheses of the <b>Shockley</b> <b>diode</b> equation can be ignored.

40|$|After {{a general}} {{introduction}} into the Shockley theory of current voltage (J – V) characteristics of inorganic and organic semiconductor junctions of different bandwidth, we apply the <b>Shockley</b> theory-based, one <b>diode</b> model {{to a new}} type of perovskite junctions with polaronic charge carriers. In particular, we studied manganite–titanate p–n heterojunctions made of n-doped SrTi 1 − y Nb y O 3, y = 0. 002 and p-doped Pr 1 − x Ca x MnO 3, x = 0. 34 having a strongly correlated electron system. The diffusion length of the polaron carriers was analyzed by electron beam-induced current (EBIC) in a thin cross plane lamella of the junction. In the J – V characteristics, the polaronic nature of the charge carriers is exhibited mainly by the temperature dependence of the microscopic parameters, such as the hopping mobility of the series resistance and a colossal electro-resistance (CER) effect in the parallel resistance. We conclude that a modification of the Shockley equation incorporating voltage-dependent microscopic polaron parameters is required. Specifically, the voltage dependence of the reverse saturation current density is analyzed and interpreted as a voltage-dependent electron–polaron hole–polaron pair generation and separation at the interface...|$|R
40|$|Historically, light {{absorption}} and emission {{has long been}} of broad interest in photovoltaic research, where these processes have been not only optimized for a high conversion efficiency but investigated to develop reliable optical characterization techniques. Although various aspects are being perfected, some issues remain unsolved due to their complexity; new technical issues also arise as solar cell technology evolves, where rapid adjustment is required {{to keep pace with}} the development. This thesis covers multiple topics relevant to the field, contributing to both the physics and characterization of solar cells. First, as a complement to <b>Shockley’s</b> p-n junction <b>diode</b> theory, an investigation of optoelectronic transport in arbitrary three-dimensional solar cell geometries shows that the ideal solar cell equation retains its traditional form in the presence of photon recycling, which however improves the dark saturation and light-generated currents. Then, taking note of developments over recent years, the applicability of spectral response analysis is reassessed as a means of determining cell optical and electrical properties, giving rise not only to extended applicability to front surface field cells, but new blue response and simplified infrared response analyses. After that, increased insights into band luminescence imaging of operational devices are provided through analytic study. With the dependence clearly illustrated, the present analytical approach not only simplifies results when local spatial uniformity is assumed, but allows more insights into the impact of lateral carrier injection as an operational feature increasingly evident in high efficiency solar cells. Finally, radiative coupling between the cells in tandem stacks is investigated as an increasingly important factor for tandem devices where energy conversion efficiency now exceeds 46 %. The investigation not only extends earlier coupling models to account for both electroluminescent and photoluminescent coupling components, but provides more general insight into the impact on device performance and demonstrates an equivalent circuit approach as an efficient means of clarifying the complex interactions involved...|$|R
5000|$|Under reverse bias, {{there is}} a small leakage current as some {{thermally}} excited electrons in the metal have enough energy to surmount the barrier. To first approximation this current should be constant (as in the <b>Shockley</b> <b>diode</b> equation); however, current rises gradually with reverse bias due to a weak barrier lowering (similar to the vacuum Schottky effect). At very high biases, the depletion region breaks down.|$|E
