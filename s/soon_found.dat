5|$|Chaplin <b>soon</b> <b>found</b> {{work with}} a new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also {{pursuing}} an acting career – in a comedy sketch called Repairs.

He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they <b>soon</b> <b>found</b> {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed.

5|$|Ladd's group <b>soon</b> <b>found</b> their {{business}} expertise {{in other areas}} did not apply as well to the iron industry.

5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981.

However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari.
