40|$|Sulfur-containing aroma {{compounds}} are key {{contributors to}} the flavor of a diverse range of foods and beverages. The tropical fruit characters of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sauvignon blanc wines are attributed {{to the presence of}} the aromatic thiols 3 -mercaptohexan- 1 -ol (3 MH), 3 -mercaptohexan- 1 -ol-acetate, and 4 -mercapto- 4 -methylpentan- 2 -one (4 MMP). These volatile thiols are found in small amounts in grape juice and are formed from nonvolatile cysteinylated precursors during fermentation. In this study, we overexpressed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, STR 3, which led to an increase in 3 MH release during fermentation of a V. vinifera L. cv. Sauvignon blanc juice. Characterization of the enzymatic properties of Str 3 p confirmed it to be a pyridoxal- 5 ′-phosphate-dependent cystathionine β-lyase, and we demonstrated that this enzyme was able to cleave the cysteinylated precursors of 3 MH and 4 MMP to release the free thiols.

40|$|An str {{gene cluster}} {{containing}} {{at least four}} genes (strR, strA, strB, and strC) involved in streptomycin biosynthesis or streptomycin resistance or both was <b>self-cloned</b> in Streptomyces griseus by using plasmid pOA 154. The strA gene was verified to encode streptomycin 6 -phosphotransferase, a streptomycin resistance factor in S. griseus, by examining the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli. The other three genes were determined by complementation tests with streptomycin-nonproducing mutants whose biochemical lesions were clearly identified. strR complemented streptomycin-sensitive mutant SM 196 which exhibited impaired activity of both streptomycin 6 -phosphotransferase and amidinotransferase (one of the streptomycin biosynthetic enzymes) due to a regulatory mutation; strB complemented strain SD 141, which was specifically deficient in amidinotransferase; and strC complemented strain SD 245, which was deficient in linkage between streptidine 6 -phosphate and dihydrostreptose. By deletion analysis of plasmids with appropriate restriction endonucleases, {{the order of the}} four genes was determined to be strR-strA-strB-strC. Transformation of S. griseus with plasmids carrying both strR and strB genes enhanced amidinotransferase activity in the transformed cells. Based on the gene dosage effect and the biological characteristics of the mutants complemented by strR and strB, it was concluded that strB encodes amidinotransferase and strR encodes a positive effector required for the full expression of strA and strB genes. Furthermore, it was found that amplification of a specific 0. 7 -kilobase region of the cloned DNA on a plasmid inhibited streptomycin biosynthesis of the transformants.

5000|$|Three {{thousand}} {{years before the}} story starts, Lysos founds a human colony on the isolated planet of Stratos {{in an effort to}} radically re-engineer human life into a happier, more pastoral form. She developed a strain of human beings that conceives clones in winter (always female), while those conceived in summer (variants or [...] "vars") obtain their genes through sexual reproduction just in case biological adaptation becomes necessary. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity: men in summer and women in winter. This scheme is said to be stable over evolutionary time because women gain an advantage from <b>self-cloning,</b> while men only reproduce in summer. Finally, men have been made far less aggressive during the times that they are less sexually receptive and are much less numerous. The social result is {{that the vast majority of}} the population of Stratos consists of groups of female clones, each in its own social or economic niche.

40|$|Abstract Background During the {{bread-making}} process, industrial baker's yeast, mostly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{is exposed}} to baking-associated stresses, such as air-drying and freeze-thaw stress. These baking-associated stresses exert severe injury to yeast cells, mainly due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death and reduced fermentation ability. Thus, {{there is a great}} need for a baker's yeast strain with higher tolerance to baking-associated stresses. Recently, we revealed a novel antioxidative mechanism in a laboratory yeast strain that is involved in stress-induced nitric oxide (NO) synthesis from proline via proline oxidase Put 1 and N -acetyltransferase Mpr 1. We also found that expression of the proline-feedback inhibition-less sensitive mutant γ-glutamyl kinase (Pro 1 -I 150 T) and the thermostable mutant Mpr 1 -F 65 L resulted in an enhanced fermentation ability of baker's yeast in bread dough after freeze-thaw stress and air-drying stress, respectively. However, baker's yeast strains with high fermentation ability under multiple baking-associated stresses have not yet been developed. Results We constructed a <b>self-cloned</b> diploid baker's yeast strain with enhanced proline and NO synthesis by expressing Pro 1 -I 150 T and Mpr 1 -F 65 L in the presence of functional Put 1. The engineered strain increased the intracellular NO level in response to air-drying stress, and the strain was tolerant not only to oxidative stress but also to both air-drying and freeze-thaw stresses probably due to the reduced intracellular ROS level. We also showed that the resultant strain retained higher leavening activity in bread dough after air-drying and freeze-thaw stress than that of the wild-type strain. On the other hand, enhanced stress tolerance and fermentation ability did not occur in the put 1 -deficient strain. This result suggests that NO is synthesized in baker's yeast from proline in response to oxidative stresses that induce ROS generation and that increased NO {{plays an important role in}} baking-associated stress tolerance. Conclusions In this work, we clarified the importance of Put 1 - and Mpr 1 -mediated NO generation from proline to the baking-associated stress tolerance in industrial baker's yeast. We also demonstrated that baker's yeast that enhances the proline and NO synthetic pathway by expressing the Pro 1 -I 150 T and Mpr 1 -F 65 L variants showed improved fermentation ability under multiple baking-associated stress conditions. From a biotechnological perspective, the enhancement of proline and NO synthesis could be promising for breeding novel baker's yeast strains. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{continue}} development of a single state rep-resentation {{for use in a}} <b>Self-Cloning</b> State Machine. The <b>Self-Cloning</b> StateMachine can be used to represent Non-Deterministic Finite State Machines ona FPGA. NFSMs can be used to for instance match regular expressions andthe <b>Self-Cloning</b> State Machine is a run-time reconguration based approach tothis problem. Previous work has been performed on design tool experiments,choosing a FPGA vendor, and creating a denition of the singular state rep-resentation. This continuation focuses on further development of the singularstate and creating a system around it for experimentation. A system is designed to be used as an example model of a <b>Self-Cloning</b> StateMachine for the Virtex- 4 FPGA. This system consists of several finite-statemachines built up by several singular states, a control system, and a resultmanagement module. The FSMs are connected together in order to model apreviously defined NFSM. To model the NFSM a control system is made toenable and disable the different FSMs as the transitions happen in the NFSM. Each of these FSMs have their own data path used for computing a simple op-eration based on a Multiply-Accumulate Circuit. The data path uses one-hotcoded state vectors from the FSM as its internal state machine. A deter-ministic version is also created to be able to compare the area and functionaldifferences. A comparison between the <b>Self-Cloning</b> State Machine and anothermethod of implementing a NFSM is made. There is also a brief comparisonof two dierent implementation methods for run-time reconguration with re-spect to ease of implementation. The two methods are a framework for run-timereconguration and a Virtual FPGA system. The modications made to the singular state representation are found to beappropriate for allowing the singular state to represent any state in any FSM. A problem was discovered with the size of the conguration register but theproblem can be solved. The control system, data path and result managementsystem functioned correctly and they were well suited to show the functionalityof a system like this one. Comparing the <b>Self-Cloning</b> State Machine to anotherimplementation method for NFSMs shows that this implementation demandsmuch more physical area which is a disadvantage, but the <b>Self-Cloning</b> StateMachine may be more flexible than the other method. The V-FPGA methodof performing run-time reconguration is found to be superior to another typeof framework created specically for the Virtex- 4 FPGA. </p...|$|E

Quantum nanotechnology is a broad concept that deals with a manipulation of individual quantum states of atoms and molecules.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a virtual layer for running <b>self-cloning</b> state {{machines}} on FPGAs has been developed. The goal {{has been to}} connect software with hardware resources, and to make partial reconfigurability more available. Previous {{work has been done}} on defining <b>self-cloning</b> state machines that can run on an FPGA, but was not tested with partial runtime reconfiguration. A framework for reconfiguration has been used in this thesis, which had previous shown some difficulties regarding synchronous designs. Specifications for the virtual layer were defined, and the different modules constructed. The virtual layer was implemented on a Virtex- 4 FPGA, with an embedded PorwerPC microprocessor running a Linux operating system. The virtual layer gives software application an interface for defining state machines, which will be mapped to the FPGA and executed. The modules on the FPGA are separated into two parts, one reconfigurable region and one static region. The static region contains a back-end that handles the control of the NFSM and communication with the processor. The reconfigurable region contains the NFSM, which is divided into several clones. The clones can be inserted or removed by using partial runtime reconfiguration. Many difficulties were experienced when trying to implement the virtual layer with support for partial runtime reconfiguration. The tool support was lacking and the space on the FPGA became a problem. Only one clone could be fitted on the FPGA. Therefore the verification of the system was divided in two. A state machine with four clones was tested and verified. The virtual layer was able to take input from software and map this into a functional <b>self-cloning</b> state machine. Some limitations had to be put on the system to make it possible to implement. A second test was performed with partial runtime reconfiguration to show that clones could be added or removed from the design at runtime. The test was successful, but could only be done with one active clone. The limitations of the Virtex- 4 platform can be avoided by implementing the virtual layer on a more state of the art FPGA. The system defined in this thesis should work on any FPGA, but will require a lot of work, especially porting of the framework for reconfiguration...|$|E

In one MGUS case, intraclonal heterogeneity was evident, and transformation to myeloma occurred rapidly with apparent homogeneity in the emergent clone.

Cloning and expression of etpBAC in recombinant E. coli LMG 194 (pJY 019) resulted in secretion of a high-molecular-weight (HMW) glycosylated exoprotein. This glycoprotein, EtpA, exhibits linear peptide sequence and predicted structural homologies with known HMW adhesins produced by other two-partner secretion loci. Antibodies directed against recombinant EtpA (anti-rEtpA. 6 H) recognized an HMW protein in culture supernatants of ETEC strains H 10407 and LMG 194 (pJY 019) but not in culture supernatant of strain H 10407 -P, which lacks the 92 -kb pCS 1 plasmid, or an isogenic etpA mutant. etpA mutants were deficient in adherence to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, and anti-rEtpA. 6 H antibodies inhibited association of H 10407 with target epithelial cells.

We find, however, that it exhibits a fundamental problem of a different nature, based on how its incentives are structured. We propose a modification to the protocol that can eliminate this problem. Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network to track transactions that are performed with the currency. For this purpose, every transaction a node learns about should be transmitted to its neighbors in the network. As the protocol is currently defined and implemented, it does not provide an incentive for nodes to broadcast transactions they are aware of. In fact, it provides a strong incentive not to do so. Our solution is to augment the protocol with a scheme that rewards information propagation. Since clones are easy to create in the Bitcoin system, an important feature of our scheme is Sybil-proofness. We show that our proposed scheme succeeds in setting the correct incentives, that it is Sybil-proof, and that it requires only a small payment overhead, all this is achieved with iterated elimination of dominated strategies. We complement this result by showing that there are no reward schemes in which information propagation and no <b>self-cloning</b> is a dominant strategy...|$|E
30|$|Because {{the number}} of marker genes is limited, {{establishing}} a marker-recycling technique {{is necessary for the}} consecutive insertion of gene expression cassettes or multiple-gene deletions. For marker rescue, the cre loxP recombination system of bacteriophage P 1 has been shown to mediate efficient recombination between 34 -bp loxP sites flanking a marker gene in yeast and filamentous fungi, resulting in excision of the marker gene (Krappmann et al. [2005]; [Sauer 1987]). Gene deletion by HR between the loxP sites results in marker removal, leaving behind a single repeat at the deleted gene locus. Therefore, developing a <b>self-cloning</b> technique to breed genetically-modified filamentous fungi is important. To achieve this aim, the double-marker enrichment technique was adopted for target-gene deletion in A. fumigatus, Aspergillus awamori, A. nidulans, and Leptosphaeria maculans (d’[Enfert 1996]; [Gardiner and Howlett 2004]; [Krappmann and Braus 2003]; Michielse et al. [2005]). In this strategy, a second selectable marker is added to the gene deletion cassette to distinguish between HR and non-homologous recombination. Upon HR, the second selection marker is lost, whereas after integration by non-homologous recombination, transformants carrying both selectable markers are obtained. Alternatively, once a mutant with a two-way (positive and negative) selectable marker such as pyrG is isolated, marker recycling enables not only consecutive gene deletion, but also consecutive gene insertion without leaving behind an exogenous DNA fragment. Although 50 – 100 bp of DRs were sufficient to facilitate gene-replacement cassette integration at the homologous locus at a gene replacement efficiency of 50 – 100 % in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bahler et al. [1998]; Wach et al. [1994]), longer DRs were thought to be required in filamentous fungi ([Hynes 1996]; [Maruyama and Kitamoto 2008]; Nielsen et al. [2008]; Ninomiya et al. [2004]). However, our results indicated that the correct excision event could occur even with a 20 -bp DR, although the frequency was relatively low. The observation that a shorter DR works sufficiently for correct excision should help to design a deletion cassette for marker recycling. Using this method, we are constructing an A. aculeatus host with multiple selectable markers to enable the breeding of filamentous fungi that produce several different cellulases to hydrolyze cellulosic substances with high efficiency.|$|E
