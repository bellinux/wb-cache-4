40|$|It can be {{said that}} a {{collision}} happens when a car 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> is longer than the car 2 ̆ 7 s headway distance. The stopping distance is some times prolonged unexpectedly. The stopping distance of the car comprises the braking distance and the reaction distance. One of the causes of the unexpected prolongation of the stopping distance is a lengthening of the reaction distance. The reaction time is the distance a vehicle travels {{from the time of the}} first appearance of an obstacle or a sudden change in the surroundings to the time when the brake system works. The authors measured the driver 2 ̆ 7 s reaction times (RTs) at the speed of 0 km/h, 20 km/h, 40 km/h and 60 km/h. The result of the experiment showed that the mean RTs for driving conditions were larger than that of a stopping condition. There are no differences between the mean RT of each speed condition. But there are differences between the standard deviation (SD) of RT. The result of other experiments showed that the RT while driving under hasty conditions was larger than that while driving under ordinary condition. Thus, the authors suggested that hasty driving must be deterred to avoid collisions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{necessary}} to estimate the determination accuracy of a car <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> during the test by the method of sequential braking. The method of sequential braking is applied for experimental evaluation of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distances.</b> Unlike the abandonment method when a sample car is disconnected from the tractive connection and they record the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a single car from the moment of uncoupling to the moment of stop, the method of sequential braking involves <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> measurement of the tractive connection, the integrity of which {{in the course of the}} test is not affected, but its set (locomotive, locomotive with the track test car or with a sample car) at the different stages of the test is changed. Direct measuring of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a sample car is not possible using this way, it requires calculating of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> values of the tractive connection. This adversely affects the accuracy of the result, but it can increase the safety level of the test. Methodology. To evaluate the accuracy researches have conducted the numerical experiment, which simulated experimental processing of <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> values. An error was found by giving disturbance of basic data (<b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of tractive connection of different configuration) and analyzing the resulted scatter of readings (<b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a single car). Findings. The study proved: 1) the relative error of car <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> value, with relative error of basic data 1 %, made 3. 3 - 19. 7 % (depending on the tractive connection variant). 2) the proposed ways of error reduction (without track test car, less-weighed-locomotive use) allowed declining the error to 2. 15 - 5. 1 %. Originality. The methodology of error estimation of car <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> determination under tests by the method of sequential braking was proposed. Practical value. Work results make it possible to replace the running brake tests by the abandonment method, under which the integrity of tractive connections is broken, with safer testing by the method of sequential braking, providing the level of result accuracy of 2 - 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> and crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> {{and it is}} very complicated to calculate them accurately. At present there are several calculation methods about them, but all these methods have large error. Based on the research of the existing calculation methods, this paper simplifies vessel resistance and calculates vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> and crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> accurately by means of physical and mathematical methods. 1 forward Vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VSD) and Vessel’s crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VCSD) are two important indexes measuring the braking performance of the vessel.

As early as the 1970 s, Chinese scholars Wang FengChen and Liu ZhengJiang et al. began to make research on large vessel’s stopping performance. [1, 2, 3] These research mainly used regression method on the measured data of VCSD to get the VCSD calculation formula. Foreign scholars have carried out extensive research, such as Tani, Okamoto, Havald, respectively put forward their own views and methods about the calculation of the VCSD for different type of vessel...|$|R
40|$|When {{the city}} centre {{is the major}} {{destination}} of the passengers, public transport vehicles will get fuller as they approach it. The disadvantage of time loss due to stops {{on the way to}} the centre is thus experienced by an increasing number of travellers. We demonstrate that optimal <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> increase as vehicles get closer to the centre. This is at variance with the usual assumption of constant <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> employed in this type of models. A Countervailing force is that urban densities increase as one approaches the centre.

40|$|Abstract—The Automobile Braking System has {{a crucial}} role for safety of the {{passenger}} and riding quality of the vehicle. The braking force mainly depends on normal reaction on the wheel and the co-efficient of friction between the tire and the road surface. Whenever a vehicle is loaded, the normal reaction on the rear wheel is increased. Thus the amount of braking force required to halt the vehicle with minimum <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> {{is based on the}} pillion load on the vehicle. In this work, in order to vary the braking force in two wheelers, the mechanical leverage which operates the master cylinder is varied based on the pillion load. Thus the amount of braking force developed between ground and tire is varied. This optimum braking force on the disc brake helps in attaining the minimum vehicle <b>stopping</b> <b>distance.</b> In addition to that, it also helps in preventing sliding. Thus the system results in reducing the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of the two wheelers and providing a better braking efficiency than the conventional braking system.

50|$|In Germany {{the rule}} of thumb for the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> in a city in good {{conditions}} is the 1-second rule, i.e. the distance covered in 1 second should at most be the distance to the vehicle ahead. At 50 km/h this corresponds to about 15 m. For higher speeds up to about 100 km/h outside built-up areas a similarly defined 2-second rule applies, which for 100 km/h translates to about 50 m. For speeds on the order of 100 km/h there is also the more or less equivalent rule that the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> be the speed divided by 2 k/h, referred to as halber tacho (half the speedometer) rule, e.g. for 100 km/h the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> should be about 50 m.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{estimate}} vehicle speed and <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> accurately {{is important for}} pedestrians to make safe road crossing decisions. In this study, a field experiment in a naturalistic traffic environment was conducted to measure pedestrians&# 39; estimation of vehicle speed and <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> when they are crossing streets. Forty-four participants (18 - 45 years old) reported their estimation on 1043 vehicles, and the corresponding actual vehicle speed and <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> were recorded. In the speed estimation task, pedestrians&# 39; performances change in different actual speed levels and different weather conditions. In sunny conditions, pedestrians tended to underestimate actual vehicle speeds that were higher than 40 km/h but were able to accurately estimate speeds that were lower than 40 km/h. In rainy conditions, pedestrians tended to underestimate actual vehicle speeds that were higher than 45 km/h but were able to accurately estimate speeds ranging from 35 km/h to 45 km/h. In <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> estimation task, the accurate estimation interval ranged from 60 km/h to 65 km/h, and pedestrians generally underestimated the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> when vehicles were travelling over 65 km/h. The results show that pedestrians have accurate estimation intervals that vary by weather conditions. When {{the speed of the}} oncoming vehicle exceeded the upper bound of the accurate interval, pedestrians were more likely to underestimate the vehicle speed, increasing their risk of incorrectly deciding to cross when it is not safe to do so.
