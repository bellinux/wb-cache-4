5|$|In {{order for}} these {{developments}} to occur, Playford personally had {{to attend to}} the bureaucracy that stood in the way. He confronted public <b>service</b> <b>workers,</b> and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations with the Federal Government that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden, Curtin, Forde and Chifley. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues made sure that deals could be made.|$|E
5|$|The Copenhagen Fire Department {{forms the}} largest {{municipal}} fire brigade in Denmark with some 500 fire and ambulance personnel, 150 administration and <b>service</b> <b>workers,</b> and 35 workers in prevention. The brigade began as the Copenhagen Royal Fire Brigade on 9 July 1687 under King Christian V. After {{the passing of}} the Copenhagen Fire Act on 18 May 1868, on 1 August 1870 the Copenhagen Fire Brigade became a municipal institution in its own right. The fire department has its headquarters in the Copenhagen Central Fire Station which was designed by Ludvig Fenger in the Historicist style and inaugurated in 1892.|$|E
40|$|Assessment of {{the role}} of the {{individual}} <b>service</b> <b>worker</b> in encouraging customer organizational citizenship behaviors (customer OCBs) is the primary focus of this paper. The researchers investigate this topic empirically across three service contexts. Customer OCBs are voluntary, outside of the customer 2 ̆ 7 s required role for service delivery, which provide help and assistance and are conducive to effective organizational functioning. In this paper, commitment to the <b>service</b> <b>worker</b> is the strongest predictor of customer OCBs. Further, personal loyalty to the <b>service</b> <b>worker</b> serves as a partial mediator of the effects of perceived benevolence of the <b>service</b> <b>worker</b> and commitment to the <b>service</b> <b>worker</b> on customer OCBs.

5|$|The mounted police {{took on a}} {{range of}} tasks {{associated}} with the new project. Teams of police escorted the construction teams as they moved across the Rocky Mountains, having been given special jurisdiction over the area along the line of the route. They enforced the liquor laws, and oversaw the itinerant <b>service</b> <b>workers</b> who accompanied the main construction teams. They defused many of the tensions involving the construction workers and the company, including intervening to resolve cases where the workers had not been paid by the company as promised, but they also intervened to support the railway company. When the railway staff went on strike for higher wages in 1883, the mounted police guarded the company's trains, escorted in new drivers and, when necessary, drove the locomotives themselves; two years later the police broke up a protest over unpaid wages by over a thousand construction workers, arresting the main leaders. The head of the Canadian Pacific Railway, William Van Horne, thanked the force for its contribution to the final completion of the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} {{was faced with}} the reawakening of labor-management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years, severe shortages in housing and consumer products, and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation, which at one point hit 6% in a single month. Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries. Truman's response to them was generally seen as ineffective. A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of price controls on most items, and labor sought wage increases. A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800,000 workers—the largest in the nation's history—was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May. The public was angry, with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public <b>service</b> <b>workers</b> and a year's moratorium on labor actions. For commodities where price controls remained, producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices: farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased, even though grain was desperately needed, not only for domestic use, but to stave off starvation in Europe.|$|E

25|$|In fall of 1970, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) gave workers {{the right}} to form unions in private universities. However, the NLRB ruling only granted {{collective}} bargaining rights to non-hospital workers. At the time, Local 77 was composed of both hospital and campus <b>service</b> <b>workers,</b> and hospital workers strongly supported Local 77. Several hospital workers in Local 77 held manual tasks that did not involve patient care, and in the end, the ruling permitted these workers for union representation. By 1971, Duke voluntarily agreed to the unionization of both housekeeping and laundry workers in the medical center and campus workers. Harvey perceived this as Duke’s strategy for preventing future unionizing pressure from other food and <b>service</b> <b>workers</b> in the medical center. After the long enduring fight for fair working conditions, Local 77 finally received union recognition in January, 1972.|$|E
