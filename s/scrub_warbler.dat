25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, streaked <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler,</b> mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and common genet, and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|E

50|$|The {{streaked}} <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> is a bird of open desert with a sparse {{cover of}} scrub, especially wadi beds with a denser cover than the surrounding desert, {{as well as}} scree areas with bushes in ravines and gorges.|$|E
50|$|The Barratt's warbler or African <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> (Bradypterus barratti), is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Locustellidae.

50|$|The Knysna warbler or Knysna <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> (Bradypterus sylvaticus) is a {{very shy}} and cryptic warbler, endemic to the coastal regions of South Africa. Its {{population}} is small and probably declining, due to natural and artificial fragmentation of its habitat, and limited dispersal and reproductive ability.|$|E

50|$|The {{streaked}} <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> (Scotocerca inquieta) is {{a species}} of bird in the Scotocercidae family from Africa and south-western Asia. It is a bird of desert fringes, frequenting scrubby areas, ravines and gorges, and is mainly resident, although local movements can occur outside the breeding season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{streaked}} <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> has a {{very wide}} range and is scarce in some places and common in others. No particular threats have been identified and the population {{is believed to be}} steady or declining slightly. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|Lobéké National Park is an Important Bird Area (#CM033). Over {{three hundred}} {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} here. The rare red-nosed green pigeon (Treron calvus), rhinoceros birds (Buceros rhinoceros), Chrysococcyx flavigularis, Otus icterorhynchus and the chestnut kingfisher (Halcyon badia) can all {{be found in the}} park. Specifically within Cameroon and Gabon, it is an important bird area for the Ja River <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Cretzschmar was {{the founder}} and second {{director}} of the Senckenberg Natural History Society in 1817. One of the founding {{members of the society}} was Eduard Rüppell, and the two men collaborated in publishing the results of Rüppell's explorations in Africa. The Atlas zu der reise im nördlichen Afrika ("Atlas of Rüppell's Travels in Northern Africa"; 1826-28) [...] included an ornithological section by Cretzschmar describing around thirty new species, including Meyer's parrot, Nubian bustard, Goliath heron, streaked <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> and Cretzschmar's bunting. In the field of mammalogy, he is the binomial author of the scimitar-horned oryx and Soemmerring's gazelle.|$|E
50|$|The {{streaked}} <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> nests in low scrub up to 1.5m {{above the}} ground, the nest is a domed structure made {{of grass and}} twigs and lined with feathers, fur and plant down. It has 1-2 side entrances, {{if there is a}} second it is used only as an exit. The clutch size averages 3-5 but varies from 2-5, incubation is roughly two weeks with another two weeks before the young fledge. Its main food is insects but it will also eat seeds which may be very important in winter. It forages on the ground, fossicking through leaf litter and other debris under bushes, and into cavities but will also feed up in the vegetation at times.|$|E
