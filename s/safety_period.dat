Captain Barefoot was, therefore, responsible for the discovery of much new and valuable information. On July 28 he assisted Dr Merriman of London in experimenting on and afterwards defusing three unexploded bombs of a new shape at Great Yarmouth. By then Captain Barefoot had defused thirty or more such bombs of varying types and shapes. On the night of September 1 Captain Barefoot received information about unexploded bombs blocking the LNER main line. There were six live bombs in one place. This was a time when delayed-action time fuse bombs were much in use. In view of the importance of clearing the line at all costs, Captain Barefoot and his men deliberately ignored the <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> of four days then laid down. By 7am work was begun and continued without cessation in relays throughout the day. Captain Barefoot assisted personally in this remarkably expeditious operation, and by the evening the line had been cleared and at 6.40pm the first train was running. Normally this work would have taken a week to perform. Captain Barefoot worked on one of the first parachute magnetic mines dropped in this country. At the time we had very little knowledge of the mechanism of these mines, and much was learnt in these initial stages.|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{mulching}} film {{plays an}} important role in development of agriculture. However, a series of problems such as pollution of plastic film residue left in the field occur. It is required to make a reasonable assessment on film mulching and rationally utilize it. Based on its application, this study proposed a concept of crop <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> of plastic film mulching, and its estimation methods. Crop <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> through plastic film mulching means the appropriate choice of a photo-selective mulch film according to the transplant season, to the pedoclimatic conditions of the area under cultivation and, finally, to the type of crop. In the days before the transplant, the plastic mulching film should be basic whole, and it works to decrease soil moisture evaporation, to warm soil and to prevent weeds. Successively, these functions almost reduce. The selection of crop <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> of plastic film mulching is helpful to manage agricultural activities efficiently; guiding film makers to produce both meet the demand of production and lower cost of plastic products; to help farmers due to the types of crop and production conditions choosing appropriate plastic mulch film. Based on measurement of function of plastic film mulching, and crop canopy density, 2 kinds of method were established. The first one is to continuously monitor soil moisture，temperature and weed control, to build relationship between the function of soil temperature, moisture, weed suppression and mulching treatments, with that to seek the intersection of them. The coincidence point means functions disappear of plastic mulching and the days from starting mulching to this date is a certain crop <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> in a certain site. The second is crop canopy density to determine crop safety of plastic film mulching period, which includes 2 steps: to measure the change of crop canopy density, and the functions (soil temperature and moisture etc.) of mulching under no mulching and mulching at same time, to establish the curve of crop canopy density and the main function of plastic film in order to cross the best condition between crop canopy density and the contribute of mulch films aimed to the determination of the ideal crop safeguard period. All in all, plastic mulching film has been widely used in global, especially in China, in the past 30 years, and its application area and efficacy works better than any other agronomic practices. Concept of crop <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> of plastic film mulching has been firstly proposed in this paper, and further research in the connotation and extension of its definition still need to be developed. Moreover, the mentioned estimation methods around crop <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> of plastic film mulching showed some usefulness in cotton in Xinjiang, corn in Northeast and tobacco in southwest planting, but more extensive research, application and improvement were needed by far. The findings from this research provide an important information base for improving adaptability evaluation system of plastic mulching film, investigating the spatial pattern of plastic mulching film utilization, and biodegradable plastic film production and application.

The adversaries attempt to launch the variety of attacks against a system to capture their needed information. Sometimes content of information is their target and other times the context of information such as timing and location can be the aim of the attack. The wireless sensors network is established based on affairs related to information. Depending on the application of this type of networks, different security considerations should be taken. This research focuses on the source location privacy where the attacker tries to discover the origin sender of packets to achieve the under monitor assets by backtracking the received signals. The final aim is improving the <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> for source node and it means the prolonging the discovering duration of the exact location of source node for adversary.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} which lever pressing by squirrel monkeys was maintained under multiple, mixed, or chained schedules of electric-shock presentation. In the first two experiments, a multiple schedule was employed in which a fixed-interval schedule of shock presentation alternated with a signaled two-minute component. Initially, no events were scheduled during the two-minute component (a <b>safety</b> <b>period).</b> In the first experiment, the <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> was “degraded” by introducing and systematically increasing the frequency of periodic shocks presented during that component. In the second experiment, the proportion of overall safe time to unsafe time was decreased by decreasing {{the value of the}} fixed-interval schedule while holding constant shock frequency during the two-minute component. In the third experiment, the overall arrangement was changed from a multiple to a mixed schedule in an attempt to determine whether fixed-interval responding would be maintained when a single exteroceptive stimulus was associated with both components. In the fourth experiment, the overall arrangement was changed from a multiple to a chained schedule in an effort to determine whether fixed-interval responding would be maintained when its consequence was presentation of a signaled “unsafe” period. Fixed-interval responding was well maintained under all experimental conditions; the varied relationships obtained lend more support to conceptualizations of shock-maintained behavior as exemplifying schedule-controlled behavior than to suggestions that such behavior may be readily accounted for by “safety theory. ...|$|E

Methods: Gametes can be donated by healthy men aged 18 – 55 years and healthy women aged 18 to 35 years. After donation, donor semen is frozen, and donor oocytes are fertilized with the semen of the recipient, after which embryos are frozen. If after a 6 -month <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> repeated tests on sexually transmitted infections are negative, thawed semen or embryos can be used for the recipients. Results: Gametes have been donated by 97 men and 30 women. ART using DS was performed in 98 couples.

40|$|Background and Aims: Apnoeic {{oxygenation}} during laryngoscopy {{has been}} emphasised in recent recommendations for airway management. We aimed {{to compare the}} effect of nasal oxygen supplementation on time for pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO 2) to fall from 100 % to 92 % (desaturation safety time), to assess the arterial oxygen partial pressures (PaO 2) with and without nasal oxygen supplementation and the time for SpO 2 to recover from 92 % to 100 % after initiation of ventilation. Methods: This is a prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial involving sixty patients, where nasal oxygen supplementation given at 10 L/min during apnoea of laryngoscopy in one group of patients (Group O 2) was compared to no oxygen supplementation in other group (Group NoO 2). Desaturation <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> and the PaO 2 just after intubation were compared. Time for SpO 2 to increase to 100 % after initiation of ventilation was also assessed.

An extended laboratory methodgives information {{on the effect of}} pesticides on adults undermore natural conditions. A semi-field test is executed in smallplots under field (glasshouse) conditions. Finally a field testsimulates the conditions in a commercial crop.

The total result of this sequentialscheme should indicate whether, and with what restrictions, aparticular pesticide can be implemented in IPM programs in whichO. laevigatus is used for control of western flower thrips(Frankliniella occidentalis). Twenty-two pesticides were testedincluding five fungicides, twelve insecticides and fiveacaricides. The fungicides captan, carbendazim, sulphur, thiram,tolylfluanid and the insecticides or acaricides pymetrozine,pyriproxyfen, tebufenozide and hexythiazox were harmless in the`worst case' laboratory test and thus did not need furthertesting.

40|$|Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are {{commonly}} used for animal tracking. Over the years, {{a significant number of}} studies have been presented for monitoring moving targets through WSNs. At the same time the location/position information of a target should be available only to authorized entities, e. g., Animal Protection Centers, thus this information should be kept private. The iHIDE is a location privacy mechanism that uses a non-geographical routing scheme for packet delivery over WSN. In this paper we elaborate on that scheme by introducing a routing plan algorithm. We enhance iHIDE by adopting epidemical data dissemination as an enforcing privacy technique. We evaluate through simulations the scheme against other commonly used location privacy overlays in terms of network overhead and <b>safety</b> <b>period</b> and quantify the benefits stemming for its adoption...|$|E
