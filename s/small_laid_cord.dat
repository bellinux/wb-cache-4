40|$|Aedes aegypti is {{the main}} vector of Dengue fever, the most {{important}} mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans. Oviposition site selection has direct effects on vector fitness and population numbers. Female Ae. aegypti that emerged from poor habitats with high larval densities and low food availability were smaller, had lower teneral reserves, and <b>laid</b> <b>smaller,</b> fewer, and less viable eggs than did females raised in good habitats. Females that were raised under good conditions but were infected with a trematode parasite were <b>smaller,</b> <b>laid</b> <b>smaller</b> eggs, and fewer parasitized females oviposited than control females. Females should evaluate site quality and avoid ovipositing in poor habitats. We have identified putative oviposition deterrent compounds, possibly of larval origin, in waters containing parasitized or stressed larvae. Females that recognize these compounds may reject these oviposition sites and search for sites {{that will allow them}} to maximize their individual fitness...|$|R
50|$|Bayt Susin was {{classified}} as a hamlet by the Palestine Index Gazeteer. In the British Mandate period, it was divided into two sections. The larger section had a rectangular, north-south plan and the <b>smaller</b> <b>laid</b> 250 m to the southwest. Its houses were constructed of masonry and a mosque was located close to the village's smaller section. The residents used the spring to obtain water for domestic purposes. The primary economic sectors were agriculture (grain being the chief cash crop) and animal husbandry.|$|R

50|$|The {{designers}} {{had also}} built cavities into the concrete piers where demolition charges could be placed. Explosives could be {{installed at the}} base of the piers in case it came under attack. Electrical circuits, protected by steel tubing, had been included so engineers would be able to detonate the bridge from the safety of the rail tunnel beneath the Erpeler Ley. As a backup, they <b>laid</b> primer <b>cord</b> that could be manually ignited. They believed they could easily destroy the bridge when necessary with minimal preparation.|$|R
50|$|In European megalithic architecture, forecourts are curved in {{plan with}} the {{entrance}} to the tomb at the apex of the open semicircle enclosure that the forecourt creates.

50|$|The fabric {{looks as}} if it is made from {{multiple}} <b>cords</b> <b>laid</b> parallel to each other and then stitched together. The word corduroy is from cord and duroy, a coarse woollen cloth made in England in the 18th century. The interpretation of the word as corde du roi (from French, the cord of the King) is a folk etymology.|$|R
60|$|Hetty smiled, {{though there}} were reasons why a trout fly was worth a good deal to them, {{and one of them}} became {{apparent}} when she glanced at the empty spider laid beside the fire, which burned clear and red between two <b>small</b> logs <b>laid</b> parallel to each other and about a foot apart.|$|R
50|$|In European megalithic architecture, such as {{that found}} in the Megalithic Temples of Malta, forecourts are curved in plan with the {{entrance}} to the tomb at the apex of the open semicircular enclosure that the forecourt creates.

Iron nails and clamps have been recovered from this palace site.There is an underground tunnel that links the palace and the temple inner 1st pragara(north).|$|R
50|$|A {{few years}} later only the main sorting sidings remained: a part of these were {{to be used to}} stable steel trains destined for the Sheffield area, the rest of the {{remaining}} sidings were used to store surplus-to-requirements rolling stock in a poor state of repair.

60|$|When I {{descended into}} the dining-room {{it was already}} almost full, and {{there were very few}} empty tables. For a minute or two I stood behind the {{entrance}} screen, looking around. Nowhere could I see any sign of the lady whose face had so interested me. Either she was dining away from the hotel or had not yet put in an appearance. Hoping devoutly that the latter was the case, I took possession of a <b>small</b> table <b>laid</b> for three facing the door and ordered my dinner.|$|R

6000|$|Amidst a {{storm of}} whispered criticisms, the general opinion was that Letty Shaw was a silly little fool who ought to have known better.

Gustav himself conducted them to a <b>small</b> table <b>laid</b> for two, covered with pink roses, and handed his fair client the menu of a specially ordered supper. There was no gainsaying the fact that Letty and her escort proposed supping alone! ...|$|R
50|$|The rim of Leucippus is eroded, with a <b>smaller</b> crater <b>laid</b> {{across the}} {{southern}} end. A small craterlet lies {{along the western}} inner wall. The edge and inner wall is generally lacking in detail, forming a relatively smooth, gentle slope down to the interior floor. This interior is offset slightly to the southeast, where the inner wall is narrower. The floor is about half {{the diameter of the}} crater. There is a small craterlet on the floor along the southern edge, and a few tiny craterlets mark the otherwise relatively level surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{fortress}} itself extended {{more than}} 150 m {{along the west}} bank of the Nile. It covered 13000 m2, and had within its wall a <b>small</b> town <b>laid</b> out in a grid system.

The walls of the fort were about 5 m thick and 10 m high.|$|R
60|$|But on he went nevertheless, till {{he could}} see both the seas and the citadel of Corinth towering high above all the land. And he past swiftly along the Isthmus, for his heart burned to meet that cruel Sinis; and in a pine-wood at last he met him, where the Isthmus was narrowest and the road ran between high rocks. There he sat upon a stone by the wayside, with a young {{fir-tree}} for a club across his knees, and a <b>cord</b> <b>laid</b> ready by his side; and over his head, upon the fir-tops, hung the bones of murdered men.|$|R

25|$|A {{variation}} on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuel wood {{with a pile of}} tinder between them, and <b>small</b> kindling <b>laid</b> over the tops of the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed {{over the top of the}} logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuel wood, and soon the logs catch fire from it.|$|R

The rim of Wood is somewhat worn and uneven, with a <b>small</b> crater <b>laid</b> across the southwest section. The surviving interior floor is nearly level and is marked only by a few tiny craterlets.|$|R
