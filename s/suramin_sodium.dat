40|$|The {{treatment}} of onchocerciasis using diethylcarbamazine and <b>suramin</b> <b>sodium,</b> which can kill {{different stages of}} the parasite, Onchocerca volvulus, remains unsatisfactory. Recent studies have more clearly defined the serious limitations of the existing forms of treatment. However, two new classes of compounds, the benzimidazoles and avermectins, offer exciting new leads {{in the search for}} a safe and effective treatment that could be used on a large scale...|$|E
40|$|ACTH (1 - 24) induces cell shape {{changes in}} the immunocytes of the bivalve mollusc, Mytilus galloprovincialis. Using {{computer-assisted}} microscopic image analysis, {{we have found that}} the G protein antagonist <b>suramin</b> <b>sodium,</b> the adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2 ´, 5 ´-dideoxyadenosine, and the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibit this effect. The highly specific inhibitors 11 - 89 (for protein kinase A) and calphostin C (for protein kinase C) only inhibited partially the morphological alterations. In contrast, the simultaneous action of 11 - 89 and calphostin C completely blocked these changes. The above findings indicate that ACTH (1 - 24) induces cell shape changes in molluscan immunocytes via adenylate cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway, as well as the activation of protein kinase C...|$|E
40|$|Immunocytes {{from the}} mollusc galloprovincialis express corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) {{receptor}} subtype (CRH-R 1 and CRH-R 2) -like mRNAs. Using computer-assisted microscopic image analysis, {{we have found}} that exogenous CRH provokes changes in the cellular shape of immunocytes, and that this response is extracellular Ca 2 +-dependent. The various inhibitors of transduction signaling pathways, i. e. <b>suramin</b> <b>sodium,</b> 2 ', 5 ' -dideoxyadenosine: neomycin sulfate, calphostin C, H- 89, and wortmannin, completely or partially inhibit these changes. The present findings demonstrate that PKA, PKC, and PKB/Akt are involved in CRH-induced cell shape changes in immunocytes, and that the cellular effect of CRH needs the synergistic action of the two second messengers, cAMP and IP 3.

40|$|<b>Suramin</b> <b>sodium</b> is an {{aromatic}} polysulfonated {{compound that}} was originally introduced as an antiparasitic {{agent in the}} 1920 s. Recently, in view {{of its ability to}} bind and disrupt the function of multiple growth factors and cellular enzyme systems, the authors have been evaluating the role of suramin as an antitumor agent. In this study, 12 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received parenteral suramin by continuous infusion to a peak plasma suramin level greater than 200 micrograms/ml. No objective radiographic responses were observed, although greater than 90 % necrosis of multiple tumor sites was documented at autopsy in one patient and normalization of tumor-related hypercalcemia occurred in another patient. Two patients had stable disease of 10 and 28 weeks' duration, respectively. Significant toxicities included hypotension related to sepsis and resulting in renal insufficiency (one patient), development of liver function abnormalities (one patient) marked thrombocytopenia (one patient), prothrombin time prolongation (all patients), vortex keratopathy (two patients), and Grade 1 sensory neuropathy (two patients). On the basis of the current results, suramin {{does not appear to be}} an active single agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma when administered by this dosing schedule...|$|E
40|$|Typical assays used to {{discover}} and analyze small molecules that inhibit the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS 3 helicase yield few hits and are often con-founded by compound interference. Oligonucleotide binding assays are examined here as an alternative. After comparing fluorescence polarization (FP), homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF; Cisbio) and AlphaScreen (Perkin Elmer) assays, an FP-based assay was chosen to screen Sigma’s Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) for compounds that inhibit NS 3 -DNA complex formation. Four LOPAC compounds in-hibited the FP-based assay: aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (IC 50 = 1. 4 kM), <b>suramin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt (IC 50 = 3. 6 kM), NF 023 hydrate (IC 50 = 6. 2 kM) and tyrphostin AG 538 (IC 50 = 3. 6 kM). All but AG 538 inhibited helicase-catalyzed strand separation, and all but NF 023 inhibited replication of subgenomic HCV rep-licons. A counterscreen using Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) revealed {{that none of the}} new HCV helicase inhibitors were specific for NS 3 h. However, when the SSB-based assay was used to analyze derivatives of another non-specific helicase inhibitor, the main component of the dye primuline, it revealed that some primuline derivatives (e. g. PubChem CID 50930730) are up to 30 -fold more specific for HCV NS 3 h than similarly potent HCV helicase inhibitors...|$|E
