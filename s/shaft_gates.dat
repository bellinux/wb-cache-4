The site includes remnants of the Rogers' No. 1 Mine, No. 3 and 4 South Golden Gate Mine and Mill, Morgan's <b>Shaft,</b> Golden <b>Gate</b> Consols Mine, Croydon Consols Battery and Cyanide Plant, Croydon Consols Pump <b>Shaft,</b> Golden <b>Gate</b> No.10 North Mine, Golden Gate Township, and Golden Gate Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|A {{motor-driven}} cam rotates and alternately {{opens the}} top gate {{and the bottom}} plate. A spring attached to the <b>gate’s</b> <b>shaft</b> re-closes the <b>gates.</b> This type of double dump valve is generally the most reliable and can be operated {{with an electric motor}} or a pneumatic motor. The speed of the cycle can be selected through the gear reducer ratio or by adjusting the motor speed.|$|R
25|$|Golden Gate Mining and Town Complex is a heritage-listed mining camp at Normanton Road (Gulf Developmental Road), Croydon, Shire of Croydon, Queensland, Australia. It {{commenced}} in 1886. It is {{also known}} as Golden Gate Township, Croydon Consols Pump <b>Shaft,</b> Golden <b>Gate</b> No.10 North Mine, Golden Gate Cemetery, Croydon Consols Battery and Cyanide Plant, and Golden Gate Mine. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 August 2009.|$|R
40|$|If air is entrained in {{a bottom}} outlet of a dam in an {{uncontrolled}} way, the resulting air pockets may cause {{problems such as}} blowback, blowout and loss of discharge capacity. In order to provide guidance for bottom outlet design and operation, this study examines how governing parameters affect air entrainment, air-pocket transport and de-aeration and the surrounding flow structure in pipe flows. Both experimental and numerical approaches are used. Air can be entrained into the bottom outlet conduit due to vortex formation at the intake if the intake submergence is not sufficient. The influent of the intake entrance profiles and channel width on the critical submergence were studied in the experiment. The experimental study was performed to investigate the incipient motion of air pockets in pipes with rectangular and circular cross sections. The critical velocity is dependent on pipe slope, pipe diameter, pipe roughness and air-pocket volume. If the pipe is horizontal, air removal is generally easier in a rectangular pipe than in a circular pipe. However, if the pipe is downward-inclined, air removal is easier in a circular pipe. When a bottom outlet gate opens, air can become entrained into the conduit in the <b>gate</b> <b>shaft</b> downstream of the gate. Using FLUENT software, the transient process of air entrainment into a prototype bottom outlet during gate opening is simulated in three dimensions. The simulations show in the flow-pattern changes in the conduit {{and the amount of}} air entrainment in the <b>gate</b> <b>shaft.</b> The initial conduit water level affects the degree of air entrainment. A de-aeration chamber is effective in reducing water surface fluctuations at blowout. High-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV) were applied to investigate the characteristics of the flow field around a stationary air pocket in a fully developed horizontal pipe flow. The air pocket generates a horseshoe vortex upstream and a reverse flow downstream. A shear layer forms from the separation point. Flow reattachment is observed for large air pockets. The air―water interface moves with the adjacent flow. A similarity profile is obtained for the mean streamwise velocity in the shear layer beneath the air pocket. QC 20140211 </p...|$|R
40|$|The University Alaska Fairbanks Nanook EV {{team has}} {{converted}} another snowmobile to electric power. Our new machine has a 48 km (30 mi) range at 32 km/h (20 mi/h). Building on last year’s success (winning Best Range with our original model), {{we started this}} project with a lighter chassis: a Ski-Doo Tundra 300 F at 167 kg (370 lb), and a stronger motor, a NetGain WarP 7 DC-series motor. The motor is connected directly to the sprocket <b>shaft</b> using two <b>Gates</b> Tri-power BX belts. The accumulator is configured to support 211 V using 396 Headway 10 A·h Lithium-ion cells, which utilize Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO 4) chemistry. This 12. 672 kW·h battery pack is the largest used in any electric snowmobile to date. The batteries are connected to a 249 V Logisystems motor controller to power the motor. The snowmobile is a respectable 295 kg (650 lb). It has {{a top speed of}} 80 km/h (50 mi/h) and it is pretty quiet at 54 dB. This snowmobile is poised to do very well in the competition.

5000|$|Carabiners {{are also}} made {{specially}} for via ferratas, their design typically allowing a larger-than-normal opening {{and having a}} spring locking mechanism that can be opened with one hand. They are also strong enough to withstand high fall factors. Such carabiners are marked with a K in a circle, the K standing for Klettersteig, the German term for via ferrata. These are the only types of carabiner that should be used {{on the end of}} the safety lines. A typical design uses a spring-loaded sleeve on the carabiner gate. While the gate is closed, the sleeve is held in place over the gate opening by its spring; to unlock and open the gate, the sleeve slides directly down the <b>gate</b> <b>shaft</b> away from the opening. The ease of opening these devices makes them suitable for via ferrata climbing, with its constant clipping and unclipping, but not for applications where more secure locking mechanisms (automatic or manual) are called for. However, locking sleeves on via ferrata carabiners have been known to hang up in the gate opening and prevent the gate from closing properly. Care must be taken to maintain (clean and lubricate) and/or replace the carabiners as needed to avoid this potentially unsafe situation. Also, these carabiners are not true [...] "locking carabiners", as employed in roped climbing and caving systems, and should not be used as such.|$|R
