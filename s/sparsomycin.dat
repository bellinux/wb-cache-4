50|$|Study of the {{biosynthesis}} of the <b>sparsomycin</b> in {{a greater}} detail has revealed that L-cysteine and S-methyl group of methionine are real precursors for the monooxo-dithioacetal group. These studies have also confirmed the L-tryptophan being a predecessor of the uracil moiety of the <b>sparsomycin.</b> However, it still remained unclear whether the transformation proceeds through the kynureine pathway or not. The next paper published by the same research group has shown that this pathway is {{not responsible for the}} transformations of L-tryphophan in the biosynthesis of <b>sparsomycin.</b> In this paper the authors have also confirmed (E)-3-(4-oxo-6-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)acrylic acid (PCA) and (E)3-(2,4-dioxo-6-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)acrylic acid (UCA) being intermediates in the studied biosynthetic pathway. Several years later an enzyme, which catalyzes transformation of PCA to UCA was found.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{structure}} of <b>sparsomycin</b> was published in 1970, no biosynthetic pathway for its formation was proposed in the literature up until 1988. Ronald J. Parry et al. have investigated biosynthetical precursors for the unusual monooxo-dithioacetal group. By administering the radioactively labeled L-methionine to S. sparsogenes, they figured {{out that it was}} the most probable precursor for C-4' and C-5' atoms of the <b>sparsomycin.</b> However, when administering labeled cysteine, they found that C-4' did not contain any 13C while C-3' still did. This finding led them to an assumption that an enzyme called serine transhydroxymethylase could be responsible for the observation by conversion of the cysteine to serine residue. However, this assumption was not confirmed, as administration of 13C-serine did not produce any labeled <b>sparsomycin.</b> In this study the authors have finally concluded that S-methyl-D-cysteine should be the precursor for this part of the molecule. In this paper they have also proposed a L-tryptophan as a source of the uracil-containing part of the molecule.|$|E

Comparison of the activity of with that of the stereomers, having RCSS, SCSS, and RCRS chirality, respectively, shows that the S configuration of the chiral carbon atom is essential for an optimal activity, whereas the R chirality of the sulfoxide sulfur atom of <b>sparsomycin</b> is of importance. Study of the ID 50 values of the S-deoxo analogues, as well as the compounds having the beta-sulfoxide function, indicate that the presence of an oxygen atom on the alpha-sulfur atom is essential. Isomerization of the trans double bond into the cis double bond yields isosparsomycin, (Scheme II), which has a low activity.

Of I 6 amino acids tested, proline was the most susceptible to the action of <b>sparsomycin</b> and phenylalanine was the most resistant. With gougerotin, the order of decreasing susceptibilities of four amino acids were: phenylalanine, proline and glycine, lysine. Inhibition of virus growth by the two antibiotics was also specific. Synthesis of pseudorabies virus was very susceptible toinhibition by <b>sparsomycin,</b> while vaccinia virus synthesis was almost completely resistant. Newcastle disease virus, fowl plague and Western equine ncephalomyelitis viruses howed intermediate susceptibilities to that drug. In contrast, the synthesis of fowl plague virus was much more inhibited by gougerotin than that of Newcastle disease virus, and this antibiotic had an equal action on the growth of pseudorabies and vaccinia viruses.

The results of feeding experiments with (13 C) - and (2 H) -labeled forms of tryptophan have indicated that the uracil moiety (7) of <b>sparsomycin</b> is derived from the indole nucleus of tryptophan via aromatic ring cleavage followed by recyclization.

40|$|The {{biological}} activity of 14 analogues of <b>sparsomycin</b> (1) was studied in cell-free systems of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Sulfolobus solfataricus {{by measuring the}} inhibition of protein synthesis. The inhibition of L 1210 colony formation in soft agar and bacterial cell growth in solid {{as well as in}} liquid medium was also examined. Each analogue possesses not more than two structural modifications of the <b>sparsomycin</b> molecule. This enabled us to determine unambiguously several structural and stereochemical features that are required for an optimal {{biological activity}} in these assays. <b>Sparsomycin,</b> having the SCRS chirality, is the most potent of the four possible stereoisomers. The results obtained with compounds 5 - 7 indicate that the presence of an oxygen atom on the S (alpha) atom is essential. Substitution of the bivalent sulfur atom by a CH 2 group (10) or of the SCH 3 moiety by a Cl atom (12) affects the activity of the molecule partially. Compound 12 is surprisingly active against intact cells. Substitution of the C(6) -CH 3 group by a H(14) reduces the activity of the molecule. Isomerization of the trans double bond into the cis double bond yields cis-sparsomycin (15), which is inactive.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the antitumor antibiotic, <b>sparsomycin,</b> {{produced by}} Streptomyces sparsogenes, has been investigated. Incorporation studies employing (13 C) -labeled precursors {{have shown that}} both L- and D-isomers of S-(methylthio) methyl-cysteine are specifically incorporated into the antibiotic. Furthermore, both L- and D-isomers of S-(methylthio) methylcysteinol are {{proved to be the}} advanced intermediates lying beyond S-(methylthio) methylcysteine. S-Methylcysteine is found not to be incorporated intact into the antibiotic; however, an isotopic trapping experiment and preliminary cell-free studies indicate that S-methylcysteine is still quite likely to be an intermediate on the pathway. A very high isotope effect was observed during studies of the loss of hydrogen atoms from the methyl group of S-methylcysteine. The uracil moiety (6) of <b>sparsomycin</b> is found to be derived from the indole fragment of tryptophan. N-Formylanthranilic acid was originally proposed as an intermediate lying beyond tryptophan on the pathway to 6.

40|$|The {{antitumor}} antibiotic <b>sparsomycin</b> is {{a universal}} and potent inhibitor of peptide bond formation and selectively acts on several human tumors. It binds to the ribosome strongly, at an unknown site, {{in the presence of}} an N-blocked donor tRNA substrate, which it stabilizes on the ribosome. Its site of action was investigated by inducing a crosslink between <b>sparsomycin</b> and bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic ribosomes complexed with P-site-bound tRNA, on irradiating with low energy ultraviolet light (at 365 nm). The crosslink was localized exclusively to the universally conserved nucleotide A 2602 within the peptidyl transferase loop region of 23 S-like rRNA by using a combination of a primer extension approach, RNase H fragment analysis, and crosslinking with radioactive [125 I]phenol-alanine-sparsomycin. Crosslinking of several <b>sparsomycin</b> derivatives, modified near the sulfoxy group, implicated the modified uracil residue in the rRNA crosslink. The yield of the antibiotic crosslink was weak in the presence of deacylated tRNA and strong in the presence of an N-blocked P-site-bound tRNA, which, as was shown earlier, increases the accessibility of A 2602 on the ribosome. We infer that both A 2602 and its induced conformational switch are critically important both for the peptidyl transfer reaction and for antibiotic inhibition. This supposition is reinforced by the observation that other antibiotics that can prevent peptide bond formation in vitro inhibit, to different degrees, formation of the crosslink...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} {{demonstration that}} mutants of 5 S rRNA called mof 9 can specifically alter efficiencies of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) suggested {{a role for}} this ubiquitous molecule in the maintenance of translational reading frame, though the repetitive nature of the 5 S rDNA gene (> 100 copies/cell) inhibited more detailed analyses. However, given the known interactions between 5 S rRNA and ribosomal protein L 5 (previously called L 1 or YL 3) encoded by an essential, single-copy gene, we monitored {{the effects of a}} series of well-defined rpl 5 mutants on PRF and virus propagation. Consistent with the mof 9 results, we find that the rpl 5 mutants promoted increased frameshifting efficiencies in both the - 1 and + 1 directions, and conferred defects in the ability of cells to propagate two endogenous viruses. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that mutant ribosomes had decreased affinities for peptidyl-tRNA. Pharmacological studies showed that <b>sparsomycin,</b> a peptidyltransferase inhibitor that specifically increases the binding of peptidyl-tRNA with ribosomes, was antagonistic to the frameshifting defects of the most severe mutant, and the extent of <b>sparsomycin</b> resistance correlated with the severity of the frameshifting defects in all of the mutants. These results provide biochemical and physiological evidence that one function of L 5 is to anchor peptidyl-tRNA to the P-site.

E., Celma, M. L. & Vazquez, D. (1969) Nature (London) 222, 356 - 358]. All three oligonucleotides protect a characteristic set of bases in 23 S rRNA from chemical probes: G 2252, G 2253, A 2439, A 2451, U 2506, and U 2585. A 2602 shows enhanced reactivity. These account for most of the same bases that are protected when peptidyl-tRNA analogues such as AcPhe-tRNA are bound to the ribosomal P site, and correspond precisely to those bases whose protection is abolished by removal of the 3 '-CA end of tRNA. We conclude that most of the observed interactions between tRNA and 23 S rRNA in the 50 S ribosomal P site involve the conserved CCA terminus of tRNA. <b>Sparsomycin</b> may inhibit protein synthesis by stabilizing interaction between the peptidyl-CCA and the 23 S P site, preventing formation of the intermediate A/P hybrid state...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotics {{were used}} as probes of {{ribosome}} topology and function. Studies of [14 C]chloramphenicol and [14 C]erythromycin binding to ribosomes and polyribosomes revealed the following features. The requirement of high K+ concentration (150 mM) for [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed ribosomes resulted from the washing procedure. Neither native 70 S ribosomes nor polyribosomes require K+ greater than 30 mM for [14 C]chloramphenicol binding. Whereas [14 C]chloramphenicol binds to both ribosomes and polyribosomes, [14 C]erythromycin binds essentially only to ribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) from polyribosomes, [14 C]erythromycin could then be bound. The effects {{of a number of}} antibiotics on [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to ribosomes and polyribosomes was assessed. It was found that most of the macrolides (erythromycin, carbomycin, spiramycin III, niddamycin, oleandomycin, and tylosin) and streptogramins A and B (vernamycin A, PA 114 A, vernamycin Bα, and PA 114 B) inhibited chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed and native 70 S ribosomes, but not to polyribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-tRNA from polyribosomes, [14 C]chloramphenicol binding was then inhibited. In contrast, <b>sparsomycin</b> and althiomycin inhibited chloram-phenicol binding to polyribosomes, but not to ribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-tRNA from polyribosomes, <b>sparsomycin</b> and althiomycin were then ineffective. The presence of peptidyl-tRNA on polyribosomes apparently is required for binding of <b>sparsomycin</b> and althiomycin, but prevents binding of most macrolides and streptogramins. The lincosaminides (lincomycin and celesticetin) and methymycin (a small macrolide) inhibited [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed and native 70 S ribosomes best, but also inhibited the binding to polyribosomes. The amino nucleosides and other antibiotics tested do not seem to interact strongly with the major chloramphenicol-binding site.

Ribosomes from S. sparsogenes and the S. lividans-resistant strains are equally sensitive to the inhibitor and bind the drug with similar affinity. Moreover, the drug was not modified by the resistant strains. However, resistant cells accumulated less antibiotic than the sensitive ones.

Carbomycin, celesticetin, chloramphenicol, puromycin, <b>sparsomycin,</b> tetracycline, and thiostrepton all inhibited growth by different degrees. Spontaneous drug-resistant mutants were isolated from plates containing celesticetin or chloramphenicol. Six mutants from each plate exhibited a C- 2585 -to-U transition in the peptidyl transferase loop of 23 S rRNA (corresponding to C- 2452 in Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA). The single-site mutation also conferred resistance to carbomycin. The mutated 23 S rRNA gene provides a potentially useful and dominant marker for a thermophilic archael vector...|$|E
40|$|Methylated {{reovirus}} and {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus mRNAs, synthesized in vitro {{in the presence}} of S-adenosylmethionine by the virion-associated polymerases (RNA nucleotidyltransferases, EC 2. 7. 7. 6), stimulate protein synthesis by wehat germ extracts {{to a greater extent than}} unmethylated mRNAs. Addition of S-adenosylmethionine to a cell-free extract programmed with unmethylated mRNA stimulates protein synthesis and results in methylation of the mRNA. An inhibitor of mRNA methylation. S-adenosylhomocysteine, blocks translation of unmethylated, but not of methylated, mRNAs. Aurintricarboxylic acid, which inhibits polypepetide chain initiation, also prevents mRNA methylation by wheat germ extracts. In contrast, <b>sparsomycin,</b> which inhibits polypeptide chain elongation, does not reduce mRNA methylation. The results indicate that methylation of viral mRNA is required for translation in vitro and suggest that mRNA methylation occurs at the initiation step of protein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of tRNA mimics complexed {{with the large}} ribosomal subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans indicate that remote interactions determine the precise orientation of tRNA in the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC). The PTC tolerates various orientations of puromycin derivatives and its flexibility allows the conformational rearrangements required for peptide-bond formation. <b>Sparsomycin</b> binds to A 2602 and alters the PTC conformation. H 69, the intersubunit-bridge connecting the PTC and decoding site, may also participate in tRNA placement and translocation. A spiral rotation of the 3 ′ end of the A-site tRNA around a 2 -fold axis of symmetry identified within the PTC suggests a unified ribosomal machinery for peptide-bond formation, A-to-P-site translocation, and entrance of nascent proteins into the exit tunnel. Similar 2 -fold related regions, detected in all known {{structures of}} large ribosomal subunits, indicate the universality of thi...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two peptidyl-transferase inhibitors, anisomycin and <b>sparsomycin,</b> on ribosomal frameshifting {{efficiencies}} and {{the propagation of}} yeast double-stranded RNA viruses were examined. At sublethal doses in yeast cells these drugs specifically alter the efficiency of − 1, but not of + 1, ribosomal frameshifting. These compounds promote loss of the yeast L-A double-stranded RNA virus, which uses a programmed − 1 ribosomal frameshift to produce its Gag-Pol fusion protein. Both of these drugs also change the efficiency of − 1 ribosomal frameshifting in yeast and mammalian in vitro translation systems, suggesting {{that they may have}} applications to control the propagation of viruses of higher eukaryotes, which also use this translational regulatory mechanism. Our results offer a new set of antiviral agents that may potentially have a broad range of applications in the clinical, veterinary, and agricultural fields...|$|E
