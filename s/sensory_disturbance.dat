40|$|Typical {{associated}} {{signs and}} symptoms of displaced zygomatic fractures include lack of zygoma projection, diplopia, and <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> of the infraorbital nerve (ION). The aim of this article was to assess eventual associations between ION <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> and zygomatic fractures patterns. This study is based on 2 databases that have continuously recorded patients hospitalized with maxillofacial fractures in 2 Departments of Maxillofacial Surgery in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Turin, Italy between 2001 and 2010. The following data for patients surgically treated for displaced zygomatic fractures were considered: gender, age, site and severity of facial fractures, etiology, and presenting symptoms. Statistically significant associations were found between ION <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> and assaults (P = 0. 007) and sport accidents (P = 0. 00003), as well as between ION <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> and isolated zygomatic fractures (P = 0. 000002) and between ION <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> and diplopia (P = 0. 00009). The severity of injury and the absorption of middle-energy and high-energy forces by the zygomatic complex only were associated with ION <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The etiology and severity of the injury as well as the presence of associated symptoms should be thoroughly investigated when a zygomatic fracture is suspected.

40|$|Background: Recently, the {{existence}} of sensory branches of the suprascapular nerve (SSN) has been reported, and <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> at the lateral and posterior aspect of the shoulder {{has been focused on}} as a symptom of SSN palsy. We have performed arthroscopic release of SSN at the suprascapular notch in patients with the <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> since 2006. The purposes of this study were to introduce the arthroscopic surgical technique and to investigate postoperative recovery of <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Methods: Twenty-five shoulders (11 men and 14 women, average age: 63. 9 years (range, 41 - 77)) followed for more than 1 year were included in this study. Arthroscopic decompression of SSN was performed using a suprascapular nerve portal (SN portal) as a landmark for approaching the suprascapular notch. <b>Sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the shoulder was evaluated pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up period was 12 - 30 months (avg. 18. 5). Results: The arthroscopic procedures was able to be performed safely. The preoperative <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> fully recovered postoperatively in all shoulders. Conclusion: Arthroscopic release of SSN {{is considered to be a}} useful procedure for the entrapment of SSN at the suprascapular notch. The <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> at the lateral and posterior aspect of the shoulder can be used as one of the criteria of diagnosing SSN palsy especially in shoulders with massive rotator cuff tear, which usually have difficulty in diagnosing and assessing the treatment results of associated SSN palsy...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{validation}} of two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein, and pinprick tests of possible <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the inferior alveolar nerve after the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth. Forty-two patients who had undergone elective unilateral lower wisdom tooth removal and 30 control subjects were given two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein, and pinprick tests bilaterally in the dermatome of the mental nerve.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMany {{patients}} from Toroku, Japan, who have chronic arsenic exposure demonstrate whole-body <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> that is slightly {{more pronounced in}} the extremities. Although previous research in this population showed a mild peripheral neuropathy, it is unknown whether these patients have central nervous system impairment. To investigate the lesion sites underlying <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> related to chronic arsenic poisoning, we analyzed somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). MethodsClinical features, nerve conduction study results, and median and/or tibial SEP were analyzed in patients with chronic arsenic exposure (total, 13 patients; median & tibial, 4; median, 5; tibial, 4) retrospectively. The SEP findings in patients were compared with those in normal controls. ResultsThe median SEP results indicated a conduction delay between the proximal brachial plexus and the primary sensory cortex, and tibial SEP findings indicated a delay between the dorsal gray matter of the lumbosacral cord and the primary sensory cortex. ConclusionThis is the first study to identify an impairment of the central somatosensory pathway in patients with chronic arsenic exposure. <b>Sensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> in these patients is related not only to peripheral neuropathy but also to impairment of the central nervous system...|$|E

40|$|It is {{emerging}} that whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) {{is a complex}} condition characterised {{by a variety of}} physical and psychological features.

40|$|To review {{mechanisms}} that {{might contribute to}} <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> and sympathetically-maintained pain in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS {{is associated with a}} range of sensory and autonomic abnormalities. In a subpopulation of patients, sympathetic nervous system arousal and intradermal injection of adrenergic agonists intensify pain. Mechanisms responsible for sensory abnormalities in CRPS include sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors and spinothalamic tract neurons, disinhibition of central nociceptive neurons, and reorganization of thalamo-cortical somatosensory maps. Proposed mechanisms of sympathetically-maintained pain include adrenergic excitation of sensitized nociceptors in the CRPS-affected limb, and interaction between processes within the central nervous system that modulate nociception and emotional responses. Central mechanisms could involve adrenergic facilitation of nociceptive transmission in the dorsal horn or thalamus, and/or depletion of bulbo-spinal opioids or tolerance to their effects. Sympathetic neural activity might contribute to pain and <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> in CRPS by feeding into nociceptive circuits at the site of injury or elsewhere in the CRPS-affected limb, within the dorsal horn, or via thalamo-cortical projections...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To measure <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> of the {{inferior}} alveolar nerve (IAN) after removal of impacted mandibular third molars using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and dental panoramic radiography (PAN) for preoperative assessment in a randomized controlled trial and {{to measure the}} efficacy of the observers' prediction of IAN exposure at surgery based on CBCT compared with PAN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 86 impacted third molars (from 79 consecutive patients) in close relation to the IAN as determined by PAN and judged as showing a "moderate" risk of IAN damage. Cases presenting with no close relation between the IAN and roots and extremely risky cases with an obvious interrelation were excluded. Potential neurosensory disturbances of the lip and chin were assessed before surgery and during the postoperative recall by measuring the function of the IAN with the light-touch sensation method. RESULTS: Postoperative <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> occurred in 1 patient in the CBCT group and 1 patient in the PAN group. The light-touch sensation test showed no significant differences at the lip (P =. 10) and chin (P =. 17) levels for CBCT- versus PAN-based surgery. Significant differences in making a correct diagnosis of neurovascular bundle exposure at the extraction of impacted teeth were found between the 2 modalities (P =. 029). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the present pilot study, CBCT was not superior to PAN in predicting postoperative <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> but was superior in predicting IAN exposure during third molar removal in cases judged as having "moderate" risk. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the most}} widely agreed neurophysiological tool for {{investigating}} small fiber damage is laser-evoked potential (LEP) recording, no study has documented its diagnostic accuracy. In this clinical, neurophysiological, and skin biopsy study, we collected age-corrected LEP normative ranges, verified the association of LEPs with pinprick <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the typical diabetic mixed fiber polyneuropathy, and assessed the sensitivity and specificity of LEPs in diabetic small fiber neuropathy. From 288 LEP recordings from the face, hand, and foot in 73 healthy subjects, we collected age-corrected normative ranges for LEPs. We then selected 100 patients with mixed-fiber diabetic neuropathy and 25 patients with possible small-fiber diabetic neuropathy. In the 100 patients with mixed fiber neuropathy, we verified how LEP abnormalities were associated with clinically evident pinprick <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances.</b> In the 25 patients with possible pure small fiber neuropathy, using the skin biopsy for assessing the intraepidermal nerve fiber density as a reference standard, we calculated LEP sensitivity and specificity. In healthy participants, age strongly influenced normative ranges for all LEP variables. By applying age-corrected normative ranges for LEPs, we found that LEPs were strongly associated with pinprick <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances.</b> In relation to the skin biopsy findings, LEPs yielded 78 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity in the diagnosis of diabetic small fiber neuropathy. Our study, providing age-corrected normative ranges for the main LEP data and their diagnostic accuracy, helps to make LEPs more reliable as a clinical diagnostic tool, and proposes this technique as a less invasive alternative to skin biopsy for diagnosing diabetic small fiber neuropathy...|$|R
40|$|Incongruence {{between our}} motor {{intention}} and the sensory feedback {{of the action}} (sensorimotor conflict) induces abnormalities in sensory perception in various chronic pain populations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in pain-free individuals. The aim of this study was to simultaneously investigate <b>sensory</b> and motor <b>disturbances</b> evoked by sensorimotor conflicts, as well as to assess how they are influenced by the presence of acute pain. It was hypothesized that both <b>sensory</b> and motor <b>disturbances</b> would be increased in presence of pain, which would suggest that pain makes body representations less robust. Thirty healthy participants realized cyclic asymmetric movements of flexion-extension with both upper limbs in a robotized system combined to a 2 D virtual environment. The virtual environment provided a visual feedback (VF) about movements that was either congruent or incongruent, while the robotized system precisely measured motor performance (characterized by bilateral amplitude asymmetry and medio-lateral drift). Changes in sensory perception were assessed with a questionnaire after each trial. The effect of pain (induced with capsaicin) was compared to three control conditions (no somatosensory stimulation, tactile distraction and proprioceptive masking). Results showed that while both <b>sensory</b> and motor <b>disturbances</b> were induced by sensorimotor conflicts, only <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> were enhanced during pain condition comparatively to the three control conditions. This increase did not statistically differ across VF conditions (congruent or incongruent). Interestingly however, the types of sensations evoked by the conflict in the presence of pain (changes in intensity of pain or discomfort, changes in temperature or impression of a missing limb) were different than those evoked by the conflict alone (loss of control, peculiarity and the perception of having an extra limb). Finally, results showed no relationship between the amount of motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> evoked in a given individual. Contrary to what was hypothesized, acute pain does not appear to make people more sensitive to the conflict itself, but rather impacts on the type and amount of <b>sensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> that they experienced in response to that conflict. Moreover, the results suggest that some sensorimotor integration processes remain intact in presence of acute pain, allowing us to maintain adaptive motor behavior...|$|R
