Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E
5|$|Modern DST {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through {{a large part of}} a summer day. An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.|$|E

This raised the concern that the extended-duration <b>shifts</b> commonly <b>worked</b> by interns {{may contribute to the}} risk of medical errors being made, and perhaps to the risk of adverse events more generally. Our current study assessed whether extended-duration <b>shifts</b> <b>worked</b> by interns are associated with significant medical errors, adverse events, and attentional failures in a diverse population of interns across the United States. Methods and FindingsWe conducted a Web-based survey, across the United States, in which 2, 737 residents in their first postgraduate year (interns) completed 17, 003 monthly reports. The association between the number of extended-duration <b>shifts</b> <b>worked</b> in the month and the reporting of significant medical errors, preventable adverse events, and attentional failures was assessed using a case-crossover analysis in which each intern acted as his/her own control.

Two alternatives of <b>work</b> <b>shift</b> model, based on Miller’s suggestion, are proposed to the company.

The result of analysis shows that the current <b>work</b> <b>shift</b> has unequal workload distribution, indicated by its standard deviation, which is higher than the standard deviation of two alternatives of <b>work</b> <b>shift</b> model that have been adjusted. The adjusted <b>work</b> <b>shift</b> model with the lowest standard deviation indicates that the expected workload assigned is more equally allocated.

Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets to the majority of urban households.

25|$|The fast-paced and {{unpredictable}} nature {{of health care}} places nurses at risk for injuries and illnesses, including high occupational stress. Nursing is a particularly stressful profession, and nurses consistently identify stress as a major work-related concern and have among {{the highest levels of}} occupational stress when compared to other professions. This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including new technology that must be mastered, the emotional labor involved in nursing, physical labor, <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including sleep disorders, depression, mortality, psychiatric disorders, stress-related illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing compassion fatigue and moral distress, which can worsen mental health. They also have very high rates of occupational burnout (40%) and emotional exhaustion (43.2%). Burnout and exhaustion increase the risk for illness, medical error, and suboptimal care provision.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a country}} with a {{comprehensive}} fire service, fire departments must be able to send firefighters to emergencies at any hour of day or night, to arrive on the scene within minutes.

On the other hand, it may not be practical to employ full-time firefighters in villages and isolated small towns, where their services may not be required for days at a time. For this reason, many fire departments have firefighters who spend long periods on call to respond to infrequent emergencies; they may have regular jobs outside of firefighting.
