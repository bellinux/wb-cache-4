40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and {{effective}} numerical approach is presented {{on the basis of}} the Member Discrete Element Method (MDEM) to investigate static and dynamic responses of steel frames with semi-rigid joints. In the MDEM, structures are discretized into a set of finite rigid particles. The motion equation of each particle is solved by the central difference method and two adjacent arbitrarily particles are connected by the contact constitutive model. The above characteristics means that the MDEM is able to naturally handle structural geometric nonlinearity and fracture. Meanwhile, the computational framework of static analysis is consistent with that of dynamic analysis, except the determination of damping. A virtual spring element with two particles but without actual mass and length is used to simulate the mechanical behaviors of semi-rigid joints. The spring element is not directly involved in the calculation, but is employed only to modify the stiffness coefficients of contact elements at the <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections.</b> Based on the above-mentioned concept, the modified formula of the contact element stiffness with consideration of <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> is deduced. The Richard-Abbort four-parameter model and independent hardening model are further introduced accordingly to accurately capture the nonlinearity and hysteresis performance of <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections.</b> Finally, the numerical approach proposed is verified by complex behaviors of steel frames with <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> such as geometric nonlinearity, snap-through buckling, dynamic responses and fracture. The comparison of static and dynamic responses obtained using the modified MDEM and those of the published studies illustrates that the modified MDEM can simulate the mechanical behaviors of <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> simply and directly, and can accurately effectively capture the linear and nonlinear behaviors of <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> under static and dynamic loading. Some conclusions, as expected, are drawn that structural bearing capacity under static loading will be overestimated if <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> are ignored; when the frequency of dynamic load applied is close to structural fundamental frequency, hysteresis damping of nonlinear <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> can cause energy dissipation compared to rigid and linear <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections,</b> thus avoiding the occurrence of resonance. Additionally, fracture analysis also indicates that semi-rigid steel frames possess more anti-collapse capacity than that with rigid steel frames...|$|R

Years ago, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the behavior of column and developed the design method on <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connection</b> for braced and unbraced frames.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry prefers connections without stiffeners for economic reasons. The deformation behaviour of these connections {{has to be}} considered in the analysis of constructions. In many cases the complex stress-deformation behaviour of these <b>connections</b> (<b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections)</b> is only poorly described by the existing models. With the help of the finite element method the real load-carrying behaviour of the <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> can be investigated. Earlier numerical studies do not allow a reliable prediction of the load-deflection behaviour of these connections. The main aspect of this work is the reliable analysis of <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> by using the finite element method. In order to get an efficient simulation, brick elements have to be used which have very good deformation characteristics under bending and in the plastic regime. A realistic numerical model requires a three-dimensional contact formulation with friction for large deformations. An EAS-element (enhanced assumed strain) and a contact element are numerical prepared and implemented in a finite element program in this work because of the requirements mentioned above. From extensive numerical studies a catalogue of requirements is layed down which now allows to model <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connections</b> for reliable predictions of the load-carrying behaviour. It is shown how to apply this catalogue to end plate joints with a momentum loading in an efficient way. T-stub experiments have been performed and described in this work.

40|$|In design stage, the {{conventional}} steel buildings are commonly using {{the methods of}} pinned design {{which means that the}} behavior of the connection is fully on the basis of pin and rigid design which means that the behavior of the connection is completely rigid. In contrast, the real behavior of joints are not fully rigid or fully pinned, therefore the discrepancy between these manners is called <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connection.</b> Therefore, this study is lead to evaluate the semi-rigid connected frame under the dynamic loading by applying damper. The numerical method on the basis of stiffness matrix method, which is developed using in Matlab Program, is used to assess this condition that can be divided in the main five steps. Firstly, mass and stiffness matrixes of <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connection</b> frame are obtained. Secondly, formulation of damping matrix is developed.

Finally, numerical method is verified by SAP 2000 modeling. In conclusion, by increasing the spring stiffness coefficient the lateral rigidity of frame increases. In the case of the constant section area of frame member, as the spring coefficient of semi-rigid increases while it reaches to rigid connection, the text increment of spring coefficient cannot improve rigidity of the frame. It means that there is no absolute rigid connection, and vice versa it is true for pinned connection. Other noticeable results are that, applying of damper and addition of damper ratio can dissipate vibration caused by dynamic loading in the shorter time and modify the amount of frame displacement at resonance frequency...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop an {{approach}} that considers fire as a load in the design of structures. Recent studies of the full-scale fire tests in Cardington, UK and the World Trade Centre collapse have shown that the behaviour of steel structures in fire when assembled into a frame differs from that measured or predicted by fire testing of individual structural elements, revealing the importance of accounting for realistic fire loads in the design of structures and the potential inadequacy of fire testing individual elements as employed by current building codes. Yet, there has been limited basic research and development to allow consideration of fire as a load in the analysis and design of structures. In response to this much needed work, this thesis develops an approach to include fire as a load in the analysis of a 2 -bay by 2 -storey structure when a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connection</b> is exposed to thermal loads typical of those that might be encountered during a real fire. The structural fire analysis is principally based on incorporating moment-rotation-temperature data for the connection, as found in archival literature, into a structural analysis software package developed at the University of Waterloo. The software employs a modified Displacement Method for analyzing structures, which involves the computation of stiffness reduction factors that represent the deterioration of strength of the structural elements as they are subjected to various loads. By modifying the moment-rotation-temperature data for a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connection</b> into a form recognized by the software, a fire load is simulated by incrementally elevating the temperature of the affected steel connection. In this way, a fragility analysis of the entire structure under fire load is conducted. A series of example calculations are presented for cases in which the <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>connection</b> is exposed to increasing temperatures of 20 °C, 200 °C, 400 °C and 600 °C. The analysis showed that as the connection is heated, it is weakened, and the steel structure undergoes a redistribution of moments from the heated connection to other non-heated elements within the framework, which is essentially a form of fire-resistance of the assembled structure that unassembled members in isolation do not have. The study also demonstrated that the experimental moment-rotation-temperature data reported in archival literature can be incorporated into the structural analysis, and that additional force-deformation data obtained from further experimental work or through finite-element analyses would allow the study to be extended to analyze the effects of fire loading on other structural elements of an assembled framework. To demonstrate the link between the predicted structural response at different temperatures and the development of a compartment fire, a fire modelling analysis is also performed...|$|E

It is therefore legitimate to question the seismic response of these historic buildings. Recent experimental work has shown that these connections can develop stable hysteretic moment rotation behavior, but must undergo large rotations in order to reach moderate moment capacity. This raises important concerns about the ability of buildings having such connections to withstand earthquakes while undergoing large drifts.
