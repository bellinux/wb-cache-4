5000|$|Because in {{most cases}} it is {{desirable}} to isolate coil-wound pickups from the unintended sound of internal vibration of loose coil windings, a guitar's magnetic pickups are normally embedded or [...] "potted" [...] in wax, lacquer, or epoxy to prevent the pickup from producing a microphonic effect. Because of their natural inductive qualities, all magnetic pickups tend to pick up ambient, usually unwanted electromagnetic interference or EMI. The resulting hum is particularly strong with single-coil pickups, and it is aggravated {{by the fact that}} many vintage guitars are insufficiently shielded against electromagnetic interference. The most common source is 50- or 60-Hz hum from power transmission <b>systems</b> (<b>house</b> wiring, etc.). Since nearly all amplifiers and audio equipment associated with electric guitars must be plugged in, it is a continuing technical challenge to reduce or eliminate unwanted hum.|$|E
5000|$|John Chisholm {{was educated}} at Worth School, and later {{attended}} Cambridge University, reading Mechanical Sciences on a scholarship from General Motors. After completing his studies, {{he worked at}} GM from 1968 as a graduate apprentice before joining BP's computer consultancy firm Scicon in 1969. He joined leading <b>systems</b> <b>house</b> CAP and founded a divisional company within that group called CAP Scientific Ltd in 1979 {{of which he was}} managing director. In 1988 CAP merged with SEMA-METRA, a French company and the merged group was called Sema Group allowing it to trade in Europe where [...] "CAP" [...] was already used by an historical link with CAP-Gemini. SEMA-METRA was cash rich whereas CAP Group had a very strong order book. This allowed balancing of the new group's portfolio. In practice some would regard the move as a reverse takeover due to the relative strength of the French component of the company. Chisholm was UK managing director of Sema Group plc.|$|E
5000|$|The Eaton BladeUPS is a modular {{three-phase}} UPS system {{consisting of}} individual 6U 12 kW UPS units {{which can be}} paralleled together to create up to a 60 kW N+1 redundant UPS. A feature of the BladeUPS is that the 6U cabinet houses both the UPS electronics and batteries; other modular <b>systems</b> <b>house</b> them separately. [...] The high power density and 6U form factor of the BladeUPS are targeted at the growing power demands of IT servers and equipment, especially blade servers.The BladeUPS does not fall into a defined category for UPS type {{as it is a}} hybrid of a line interactive and online architecture, which Eaton calls Double Conversion on Demand. [...] During normal operation the BladeUPS operates as a line interactive UPS allowing it to be energy efficient. When power conditions fluctuate outside preset standards, the unit switches into online mode (also known as double conversion). Software upgrades by Eaton have allowed BladeUPS owners to defeat this hybrid architecture and force the unit to operate entirely in online (double conversion) mode.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem was}} not the {{availability}} of suitable aircraft {{but the lack of}} an effective airborne radar. An ad hoc team of specialists from DRDO's Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) began work on developing an airborne radar, allowing the programme to proceed. Studies and analysis began in July 1985 under the project name 'Guardian', later (possibly in 1987) renamed 'Airawat'. In the late 1980s an HS 748 aircraft was fitted with a 24 ft x 5 ft composite rotodome. The aircraft flew with the pylon, but not the dome, in May 1989 and with the rotodome in November 1990. The Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) was set up in February 1991, under Dr K. Ramchand to act as a <b>systems</b> <b>house</b> and integration agency using all the expertise and infrastructure available in India. At the peak of its operations, some 300 scientists and engineers were involved in the project. The aircraft was unveiled to the public during flight demonstrations at the inauguration ceremony of the first Aero India show held in Bangalore in December 1996. Two testbed aircraft transferred from the western command of the Indian Air Force, with tail numbers H-2175 and H-2176, were employed in the design program.|$|E

40|$|A growing {{interest}} {{is devoted to}} global-scale approaches in ecology and evolution that examine patterns and determinants of species diversity and the threats resulting from global change.

Freshwater <b>systems</b> <b>house</b> a disproportionately high fraction of the global fish diversity considering the small proportion of the earth's surface that they occupy, and {{are one of the}} most threatened habitats on Earth. Here we provide complete species lists for 3119 drainage basins covering more than 80 % of the Earth surface using 14953 fish species inhabiting permanently or occasionally freshwater systems. The database results from an extensive survey of native and non-native freshwater fish species distribution based on 1436 published papers, books, grey literature and web-based sources.

40|$|The {{demand for}} house crickets {{as a source}} of food or feed is increasing. Meeting this demand will require {{efficient}} production <b>systems.</b> <b>House</b> crickets are often fed a combination of dry feed and fresh plant material. Supplying fresh plant material could improve growth and development, but also increases labour and costs. Two experiments were conducted to verify that provision of fresh plant materials has a beneficial effect on house cricket performance. In the first experiment, house crickets were provided with an ad libitum supply of chicken feed, a water dispenser, and with carrots at different frequencies: (1) daily; (2) three times a week; (3) first week daily then three times a week; (4) two weeks daily then three times a week; and (5) no carrots. When the first cricket in a container reached adulthood, all crickets in that container were harvested. Survival, development time and body weight were determined. In a second experiment feed conversion efficiency of house crickets, either provided with carrots daily or not at all, was compared. No effects of carrot provision on survival, development time, body weight or feed conversion efficiency were found. The outcomes of these parameters were similar to other studies in which crickets were provided with chicken feed. The results indicate that supplying carrots in addition to a suitable dry feed and water does not improve house cricket survival, development time, body weight and feed conversion efficiency. </p...|$|E
