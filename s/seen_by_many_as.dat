5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> a step back to Catholic practice.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 White Paper was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> {{an attempt}} to {{strengthen}} Australia's relationship with the United States, which had been damaged by New Zealand's stance against nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with this policy, the RAN was structured to become more self-reliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia's local region.|$|E
5|$|The {{recording}} of the transit is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> the birth of modern astronomy in Britain. John Flamsteed later said he regarded Horrocks, Crabtree and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to Galileo and Kepler. and began his three folio volume, Historia Coelestis Britannica (1745) by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643.|$|E

5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or {{that the absence of}} a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{mission to}} move a {{metallic}} disc {{from one side of}} an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{destroyed a}} colonial administration ruled {{from the other}} side of the world, and dismantled with it the raja, <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.|$|E

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's 1961 {{commitment}} to a staffed moon landing {{before the end of}} the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of unstaffed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for staffed missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program produced the first close-up pictures; the Lunar Orbiter program produced maps of the entire Moon; the Surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after Luna 9. The staffed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of unstaffed and staffed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar flight, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first staffed mission to lunar orbit. The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> the culmination of the Space Race.|$|E

25|$|The {{candidate}} of the governing centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) Andrija Hebrang came in third with 12% of the vote, a result noticeably better than most polls had predicted, but still <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> a debacle for HDZ as he achieved the lowest ever result for the party {{on a national level}} and also became their first presidential candidate not to secure a second round since Mate Granić in 2000. Nadan Vidošević, who was <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> a front-runner for the presidency {{in the beginning of the}} year, came in fourth with 11% of the vote. Dragan Primorac was the third prominent right-wing candidate who invested huge sums in his campaign, but in the poll he achieved only 6%, lower than what many polls had predicted. Primorac was indeed surpassed even by the centre-left candidate Vesna Pusić who was fifth, obtaining 7.25%.|$|E
