40|$|Of late, tipping {{has become}} a topic of great debate. This pilot study {{attempted}} to capture tipping perceptions and practices in a largely minority population. The study found that respondents perceived the need to tip restaurant servers more regularly than other hospitality service providers such guest service employees and <b>shuttle</b> <b>drivers.</b> The study indicated that the respondents were inconsistent with their perceptions regarding the importance of tipping and practices for two out of the three service providers (guest service employees and hotel <b>shuttle</b> <b>drivers)</b> regarding tipping in the restaurant establishments. The results also indicated that prompt service, attentiveness, a warm welcome, a positive deposition, attire, skills and knowledge and being proactive about the service experience were justifications for tipping in general...|$|R

There, {{they spend their}} time relaxing and being pampered in paradise. Following a storm after their first night, the guests suddenly find themselves all alone, with dwindling supplies, without communication with the outside world, and abandoned by the resort staff. The guests discover they have each recently experienced a brush with death, and they try to determine what it means. As time passes, they receive clues about their fate. First, a promise by a <b>shuttle</b> <b>driver,</b> that rescue is on its way. Then, when they are visited by {{what appears to be}} help from a boat. They are informed that the vessel must take emergency supplies to a neighboring island and that they will return shortly. The anxious guests begin to believe that they will never be rescued and that they may be dead. They believe this because they continue to be teased by rescue efforts that never follow through. Finally, they hear a plane that is supposed to come to rescue them, only to realize that the plane continues to fly away.|$|E
30|$|Since {{drivers who}} drive for work purpose {{are known to}} be more prone {{to a wide range of}} risks [16], and thus such {{professional}} drivers have been reported to have above average crash frequencies compared to personal vehicle drivers as reported in the literature [17]. In Britain, 31 % of fatal crashes and 26 % of serious injury crashes involve occupational drivers [18]. A survey in Xi’an, China revealed that the average number of taxi crashes per month was 8.500 over the period of 2006 to 2011 [4]. Our previous study also showed that 47.34 % of the occupational bus, taxi, lorry, company car and <b>shuttle</b> <b>drivers</b> in Xining, China had caused crashes at some point [19]. Accordingly, it is quite necessary to identify the potential crash risk for these professional drivers.|$|R

Odessa National Medical University, Odessa, Ukraine There was stated that the spectral indices of HRV are increasing whereas frequency indices are decreased with age. The differences by the indices ТІ and PNN 50 between age groups under 35, 35 - 50 and older 50 years were significant (p< 0, 05). Amongst the main factors for drivers’ health is the absence of the chronic stress (RRR= 0, 23 CI 95 % 0, 16 - 0, 30), smoking cessation (RRR= 0, 24 CI 95 % 0, 20 - 0, 28) and healthy nutrition (RRR= 0, 16 CI 95 % 0, 12 - 0, 21). There was proposed to use the assessment of HRV as a criterion of cardiovascular risk among route taxi drivers.

40|$|Northwest of {{the town}} of Grafton, just past Graham Hollow on the Great River Road, 26 miles and about a century from {{downtown}} St. Louis, the Brussels ferry <b>shuttles</b> <b>drivers</b> and their cars across the Illinois River to and from the "rugged kingdom of Calhoun" County. Though the peninsular county is virtually surrounded by waters of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, only one state highway bridge connects it to the rest of Illinois, and anyone wishing to enter it at other points must float across. For years Calhoun County's ferries were taken as symptoms of the region's backwardness. Today they are symbols of its unspoiledness, proof that this part of Illinois has been exempted from the modernity that more and more visitors now come here to escape. To rural residents an essential service, the ferry at Grafton is advertised to visiting urbanites as a "fun" attraction, a country carnival ride. The Brussels ferry at once symbolizes the rural past and suburbanized future of Illinois' Big Rivers region. As used here, "Big Rivers" describes parts of five counties of west central Illinois near where the lower Illinois River enters the Mississippi. Centered in Jersey, Madison, Greene, Calhoun and MacoLlpin counties, the Big Rivers region covers some 1, 770 square miles. It includes parts of the basins of three large streams-the middle Mississippi, the lower Illinois, and Macoupin Creek-and takes in one of Illinois' 30 "resource rich areas" identified by state scientists and other experts as being especially endowed with biologic resources. Much of the region is broad prairie, growing on the Central Till Plain that dominates the middle U. S. The floodplains of the two big rivers constitute a second distinct ecological realm. Along the lower Illinois River a bit of the Ozarks plateau intrudes in the form of rugged rocky hills and limestone bluffs formed from lime muds deposited at the bottom of ancient seas 320 - 500 million years ago, when Illinois basked on the equator. The Dividing Ridge, the massive hump of rock that separates the converging Illinois and the Mississippi, makes up southern Pike County and most of Calhoun County. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
