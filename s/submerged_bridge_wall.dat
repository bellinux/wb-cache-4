40|$|Great Britain {{has been}} subject to an {{increasing}} rate of invasion from freshwater species of Ponto-Caspian origin. A recent horizon-scan of potential invaders into Great Britain named the Ponto Caspian quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897), as the non-native species least wanted. On 29 t h September 2014 quagga mussels were discovered in the Wraysbury River, Surrey, during a routine kick sample collected by the Environment Agency. Identity was confirmed using genetic markers (Cytochrome Oxidase I- COI) on five individuals encompassing a broad morphological variation. The absence of very large individuals (max. length 16 mm), absence of shells and absence of quagga mussels in samples collected during March 2014 point toward a recent invasion. The quagga mussels were found attached to <b>submerged</b> rocks, vegetation, <b>bridge</b> <b>walls</b> and shells of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771). The collection site is a small (< 5 m wide), shallow (< 50 cm deep) stream that is not navigable or regularly fished. This suggests that the species is more widely distributed than the current location, because such a system {{is unlikely to be}} the point of introduction. The shallow depth (30 cm) in open water at which quagga mussels were abundant is surprising given that zebra mussels have failed to establish in such habitats, despite being present in the catchment for over 100 years. Previously published models predict quagga mussels will establish widely across England, western an...|$|R

50|$|The {{submersible}} bridge's primary {{advantage over}} the similar lift bridge {{is that there is}} no structure above the shipping channel and thus no height limitation on ship traffic. This is particularly important for sailing vessels. Additionally, the lack of an above-deck structure is considered aesthetically pleasing, a similarity shared with the Chicago-style bascule bridge and the table bridge. However, the presence of the <b>submerged</b> <b>bridge</b> structure limits the draft of vessels in the waterway.|$|R

50|$|The concept behind {{low-water}} crossings is {{that they}} are convenient and safe to use in normal conditions. Once the water level rises {{to the point where it}} crosses the bridge surface the bridge is generally unsafe to use, and in developed countries this will usually be indicated by warning signs. An additional hazard is that the bridge surface may become completely obscured by the water, making it relatively easy to fall off the bridge surface into the deeper and more hazardous water on either side. As a consequence, the line of the <b>submerged</b> <b>bridge</b> is often marked with poles or other structures to indicate its course to unwary travelers and emergency users even when submerged.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} 1920-?, the de Roovere fort has fallen into major disrepair. It has only {{recently}} been restored through contributions. In addition, a bridge was built to access the fort across its moat. The designers, RO&AD Architecten, felt {{it would be inappropriate}} to build a bridge over the moat, so instead, they decided to construct a partially <b>submerged</b> <b>bridge,</b> rendering it practically invisible. The bridge has taken on the name [...] "The Moses Bridge", as it appears to have divided the moat's waters. This design (built using Accoya wood) allows people to cross virtually undetected at water level: only a few bobbing heads are usually visible. Its construction is entirely of wood waterproofed with foil.|$|R

5000|$|The Floodway {{protection}} system {{includes more than}} just the channel to the east of the city, but also the dikes along the river through Winnipeg and the [...] "Brunkild Z-dike" [...] extending to the west from the south of the city. The Brunkild Dike was built in 1997 during the [...] "Flood of the Century," [...] when the volume of water exceeded the safe capacity of the Floodway and water lapped within inches of the city's dikes. Primarily {{as a result of the}} Floodway, the city suffered little flood damage. After the 1997 flood, a 2004 re-assessment of the floodway and its channel capacity indicated that 2,550 m3/s (90,000 cfs) could be passed through the floodway during a major flood, but this is considered above the design capacity as it would <b>submerge</b> <b>bridges,</b> and the decision was made to further expand the floodway.|$|R
