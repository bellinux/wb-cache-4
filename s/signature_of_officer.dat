Both badge styles were awarded for three combat engagements on three different days.

Gallas made his appearance, but merely {{with the intention of}} finding out all Wallenstein's plans and of keeping the emperor informed of them. Piccolomini had, immediately the meeting broke up, sent full details of its proceedings to the court, and Gallas was furnished with a secret commission containing the emperor's orders to the colonels and officers, granting an amnesty for their adhesion to Wallenstein at Pilsen, and ordering them to make known to the army that it was released from its obedience to Wallenstein, and was placed under the command of Gallas himself, who received orders, if possible, to arrest Wallenstein.|$|R
2500|$|The Panzer Badge was {{introduced}} on 20 December 1939, {{in order to}} recognize the achievements of Panzer personnel {{who took part in}} armoured assaults. It was designed by the Berlin firm of Wilhelm Ernst Peekhaus, and was instituted by order of Generaloberst Walther von Brauchitsch. On 6 June 1940, a separate class of the badge, in Bronze, was added in order to recognize the crews of armoured vehicles other than tanks. The award document that came with it was the common type that had the particulars of the recipient (rank, name) and the authorizing <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> an <b>officer.</b> The Panzer Badge was worn on the left tunic pocket. [...] The bronze version of the Panzer Badge was authorized for armoured personnel and Panzer grenadier units equipped with armoured vehicles. It was also to be presented to members of armoured reconnaissance groups and rifle battalions of Panzer divisions. The authorization of these badges was usually done at a regimental or divisional level.|$|R

For this, Ana became involved as well, until she was seriously injured by Frost. In retaliation, Jarvis unsuccessfully attempted to murder Frost.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} heavily criticised by the {{political}} opposition for the suspected involvement of high-ranking bureaucrats and legal officials which were close to the Cemaat movement, an Islamist movement led by exiled cleric and (then) AKP ally Fethullah Gülen.

This included the case that the original Sledgehammer document, claimed to have been produced in 2003, was actually created using Microsoft Word 2007.

"There was {{a moment}} in which, doubtless, the {{destruction}} of private fortunes, the ruin of youth, the domestic discord occasioned by these abuses, determined the government to depart from its established maxims concerning the freedom of manners allowed the subject. All the courtesans were banished from Venice; but their absence {{was not enough to}} reclaim and bring back good morals to a whole people brought up in the most scandalous licentiousness. Depravity reached the very bosoms of private families, and even into the cloister; and they found themselves obliged to recall, and even to indemnify,[489] women who sometimes gained possession of important secrets, and who might be usefully employed in the ruin of men whose fortunes might have rendered them dangerous.

5000|$|Wierzchowiny was the {{location}} of a pacification action carried out on 6 June 1945 in which approximately 50-196 inhabitants of the village (mostly Ukrainian, but also Polish) were massacred in an aura of considerable controversy. Incriminating documents, including <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the NSZ <b>officer</b> accused <b>of</b> being responsible for the murder, Mieczysław Pazderski nom-de-guerre [...] "Szary" [...] (1908-1945), were produced by the MBP secret service actively engaged in anti-partisan raids and extrajudicial killings. Pazderski was an avid anticommunist who commanded a partisan unit which used to liquidate Soviet agents (including Poles) in the region between October 1944 and May 1945. His unit of PAS NSZ was involved in the fight with the Ukrainian OUN-UPA during the massacres of Poles in Volhynia. The action in Wierzchowiny resulted from a death sentence issued by NSZ against 17 Ukrainian and 2 Polish men suspected of retaliatory murders. Mieczysław Pazderski stationed in Wierzchowiny with the retreating Polish Army in September 1939 and witnessed the killing of several Polish soldiers ambushed by the local Ukrainian men.|$|R

The release included the two reports of Ramachandran, the amicus, that had been submitted in January and July 2011. The documents revealed that the SIT believed that Bhatt had not been present at the meeting {{and that this was}} supported both by statements from those who had been present and by analysis of Bhatt's telephone records, which suggested that he was in Ahmedabad at the time. The SIT also found that the fax message that Bhatt claimed to have sent never existed and he concocted it later and the <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> his superior <b>officers</b> were forged. Their preliminary report did note that {{there was a lack of}} credibility among the witnesses present at the meeting, some of whom had retired and were claiming either a loss of memory or had been in receipt of retirement benefits that might impact upon their neutrality. In addition, the SIT considered Bhatt to be an unreliable witness who had attempted to coach other witnesses, had not provided adequate explanation for his nine-year silence regarding the events surrounding the meeting and had been imprecise in his description of the events. They also though that he had [...] "an axe to grind" [...] against the state.|$|R
