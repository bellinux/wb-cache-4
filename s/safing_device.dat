40|$|Economic and {{political}} demands are driving computational investigation of {{systems and processes}} like never before. It is foreseen that questions of safety, optimality, risk, robustness, likelihood, credibility, etc. will increasingly be posed to computational modelers. This will require the development and routine use of computing infrastructure that incorporates computational physics models {{within the framework of}} larger meta-analyses involving aspects of optimization, nondeterministic analysis, and probabilistic risk assessment. This paper describes elements of an ongoing case study involving the computational solution of several meta-problems in optimization, nondeterministic analysis, and optimization under uncertainty pertaining to the surety of a generic weapon <b>safing</b> <b>device.</b> The goal of the analyses is to determine the worst-case heating configuration in a fire that most severely threatens the integrity of the device. A large, 3 -D, nonlinear, finite element thermal model is used to determine the transient thermal response of the device in this coupled conduction/radiation problem. Implications of some of the numerical aspects of the thermal model on the selection of suitable and efficient optimization and nondeterministic analysis algorithms are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Safety and Health Information Bulletin is: 1. To {{describe}} the hazard of sharp-tip suture needles {{as a source of}} percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel; 2. To present evidence of the effectiveness of blunt-tip suture needles in decreasing percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel, particularly when used to suture muscle and fascia; and 3. To emphasize OSHA's requirement to use <b>safer</b> medical <b>devices</b> - in this case, blunt-tip suture needles - where clinically appropriate. Conclusion: OSHA and NIOSH strongly encourage the use of blunt-tip suture needles, whenever feasible and appropriate, to decrease percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel. Clinical use and scientific studies have established the effectiveness of blunt tip suture needles in decreasing the risk of percutaneous injuries. Employers in workplaces that use suture needles have the responsibility under the Bloodborne Pathogens standard to evaluate the use of blunt-tip suture needles as well as other appropriate <b>safer</b> medical <b>devices.</b> After this evaluation, which must include input from nonmanagerial employees responsible for direct patient care [29 CFR 1910. 1030 (c) (1) (v) ] - e. g., in this case surgical personnel - employers must use <b>safer</b> <b>devices</b> to replace corresponding conventional sharp-tip suture needles in their workplaces when clinically appropriate. The introduction of any device must include training of staff in its proper use and follow-up to ensure a successful transition from conventional to <b>safer</b> <b>devices.</b> Where an employer has determined that the use of available <b>safer</b> <b>devices</b> is not feasible, the clinical justification for this determination must be documented in the facility's Exposure Control Plan and the employer must implement alternative means of protecting surgical personnel from percutaneous injuries.

40|$|Ever since arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{was discovered in}} Bangladesh in the 1990 ’s, several international organizations and NGOs have been constructing <b>safe</b> water <b>devices</b> for mitigating the associated problems. However, many such <b>safe</b> water <b>devices</b> were abandoned {{due to lack of}} maintenance. This article analyzes how and why the use of these devices had stopped, through the use of interviews made with officials of the device operating committees. It was found that, in one example, an active <b>safe</b> water <b>device</b> had a well-organized operating committee, headed by a leading member of the community who was held in high regard. In contrast, an inactive <b>safe</b> water <b>device</b> in a neighboring village was found to have an unstable organizing committee; in this case an unmotivated community leader who had his own access to safe drinking water. The maintenance of <b>safe</b> water <b>devices</b> therefore greatly depends on leadership in the community. A future concern should see the implementation of methods of sustainable device maintenance that is free from the issues of community unity and/or leadership. 国民の９割が地下水を飲用に利用しているバングラデシュでは 1990 年代に地下水砒素汚染が明らかになり問題になっている｡以降､国内外の機関によって対策活動として､安全な水を供給するための装置(代替水源装置) が建設されてきた｡しかし､建設された多くの代替水源装置において維持管理が適切に行われず結果的に放棄される例などが報告されている｡本研究は､代替水源装置の運営(維持管理) がどうして､どのように立ち行かなくなっていくのかということについて､装置の管理組合の役員にインタビューを行い､明らかにするものである｡順調に稼動している代替水源装置においては､尊敬されている人物が組合のリーダーを務めておりその人物を中心として利用世帯がまとまっていたり､日常的に装置のメンテナンスを行う人物の存在が見られた｡一方､維持管理が放棄されている代替水源装置においては､組合のリーダーや､コミュニティ全体に関連する問題が見られた｡今後､放棄される代替水源装置の数を減らし､代替水源装置によって安定的に安全な水を供給するためには､いいリーダーがいない､又はまとまって何かを解決することが難しいという地域社会において､どうすれば代替水源装置は安定的に稼動させることができるのかという点が重要な課題となるであろう...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. One hundred forty-three {{large bore}} right-atrial {{catheters}} (RACs) in 111 {{bone marrow transplant}} recipients were prospectively analyzed for the incidence of complications interfering with catheter function. Of the 143 RACs, 108 (76 %) were patent on departure from Seattle or death. Infectious complications occurred in 63 (44 %) of the catheters, resulting in 18 (13 %) removals. Noninfectious complications occurred with 54 (38 %) of the catheters, resulting in 17 (12 %) removals. Successful interventions included catheter repair, dissolving precipitates with ammonium chloride solution, and declotting catheter lumens with heparin and/or urokinase. We conclude that RACs continue to be reliable and <b>safe</b> <b>devices</b> to use in marrow transplant patients. Complications interfering with catheter function are frequent; however, most can be resolved without the need to remove the catheter. (Journal of Parentera...|$|R
