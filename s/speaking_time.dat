After that experiment, Frattini indicated {{he would like to}} include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they could gain as part of the Treaty of Lisbon. Between 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> for rapporteurs, increase committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.|$|E
5|$|The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides {{who speaks}} in chamber debates {{and the amount}} of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between {{different}} viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.|$|E

25|$|On December 16, 2010, Werner Kogler of the Austrian Green Party {{gave his}} speech before the budget committee, criticizing the failings {{of the budget}} and the {{governing}} parties (Social Democratic Party and Austrian People's Party) in the last years. The filibuster lasted for 12 hours and 42 minutes (starting at 13:18, and speaking until 2:00 in the morning), thus breaking the previous record held by his party-colleague Madeleine Petrovic (10 hours and 35 minutes on March 11, 1993), after which the standing orders had been changed, so <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> was limited to 20 minutes. However, it didn't keep Kogler from giving his speech.|$|E
25|$|With two right-wing parties {{competing}} for power, {{it became apparent}} that unseating the governing Liberals would be next to impossible. In the 1997 election, both the PCs and the Reform Party respectively polled roughly 19% each in popular support. Reform emerged with 60 Western seats and Official Opposition status, while the demoralized PCs emerged from the brink of oblivion with 20 Eastern seats and regained party status (a minimum of 12 seats is required for official party status in the Canadian House of Commons, allowing the party to have seats on parliamentary committees, guaranteed <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> in the Commons, additional office space in the east and west blocks of Parliament, and multimillion-dollar federal funding for party research and staffing). More importantly, the Liberals emerged with only a five-seat majority in the election, and many pundits suggested that the combined PC and Reform votes would have been enough to unseat the Liberals or at least reduce them to minority status.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 Governor Michael Dukakis (Massachusetts) chose Bentsen to be {{his running}} mate in that year's presidential election, beating out Ohio Senator John Glenn, who was {{considered}} the early favorite. Bentsen was selected {{in large part to}} try to lure away the state of Texas and its electoral vote for the Democrats, even with fellow Texan George H. W. Bush {{at the top of the}} Republican ticket. Because of Bentsen's status as something of an elder statesman who was more experienced in electoral politics, many believed Dukakis's selection of Bentsen as his running mate was a mistake in that Bentsen, number two on the ticket, appeared more presidential than did Dukakis. During the vice presidential debate (see below), Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle spent most of his <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> criticizing Dukakis as too liberal while avoiding a match up with the seasoned Bentsen. One elector in West Virginia even cast a ballot for him rather than Dukakis, giving Bentsen one electoral vote for president.|$|E

Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use my presence and <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities, I tell them what the people expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E

2500|$|A {{debate between}} François Fillon, Benoît Hamon, Marine Le Pen, Emmanuel Macron, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon {{took place on}} 20 March, hosted by TF1 and moderated by journalists Anne-Claire Coudray and Gilles Bouleau. It {{is the first time}} that a debate prior to the first round was held. The choice of date means that TF1 will not be {{required}} to provide candidates with equal <b>speaking</b> <b>time,</b> as Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) regulations do not go into force until 9 April, the start of the official campaign. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who was not invited, denounced the debate as a [...] "rape of democracy", and the CSA urged TF1 to guarantee fair <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> for other candidates. Dupont-Aignan filed an appeal that was rejected in part because he had already received airtime proportionate to his support. On 18 March, appearing on TF1, he quit mid-interview, furious at his exclusion from the network's debate. The first debate began with an introductory question – [...] "What kind of president do you want to be?" [...] – followed by segments on three themes lasting about 50 minutes each: what type of society France should have, what type of economic model France should adopt, and the place of France in the world. The five candidates were given two minutes to answer each question, but opponents had the opportunity to interject 90 seconds in. The debate was three and a half hours long, and was watched by 9.8 million (47% of the audience share) on TF1, peaking at 11.5 million.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{grouping}} {{of five or}} more deputies can be officially recognised as a parliamentary group, with each deputies permitted {{to be members of}} only a single group at any one time. Although groups are mostly based on electoral lists from the previous election to the Assembly, groups are often a diverse collection of different parties as well as independents. This is due to Serbia's complex multi-party system, with many parties having a presence in the legislature; parties with similar ideology, but low representation, are therefore inclined to cooperate and form joint parliamentary groups together in order to secure more privileges they would otherwise not be entitled to, such as additional <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> and committee assignments. An example of such a group includes the LDP-LSV-SDA group.|$|E

2500|$|The Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) {{ensured that}} all {{candidates}} receive equal time in broadcast media [...] "under comparable programming conditions" [...] from 19 March onward. The CSA warned on 8 March {{that the amount}} of <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> broadcasters had given Fillon and his supporters was [...] "unusually high", even given the unusual circumstances surrounding his candidacy. After the official start of the campaign on 10 April, the CSA strictly enforced equal time in broadcast media.

The Constitutional Council verified the results of the first round on 24–26 April and officially certified the vote tallies on 26 April, and the same procedure will be used for the second round.

2500|$|While when a {{contract}} is silent a court must essentially {{make an informed}} choice about whether a right to terminate should exist, if {{a contract}} deals with the matter the courts' general approach is to follow the parties' wishes. The drafters of the old Sale of Goods Act 1893 distinguished between [...] "conditions" [...] (major terms, which when breached confer a right to terminate) and [...] "warranties" [...] (minor terms, which do not), and under the present Sale of Goods Act 1979 some terms, such as descriptions about quality, are conditions by default. A third kind is an [...] "innominate term", which is typically a vague term like citrus pulp pellets being [...] "in good condition", or a ship having to be [...] "seaworthy". Because such a term could be breached in both a major way (e.g. the ship sinks) or a trivial way (e.g. a lifejacket is missing) the court will determine whether the right to terminate arises based on how serious in fact {{the consequences of the}} breach were. So in The Hong Kong Fir, Lord Diplock held that a ship crew being too incompetent to properly operate the vessel did not breach the contract's [...] "seaworthiness" [...] term in a serious enough way as to allow for termination, because the charterers still got a working boat and could have replaced the crew. If a contract specifies that a particular obligation is a [...] "condition" [...] the dominant approach of the courts is to treat it as such. Nevertheless, concerned with the ability of a stronger party to specify the terms it finds most convenient as [...] "conditions" [...] {{at the expense of the}} weaker, courts retain the ability to construe an agreement contra proferentum. In L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd the majority of the House of Lords held that clause 7 of a contract, stating it was [...] "a condition of this agreement" [...] that Mr Wickman would visit 6 major car companies [...] "at least once in every week" [...] to try selling panel presses, was not really a condition in the technical sense. So when Mr Wickman was found to have visited much less, Schuler AG could not dismiss him. This was because clause 11 said that 60 days of warning was needed before Schuler AG could terminate, so the whole contract read together meant the clause 7 had to be subject to clause 11. The language in the contract is not decisive. If the word [...] "condition" [...] is not used, but the contract describes a right to terminate, such as the contract being terminable for [...] "any breach" [...] of obligation, the issue is, again, one of construction and the courts may be reluctant to give effect to the plain meaning if it would have [...] "draconian consequences" [...] for the weaker party. By contrast, in Bunge Corporation v Tradax SA the House of Lords held that giving notice for a ship to start loading the soya bean cargo four days late, when the contract expressly stipulated the date, should allow the right to terminate regardless of the actual consequences of the breach. In mercantile contracts, 'broadly <b>speaking</b> <b>time</b> will be considered of the essence', and so it is highly likely the courts will enforce obligations to the letter.|$|E
