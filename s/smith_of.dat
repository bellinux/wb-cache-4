5|$|Billy <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> the New York Islanders {{became the}} first goaltender to score an NHL goal on November 28, 1979, when he was given credit {{following}} an own goal. Ron Hextall of the Philadelphia Flyers became the second goalkeeper to score, {{and the first to}} score by taking a shot. Martin Brodeur has scored the most NHL goals by a goaltender, with two in the regular season and one in the playoffs. The most recent goal credited to a goaltender was awarded to Mike <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> the Phoenix Coyotes on October 19, 2013, scored via a shot on goal.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children. He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building {{up a series of}} short stories (later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters). Other stories included Mr. Bliss and Roverandom (for children), and Leaf by Niggle (part of Tree and Leaf), The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, On Fairy-Stories, <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> Wootton Major and Farmer Giles of Ham. Roverandom and <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> Wootton Major, like The Hobbit, borrowed ideas from his legendarium.|$|E

5|$|As of the 1981–82 NHL season, the Vezina Trophy {{has been}} given to the most {{outstanding}} goaltender as voted by the general managers of the NHL teams. Billy <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> the New York Islanders was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system. The William M. Jennings Trophy, given to the goaltender(s) who play(s) more than 25 games for the team that allows the fewest goals, serves the function of the old Vezina.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom {{was created}} by Peter James and Andrew O'Connor, and was {{conceived}} as a parody of both reality television and the traditional sitcom. It combined these two elements by featuring {{three members of the}} public being unknowingly placed in extraordinary situations by three actors being directed by writers. After being commissioned for Channel 4 by Danielle Lux, Bedsitcom was produced by Matt Crook and Kirsty <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> Objective Productions.|$|E

5000|$|Membership {{was around}} 3,000 for many years, but grew rapidly under the {{leadership}} of John Thomson in the 1910s. He focused on mergers with smaller unions, bringing in the Combined <b>Smiths</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain and Ireland, the Co-operative Society <b>of</b> <b>Smiths,</b> the National United Society <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> and Hammermen, and the United <b>Smiths</b> Trade Union <b>of</b> Ireland. [...] This brought membership up to 13,500 by 1915, and made it the largest union of blacksmiths in the country, ahead of the Amalgamated Society <b>of</b> <b>Smiths</b> and Strikers.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1st Marine Division {{landed at}} Wonsan {{as part of}} Almond's US X Corps, Almond and Major General Oliver P. <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before the landing at Inchon, when Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious {{landings}} are {{even though he had}} never been involved in one. Smith believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact that higher headquarters in Tokyo said otherwise, but Almond felt Smith was overly cautious. The mutual distrust between the commanders caused Smith to slow the 1st Marine Division's advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond's instructions. Smith established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.|$|E

40|$|This paper first {{considers}} the character <b>of</b> <b>Smith's</b> account <b>of</b> {{division of labour}} as a theory of technical progress. In so far as Smith's account does entail a vision of liberal or competitive commercial society as exhibiting ongoing technical progress, this must have implications for income distribution through time. The paper therefore also considers, in particular, <b>Smith's</b> conception <b>of</b> the course of real wages in competitive commercial society, and how this connects with his view of technical progress. A reconciliation <b>of</b> <b>Smith's</b> theory <b>of</b> real wages and his prediction of high and rising real wages over time is suggested.

5|$|Billy <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> the New York Islanders, in the 1979–80 season, was {{the first}} goaltender to be {{credited}} with a goal in the NHL when Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put the puck into his own empty net. Smith was the last Islander to have touched the puck, and by NHL rule 78.4, an unassisted goal is awarded to the last player on the scoring team who had contacted the puck, {{in the event of}} an own goal.|$|E
5|$|Black {{churches in}} Maryland hosted many musical, {{as well as}} {{political}} and educational, activities, and many African American musicians got their start performing in churches, including Anne Brown, Marian Anderson, Ethel Ennis and Cab Calloway, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy.|$|E
5|$|Fighters Uncaged was {{announced}} by Ubisoft at Gamescom 2010, {{three months before}} its official release. There, people were allowed to preview the game. The game was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. Because the announcement came suddenly {{and close to the}} release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing the concept and its character designs and noted a misspelling in the preview. The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E

5|$|Former Boise State University student Eric Matthias participated {{on behalf}} of the British Virgin Islands at the discus throw event. He was one of two British Virgin Islanders {{participating}} in a track and field event and in the 2008 Olympics as a whole. Matthias' appearance in Beijing marked his first appearance at any Olympic game. Once at the Olympics, Matthias was placed in the second qualifying heat on 16 August. He threw the discus 53.11meters, ranking last out of 18 athletes. The 17th place finalist in the second qualifying heat, Iraq's Haidar Nasser Shaheed, threw 1.08meters further, with heat leader Rutger <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> the Netherlands throwing the discus 12.54meters further than Matthias. Overall, out of 37 athletes, Matthias placed last, and did not progress to the final round on 19 August.|$|E
5|$|However, {{following}} Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962spectators.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009 the SNP {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat. After the 2011 elections gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, a referendum on independence for Scotland was held on 18 September 2014. The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%. During the campaign, the three main parties in the UK Parliament pledged to extend {{the powers of the}} Scottish Parliament. An all-party commission chaired by Lord <b>Smith</b> <b>of</b> Kelvin was formed, which led to a further devolution of powers through the Scotland Act 2016.|$|E
