40|$|International audienceDue to the {{impulsion}} {{of aircraft}} manufacturers, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers have become thicker. But {{the manufacturing process}} still implies the development of important residual stresses, either due to moisture effects or thermal effects [I]. If the symmetry of the composite part is broken, the global part shape {{will be affected by}} any moisture/temperature variation. In this communication, a simple L thick composite shell is studied under moderate temperature changes. An error in the stacking sequence is voluntarily added to the sequence in order to simulate possible manufacturing error. Displacements are recorded on the <b>shell</b> <b>front</b> and on its side using a mixed in-plane and out-of-plane DSPI set-up [8] The zone of interest is limited here to {{the central part of the}} L shape i. e. where the curvature is significant. Variations of the L-shape with temperature are recorded; typical flexure strain effects are outlined. Interesting global or local parameters can be deduced from this experiment: through thickness coefficient of thermal expansion, ply thickness and consequently local fiber volume fraction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

Results are presented on 4 Mira stars monitored for 2 - 8 years with the VLBA. The data show that in some stars the VLBI detection is dominated by blue-shifted emission that is associated with the stellar image amplified by the maser <b>shell</b> in <b>front</b> of the star. In other cases the maser is not directly tied to the stellar position, but still persistent enough to measure proper motion and parallax. 1...|$|R
50|$|The minute {{shell is}} white, with a {{yellowish}} periostracum. It contains about four whorls {{with a very}} minute subglobular hardly projecting glossy nucleus. The summit of the spire with the whorl is but little raised, flattish but not excavated between the suture and the bluntly rounded shoulder. The <b>shell</b> in <b>front</b> of the shoulder is subcylindrical, with fine axial incremental lines. The aperture is narrow. The outer lip is thin, nearly straight, rounding in front into the rather wide, slightly excavated columella which near the body carries a single strong plait. The body shows a thin coat of enamel, the umbilical region slightly impressed but imperforate.|$|R

5000|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus was 6 - 10.3 mm long {{including}} its long spines, {{and had a}} fairly slim, roughly oval body that tapered towards the rear, was distinctly [...] on top but {{was surrounded by a}} flatter rim. The underside was soft and unarmored, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small <b>shell,</b> near the <b>front</b> end; three zones of armor plates called [...] "sclerites", which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of the}} body. The sclerites and spines were unmineralized, and had internal cavities that appear to have been circular in cross-section. The shell was convex and shaped like a triangle with rounded corners. It had a bulge at the front, a raised rear edge and a ridge along the middle that flared out towards the rear. It also had finely spaced rings that indicate growth by addition of material round the edges, and coarser ridges which may indicate that the animal was metameric, in other words built out of repeated [...] "modules".

The Germans sprung a surprise on the Canadians by exploding four large mines under trenches of the 2nd Canadian Division covering the spur at the eastern outskirts of the ruins of Hooge and a company of the Canadian 28th (North West) Battalion was wiped out in the explosions. The Canadians managed to hold their position and prevent the Germans from reaching their support line but Byng ultimately {{decided to leave the}} Hooge trenches in German hands and to concentrate on regaining Mount Sorrel and Tor Top.
