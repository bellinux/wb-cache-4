5|$|Vlad Ţepeş's only ally, Mihály Szilágyi, was {{captured}} in 1460 by the Turks while traversing Bulgaria. Szilágyi's men were tortured to death, while Szilágyi was killed by being <b>sawed</b> in half. Later that year, Mehmed sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay the delayed Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Vlad Ţepeş provoked Mehmed by having the envoys killed and in a letter dated September 10, 1460, addressed to the Transylvanian Saxons of Kronstadt (today: Braşov), he warned them of Mehmed's invasion plans and asked for their support. Vlad Ţepeş had not paid the annual Jizya (tax on non-Muslims) of 10,000 ducats since 1459. In addition to this, Mehmed asked him for 1000 boys that were to be trained as janissaries. Vlad Ţepeş refused the demand, and the Turks crossed the Danube and started {{to do their own}} recruiting, to which Vlad reacted by capturing the Turks and impaling them. The conflict continued until 1461, when Mehmed asked the Prince to come to Constantinople and negotiate with him.|$|E

40|$|The {{shortage}} in wood supply {{makes the}} effort to find alternative for wood material {{become more and more}} important. It was reported that the outer parts of oil palm stems could be used as solid wood after being properly treated. Being a monocotyledon, oil palm stems have a contradictory characteristic to the conventional hardwoods and softwoods and thus the <b>sawing</b> patterns suitable for hardwoods and softwoods should not be suitable for the oil palm stems. Two modified <b>sawing</b> patterns (polygon <b>sawing</b> and cobweb <b>sawing)</b> plus one ordinary <b>sawing</b> pattern (life <b>sawing)</b> were compared in the <b>sawing</b> of oil palm stems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the most suitable <b>sawing</b> pattern for oil palm stems. The cobweb <b>sawing</b> provided the highest outer lumber recovery (35 %) followed by polygon <b>sawing</b> (27 %) and life <b>sawing</b> (23 %). The polygon <b>sawing</b> provided the highest occurrence of wide lumbers, followed by the cobweb <b>sawing</b> and life <b>sawing.</b> The cobweb <b>sawing</b> need more than twice effective <b>sawing</b> time (15. 4 min) than the life <b>sawing</b> and polygon <b>sawing.</b> In overall, the polygon <b>sawing</b> was the most suitable pattern for the <b>sawing</b> of oil palm stem...|$|R

50|$|The name carbide <b>saw</b> {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} <b>saw</b> blade, with silver soldered carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS <b>saws</b> were developed, abrasive, friction or hot <b>saws</b> were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot <b>saws.</b> However, HSS blades use coolant and the cut surfaces don’t get hot, thus called cold <b>saws.</b> With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular <b>saws,</b> the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide <b>saws</b> were also called cold <b>saws.</b> Other names include cold cut <b>saws,</b> cold circular <b>saws,</b> cold cut off <b>saws</b> or circular cold <b>saws.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{price of}} pulp doubled during the First World War, {{but so did}} many of the costs, {{including}} a 250 percent increase in wages. By 1917 export of <b>sawed</b> wood was responsible for forty percent of its revenue. The company experienced high profits during the war, peaking at NOK5.6 million in 1918. However, the investments and increasing prices caused two issues of new shares, both of NOK6 million in 1916 and 1918, raising the share equity to NOK18 million. Demand and prices skyrocketed from 1919, but Saugbrugsforeningen, like many of its competitors, failed to capitalized due to the corresponding rise in lumber prices.|$|E
