5|$|Unlike many {{of their}} Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, {{possibly}} due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity {{of a large number}} of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of <b>spoon</b> <b>and</b> fork, not knife and fork.|$|E
5|$|Richards' {{addiction}} to heroin delayed {{his arrival in}} Toronto; the other members had already arrived, waiting for him, and sent him a telegram asking him where he was. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canada Customs after Richards was found {{in possession of a}} burnt <b>spoon</b> <b>and</b> hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Pallenberg, discovered 22 grams of heroin in Richards' room. Richards was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence.|$|E

5|$|The monarchy was {{restored}} after Cromwell's death, {{and for the}} coronation of King CharlesII, who {{had been living in}} exile abroad, new Jewels were made based on records of the lost items. They were supplied by the banker and Royal Goldsmith, SirRobert Vyner, at a cost of £12,184– as much as three warships. A medieval anointing <b>spoon</b> <b>and</b> three swords had survived and were returned to the Crown, as were some historically important gemstones. Between 1660 and 1663, at the additional cost of some £18,000, almost two tons (4,400lb) of altar and banqueting plate were made for the king.|$|E
5|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, the only surviving {{items of the}} coronation regalia were a 12th-century <b>spoon</b> <b>and</b> three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.) Detailed records of old regalia survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings {{from the time of}} Charles I. For the coronation of Charles II, gems were rented because the treasury could not afford to replace them.|$|E
5|$|As {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} National Mall in the mid 1980s, its {{permanent}} collection consisted of more than 6,000 art objects (e.g., sculpture, artifacts, textiles) and the large Elisofon photography collection. This original collection focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, with better representation of the Guinea coast and Western Sudan than the Central African region. The collection is idiosyncratic, reflecting the relative lack of colonial era African art acquisitions in American donor collections. Some early highlights of the museum's collection include an Edo–Portuguese ivory <b>spoon</b> <b>and</b> an Akan gold pendant bequeathed by the Robert Woods Bliss estate. The museum's first acquisitions budget came with joining the Smithsonian.|$|E
