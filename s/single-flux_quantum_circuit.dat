40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the Rapid <b>Single-Flux</b> <b>Quantum</b> (RSFQ) <b>circuits</b> with reduced Josephson current density and especially deal {{with one of the}} basic building blocks of these electronics- the DC to SFQ converter. For future promising RSFQ applications the critical current of the Josephson junctions should be reduced (by reduction of Josephson current density) to several µA, resulting into values of the interferometer’s inductance of several hundreds of pH. Such large inductances cannot be efficiently realized and we utilize an approach for substitution of inductances by arrays of classical Josephson junctions operating in nonswitching mode. We investigate the classical DC to SFQ converter and based on the utilized approach we design a new schematic with reduced Josephson current density. The circuit is optimized with respect to yield and fabrication margins of the design parameters.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} and test of an integrated system composed of a flux qubit and a rapid <b>single-flux</b> <b>quantum</b> (RSFQ) <b>circuit</b> that allows qubit manipulation. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of control electronics integrated on the same chip as the qubit, {{in view of the}} application in quantum computation with superconducting devices. RSFQ logic relies on the storage and transmission of magnetic flux quanta and can be profitably used with superconducting qubits because of the speed, scalability, compatibility with the qubit fabrication process and low temperature environment. While standard RSFQ circuitry is well assessed, the application to quantum computing requires a complete rescaling of parameter values, in order to preserve the qubit coherence and reduce the power dissipation. In the system presented in this paper, the qubit role is played by a superconducting loop interrupted by a small dc SQUID, usually called a double SQUID, which behaves as a tunable rf-SQUID. Its energy potential has the shape of a double well, with the barrier between the wells controlled by magnetic flux applied to the inner dc SQUID.

40|$|A Defect-Based Test (DBT) {{methodology}} for Superconductor Electronics (SCE) {{is presented in}} this thesis, so that commercial production and efficient testing of systems can be implemented in this technology in the future. In the first chapter, the features and prospects for SCE have been presented. The motivation for this research and {{the outline of the}} thesis were also described in Chapter 1. It has been shown that high-end applications such as Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and petaflop computers which are extremely difficult to implement in top-of-the-art semiconductor technologies can be realised using SCE. But, a systematic structural test methodology had yet to be developed for SCE and has been addressed in this thesis. A detailed introduction to Rapid <b>Single-Flux</b> <b>Quantum</b> (RSFQ) <b>circuits</b> was presented in Chapter 2. A Josephson Junction (JJ) was described with associated theory behind its operation. The JJ model used in the simulator used in this research work was also presented. RSFQ logic with logic protocols as well as the design and implementation of an example D-type flip-flop (DFF) was also introduced. Finally, advantages and disadvantages of RSFQ circuits have been discussed with focus on the latest developments in the field. Various techniques for testing RSFQ circuits were discussed in Chapter 3. A Process Defect Monitor (PDM) approach was presented for fabrication process analysis. The presented defect-monitor structures were used to gather measurement data, to find the probability of the occurrence of defects in the process which forms the first step for Inductive Fault Analysis (IFA). Results from measurements on these structures were used to create a database for defects. This information can be used as input for performing IFA. "Defect-sprinkling" over a fault-free circuit can be carried out according to the measured defect densities over various layers. After layout extraction and extensive fault simulation, the resulting information will indicate realistic faults. In addition, possible Design-for-Testability (DfT) schemes for monitoring <b>Single-Flux</b> <b>Quantum</b> (SFQ) pulses within an RSFQ circuit has also been discussed in Chapter 3. The requirement for a DfT scheme is inevitable for RSFQ circuits because of their very high frequency of operation and very low operating temperature. It was demonstrated how SFQ pulses can be monitored at an internal node of an SCE circuit, introducing observability using Test-Point Insertion (TPI). Various techniques were discussed for the introduction of DfT and to avoid the delay introduced by the DfT structure if it is required. The available features in the proposed design for customising the detector make it attractive for a detailed DBT of RSFQ circuits. The control of internal nodes has also been illustrated using TPI. The test structures that were designed and implemented to determine the occurrence of defects in the processes {{can also be used to}} locate the position for the insertion of the above mentioned DfT structures...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, quantum {{computing}} has promised {{a revolution in}} computing performance, based on massive parallelism enabled by many entangled qubits. Josephson junction integrated circuits have emerged as the key technology to implement such a universal digital quantum computer. Indeed, prior experiments have demonstrated simple Josephson qubit configurations with quantized energy levels and long coherence times, which are a necessary prerequisite for a practical quantum computer. However, these quantized states do not directly prove the presence of entanglement or macroscopic superposition, which are essential for the superior speed of such a digital quantum computer. On the contrary, an alternative realistic foundation for quantum mechanics has recently been proposed, with coherent transitions between quantized states, but without entanglement. A new experiment is proposed that may test whether superconducting <b>quantum</b> <b>circuits</b> can exhibit quantized states without macroscopic entanglement or superposition. Specifically, a flux qubit (a bi-stable SQUID) may be configured with a resonant input line for excitation and a <b>single-flux</b> <b>quantum</b> output line for simultaneous direct measurement of quantized energy and flux states, which are incompatible measurements in standard quantum theory. Such an observation could undermine the assumptions of superposition and entanglement, bringing into question the foundation and the ultimate performance of a universal digital quantum computer.
