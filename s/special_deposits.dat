40|$|This paper explores {{recurring}} patterns among special animal {{deposits in}} rural {{settlements in the}} Dutch river area from the Roman period and draws a comparison with finds of other material categories. Recognising patterns is a step towards interpreting <b>special</b> <b>deposits</b> as the material remains of ritual actions since ritual usually follows strict rules. Any interpretation of <b>special</b> <b>deposits,</b> such as animal burials, {{should be based on}} sound argumentation. Archaeologists may be faced with, and have to distinguish between, deliberate or casual rubbish disposal, intentional deposition without attending rituals and deposition surrounded by ritual actions. Detailed descriptions of good examples of both rubbish dumps and structured deposits will be of great value in this process. This paper also argues for a more holistic approach where various find categories are studied together. This will lead to the identification of similarities between deposits. As an example, remarkable bone and non-bone finds from wells are described. Some of these finds should be seen as foundation or abandonment deposits, suggesting that like farmhouses, wells had a life cycle punctuated by ritual moments. <b>Special</b> <b>deposits</b> of animal remains and other find categories deserve much more attention than they now receive in excavation reports...|$|E

40|$|The {{excavations}} of the Cambridge Keros Project at early {{bronze age}} Dhaskalio and Dhaskalio Kavos on the Cycladic Island of Keros during the 2006 and 2007 seasons are described. They were directed by Colin Renfrew with Olga Philaniotou as Associate Director and Neil Brodie and Giorgos Gavalas as Assistant Directors. The site of Dhaskalio Kavos is well-known for the extensive looting {{which took place}} there during the 1950 's. Rescue excavations by Christos Doumas in 1963 and by Photeini Zapheiropoulou in 1967, and a project in 1987, directed by Renfrew, Doumas and Lila Marangou, defined {{the extent of the}} looted 'special deposit', assigned to the early bronze age Keros-Syros culture (Early Bronze II). At the beginning of the 2006 field season a separate and unlooted <b>special</b> <b>deposit</b> was located {{at the southern end of}} the Kavos site (the 'Special Deposit South'). Its excavation yielded thousands of fragments of marble vessels and potsherds, and hundreds of broken marble figurines. These had been deliberately broken elsewhere, brought to the site and deposited there in what appears to be a ritual context. Work on the <b>Special</b> <b>Deposit</b> South continued in 2007, and excavations on the extensive Early Cycladic settlement on the small (200 metre) but precipitous island of Dhaskalio were initiated. Well preserved building remains were uncovered with abundant Early Cycladic domestic materials. Dhaskalio island may now be recognised as a major settlement of the Keros-Syros culture (c. 2800 to 2300 BC). Kavos, immediately opposite on Keros itself, is confirmed as the locus for two separate areas of structured deposition of high status materials, brought from a wide range of sources in the Cyclades and possibly beyond, apparently already in fragmentary condition, and placed there in a series of prestations for which a ritual context may safely be inferred. Dhaskalio Kavos may now be claimed as the first major symbolic centre of the early Aegean...|$|R

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate {{concerning}} the nature of warfare and violence in the Iron Age of Britain. Interpretations regarding material remains from this period fluctuate between classifying instruments of violence (i. e. swords, spears, hillforts) as functional tools of war and as ritual symbolic devices. Human skeletal remains provide the most unequivocal evidence for violent encounters, but were often missing from these debates in the past. This thesis addresses this lack of treatment by analyzing the patterns of traumatic injuries at sites from two distinct regions in Iron Age Britain (East Yorkshire and Hampshire). The human remains from these sites show clear markers of interpersonal violence. When the remains are placed in context with the mortuary treatment, {{it is evident that}} violence and ritual were inextricably linked. In East Yorkshire, combat may have been ritualized through duelling and competition performance. In Hampshire, individuals with perimortem injures are often found in <b>special</b> <b>deposits</b> such as pits, ditches and domestic areas, suggesting their use in ritual processes that distinguish them from the general population. This provides a basis for understanding warfare and violence during the Iron Age of Britain and how communities negotiated the social tensions caused by violent interactions.

An account is given of the survey, recording many walls of the early Bronze Age, and of the excavations, continued from the 2007 season.
