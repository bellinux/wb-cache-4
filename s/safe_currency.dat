50|$|In {{situations}} of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency {{for the local}} currency. The U.S. dollar {{is viewed as a}} relatively stable and <b>safe</b> <b>currency</b> and is often used abroad as a second currency. In 2012, $340 billion, roughly 37 percent of all U.S. currency, was believed to be circulating abroad. The most recent study of the amount of currency held overseas suggests that only 25 percent of U.S. currency is presently held abroad. The widespread substitution of U.S. currency for local currency is known as de facto dollarisation, and has been observed in transition countries such as Cambodia and in some Latin American countries. Some countries, such as Ecuador, abandoned their local currency and now use US dollars, essentially for this reason, a process known as de jure dollarization. See also the example of the Ghanaian cedi from the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|The free banking {{reforms were}} seen {{as a part of}} a greater {{struggle}} for liberty and hence much was expected from them. Free banking replaced special interest legislation with a systematic [...] "rule of law," [...] in a form of highly idiosyncratic, flexible, personalized charter conditions. It was expected that the elimination of the privilege associated with the Safety Fund System 1929 would decrease legislative corruption and log rolling, the number of banks would increase and they would be more rationally located, and the end effect of more available credit would encourage commercial and manufacturing businesses.A bulk of evidence suggests that the free banking laws indeed helped the growth of the number of banks. In 1800, there were only 25 banks in the United States and this number grew to 1,364 in 1860. The bank expansion varied significantly across the states; for example New York and Pennsylvania had 4 and 2 banks in 1800, and this number grew to 299 and 80 in 1860 respectively. Although the economic development in some areas might have had some influence on the discrepancies, the difference was most likely caused by different chartered policies in each state that controlled the reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc. Many banks, however, failed to survive the period and provide a stable source of banking services, and a <b>safe</b> <b>currency.</b> In Minnesota, for example, between 1852 and 1854, 57 banks or eighty percent of the state's financial institutions, ceased operation.|$|E

We then use non-temporal threshold analysis to investigate whether intra-safe haven currency behavior changes, e. g. accelerates or decelerates, as market uncertainty increases. We find that the JPY is the “safest ” of <b>safe</b> haven <b>currencies</b> and that only the JPY appreciates as market uncertainty increases regardless of the prevailing level of uncertainty. For all other currencies under study we find significant market uncertainty threshold effects.

30|$|A {{currency}} {{that has}} a general tendency to appreciate during episodes of intense crisis and offer hedging value against global risk is a currency that {{we would expect to}} earn a safety premium, defined as the compensation that investors require to short a <b>safe</b> <b>currency</b> and invest in a basket of foreign currencies. And as the willingness to short a <b>safe</b> <b>currency</b> decreases during risky episodes, we would expect this safety premium to be time-varying and to reach its highest values during periods of crises. One objective {{of this paper is to}} examine whether the Swiss franc earns a safety premium and to give an idea about its approximate size. Studying the potential safety premium of the Swiss franc might help to understand the dynamics of the Swiss franc exchange rate. Given Switzerland’s strong trade linkages with the rest of the world, variations in the Swiss franc exchange rate are not only an important factor in determining the profitability of Switzerland’s major export-oriented sector, but are also an important factor in determining domestic inflation. Hence, its dynamics will have major implications for monetary policy makers. Furthermore, the safety premium is a priced factor that can be reflected in many internationally traded assets.|$|E

40|$|There {{is already}} a {{substantial}} literature documenting the fact that low yield currencies typically appreciate during times of global financial stress and behave as safe havens. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to find out what the fundamentals of <b>safe</b> haven <b>currencies</b> are. We analyse a large panel of 52 currencies in advanced and emerging countries over almost 25 years of data. We find that only a few factors are robustly associated to a safe haven status, most notably the net foreign asset position, an indicator of external vulnerability, and to a lesser extent the absolute size of the stock market, an indicator of market size and development. The interest rate spread against the US is significant only for advanced countries, whose currencies are subject to carry trade. More generally, we find that it is hard to predict what currencies would do when global risk aversion is high, as estimates are imprecise and often not stable or robust. This suggests caution in over-interpreting exchange rate movements during financial crises.

40|$|This paper aims to {{forecast}} the USD/ALL {{exchange rate volatility}} in short term period in Albanian market, being that the American dollar is considered a <b>safe</b> <b>currency</b> independently to the political context {{in the rest of}} the world. Furthermore, U SD is the second foreign currency after Euro (according to financial and commercial transactions) and it is characterized by a peculiar probabilistic volatility distribution.

It follows that the measurement of the USD/ALL exchange rate volatility may help in the assessment and maintenance of capital needed for coverage purposes. The common financial time series dynamic models such as ARMA (1; 1), ARCH (1) an d GARCH (1; 1) can be used to estimate the USD/ALL exchange rate volatility in short term period.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} ways an economy working under a {{currency}} board could adjust when capital inflows stop suddenly. Six alternative solutions {{to restore the}} economic equilibrium are available when the sudden stop comes: a recession could push the prices of non-tradable goods down, a devaluation of the exchange rate could drive the prices of traded goods up, {{an increase in the}} international terms of trade could work in the same way the devaluation does, an increase in domestic savings could replace external savings, a recession could reduce {{the rate at which the}} economy creates new jobs or an increase in total factor productivity could validate the set of relative prices that ruled before the stop. The first three alternatives are short-run solutions (they require variables to adapt to new values of the parameters) while the rest could be addressed as structural solutions (they require parameters to change to keep variables at their original equilibrium levels). Solow`s neoclassical growth model (Solow,R. 1956) is used to analyze and evaluate each one of the six alternative solutions suggested. The model can easily accommodate supply side effects including total factor productivity growth which play a key rôle in this problem. The analysis of the changes in the values of parameters required for an 'structural adjustment' is made using elasticities to compare different steady-states. The results stress how important is for a <b>safe</b> <b>currency</b> board operation to encourage 'structural reforms' to favor total factor productivity improvements. currency board; growth; productivity growth; fixed exchange rate; stabilization; inflation; hyperinflation...|$|E

3000|$|The main {{message of}} this and the two {{preceding}} sections may be that while a Swiss bias in international asset allocation {{can be understood as}} the product of fear (notably following a severe crisis), such a bias may prove very costly over the long run. It is true that over a horizon of a few years, the evolution of the exchange rate can be dominant and have devastating consequences on unhedged portfolio returns. While the dollar weakness of the early 2000 s has been significant, the exchange rate impact is felt most critically during a crisis period when international diversification from a <b>safe</b> haven <b>currency</b> base appears very disadvantageous.

30|$|These {{observations}} {{confirm that}} ex-post deviations from uncovered interest parity can be long lasting. They {{also show that}} in normal times, the return differential pays off in the sense that, over the years, it more than compensates for the nominal appreciation of the franc. Moreover, the cumulative return advantage over long periods can be substantial. In crisis times, however, the appreciation of the <b>safe</b> haven <b>currency</b> combined with the compressed interest differentials at the Zero-Lower-Bound leads to reversals where investments in the <b>safe</b> haven <b>currency</b> delivers superior returns, as should be expected. Note {{that in the case}} of the dollar, the weakness of the early 2000 s has been as significant as the financial crisis itself. This is no doubt a reflection of the fact that the dollar also possesses safe haven characteristics. As shown in Fig.  4, the reversal has been dramatic in the case of the euro, plausibly because the euro area has been at the center of the crisis, so that the (smaller) return advantage cumulated until the advent of the crisis has been eliminated. Viewed from this angle, the hypothesis of uncovered interest parity appears validated. This validation, however, comes with the modulo that one may have to wait for a very severe crisis before observing the equalization of returns (and, as for all low-frequency events, such an event may not materialize in the course of a finite length sample). The reversal has been in full force for the UK sterling as well, but the return advantage cumulated until 2007 was too large to have been wiped out by the advent of the crisis. The situation is similar in the case of the dollar. Here again, the return advantage cumulated until approximately 2000 was so substantial that it was not annihilated by the subsequent under-performance of the dollar portfolio.|$|R

50|$|A case {{to point}} out {{is that of the}} Swiss National Bank, the central bank of Switzerland. The Swiss franc is {{regarded}} as a <b>safe</b> haven <b>currency,</b> so it usually appreciates during market's stress. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and during the initial stages of the Eurozone crisis, the Swiss franc (CHF) appreciated sharply. The central bank resisted appreciation by buying reserves. After accumulating reserves during 15 months until June 2010, the SNB let the currency appreciate. As a result, the loss with the devaluation of reserves just in 2010 amounted to CHF 27 Billion or 5% of GDP(part of this was compensated by the profit of almost CHF6 Billion due to the surge in the price of gold). In 2011, after the currency appreciated against the Euro from 1.5 to 1.1, the SNB announced a ceiling at the value of CHF 1.2. In the middle of 2012, reserves reached 71% of GDP.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the international {{flow of funds}} associated with calm and volatile global equity markets. During calm periods, portfolio investment by real money and leveraged investors in advanced countries flows into emerging markets. When central banks in the receiving countries resist exchange rate appreciation and buy dollars against domestic currency, they end up investing in medium-term bonds in reserve currencies. In the process they fund themselves (or "sterilize" the expansion of local bank reserves) by issuing safe assets in domestic currency to domestic investors. Thus, calm periods, marked by leveraged investing in emerging markets, lead to an asymmetric asset swap (risky emerging market assets against <b>safe</b> reserve <b>currency</b> assets) and leveraging up by emerging market central banks. In declining and volatile global equity markets, these flows reverse, and, contrary to some claims, emerging market central banks draw down reserves substantially.
