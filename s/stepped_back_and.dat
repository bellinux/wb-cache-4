5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E

Before García Calderón left Peru for Chile, he named Admiral Lizardo Montero as his successor.

25|$|Florida {{started the}} fourth quarter with a new quarterback, Mickey Ellenburg, who then led the Gators {{into the end zone}} with a 14-yard pass to Perry McGriff, tying the game at 7–7. LSU {{received}} the kickoff and were forced to punt shortly after. Florida again began a drive down the field but were intercepted by Cannon at the LSU 18-yard line, who then lateraled to Hendrix, who ran it down to LSU's 40. Rabb completed a pass to Brodnax and Cannon rushed four times for twenty yards to get LSU within eight yards of the end zone. After two incomplete passes by Rabb, Cannon tried a run up the middle, but was stopped by Heckman for a one-yard gain to bring up fourth down. Dietzel then allowed the play clock to run down and took a five-yard delay of game penalty to give Tommy Davis a better angle for a field goal attempt. From the 19-yard line, Davis <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> kicked it through the uprights to give LSU a 10–7 lead with 2:59 left in the game. Florida was unable to score on its final possession.|$|E
500|$|The {{fourth season}} {{also saw a}} change in the {{production}} team. Enterprise had previously been run by the show's creators, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, who were also the executive producers. Manny Coto joined the production team during the third season as a co-executive producer following his work on the series Odyssey 5. His scripts were well received, having written such episodes as [...] "". For the fourth season, Coto was credited as the show runner. He explained in an interview that [...] "What's been publicized, that Rick and Brannon have <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> I've moved in, is not exactly true. I've kinda moved in with them, so to speak, so we're all three running the show. I'm actually more in charge of writing, I guess, dealing with the writers and the 'writing room,' coming up with stories that Rick and Brannon approve or not approve, or give notes on." [...] He explained that the process was for the three of them to pitch stories together and work on fleshing them out.|$|E

The police had arrested 37 protesters that weekend; the government said that nearly 70 people had been injured. At night, two pro-democracy lawmakers, Fernando Cheung and Claudia Mo, appeared at Mong Kok to mediate between the suffragists and the police, leading to a lowering of tensions as the police and suffragists each <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> widened the buffer zone.

[...] It appeared Wells had scored the winning touchdown, but the play was called back. [...] The 1911 Michiganensian described the play this way: [...] "'Shorty' McMillan sent 'Stan' Wells down the side lines. [...] Then the Michigan team opened up and Bill Edmunds was given the ball. [...] Bill <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sent a beautiful long pass to 'Stan' Wells. [...] The pigskin came sailing through the air on a perfect line, Wells grabbed it and ran for a touchdown. [...] Instantly the small Michigan rooting contingent rose as one man and cheered until their voices failed. [...] Then Umpire Crowell asked for the ball. [...] It was handed him, and he walked {{back to where it}} had been put in play and told the Michiganders to start anew. [...] Wells had stepped out of bounds for an instant, just as he received the ball." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of several 299 {{games that}} were bowled on {{televised}} championships, {{the most memorable}} occurred on April 4, 1970 when Don Johnson defeated Dick Ritger to win the 1970 Firestone Tournament of Champions at Riviera Lanes in Fairlawn, Ohio. [...] With 11 strikes already down, he threw his 12th ball, <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> dropped to the floor. [...] The ball hit the pocket, but the 10-pin remained standing. [...] Johnson, still on the floor, briefly lowered his face into his hands, then stood up to a thunderous ovation. Johnson's wife Mary Anne was also crying prior to the shot, and crying even more after Johnson {{got up from the}} floor. Along with the trophy and $25,000 check from Firestone, Johnson also received the 10-pin that denied him both an extra $10,000 and a new Mercury Cougar automobile for a perfect game (In the post-match interview with the Johnsons, Mary Anne was holding the pin). [...] The footage of this has been replayed many dozens of times in flashback segments on PBA telecasts. The online bowling channel Xtra Frame has named this the most memorable moment of the events history.|$|E

2500|$|They {{were rewarded}} for {{this in the}} 1994 general {{election}} in which the party doubled its number of seats to twenty-four. D66 was able to form its 'dream coalition', the Purple government, which combined the social-democratic PvdA, and the conservative-liberal VVD. The first Kok cabinet initiated legislation, which the D66 has always advocated, such as the referendum, same-sex marriage and the legalisation of euthanasia. The [...] moderate liberal economic policies of the cabinet were also seen as a great success. Van Mierlo became Minister of Foreign Affairs. Before the election of 1998, Van Mierlo <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> Els Borst, the minister of health became the top candidate. D66 lost ten seats in the election, but its coalition partners won considerable ground {{at the cost of}} D66. The second Kok cabinet continued. Although D66 was numerically not necessary, it was seen as the glue that kept the two opposites of PvdA and VVD together. Borst stepped down as party leader and became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health. Thom de Graaf led the parliamentary party. Within the party, a group of age twenty-somethings called Opschudding (Upheaval) began to call for a more explicit progressive liberal course. In 1999 a constitutional reform, which would allow referendums was rejected by the Senate. A group of dissidents around the prominent VVD member Hans Wiegel had voted against. D66 left the cabinet. In the subsequent formation talks, D66 returned to the cabinet, in return for another important issue for D66, the directly elected mayor, and a temporary referendum law.|$|E
2500|$|... {{hooligan}}ism for {{the first}} time. The first Dutch hooligan firms occurred in the late 1960s. Prior to the match English hooligans had been causing damage {{in the center of}} Rotterdam already and during the match they climbed over the cages that separated the stands. They were throwing seats, set the stadium on fire and were fighting man to man. About 150 people were wounded and 50 English hooligans were arrested. UEFA-employee Lucien Schmidtlin reported that neither Feyenoord nor Tottenham could be blamed for the riots. After the match the Dutch authorities saw the happenings as a problem that occurred in England and only a few people were warning that these riots might become common, also in the Netherlands. [...] In the years that followed the S.C.F (SCF) was established {{and a lot of the}} fanatic Feyenoord fans became part of one of the most feared firms in European football. In Europe they were also known as the [...] "Don't run away" [...] firm and besides fights with other Dutch firms there were some big fights in the 1990s in Germany. 15,000 Feyenoord fans were having control over the German police in Mönchengladbach, while also in Stuttgart and Leverkusen they caused a lot of trouble. The most violent clash where the SCF clinched with Ajax's F-side was on 23 March 1997 when the [...] "Battle of Beverwijk" [...] took place and Ajax fan Carlo Picornie was killed by the SCF. After this incident several members of the original SCF <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> a second generation of hooligans joined those who stayed. The additional firm was known as the RJK (Rotterdamse Jongeren Kern/Rotterdam Youth Squad). Two years later a third firm (FIIIR) was established and merged with the RJK, the FIIIR became the youth squad of the SCF. Another big clash between the firms of Ajax and Feyenoord happened in Rotterdam on 17 April 2005 when hundreds of SCF and FIIIR members fought with the police prior to the match versus Ajax. F-side members were at that time held by the police just outside the stadium and when the announcement was made in the stadium several groups of SCF/FIIIR members left the stadium to find the F-side. When the police tried to avoid the groups to get together both sides attacked the police first before clashing with each other. Many people got injured, police officers and members of both firms. On 30 November 2006 Feyenoord faced AS Nancy in France, which is at driving distance from Rotterdam. Only 1200 tickets were awarded to Feyenoord fans. Much more than that number travelled to Nancy and tried to get tickets at the Stade Marcel Picot. Later, during the match inside the stadium SCF and FIIIR members broke a wall of glass between two stands and provoked French fans. The match was suspended for 30 minutes in the 80th minute after the police used tear gas to drive the SCF/FIIIR members back into their own stand. The match was eventually finished, 30 minutes after it was suspended. It was said many of the SCF/FIIIR members were having Dutch stadium bans and should not have been allowed to buy tickets in Nancy. Members of SCF and FIIIR identify themselves with their tattoos Due to this violence, Feyenoord was knocked out of the UEFA Cup for the remaining of the season. The estimation is that there are around 200 core members, but when in Rotterdam they are joined by more. They also call themselves [...] "Rotterdam Hooligans" [...] and [...] "Lunatics", their main slogans are [...] "Vatos Locos Forever", [...] "Feyenoord till we die" [...] and [...] "We shall not be moved". In 2013 Independent Dutch film company Cerce Films released the movie [...] "Roffa" [...] which is a story based on the hooligans of Feyenoord.|$|E
