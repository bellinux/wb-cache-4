5|$|In November 2016, Manning {{disclosed}} {{that she made}} a second suicide attempt on October 4, 2016, {{on the first night}} of her <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following their {{arrest the}} activists {{were kept in}} <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for weeks during which they were {{allegedly}} subjected to torture by Bahrain National Security Agency (NSA) officers seeking to secure confessions and for punishment. This reportedly included sexual assaults.|$|E
5|$|Sentenced to 25 {{years of}} hard labor, Hartmann refused to work. He was {{eventually}} put into <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> which enraged his fellow prisoners. They began a revolt, overpowered the guards, and freed him. Hartmann made a complaint to the Kommandants office, asking for a representative from Moscow and an international inspection, {{as well as a}} tribunal, to acquit him of his unlawful conviction. This was refused, and he was transferred to a camp in Novocherkassk, where he spent five more months in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Eventually, Hartmann was granted a tribunal, but it upheld his original sentence. He was subsequently sent to another camp, this time at Diaterka in the Ural Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Since the prison's closure, six {{cells have}} been {{restored}} {{to represent the}} varying living conditions at different times in the prison's history. The main block also houses the gallows, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells, and two chapels.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{frequently}} {{clashed with}} the prison's management over the mistreatment of his fellow prisoners. Sometimes he was put into <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> with one stay lasting 16 months. When Berkman smuggled reports of corruption and brutality outside the prison, resulting in an investigation, {{he was taken to}} the dungeon and put in a straitjacket.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2016, Manning {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} after what media sources characterized as a suicide attempt. The following week, Manning confirmed through an attorney statement that she had attempted to end her own life. On July 28, 2016, the ACLU announced that Manning was under investigation and facing several possible charges related to her suicide attempt. She was not allowed to have legal representation at the disciplinary hearing for these charges. At the hearing, held on September 22, she was sentenced to 14 days in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> with seven of those days suspended indefinitely. Manning emerged from <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> on October 12, after serving seven days; she said that she was not given the opportunity to appeal the ruling before being placed in solitary.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} attacks, Gupta said he {{accepted}} his guilt {{and should be}} hanged. Mukesh Singh, who was placed in Tihar Jail after his arrest, was assaulted by other inmates and was kept in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for his own protection.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flogging was {{discontinued}} in the 1940s, {{with the}} last incident occurring in 1943. From that decade, punishments were decided by the superintendent after hearing the case against a prisoner, or by a magistrate for grievous violations. Lesser transgressions could result in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> or restriction from visitors, education, and concerts; serious offences were punishable by the cancellation of any remission earned and a bread-and-water diet, normally over a two-week period.|$|E
5|$|Following his conviction, Brady {{was moved}} to Durham Prison, where he asked to live in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> He spent 19 years in {{mainstream}} prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 {{and sent to the}} high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital, in Sefton; {{he made it clear that}} he never wanted to be released.|$|E
5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point. In August 2008, Jeffs went into convulsions after banging {{his head against the}} walls of his cell repetitively and had to be taken to a hospital by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|While Buckner was a Union {{prisoner}} of war at Fort Warren in Boston, Kentucky Senator Garrett Davis unsuccessfully sought to have him tried for treason. On August 15, 1862, after five months of writing poetry in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> Buckner was exchanged for Union Brig. Gen. George A. McCall. The following day {{he was promoted to}} major general and ordered to Chattanooga, Tennessee, to join Gen. Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|In the convict era, {{particularly}} during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving prisoners were punished with flogging, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> {{and working in}} chain gangs at gunpoint. Particularly difficult prisoners were put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, {{out of a total}} of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, where he {{received}} marginal care. He had lost , was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned as white as snow. McCain {{was sent to a}} different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed into <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> where he would remain for two years.|$|E
5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in tough love behavior modification programs since the 1960s. Many {{of these programs}} {{take place in the}} wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ten}} months of Nayyouf's {{sentence}} were served in Sednaya Prison outside Damascus. While at Sednaya, Nayyouf tried {{to organize a}} prisoner revolt. He was moved to Palmyra prison near Tadmur. In 1993, Nayyouf went on a thirteen-day hunger strike at Palmyra in order to protest the torture of prisoners. While at Palmyra, Nayyouf was able to pass evidence that the prisoners were being tortured to the press outside, which led to another transfer to Mezzeh prison, a military prison outside Damascus. Most of his ten-year sentence was spent in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in Mezzeh.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} a meter that tracks Mustafa's hope. As he completes tasks that take him towards {{the goal of}} escaping, the meter increases. Listening to the {{experiences}} of fellow detainees, which in some cases is required {{to gain access to}} other information or tasks, drains Mustafa's hope. If he is caught breaking rules by the guards, Mustafa is placed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> which also drains hope. Should the hope meter run out, Mustafa loses the ability to continue to attempt an escape, and is deported.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, some {{children}} {{playing in the}} street wandered into the yard of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison's Board of Inspectors was unable to identify the inmate involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for nearly a year. Days after {{he was released from}} solitary, Berkman tried to hang himself with a strip of his blanket.|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{arrived in}} Stalag VIII-B in April 1942, and {{switched}} identities with a New Zealand army private, Frederick Cole, {{so that he}} would be available to be placed on work detail (members of the air force were not permitted to be part of working parties). In June he was able to escape from a coal-mining work camp with an Irish soldier, and fled to occupied Poland, but was soon captured in Kraków and returned to Stalag VIII-B {{by the end of the}} month. He was sentenced to two weeks of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> but retained his secret identity.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Brooks is paroled {{after serving}} 50 years, but he cannot {{adjust to the}} outside world, and he commits suicide by hanging himself. Andy {{receives}} a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, earning a spell in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias Randall Stephens.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Abu-Jamal was punished with <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for {{engaging}} in entrepreneurship contrary to prison regulations. Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court of Appeals, in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail {{in an attempt to}} establish whether he was writing for financial gain.|$|E
5|$|March-Phillipps {{was killed}} during Operation Aquatint in September 1942. On the same mission, Hayes evaded capture {{and crossed the}} Spanish border, only {{to be handed over}} to the Germans who kept him in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for nine months before he was {{executed}} by firing squad on 13 July 1943. Appleyard later joined the Special Air Service, and {{on the same day that}} Hayes was executed Appleyard was reported missing when his plane failed to return from a mission. Lassen would also join the Special Air Service; he was awarded two bars to his MC and promoted to major before receiving a posthumous Victoria Cross in Italy in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{retired from}} St Bartholomew's in 1976. In 1975–1976, he was Montague Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh. He {{believed}} that scientists have an individual moral responsibility and, {{just as the}} Hippocratic Oath provides a code of conduct for physicians, he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct, a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. During his tenure {{as president of the}} Pugwash conferences, Rotblat nominated Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1988 to 2004. Vanunu had disclosed the extent of Israel's nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the Bahraini {{uprising}} {{started in}} early 2011, Matar joined the protests and gave several interviews to international media. Following government crackdown, {{he and other}} party MPs resigned from Parliament. Due to his activism, Matar was arrested by authorities in May. He was allegedly kept in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> and subjected to torture while in detention before getting tried before a military court. He was released in August and acquitted of charges in February 2012. His arrest, alleged mistreatment and subsequent release triggered several international reactions by international bodies and NGOs such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Inter-Parliamentary Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Following his release, Matar continued his political activism.|$|E
5|$|By September, Brooks {{was back}} at a work camp, this time in Svitavy in the Sudetenland. He escaped that month with five other men, this time making it to Lüneburg inside a coal train prior to his recapture. Sent to a {{prisoner}} of war camp near Wiener Neustadt, he once more tried to escape but failed, suffered a severe beating {{at the hands of the}} Germans, and was again sent back to Stalag VIII-B for two weeks of <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b> Working as a truck helper from a saw mill in Toszek, he slowly acquired maps of Europe and the surrounding region as well as contact information for the Polish Underground State. Having escaped twice already, he risked transfer to a special punishment camp if caught again but, nevertheless, he fled his detention once more, this time with a Scottish soldier by the name of John Duncan, in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors {{who refused}} noncombatant service during World War I were imprisoned in {{military}} facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). The government assumed that COs could {{be converted into}} soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps. Simultaneously the Justice Department was preparing to indict 181 Mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service. The draftees' refusal {{to put on a}} uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both the government and the COs. The treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute COs included short rations, <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|E
5|$|Doggett first {{appears in}} the fifth episode. She wishes to hang up a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture to fall down and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also {{displays}} transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her for {{the damage to the}} chapel. Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a dryer while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause for dancing provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1905 then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, {{partitioned}} Bengal. This sparked {{an outburst}} of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, {{the wife and}} daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in Alipore Jail. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was Chittaranjan Das.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 2010, CBC News Network's The Fifth Estate {{broadcast}} {{a documentary about}} the case titled Out of Control. In the documentary, reporter Hana Gartner describes Smith as a fourteen-year-old placed in a youth facility for one month in 2003 after throwing crabapples at the mailman. Smith was placed in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> after disruptive behaviour on her first day. Her initial one-month sentence would last almost four years, entirely in isolation, until her death in 2007. Often violent and unpredictable, her behaviours and the force required to intervene were always filmed and recorded, then listed on daily logs. Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at choking herself into unconsciousness; guards responding were often attacked by Smith, sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all {{former high}} {{officials}} of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard. The prisoners were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin, where they were designated by number, with Speer given Number Five. Initially, the prisoners were kept in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> for all but half an hour a day, and were not permitted to address each other or their guards. As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation. Speer considered himself an outcast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|Once Adrienne was {{released}} from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France James Monroe, obtained passports for her and her daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to Vienna for an audience with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who had endured harsh <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> since his escape attempt a year before, was astounded when soldiers opened his prison door to usher in his wife and daughters on 15 October 1795. The family spent the next two years in confinement together.|$|E
5|$|The Main Cell Block {{was built}} in two stages. Construction of the {{southern}} half of the block began in 1853 {{and most of the}} masonry works were finished within a year. The section was finished in 1855, including the association wards, a circular jarrah stairwell, and 18 <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> cells in the Refractory Block. However, iron fittings for the guardrails, which had been ordered from England three years previously, still had not arrived. Anxious for the new cell block to start being used, Henderson ordered that doors and rails be made locally, with iron salvaged from convict transport ships. The obvious transition between the local and imported railing now marks the boundary between the southern and northern wings. Prisoners were transferred from the temporary South Beach prison on 1 June 1855.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, all the women except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. Adam was questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement</b> in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the prison guards, who perhaps felt sorry for her, put her in a cell with a window low enough for her to escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in <b>solitary</b> <b>confinement,</b> without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
