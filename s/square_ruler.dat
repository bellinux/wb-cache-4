6000|$|We enter a small public-house by the {{roadside}} to get a draught of beer. In the kitchen, we behold the landlord and a tall man who is a customer. Both stare {{as a matter of}} course; the tall man especially, after taking one look at our knapsacks, fixes his eyes firmly on us and sits bolt upright on the bench without saying a word--he is evidently prepared for the worst we can do. We get into conversation with the landlord, a jovial, talkative fellow, who desires greatly to know what we are, if we have no objection. We ask him, what he thinks we are?--"Well," [...] says the landlord, pointing to my friend's knapsack, which has a <b>square</b> <b>ruler</b> strapped to it, for architectural drawing--"well, I think you are both of you mappers--mappers who come here to make new roads--you may be coming to make a railroad, I dare say--we've had mappers in the country before this--I know a mapper myself--here's both your good healths!" [...] We drink the landlord's good health in return, and disclaim the honour of being [...] "mappers;" [...] we walk through the country (we tell him) for pleasure alone, and take any roads we can get, without wanting to make new ones. The landlord would like to know, if that is the case, why we carry those weights at our backs?--Because we want to take our luggage about with us. Couldn't we pay to ride?--Yes, we could. And yet we like walking better?--Yes we do. This last answer utterly confounds the tall customer, who has been hitherto listening intently to the dialogue. It is evidently too much for his credulity--he pays his reckoning, and walks out in a hurry without uttering a word. The landlord appears to be convinced, but it is only in appearance. We leave him standing at his door, keeping his eye on us as long as we are in sight, still evidently persuaded that we are [...] "mappers," [...] but [...] "mappers" [...] of a bad order whose presence is fraught with some unknown peril to the security of the Queen's highway.|$|E
50|$|Lewis Latimer {{joined the}} U.S. Navy {{at the age}} of 15 on September 16, 1863, and served as a Landsman on the USS Massasoit. After {{receiving}} an honorable discharge from the Navy on July 3, 1865, he gained employment as an office boy with a patent law firm, Crosby Halstead and Gould, with a $3.00 per week salary. He learned how to use a set <b>square,</b> <b>ruler</b> and other tools. Later, after his boss recognized his talent for sketching patent drawings, Latimer was promoted to the position of head draftsman earning $20.00 a week by 1872.|$|E
5|$|Nicolas Louis de Lacaille {{portrayed the}} constellations of Norma, Circinus and Triangulum Australe {{as a set}} <b>square</b> and <b>ruler,</b> a compass, and a surveyor's level {{respectively}} {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments in his 1756 map of the southern stars. Also depicting it as a surveyor's level, German Johann Bode gave it the alternate name of Libella in his Uranographia.|$|R
5|$|In 1756, French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{introduced the}} constellation of Circinus with the French name le Compas, representing a pair of dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set <b>square</b> and <b>ruler,</b> a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Yi Dan {{established}} a Market Bureau ( [...] , [...] ) or Bureau of Weights and Measures ( [...] , [...] ) {{at the foundation}} of the Joseon dynasty in 1392. The Joseon Kingdom later attempted a standardization of length based on <b>square</b> brass <b>rulers,</b> which were used by magistrates and the secret police to fight commercial fraud. Under the Joseon, different classes of society were permitted different numbers of kan in their homes, but in its traditional sense—like the Japanese ken—of a bay between two pillars rather than as a set unit of length.|$|R
50|$|With the {{drafting}} machine one can perform {{a series of}} drawing operations that otherwise could only be achieved with a much more complex use of the classic <b>ruler</b> <b>square</b> and protractor, as, for example, drawing parallel lines, orthogonal lines, inclined lines according to a preset angle, measurement of angles, etc.|$|R
500|$|Norma was {{introduced}} in 1751–52 by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille with the French name l’Equerre et la Regle, [...] "the Square and Rule", after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set <b>square</b> and <b>ruler,</b> a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman instruments, in his 1756 map of the southern stars. The level was dangling from the apex of a triangle, leading some astronomers to conclude he was renaming [...] l’Equerre et la Regle to [...] "le Niveau" [...] "the level". In any case, the constellation's name had been shortened and Latinised by Lacaille to Norma by 1763.|$|R
5000|$|A Bay mare bred in New Jersey, Imperatrice was bred by W.H. Laboyteaux. In 1947 Imperatrice was {{purchased}} by Christopher Chenery's Meadow Stud. She raced 31 times with 11 wins, 7 shows, and 2 places. Some of her winning efforts included the New England Oaks, New Rochelle Handicap, the Test Stakes, and the Fall Highweight Handicap. [...] Imperatrice lived {{to the age of}} 34. She was the dam of winners Imperial Hill (Hill Prince), Scattered (Whirlaway), Speedwell (Bold <b>Ruler),</b> <b>Squared</b> Away2 (Piping Rock) and was the 3rd dam of successful New York sire Cure the Blues (through daughter Speedwell).|$|R
