5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and <b>shatter.</b> Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to <b>shatter.</b> Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Seed <b>shattering,</b> or shedding, is an {{important}} fitness trait for wild and weedy grasses. U. S. weedy rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly <b>shattering</b> weed, thought to have evolved from non-shattering cultivated ancestors. All U. S. weedy rice individuals examined to date contain a mutation in the sh 4 locus associated with loss of <b>shattering</b> during rice domestication. Weedy individuals also share the <b>shattering</b> trait with wild rice, but not the ancestral <b>shattering</b> mutation at sh 4; thus, how weedy rice reacquired the <b>shattering</b> phenotype is unknown. To establish the morphological basis of the parallel evolution of seed <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice and wild, we examined the abscission layer at the flower-pedicel junction in weedy individuals in comparison with wild and cultivated relatives. Results Consistent with previous work, <b>shattering</b> wild rice individuals possess clear, defined abscission layers at flowering, whereas non-shattering cultivated rice individuals do not. <b>Shattering</b> weedy rice from two separately evolved populations in the U. S. (SH and BHA) show patterns of abscission layer formation and degradation distinct from wild rice. Prior to flowering, the abscission layer has formed in all weedy individuals and by flowering it is already degrading. In contrast, wild O. rufipogon abscission layers have been shown not to degrade until after flowering has occurred. Conclusions Seed <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice involves the formation and degradation of an abscission layer in the flower-pedicel junction, as in wild Oryza, but is a developmentally different process from <b>shattering</b> in wild rice. Weedy rice abscission layers appear to break down earlier than wild abscission layers. The timing of weedy abscission layer degradation suggests that unidentified regulatory genes may {{play a critical role}} in the reacquisition of <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice, and sheds light on the morphological basis of parallel evolution for <b>shattering</b> in weedy and wild rice. </p...|$|R

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to <b>shatter</b> as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E

According to sources online, an early draft of the film would have had the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to <b>shatter</b> his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E

40|$|A {{yield loss}} caused by pod <b>shattering</b> {{is one of}} the {{obstacles}} to the improvement of soybean productivity in tropical areas. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the resistance of soybean genotypes to pod <b>shattering</b> as affected by agronomical and morphological characters. The field study was conducted in Malang, Indonesia, using 150 soybean genotypes. Data were collected on agronomical traits, the percentage of pod <b>shattering,</b> and pod morphological traits. Identification for <b>shattering</b> resistance was done as per oven dry method. Percentage of pod <b>shattering</b> was ranged from 0 % up to 100 % <b>shattering</b> with a mean of 58. 11 %. Pod <b>shattering</b> was found to be negatively correlated with a number of pod per plant, the thickness of the pod, and Y/Z (seed weight and pod weight ratio). The Identification obtained 66 very highly susceptible genotypes, 19 susceptible genotypes, 19 moderate genotypes, 38 resistant genotypes, and 8 very resistant genotypes. Two of eight very resistant genotypes (G 511 H/Anj//Anj///Anj////Anj- 6 - 11 and G 511 H/Anj//Anj///Anj////Anj- 5 - 4) have high yield, medium maturity day and large seed size.

5|$|Julian's {{best hope}} for a quick victory lay in a cavalry breakthrough. Not only was the German cavalry {{probably}} smaller than his own, but its lack of armour made it vulnerable to his armoured regiments, especially the cataphracts. If they could rout the enemy horse, his squadrons could then wheel and attack the German lines in the flank or rear, and the battle would {{be as good as}} won. Julian's cavalry would thus aim to deliver a shock charge, careering forward in a wedge formation with the cataphracts forming the spearhead, the conventional armoured cavalry on either side and the light regiments on the extreme right, ready to block outflankers and to pursue fleeing enemy horse. The initial collision would <b>shatter</b> the enemy formation, and then the Germans could be overpowered in the ensuing melee. Failing a cavalry breakthrough, Julian would have to rely on a struggle of attrition on foot, in which superior Roman armour, training and formation discipline would almost inevitably prevail.|$|E

Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to <b>shatter</b> into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E

40|$|Seed <b>shattering</b> in crops {{is a key}} {{domestication}} trait due to {{its relevance}} for seed dispersal, yield, and fundamental questions in evolution (e. g., convergent evolution). Here, we focused on pod <b>shattering</b> in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume crop for human consuption in the world. With this main aim, we developed a methodological pipeline that comprises a thorough characterization under field conditions, including also the chemical composition and histological analysis of the pod valves. The pipeline was developed {{based on the assumption}} that the <b>shattering</b> trait itself can be treated in principle as a “syndrome” (i. e., a set of correlated different traits) at the pod level. We characterized a population of 267 introgression lines that were developed ad-hoc to study <b>shattering</b> in common bean. Three main objectives were sought: (1) to dissect the <b>shattering</b> trait into its “components,” of level (percentage of <b>shattering</b> pods per plant) and mode (percentage of pods with twisting or non-twisting valves); (2) to test whether <b>shattering</b> is associated to the chemical composition and/or the histological characteristics of the pod valves; and (3) to test the associations between <b>shattering</b> and other plant traits. We can conclude the following: Very high <b>shattering</b> levels can be achieved in different modes; <b>shattering</b> resistance is mainly a qualitative trait; and high <b>shattering</b> levels is correlated with high carbon and lignin contents of the pod valves and with specific histological charaterstics of the ventral sheath and the inner fibrous layer of the pod wall. Our data also suggest that <b>shattering</b> comes with a “cost,” as it is associated with lowpod size, low seed weight per pod, high pod weight, and low seed to pod-valves ratio; indeed, it can be more exaustively described as a syndrome at the pod level. Our work suggests that the valve chemical composition (i. e., carbon and lignin content) can be used for a high troughput phenotyping procedures for <b>shattering</b> phenotyping. Finally, we believe that the application of our pipeline will greatly facilitate comparative studies among legume crops, and gene tagging...|$|R

5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{terrestrial}} region, between 2 and 4AU from the Sun, is called the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically. Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to <b>shatter</b> upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.|$|E
