In this article, the author identifies the main characteristics of the UK takeover regulatory regime, which is unique compared to other models in advanced capital markets.

With this model, minority <b>shareholder’s</b> <b>engagement,</b> employee’s participation, and public interest in market integrity have been addressed within the principle-based investor primacy while not destabilising the UK market for corporate control because of incumbent shareholder litigation and other regulatory actions. Of many rules, the disclosure requirement is being used to target various areas prone to abuse such as stake-building, virtual bid, deal protection arrangement, and post-takeover behaviour. The UK market has faced many cross-border takeovers and is competing with other major financial markets for corporate listings, this model has so far proven to be a resilient best market standard for takeovers...|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{engagement}} in {{socially responsible investment}} (SRI) processes. More specifically, it researches the impact of shareholder salience {{on the success of}} engagement activities. The research question asks: What is the relationship between <b>shareholder</b> salience and <b>engagement</b> effort success? Observations made within this study are based on 61 engagement projects between an institutional investor engaging in the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) performances of their investees and 61 of the investees.

50|$|To guide {{its mission}} of stewarding capital responsibly, Calvert seeks {{to deliver on}} what it calls the four pillars of {{responsible}} investing. These pillars are financial performance, superior research, <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> and inclusive prosperity and impact. Financial performance refers to Calvert’s paramount fiduciary responsibility to the investor to achieve the right risk and return profile for the asset class and style of investment. Superior research means gaining a comprehensive understanding of the impact an investment could have on society {{both positive and negative}} in order to generate investment returns and avoid risks. <b>Shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> speaks to Calvert’s commitment to actively engage with companies on behalf of their investors with a focus on environmental, social and governance issues. Finally, inclusive prosperity and impact means recognizing that the original and primary purpose of capitalism was to address problems in society. With this in mind, Calvert works to execute specific investments intended to directly address key problems such as widespread poverty and sub-standard living conditions worldwide.|$|E

40|$|The {{failures}} of high profile international {{companies such as}} Enron, Parmalat and Barings Bank and also companies in Malaysia such as Transmile, Idris Hydraulic, Aokam, PWE Industries and Hwa Tai Industries have triggered much interest to researchers and regulatory bodies {{on the work of}} company directors, arguably the front liners that are responsible for the success of the company. Although many reforms were taken in the last decade to prevent corporate collapses, how directors work and whether there are specified internal guidelines that guide their decision making, which affects the stakeholders of the company have been neglected. The collapse of many large companies gives significant evidence that without ethical leaders, corporate governance mechanisms and any type of control may malfunction. In 2012 the Securities Commission of Malaysia added a new principle, board ethical commitment, in the revised Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG). These developments have motivated the current study to explore and investigate the contribution of board ethical commitment towards the sustainable performance of the company. While there has been research on the association between corporate governance and firm performance, most of the studies use single measures of each corporate governance principle and no known archival research has been conducted on board ethical commitment. This study looks at multiple measures of each corporate governance principle and their association with firm performance. It also aims to examine the extent of companies compliance and disclosure with respect to board ethical commitment, test whether board ethical commitment is associated with firm performance and whether it will enhance the association between corporate governance and firm performance. This study uses two methods of data collection. First, archival analysis of the annual reports and websites of Malaysian listed companies. The MCCG 2012 Index was created to assess the compliance of companies with the corporate governance requirements while a comprehensive checklist was developed from international best practices to assess the level of board ethical commitment. Second, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with directors of the listed companies were conducted to draw insights into the reasons and justifications {{of the results of the}} archival analysis. This study found that in general, corporate governance does not have a significant positive relationship with corporate performance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} financialization of nonfinancial corporations (NFCs), emphasizing changes in firm-level financial {{behavior in the}} post- 1970 U. S. economy. The dissertation consists of four essays. These essays ask what is the financialization of NFCs, explore why NFCs have ‘financialized’, and evaluate the implications for fixed investment behavior. Chapter 2 lays out a simple stylized framework describing firm-level portfolio choice and utilizes this framework to analyze the implications of increasing NFC involvement {{in the provision of}} financial services, increasingly entrenched shareholder value norms, and rising firm-level demand volatility for NFC financial structure. By articulating underlying determinants of firm-level portfolio and financing decisions, this chapter isolates specific features of the post- 1970 U. S. economy that can be identified with the ‘financialization’ of nonfinancial corporations, and links these factors to expected changes in financial structure. Chapter 3 identifies the key phenomena constituting the financialization of NFCs via a detailed decomposition of firm-level balance sheets, thereby addressing the question of what is the financialization of NFCs. Changes in NFC financial behavior are reflected in both an increasing share of – largely liquid – financial assets in firm portfolios, and in changes in the structure of external finance, including increased indebtedness and equity repurchases among large firms. Chapter 4 explores the increasing intertwinement of industry and finance in the case of General Electric, thereby analyzing in more detail the ‘financialization’ of large firms. This case study exemplifies important complementarities and interdependence between the industrial and financial aspects of GE’s business. The shifts in GE’s balance sheet structure towards greater financial asset holdings, increased indebtedness and a reduction in outstanding equity are, furthermore, consistent with GE’s increased emphasis on ‘creating’ <b>shareholder</b> value and <b>engagement</b> in banking activities since the mid- 1980 s. Chapter 5 uses a firm-level panel to econometrically analyze the relationship between financialization and fixed investment, exploring the implications of changes in financing behavior, increasingly entrenched shareholder value norms and rising firm-level demand volatility for NFC investment rates between 1971 and 2011. Both shareholder value norms and rising volatility are identified as factors associated with an empirically and economically meaningful decline in NFC investment rates. This analysis also highlights key firm-size differences, building on the discussion in Chapters 3 and 4. In particular, shareholder value norms are found to primarily influence the financial decisions and investment behavior of large firms, whereas rising volatility most substantially impacts small firms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES Shareholders {{and investors}} have {{generally}} been considered to be stakeholders with limited interest in corporate social responsibility. This trend is changing, as today many investors perceive CSR as a factor that has implications on the bottom line. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how CSR is present in investor relations (IR). The focus was on the interaction between socially responsible investors (SRIs) and IR as well as on <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement.</b> In the present study, <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> refers to dialogues between investors and companies, with which investors aim to influence companies' CSR. Additionally, the study attempted to explore what challenges can be related to CSR in investor relations and to <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement,</b> and how these phenomena are developing in the future. METHODOLOGY The present thesis adopted a qualitative research design and the method of data collection was semi-structured interviews. In total nine individual interviews were conducted, four of which were with investor relations officers of Finnish public limited companies and five with Finnish institutional investors, who can be characterized as socially responsible investors. FINDINGS The findings of the study showed that CSR is present in investor relations, since it is a relevant part of companies' strategies today. However, the findings suggested that mainstream investors are not very interested in CSR yet, and socially responsible investors thus stand out from the crowd. Socially responsible investors were considered to be quite focused on CSR as well as very thorough in their processes of evaluating the responsibility of their investments. <b>Shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> was discovered to be an investor strategy for influencing corporate responsibility, which can be done in many different ways and compositions. Common denominators of engagement processes seemed to be their resource-binding nature, and the importance of personal relationships and trust. The findings suggested that CSR in investor relations can be challenging, since CSR messages directed to investors have to differ from messages to other stakeholders. Regarding <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement,</b> the biggest challenge seemed to be related to resources. As for the future development of CSR in IR and <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement,</b> the findings suggested that they are both increasing.

Research Findings/Insights: Drawing on 44 in-depth semi-structured interviews with pension fund representatives, asset managers and other investment players, {{the findings suggest that}} legislation provides limited direct encouragement to private engagement behaviour. However, legislation encourages attitudes towards Responsible Investment by enhancing investor understanding of Responsible Investment, increasing the interest of pension funds and asset consultants in the Responsible Investment practices of asset managers, and reducing the fear of pension funds to violate their fiduciary duties, thereby promoting an enabling environment for ESG engagement. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This article adds to the literature on comparative corporate governance and <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement.</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is first study that specifically analyses how regulation affects private <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> behaviour in emerging markets, providing empirical support for the institutional perspective.

40|$|This PhD {{research}} analyses {{the institutional}} and organisational determinants of <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues in Brazil and South Africa. Using an institutional framework, this study investigates the institutional incentives and barriers faced by domestic investors when engaging with companies on ESG issues. It also identifies which types of investors {{are more likely}} to engage. The key research question of this PhD study was investigated using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Statistical analysis was used to identify which types of investors {{are more likely to}} engage, and the results were explored in semi-structured interviews. The institutional influences on <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> in these countries were also explored through semi-structured interviews. The research findings demonstrate that the engagement strategies most commonly employed by South African investors are individual meetings with companies to address ESG issues, while Brazilian investors mainly use collaborative engagement and appointment of investor representatives onto Boards of Directors of investee companies. As for the determinants of engagement in these countries, legislation and the influence of investor associations are driving local investors to engage with companies both directly and indirectly. Moreover, the influence of the legal and self-regulatory guidelines is encouraging pension funds to question asset managers about their RI practices and, to a lesser extent, to outsource engagement activities. This is because, since most pension funds in Brazil and South Africa are small and lack financial resources, staff and investment knowledge, they are shifting the RI responsibilities imposed on them by mandatory and voluntary regulations to service providers. In terms of investor characteristics, the statistical data and the interviews show that larger investors and asset managers are more likely to engage with investee companies than smaller investors and pension funds. This is largely because smaller investors and pension funds have insufficient resources available to them, pension fund trustees lack investment understanding, and the potential for smaller investors to influence companies is limited. In addition, active investors are more likely to engage than passive investors as they are motivated by their goal to outperform the market as well as the remuneration incentives available to active managers. Furthermore, passive investors are unable to divest from companies. By studying the determinants of <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> in the emerging markets, this study offers academic and practical contributions. Academically, the study contributes to the literature on <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement,</b> and particularly on emerging markets where the level of RI and engagement activities is increasing, but on which limited literature is available. Furthermore, the research shows that the institutional frameworks in place in Brazil and South Africa are likely to bring further growth for the practice of RI and <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement.</b> As practical contributions, the identification of the most common engagement strategies employed and of the determinants of engagement will help investors to develop more effective engagement strategies and will help public and non-governmental organisations develop policies to foster engagement...|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> and {{financial}} risk and/or return {{is a very}} novel topic within the wider relevant literature. While prominent theoretical and empirical research has studied shareholder activism {{in the form of}} raising shareholder proposals, literature specifically pinpointing shareholder engagements, a rapidly growing alternative form of activism, is scarce. This thesis provides a quantitative analysis of a leading UK activist’s (Hermes Equity Ownership Services) ESG <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> and its impact on investment risk as well as the role of additional determining engagement factors lying behind these financial impacts. First, I investigate the issue of the ESG engagement effect on investment risk by examining the respective differences between target firms and control firms during the entire engagement period. The main finding is that ESG <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> creates a demonstrable value protection effect. The engagement targets have significantly less downside risk and Value at Risk than control firms. This result holds for subsamples of engagements related to governance theme, the combination of governance and social themes, and the combination of governance and environmental themes. However, this risk reduction effect disappears for environmental or social engagements alone. Moreover, I find that reduced risk only manifests for engagement targets that take actions/strategies to meet the investors’ requirements. Secondly, I analyse ESG engagement effects on investment returns and find little evidence of a strong association between the two. This conclusion holds for subsamples created by theme, industry or geography. I argue that ESG engagement hardly delivers any abnormal returns in the long run when the market learns the anomalies associated with ESG information. Thirdly, I further explore the financial impacts of ESG engagement and the mechanisms underlying it, focusing on the extractive industry only. I find that a successful engagement produces in average lower downside risk than a less successful engagement. Further investigating this, I show that tactics contributing to a successful engagement include targeting the higher authority levels of engaged firms, communicating via personal meetings (instead of alternative channels) and being consistent in the engagement pro...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to deepen the {{discussion}} about religious organisations’ (ROs) potential to practise their faith by means of their investments, rather than keeping both issues separate. The authors adopted a qualitative exploratory approach using seven cases of social <b>shareholder</b> <b>engagement</b> (SSE) by Christian organisations.

Within the three Christian organisations studied, the authors identified three significant features that relate to their religious nature and affect their SSE: having a structured belief system, a grassroots network and a long-term perspective. These features can be instrumental in impacting company behaviour and society at large.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{corporate}} governance on firm value {{has been extensively}} debated by academics and business practitioners. Some studies show that companies that allow minority shareholders to have more control are likely to create greater shareholder value than those firms with concentrated control, while other {{studies suggest that the}} impact of having democratic governance is either negligible or even negative. In developed countries institutional investors have a significant stake in most of the companies. Active engagement by institutional investors is expected to decrease agency costs by strengthening monitoring mechanisms of operations and performance evaluations of the management, resulting in an increase in firm value. However, some academics and business practitioners argue that such minority shareholders' active engagement could be detrimental to firm value.

In short, we have learned the wrong lesson about shareholders from the banking crisis...|$|E
