30|$|The {{numerical}} calculations for {{the electromagnetic}} field distribution {{of an individual}} Mo nanoscrew were performed using commercial software package (COMSOL Multiphysics v 4.3 b). In a specific calculation, the screw threads were modeled as casks. The nanoscrew was modeled by <b>stacking</b> series <b>of</b> <b>casks</b> along the length direction of a free-standing tapered cylinder. For simplicity, the supporting substrate was not considered in the calculation. The length of the cylinder was 1.3  μm; the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>casks</b> was 100  nm, and the separation between adjacent casks was set as 2  nm. The dielectric function of Mo was employed according to previous measurements [31]. In the simulation, a p-polarized light with an incidence angle of 45 ° was launched into the box containing the Mo nanoscrew to simulate {{the interaction between the}} excitation light and the nanoscrew. The excitation wavelength was 633  nm.|$|R

40|$|When the warship Vasa {{was raised}} in 1961, wooden casks were found in nearly every area of the ship. Unfortunately, this {{important}} find category was not subject to detailed recording and study until now. This thesis explains the use and distribution <b>of</b> <b>casks</b> aboard Vasa, and their place in seventeenth-century northern European cooperage. Recording <b>of</b> individual <b>cask</b> attributes {{formed the basis for}} these subsequent analyses. This shows there were at least 145 <b>casks</b> <b>of</b> five main types aboard when the ship sank in 1628. The majority <b>of</b> <b>casks</b> were made <b>of</b> oak timber; the remainder of pine. The most common type <b>of</b> <b>cask</b> could hold between 117 and 146 liters and featured square bungholes. These casks contained salt meat, and likely beer. The dimensions <b>of</b> these <b>casks</b> conform to multiples of the Swedish foot, suggesting they were produced locally or at least according to Swedish specifications. Distribution of the containers shows a clear stowage plan, with the majority <b>of</b> provision <b>casks</b> in the hold and <b>casks</b> <b>of</b> personal possessions on the gundecks above. A study of period art reveals that casks with square bungholes were common across seventeenth-century northwestern Europe, but have hitherto been underrepresented archaeologically. This iconographic evidence also supports the contention that many <b>of</b> the oak <b>casks</b> held beer. The casks from Vasa remain an important tool for understanding shipboard organization and the naval supply process during the seventeenth century.   M. A...|$|R

40|$|Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS) is {{the only}} nuclear power station in Africa and it stores its spent nuclear fuel (SNF) onsite in the spent fuel pool (SFP). Additional aged SNF {{assemblies}} are stored in dry storage casks in a facility located on the KNPS site. This minor research dissertation aims at evaluating various dry storage cask found in open literature. The dissertation provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>cask</b> types, heat transfer, radiation shielding and storage facility types. Specific criteria are required in the selection <b>of</b> <b>casks</b> and the storage facility to house the casks on site. The selection criteria for casks and the storage facility were determined and technically evaluated in this dissertation. The selected casks were evaluated in terms of SNF criticality, radiation shielding, decay heat removal and heat transfer. Other aspects also determined by calculation were the seismic stability <b>of</b> <b>casks</b> and the cask footprint. The results obtained show {{the relationship of the}} spent fuel (SF) packing density between the different casks. Different shielding materials are used in the casks and it aided the heat transfer process to take place with some casks having additional features which included cooling fins and air vents for adequate cooling of the SNF. Through these some trends could be identified which could be used in the selection or design <b>of</b> new storage <b>casks.</b> Recommendations for further study are to evaluate a greater range <b>of</b> <b>casks</b> to verify and improve upon the relationship of evaluated parameters that were shown in the technical evaluation. These casks should all have similar means of maintaining sub-criticality, shielding and heat removal in order to generate comparable results...|$|R

40|$|CASK, the rat homolog {{of a gene}} (LIN- 2) {{required}} for vulval differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans, is expressed in mammalian brain, but its function in neurons is unknown. CASK is distributed in a punctate somatodendritic pattern in neurons. By immunogold EM, CASK protein is concentrated in synapses, but is also present at nonsynaptic membranes and in intracellular compartments. This immunolocalization is consistent with biochemical studies showing the presence <b>of</b> <b>CASK</b> in soluble and synaptosomal membrane fractions and its enrichment in postsynaptic density fractions of rat brain. By yeast two-hybrid screening, a specific interaction was identified between the PDZ domain <b>of</b> <b>CASK</b> and the COOH terminal tail of syndecan- 2, a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). The interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from heterologous cells. In brain, syndecan- 2 localizes specifically at synaptic junctions where it shows overlapping distribution with CASK, consistent with an interaction between these proteins in synapses. Cell surface HSPGs can bind to extracellular matrix proteins, and are {{required for}} the action of various heparin-binding polypeptide growth/differentiation factors. The synaptic localization <b>of</b> <b>CASK</b> and syndecan suggests a potential role for these proteins in adhesion and signaling at neuronal synapses...|$|R
