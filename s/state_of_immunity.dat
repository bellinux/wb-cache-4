An infallible is regarded as preserved from sin because of his or her supreme level of righteousness, consciousness, love of God, and thorough knowledge of the consequence of sin. An infallible is considered immune from error in practical affairs, in calling people to religion, and in perception of divine knowledge, so that their followers do not fall into error.|$|E

Noon and Freeman, researchers at the Department of Therapeutic Inoculation at St. Mary’s Hospital in London, published their findings in The Lancet in 1911.Building on the observations of his predecessors Bostock, Blackley and Dunbar, Noon noted that hay fever patients “sometimes become cured” {{and that this was}} possibly because they “have {{had the good fortune to}} develop an active immunity against the toxin.” He hypothesized that by injecting hay fever patients with small amounts of a pollen “toxin”, a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> could be achieved.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1888 {{discovery}} of the bacteria that cause diphtheria and tetanus, Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō showed that disease need not be caused by microorganisms themselves. They discovered that cell-free filtrates were sufficient to cause disease. In 1890, filtrates of diphtheria, later named diphtheria toxins, were used to vaccinate animals {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate that immunized serum contained an antitoxin that could neutralize the activity of the toxin and could transfer immunity to non-immune animals. In 1897, Paul Ehrlich showed that antibodies form against the plant toxins ricin and abrin, and proposed that these antibodies are responsible for immunity. Ehrlich, with his friend Emil von Behring, went on to develop the diphtheria antitoxin, which became the first major success of modern immunotherapy. The presence and specificity of compatibility antibodies became the major tool for standardizing the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> and identifying the presence of previous infections.|$|E

40|$|International events {{since the}} {{landmark}} Pinochet case, increased human rights advocacy, efforts at {{a culture of}} accountability, {{as well as the}} recent pro-democratic up-rising in the Arab states sustain impetus for the consideration <b>of</b> Head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>immunity</b> in international law. A naturalist view of international law is {{that there can be no}} Head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>immunity</b> for violations <b>of</b> human rights. This popular view proceeds from a theoretical misunderstanding of the positivist concept <b>of</b> <b>immunities</b> resulting in its practical misapplication. However, this naturalist view must be contextualised within the subtleties of international rule-making. It is to this end that the inquiry into Head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>immunity</b> as a concept of customary international law, emergent trends and the formation of a new rule of custom in this regard is necessitated. Thus, this thesis will inquire into the applicability, or otherwise, <b>of</b> Head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>immunity</b> before certain fora, including national courts, international courts, and internationalised courts with view to discerning emergent trends in the practice <b>of</b> Head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>immunity.</b> Thematic in this thesis, is the argument that a provision in the constitutive instrument establishing the jurisdiction of a court which makes irrelevant the fact of official capacity as Head <b>of</b> <b>state,</b> without more, cannot remove the <b>immunities</b> <b>of</b> Heads <b>of</b> <b>states</b> under customary international law. This thesis will undertake its analysis from the perspective of the nature of the constitutive instrument establishing an international court and the extent to which states are bound by the instrument. This thesis will conclude this inquiry by considering the extent to which the trends elicited in the substantive part of the work have changed customary international law and the extent to which there can be said to be a new international law on Head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>immunity...</b>|$|R

The decline of immunity in actively immunized animals is not altered by antigenic challenge with formalin-killed cells or cell products.

40|$|A primary humoral immune {{response}} to most antigens results {{in the development of}} a long-lasting <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity.</b> In addition to influencing the outcome of a secondary {{immune response}} to the priming antigen, this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> may also alter subsequent immune responses to antigens that are structurally related to this priming antigen, a phenomenon that has been termed "original antigenic sin " (1 - 3).

40|$|Random-bred ICR mice {{recovered}} from infection with avirulent Plasmodium yoelii were challenged at various later times with virulent P. yoelii or with another species of Plasmodium, P. berghei, {{to characterize the}} immunological nature of the long-term <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> generated {{in response to the}} avirulent infection. It was found that recovered mice resisted lethal challenge with virulent P. yoelii through at least 416 days after primary infection. However, the quality of this immunity changed as the time after avirulent infection increased. Mice challenged early after recovery were able to prevent the development of patent parasitemia. Later, these immune animals lost this capacity and after challenge infections progressed to patency {{at the same rate as}} did nonimmune controls. However, after the establishment of parasitemia, those animals which had encountered the homologous parasite a long time before controlled, and then eliminated, blood infection and survived. The “early” <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> was expressed by animals which may have harbored small numbers of viable avirulent parasites and possessed a protective humoral factor which could passively transfer anti-P. yoelii activity to naive recipients. In contrast, animals with “late” immunity showed evidence of neither persisting avirulent parasites nor serum anti-P. yoelii activity. The results support the proposition that immunity to this parasite exists as two distinct but interrelated states of immunological reactivity: an early “active” immunity and a later state which has characteristics suggestive of a state of immunological memory wherewith the animals were capable of anamnestically responding to P. yoelii challenge. Little evidence of heterologous immunity to P. berghei was observed for animals {{recovered from}} P. yoelii...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} seven {{different}} parameters {{were employed to}} investigate the spleen and lymph node cells from mice at the early and the late <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> to the lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. Distinct differences were observed. Morphological studies revealed a different size distribution of the cells in the preparations from the early and the late <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity.</b> The cell mixtures of early immune cells contained many more large and blast-like lymphoid cells than the other. Where the cell function was concerned, the cytotoxic activity against LCM virus-infected target cells was almost entirely {{a function of the}} early immune cells, and our data strongly indicate that enhancement does not play any role for the disappearance by time of this cell activity. The antiviral effect after transfer to acutely infected animals was also predominantly a function of the early immune cells and the same was the case concerning the ability to protect against a lethal acute infection. However, the early immune cells were almost inactive after transfer to chronically infected virus carriers, whereas transplants of late immune cells to such mice had a very strong antiviral effect. The resistance to X irradiation also varied. Even high X-ray doses could not destroy the function of early immune cells, whereas the function of the late immune cells was readily impaired by X-ray treatment. The early and the late immune cells have one thing in common—both are susceptible to treatment with anti-theta serum. Because of the differences observed between the early and the late immune cells, it is concluded that they belong to different cell populations. However, because of the common susceptibility to anti-theta serum, probably both populations are T-cell lymphocytes. The implications of the results {{and the role of the}} different cells in the combat of the viral infection are discussed...|$|E
