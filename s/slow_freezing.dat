25|$|The second {{technique}} for cryoconservation is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without {{the formation of}} crystals. The process and mechanics of vitrification are similar to <b>slow</b> <b>freezing,</b> the difference lying in the concentration of the medium. The vitrification method applies a selected medium which has a higher concentration of solute so the water will leave the cells via osmosis. The medium is concentrated enough so all of the intracellular water will leave without the medium needing to be reconcentrated. The higher concentration of the medium in vitrification allows the germplasms to be frozen more rapidly than with <b>slow</b> <b>freezing.</b> Vitrification {{is considered to be}} the more effective technique of freezing germplasms.|$|E
25|$|Cryoconservation is {{the process}} of {{freezing}} cells and tissues using liquid nitrogen to achieve extreme low temperatures with the intent of using the preserved sample to prevent the loss of genetic diversity. Semen, embryos, oocytes, somatic cells, nuclear DNA, and other types of biomaterial such as blood and serum can be stored using cryopreservation, in order to preserve genetic materials. The primary benefit of cryoconservation is the ability to save germplasms for extended periods of time, therefore maintaining the genetic diversity of a species or breed. There are two common techniques of cryopreservation: <b>slow</b> <b>freezing</b> and vitrification. <b>Slow</b> <b>freezing</b> helps eliminate the risk of intracellular ice crystals. If ice crystals form in the cells, there can be damage or destruction of genetic material. Vitrification {{is the process}} of freezing without the formation of ice crystals.|$|E
25|$|During <b>slow</b> <b>{{freezing}},</b> {{cells are}} placed in a medium which is cooled below the freezing point using liquid nitrogen. This causes an ice mass to form in the medium. As {{the water in the}} medium freezes, the concentration of the sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant increase. Due to osmosis, the water from the cells enters the medium to keep the concentrations of sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant equal. The water that leaves the cells is eventually frozen, causing more water to diffuse out of the cell. Eventually, the unfrozen portion—cellular—becomes too viscous for ice crystals to form inside of the cell.|$|E

2500|$|Cryopreservation {{in humans}} {{with regards to}} {{infertility}} involves preservation of embryos, sperm, or oocytes via freezing. [...] Conception, in vitro, is attempted when the sperm is thawed and introduced to the 'fresh' eggs, the frozen eggs are thawed and sperm is placed with the eggs and together they are placed back into the uterus or a frozen embryo is introduced to the uterus. [...] Vitrification has flaws and is not as reliable or proven as freezing fertilized sperm, eggs, or embryos as traditional <b>slow</b> <b>freezing</b> methods because eggs alone are extremely sensitive to temperature. [...] Many researchers are also freezing ovarian tissue {{in conjunction with the}} eggs in hopes that the ovarian tissue can be transplanted back into the uterus, stimulating normal ovulation cycles. In 2004, Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997, samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cryopreserved in a (Planer, UK) controlled-rate freezer and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Chemotherapy was initiated [...] after the patient had premature ovarian failure. In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and after five months, reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after reimplantation, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in the first such live birth – a girl named Tamara.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, bull semen was cryopreserved for {{the first}} time by a team of {{scientists}} led by Christopher Polge. [...] This led to a much wider use of cryopreservation today, with many organs, tissues and cells routinely stored at low temperatures. Large organs such as hearts are usually stored and transported, for short times only, at cool but not freezing temperatures for transplantation. Cell suspensions (like blood and semen) and thin tissue sections can sometimes be stored almost indefinitely in liquid nitrogen temperature (cryopreservation). Human sperm, eggs, and embryos are routinely stored in fertility research and treatments. Controlled-rate and <b>slow</b> <b>freezing</b> are well established techniques pioneered in the early 1970s which enabled the first human embryo frozen birth (Zoe Leyland) in 1984. Since then, machines that freeze biological samples using programmable steps, or controlled rates, have been used all over the world for human, animal, and cell biology – 'freezing down' a sample to better preserve it for eventual thawing, before it is deep frozen, or cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen. Such machines are used for freezing oocytes, skin, blood products, embryo, sperm, stem cells, and general tissue preservation in hospitals, veterinary practices, and research labs. The number of live births from 'slow frozen' embryos is some 300,000 to 400,000 or 20% of the estimated 3 million in vitro fertilized births. Dr Christopher Chen, Australia, reported the world’s first pregnancy using slow-frozen oocytes from a British controlled-rate freezer in 1986.|$|E
40|$|Pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy, DEER and DQC, require frozen samples. An {{important}} {{issue in the}} biological application of this technique is how the freezing rate and concentration of cryoprotectant could possibly affect the conformation of biomacromolecule and/or spin-label. We studied in detail {{the effect of these}} experimental variables on the distance distributions obtained by DEER from a series of doubly spin-labeled T 4 lysozyme mutants. We found that the rate of sample freezing affects mainly the ensemble of spin-label rotamers, but the distance maxima remain essentially unchanged. This suggests that proteins frozen in a regular manner in liquid nitrogen faithfully maintain the distance-dependent structural properties in solution. We compared the results from rapidly freeze-quenched (≤ 100 μs) samples to those from commonly shock-frozen (<b>slow</b> <b>freeze,</b> 1 s or longer) samples. For all the mutants studied we obtained inter-spin distance distributions, which were broader for rapidly frozen samples than for slowly frozen ones. We infer that rapid freezing trapped a larger ensemble of spin label rotamers; whereas, on the time-scale of <b>slower</b> <b>freezing</b> the protein and spin-label achieve a population showing fewer low-energy conformers. We used glycerol as a cryoprotectant in concentrations o...|$|R

40|$|Crypreservation of oocytes is {{recently}} {{being considered}} to be a valid choice in infertility treatments. Low survival and fertilization rates due to inefficient <b>slow</b> <b>freeze</b> protocols have been the outcome ofmany previous studies done in the field. However, introduction of the vitrification technique and itsapplication in reproductive medicine and to some extent new improved <b>slow</b> <b>freeze</b> protocols haveshown that oocytes can be cryopreserved with successful outcome. In this project the survival rate of oocytes after vitrification with MediCult Vitrification andWarming Media has been studied. Also, a comparison of the carriers Cryoloop (an open system) andCryopette (a closed system) has been performed. A total of 43 oocytes were vitrified and warmed according to MediCult's protocol, of which 21 oocytes with Cryoloop and 22 with Cryopette. The cells were post-thaw incubated in a physiologicalenvironment for 24 h. During that time the morphology and viability were observed and noted after 2 h,over night and after 24 h. No significant difference in survival rates of the oocytes' was observed usingthe two carriers, and the total survival rate of the oocytes was 83. 7 %. This indicates thatcryopreservation of oocytes is a valid choice in fertility treatments and that the new product Cryopettecan be used clinically with just as good results as the well established Cryoloop technique. This merits further studies on the applicability of vitrification on oocytes and the Cryopette technique...|$|R
6000|$|If Dickens had {{fulfilled}} {{what was}} probably his original design, {{and described the}} <b>slow</b> <b>freezing</b> of Boffin's soul in prosperity, I do not say {{that he would have}} done the thing well. He was not good at describing change in anybody, especially not good at describing a change for the worse. The tendency of all his characters is upwards, like bubbles, never downwards, like stones. But at least it would probably have been more credible than the story as it stands; for the story as it stands is actually less credible than any conceivable kind of moral ruin for Boffin. Such a character as his--rough, simple and lumberingly unconscious--might be more easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as keeping up, month after month, so strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. To a good man (of that particular type) {{it would be easier to}} be bad than to pretend to be bad. It might have taken years to turn Noddy Boffin into a miser; but it would have taken centuries to turn him into an actor. This unreality in the later Boffin scenes makes the end of the story of John Harmon somewhat more unimpressive perhaps than it might otherwise have been. Upon no hypothesis, however, can he be made one of the more impressive figures of Dickens. It is true that it is an unfair criticism to object, as some have done, that Dickens does not succeed in disguising the identity of John Harmon with John Rokesmith. Dickens never intended to disguise it; the whole story would be mainly unintelligible and largely uninteresting if it had been successfully disguised. But though John Harmon or Rokesmith was never intended to be merely a man of mystery, it is not quite so easy to say what he was intended to be. Bella is a possible and pretty sketch. Mrs. Wilfer, her mother, is an entirely impossible and entirely delightful one. Miss Podsnap is not only excellent, she is to a healthy taste positively attractive; there is a real suggestion in her of the fact that humility is akin to truth, even when humility takes its more comic form of shyness. There is not in all literature a more human cri de coeur than that with which Georgiana Podsnap receives the information that a young man has professed himself to be attracted by her--"Oh what a Fool he must be!" ...|$|E
