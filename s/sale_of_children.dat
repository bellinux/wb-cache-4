25|$|The complex {{definition}} of child trafficking {{and the differences}} in national laws and interpretations makes the identification of child victims of trafficking challenging. For example, the European debate on child trafficking lacks consensus on how child trafficking is to be distinguished from other contexts of exploitation, from social dumping of migrants, the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and the smuggling of migrants.|$|E
25|$|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action urges at Section II para 47, {{all nations}} to {{undertake}} measures {{to the maximum}} extent of their available resources, {{with the support of}} international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action. And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans. By means of these national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and organs, child prostitution, child pornography, as well as other forms of sexual abuse. This gave an influence to adoptions of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Children,</b> Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.|$|E

25|$|Slavery {{was widely}} practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia, {{as well as}} in the rest of the ancient and early medieval world. The {{minority}} were white slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of Bedouin captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native Arab slaves had also existed, a prime example being Zayd ibn Harithah, later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes. The slave population increased by the custom of child abandonment (see also infanticide), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children. There is no conclusive evidence of the existence of enslavement for debt or the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> by their families; the late and rare accounts of such occurrences show them to be abnormal, Brunschvig states (According to Brockopp, debt slavery was persistent.) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the Roman Empire.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, the Canadian Coalition for the Rights of Children (CCRC) {{said that}} it {{approved}} of Canada's adoption of the plan, but was reserving judgement on whether the new Human Trafficking Taskforce {{would be more effective}} than the body it replaced. The CCRC criticized the NAP-CHT for including [...] "few specific strategies for children and no mention of strengthening respect for children's rights as part of prevention." [...] The CCRC also said that the NAP-CHT lacks recognition of the responsibilities Canada has according to the Optional Protocol on the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Children,</b> Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. The coalition therefore recommended that the plan be amended to include mandatory sentencing for traffickers of children, and to provide for collaboration with youth organizations.|$|E

Some of Haiti's efforts to combat modern day slavery include ratifying several key conventions, including the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UHDR), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, and the ILO Minimum Age Convention. [...] In 2014 Haiti ratified the Optional Protocol on the <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Children.</b> Conventions such as these, if enforced, could help to combat human trafficking.

This study adds to this body of research by reporting the results of a trial focused on promoting the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> healthy <b>child</b> menu items in independently owned restaurants. Eight pair-matched restaurants that met the eligibility criteria were randomized to a menu-only versus a menu-plus intervention condition. Both of the conditions implemented new healthy child menu items and received support for implementation for eight weeks. The menu-plus condition also conducted a marketing campaign involving employee trainings and promotional materials. Process evaluation data captured intervention implementation. <b>Sales</b> <b>of</b> new and existing child menu items were tracked for 16 weeks. Results indicated that the interventions were implemented with moderate to high fidelity depending on the component. <b>Sales</b> <b>of</b> new healthy <b>child</b> menu items occurred immediately, but decreased during the post-intervention period in both conditions. <b>Sales</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>child</b> menu items demonstrated a time by condition effect with restaurants in the menu-plus condition observing significant decreases and menu-only restaurants observing significant increases in <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>child</b> menu items.
