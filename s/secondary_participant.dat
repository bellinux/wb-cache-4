40|$|Transferred malice is a {{well-known}} concept that allows the extension of an offender's intent to a victim or object hit accidentally because the offender missed his intended target. Coupled to this doctrine is the annex doctrine of transferred defences which purports to transfer any defence the offender may have had vis-à-vis his intended victim to the actual victim. These doctrines cause systemic problems in single-actor scenarios, but those are increased exponentially if one applies them to multiple-actor situations, where the principles from Saunders and Archer apply which transpose the transferred malice doctrine to the <b>secondary</b> <b>participant</b> {{as long as the}} principal missed his target accidentally. The transferred defences doctrine has not been explored in these cases at all, as far as can be seen. This article examines the traditional doctrine and argues that based on a number of problematic constellations and a comparison to German law, it is in need of systematisation and clarification, and that the approach under Saunders and Archer is no longer fit for purpose. ...|$|E

By analyzing advertising from a discourse perspective, this paper further examines the context of communication and the participants’ roles in the context. This study focuses on commercial advertising, {{based on the assumption}} that the intended meaning of the advertiser is to persuade the viewer to perform a purchase. Therefore this study observes persuasive messages and how they are presented in advertising. To analyze and compare real texts from a discourse perspective present an opportunityto examine social changes that might have taken place in a society due to different temporal settings. The social changes are examined by comparing assigned gender roles in advertisements published in 1956 and advertisements published in 2014. The material consists of a total of eleven transcripts description of printed advertisements collected from The New Yorker. The examples used for this study have been hand picked to illustrate theories described in the background, such as those provided by Leech (1966), Hermerén (1999), Romaine (1999), Cronin (2000) and Hillier (2004). The framework for the analysis is based on Leech’s (1966) concept of primary and secondary situations with corresponding primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>participants.</b> The findings suggest that advertisers can persuade the viewer by addressing the viewer directly and by using exophoric references, or by inserting <b>secondary</b> <b>participants</b> to convey the message.

In Drosophila melanogaster {{differentiation}} {{of the male}} germ cells is accompanied by chromatin rearrangement and activation of the specific genes. These processes are regulated by few transcription factors that belong to two classes, can and aly that form distinct functional complexes. Mechanisms of action of aly and can class transcription factors on gene expression and chromatin state remain unclear. To investigate this question we have built the whole genome binding profile of transcription factor Comr belonging to aly class using the tissue-specific DamID method. Resulting datawere correlated with gene expression in comr (aly class) and can (can class) mutant testes. It was shown that Comr is a direct activator for about 300 testis-specific genes. Furthermore a set of genes revealed decreased expression in comr mutants but did not bind Comr protein, suggesting the existence of secondary regulation.

40|$|The {{conventional}} dictionary {{is not a}} good learner’s dictionary. Pinning senses onto words, it mythifies the language, excluding cognitive dynamics, {{specifically the}} speaker as meaning-maker, from language use. Therefore, it fails to motivate the coherence of senses, combinability, and grammatical habits of the items described, i. e. the knowledge which makes up the content of the speaker’s linguistic intuitions. Cognitive lexicography tackles this task based on conceptual analysis of the symbolic units of language.   How the two models, the representationist and the cognitive one, differ, is shown in this paper using lexicographic description of adjectives as an example. The Russian adjective presents the traditional lexicography with a special challenge. It lacks the means to motivate the admissibility and conditions of use of the short form, the degrees of comparison, specifically, the analytical and the synthetic form, the so called forms of subjective evaluation, and the many varying uses in predicative positions. Defining adjectival words in propositional terms, or paraphrastically, it is unable to escape the bad infinity of referential synonymy. Neither can it explain the dynamic positioning of virtually any adjective along the “qualitative – relational” axis, with both use types included, quite mechanically, in the inventory of senses, essentially undifferentiated as to their nature, and tending to proliferate.   In cognitive grammar, the adjective represents an atemporal relational concept, a stative relation between a concrete, or reifiable, entity (a “thing” in the sense of R. Langacker), and an abstract, not separately verbalized entity implicit in the lexical meaning of the adjective. What the adjective designates is thus not a feature but a featural relation. For this reason, any adjective is, in effect, relative. Its position on the “qualitative – relational” axis is determined by how the landmark of the adjectival relation, i. e. its implicit <b>secondary</b> <b>participant,</b> is conceptualized.     If construed as an immediate property revealed in, or ascribed to a thing, it {{can be thought of as}} an inherent or an autonomous one, respectively. This dialectics engenders conceptualizations imbued with the sense of “objective” property, ultimately, axiologically neutral construals, as well as of a property meaningful in the perspective of the speaker, i. e. evaluative ones. If, on the other hand, the landmark is construed as a domain, no property is ascribed to the thing; the adjective merely relates it to an entity in the domain, the relation meaningfully established by convention or context. The adjectives of this kind are non-evaluative and can not, in normal use, support a judgement, therefore, lacking predicative forms.   Thus, “qualitativeness” is functional, and originates with evaluation of an ontological relation. No morphological or other property typically invoked to categorize an adjective as a qualitative one, while pointing in the right direction, is a necessary feature of qualitativeness. If a domain relation gets conventionalized as an evaluative one, or deliberately re-categorized as such, i. e. if it gets transformed from an ontological and subcategorizing into a featural and characterizing one, the adjective shifts toward qualitativeness. Conversely, if a property gets ontologized, it acquires the domain status, with the adjective shifting toward relatedness. The extensions of this kind are underlied by mechanisms of metaphor, usually conceptual, and those of metonymy, usually regular, but also by creative uses.   In this paper, a so called specific-evaluation adjective slavnyj (usually interpreted as ‘ 1. glorious; famous’ and ‘ 2. nice’) provides the main example offering a conceptual analysis against the background of a traditional lexicographic description. The analysis reveals that it is slavnost' (≈ ’gloriousness’) rather than slava (‘fame’) that is this adjective’s correlate property name, while the eidetic core, or functional constituent, of the concept SLAVNYJ relates to the idea of “a source of grace”. Also presented are mechanisms of construing the concept in terms of a property resp. in terms of a domain. It is thus shown how exactly the conceptual analysis of an adjective based on the above premises helps to motivate the coherence of all its senses, conventional and less so, resulting from cognitive operations over the concept, as well the adjective’s combinatorial and grammatical behavior...|$|E

Ten residents (age range = 69 - 93) of three nursing homes served as primary participants, providing one in-depth formal interview, repeated informal interviews, participant observation experiences, and access to their health care records. Another 33 individual residents and five groups of residents served as <b>secondary</b> <b>participants,</b> providing informal interviews and participant observation experiences. Using Grounded Theory methodology, data were concurrently obtained and analyzed over a seventeen-month period. ^ Two distinct responses to UI were discovered in the data: making the best of it and suffering with it. Both are consequences of the core category, MANAGING THE FLOW. As the main theme in the data, MANAGING THE FLOW explained response to UI as a function of perceived impact and management of UI by the older adult residing in a nursing home. Older adults use six strategies to MANAGE THE FLOW: limiting, improvising, learning, monitoring, speaking up, and letting it go. These strategies are pursued in the interest of protecting physical, psychological, and social integrity within the nursing home, and in the context of believing that UI is inevitable and difficult, if not impossible, to treat. ^ This study suggests that the process by which institutionalized older adults respond to UI is similar to that observed among community-dwelling elderly, and congruent with major concepts and principles of the Roy Adaptation Model.

To {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of an intervention delivered by health professionals outside the school environment to girls identified with issues such as poor body image, low self-esteem, low self-confidence, nonparticipation in sports, or being overweight or underweight. Design. The study's design was a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an intervention on self-esteem, impairment induced by eating disorders, self-efficacy, body satisfaction, and dieting behaviors. Setting. The study {{took place at the}} community health center located in a culturally diverse area of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Subjects. Participants were 122 primary and secondary school girls between 10 and 16 years of age. Intervention. Girls on the Go! is a 10 -week program designed to improve self-esteem, body image, and confidence, using an empowerment model that involved interactive and experiential learning approaches. Weekly themes included body image and self-esteem, safety and assertiveness, a healthy mind, physical activity, healthy eating, trust and confidence, and connections. Measures. Measurements were made using Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, clinical interview assessment, health self-efficacy (included mental health and physical health self-efficacy scales), body esteem scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Children. Analysis. A linear mixed model was used. Results. The intervention led to a significant increase (p <. 05) in self-esteem and self-efficacy (mental and physical health self-efficacy subscales), for both primary and <b>secondary</b> school-aged <b>participants</b> and reduced dieting behaviors (<b>secondary</b> school <b>participants).</b> These gains were retained after 6 months of follow-up.

In particular, there is little understanding of how people ascribe cause to miscarriage. This research sought to gain an in-depth understanding of notions of miscarriage causality and risk amongst Qataris. Methods The study adopted an exploratory descriptive qualitative approach and collected data during 18  months of ethnographic research in Qatar, including semi-structured interviews. The sample includes 60 primary participants (20 pregnant women and 40 women who had recently miscarried), and 55 <b>secondary</b> <b>participants</b> including family members, health care providers, religious scholars and traditional healers. Informed {{consent was obtained from}} all participants. Primary participants were interviewed in Arabic. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Data was analysed using an inductive thematic approach, which involved identification and application of multiple codes to different text segments. Data were encoded manually and examined for recurrences across the data set. Similar quotations were grouped into subcategories and further categorized into main themes. Results A number of key themes emerged, revealing Qatari women attributed miscarriages to a number of factors including: supernatural forces, such as God’s will and evil eye; lifestyle, such as physical activities and consuming particular substances; medical conditions, such as diabetes; and emotional state, such as stress, and emotional upset. Resting, avoiding stress and upset, maintaining healthy diet, and spiritual healing (ruqyah) are seen as a means to avoid miscarriage.

The primary participants of this study were four teacher leaders, two males and two females. I selected them through purposive sampling. Moreover, two groups of students, two community members and two head teachers from both the schools were selected as <b>secondary</b> <b>participants.</b> I used the qualitative case study methodology to explore the practices of participant teachers in the classroom, school and community through in- depth interviews, focus group discussions and classroom observations. These multiple data sources allowed me to explore the practices of participant teachers in the three realms. The key findings of the study suggest that in their classrooms, participant teachers strive to promote in- depth student learning using student-centred teaching as well as innovative methods of teaching and building close relationship with the students. In the school, they develop a cooperative and collegial environment by changing the existing practices and taking new initiatives such as teamwork and support. In the community realm, they try to develop a good relationship among the school, parents and the wider community. They develop linkages between parents, youth, management and school and also participate voluntarily in social services in the community for community development. In sum, implications of these findings for teachers, school or system are presented as recommendations.

Data were coded and analyzed and primary themes included: (a) a supportive classroom atmosphere; (b) repertoire selection; (c) developing independent musicians; and (d) creating a chorus community. Results ofthis study indicate that the director demonstrated numerous leadership behaviors that intersect with those found in Transformational Leadership. These included: setting clear, challenging goals; holding high expectations for music reading and performance; providing support in a friendly classroom environment; establishing a sense of community in the chorus; and, genuinely caring for the needs of students. These transformative leadership behaviors led to students who demonstrated musical independence. Suggestions for the profession include implementing transformational leadership behaviors into undergraduate music education courses, which can provide opportunities for preservice teachers to reflect upon and develop their leadership skills to a higher level before they enter the profession...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{explored}} {{the negotiation of}} identities of American-born Mexican descent {{high school students in}} a US-Mexico border region. These students resided mostly with their parents and families on the Mexican side, and having legal American status, crossed the border daily to attend high school on the U. S. side. This qualitative study was informed by social and historical perspectives, and emphasized the identity of border crossers, examining the question of how they positioned themselves when faced with Americanization on the U. S. side and Mexicanization on the Mexican side. The study included a total of 19 participants: 3 students of primary focus, and 16 <b>secondary</b> <b>participants</b> (6 other high school students, 6 educators and 4 parents.) This sample of convenience was recruited at Isler High School, the researcher's place of work. Interviews were conducted with each participant, and the three focus students kept a month-long journal. Finally, some students in the secondary group provided valuable information through focus group discussion. Using Gee's (2001) theoretical framework that proposes four perspectives for viewing identity (Nature, Institution, Discourse and Affinity), the researcher found that the focus participants, each one bilingual, considered English an instrument to become American and be recognized as such. However, each "confessed" to code-switching, but preferred to avoid it. The three focus students self-identified as either Mexican or Mexican and American. One strongly rejected the possibility of being ascribed the identity of a Chicano. The study showed that student border crossers are perfectly fluent in both English and Spanish, contrary to commonly held belief, and that they identify with Mexico, but also with the United States...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{narrative}} study was to describe the life history of an adolescent survivor of an abusive head trauma in the Southeastern United States. Abusive head trauma {{is a form of}} inflicted brain injury, often occurring because of violence in the form of shaking or impact to the head of an infant under the age of two years old (Chevignard 2 ̆ 6 Lind, 2014). Life history is defined as a first-hand account to convey understanding of a life. The primary participant was a 19 -year-old, Caucasian female survivor of an abusive head trauma that occurred when she was five months old. <b>Secondary</b> <b>participants</b> include the survivor’s family members, a family friend, a special education teacher and a church youth leader. The theoretical framework of this study was based on Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecology of human development, Ungar’s (2012) theory of social-ecological resilience, and Bandura’s (1986) social cognitive theory. The central research question was: What are the lived experiences of an adolescent survivor of an abusive head trauma in the Southeastern United States? Data was collected through interviews, observations, documents, artifacts, video journal, and prolonged engagement with the survivor and her family. Data was analyzed to describe the story and place it in a chronology to present narration focusing on processes, theories, and unique general features of the primary participant’s life. Findings indicated that the primary participant faced neurological, cognitive, behavioral, academic and social challenges, while her resilience mechanisms included a large support network, adaptive behaviors, faith and perseverance. This study makes an original, empirical contribution as the sole account of the life history of an adolescent survivor of an abusive head trauma...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} research {{study was to identify}} how (and to what extent) techniques and practices influence the learning of African American college students in predominately White institutions (PWI) because emerging trends in the performance of African American students reveal a decrease in retention and graduate rates. This study involved a set of 14 open-ended questions used for the interview protocol, and primary participants selected were 20 full-time award winning faculty members with at least five years teaching experience; <b>secondary</b> <b>participants</b> involved 80 recent Junior and Senior level students of the faculty members. ^ The analysis of the data revealed that both faculty and students indicated that the environment {{played a significant role in}} influencing learning, and a key variable included environmental dynamics such as cooperative, individualized and unbiased instruction. The study also revealed that professors who successfully influenced learning utilized a multitude of teaching techniques, and these professors also utilized a strong teaching philosophy and were described by their students as possessing strong characteristics which included being caring and compassionate. ^ Furthermore, the study revealed apparent limitations in the ability to further influence learning at the PWIs studied. These limitations included a lack of good assessment planning, learning style testing, faculty instruction development, and enhanced student faculty interaction. Based on the implications presented in the study, positive influences in learning may result in improved performance, retention and graduation rates of all students—not just African American students. The conclusion expanded on the existing body of knowledge by indicating that African American students—when given a fair and equitable environment—need no special treatment to be successful at Predominately White Institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinically useful {{treatment}} moderators of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) {{have not}} yet been identified, though some baseline predictors of treatment outcome have been proposed. The aim of iSPOT-D is to identify pretreatment measures that predict or moderate MDD treatment response or remission to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine; and develop a model that incorporates multiple predictors and moderators. Methods/Design: The International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment - in Depression (iSPOT-D) is a multi-centre, international, randomized, prospective, open-label trial. It is enrolling 2016 MDD outpatients (ages 18 - 65) from primary or specialty care practices (672 per treatment arm; 672 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls). Study-eligible patients are antidepressant medication (ADM) naïve or willing to undergo a one-week wash-out of any non-protocol ADM, and cannot have had an inadequate response to protocol ADM. Baseline assessments include symptoms; distress; daily function; cognitive performance; electroencephalogram and event-related potentials; heart rate and genetic measures. A subset of these baseline assessments are repeated after eight weeks of treatment. Outcomes include the 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (primary) and self-reported depressive symptoms, social functioning, quality of life, emotional regulation, and side-effect burden (<b>secondary).</b> <b>Participants</b> may then enter a naturalistic telephone follow-up at weeks 12, 16, 24 and 52. The first half of the sample will be used to identify potential predictors and moderators, and the second half to replicate and confirm. Discussion: First enrolment was in December 2008, and is ongoing. iSPOT-D evaluates clinical and biological predictors of treatment response in the largest known sample of MDD collected worldwide.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Teachers {{are unique}} when {{compared}} to most other professionals, as pre-service teachers spend {{more than a decade}} observing teachers in practice before entering their own professional training. This study investigated teacher candidates at the earliest point of their teacher training, entry into a teacher certification program, at the University of Sydney and University of Auckland in 2005. Specifically, this study sought to address how prior experiences informed the teacher role identity of male primary, female secondary and non-traditional student teachers. These three teacher candidate groups emerged from a previous study (Sexton, 2002) which explored post-graduate teacher candidates’ beliefs with the most vivid and articulate prior experiences. The study used a mixed-model research design to explore the research question, How do pre-service teacher candidates interpret prior teacher experiences as to the type of teacher they do and do not want to become? 354 entry-level teacher candidates were surveyed using both closed item and open-ended responses. From these participants, 35 were then interviewed before their course commencement and then again after their first teaching practicum. The study showed that there were differences as to how prior teachers informed the teacher role identity of entry-level student teachers. Male primary candidates were more influenced by their positive primary experiences of role model teachers. Female <b>secondary</b> <b>participants</b> remembered those <b>secondary</b> teachers who encouraged the development of critical thinking and they now wish to emulate this in their practice. Non-traditional student teachers remembered a wider range of educational experiences and entered into their teaching program {{to make a difference in}} both their and their students’ lives. The study highlights how in-service teachers play an important role in not only who will become teachers but also what subjects and school level future teachers will teach...|$|R
