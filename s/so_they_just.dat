25|$|During concert pieces, timpani {{were often}} {{grounded}} momentarily, using a ti-pod leg system. Eventually around 1981, timpani and mallet instruments {{were allowed to}} be grounded in the front, paving {{the way to the}} modern day front ensemble. For a few years, corps still marched timpani. Some corps took advantage of the new rule, and grounded their timpani. However, some corps couldn't afford a new set of concert timpani, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> grounded their marching timpani.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, January 25, 2015, three platoons of {{the elite}} SAF police squad entered the guerrilla enclave of Tukanalipao, Mindanao, Philippines, {{with the goal of}} detaining two {{high-ranking}} Jemaah Islamiyah-affiliated, improvised-explosive-device experts, Zulkifli Abdhir (also known as Marwan) and Abdul Basit Usman. The SAF troops raided the hut where they believed Marwan was located, and the man they believe to be Marwan engaged them in a firefight and was killed. The SAF initially planned to take his body for identification. However, the shooting alerted the BIFF and MILF 118th Command in the area. The SAF had no time to retrieve the body <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> cut off a finger, took a photo, and left his body there. By 6:18 AM UTC+8 (PST), an SMS message was sent by the Commander of SAF 61D Battalion to SAF Director Getulio Napeñas that they were pinned down at coordinates 6.92489°N 124.52047°E. What followed was a bloody encounter that left 44 SAF, 18 MILF, and 5 BIFF dead.|$|E
500|$|Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "seems like two story {{fragments}} combined into one; it’s like the writers couldn’t flesh out either tale for an entire 22 minutes <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> stuck two half-programs together."Blu-Ray] (2001) |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 16, 2011|last=Jacobson |first=Colin |publisher=DVD Movie Guide}} He added that it still [...] "manages some laughs", and also argued that the episode was {{very similar to the}} season 1 episode [...] "There's No Disgrace Like Home", which was also noted by Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk.

500|$|In April 1987, Bakshi set up {{a meeting}} with Judy Price, the head of CBS's Saturday morning block. Three days before the meeting, Bakshi, Kricfalusi, Naylor, Tom Minton, Eddie Fitzgerald and Jim Reardon met to brainstorm. Bakshi remembers, [...] "My car was packed to the windows. Judy was my last stop before driving cross country back to New York to my family." [...] Price {{rejected}} Bakshi's prepared pitches, but asked what else he had. He told her that he had the rights to Mighty Mouse, and she agreed to purchase the series. However, Bakshi did not own the rights and did not know who did. While researching the rights, he learned that CBS had acquired the entire Terrytoons library in 1955 and forgotten about it. According to Bakshi, [...] "I sold them a show they already owned, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> gave me the rights for nothin'!" ...|$|E
500|$|Based {{upon their}} findings, {{and despite the}} expense and their {{intention}} to air [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for test groups of kids. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E

Summarizing his 2011-2013 Maclean's experience during a discussion on an October 2016 Canadaland podcast, Brown said: [...] "They had an in-house distinction — a caste system if you will — with magazine writers on one hand getting paid a certain wage and web bloggers on the other getting a contract wage that's a quarter of that.

2500|$|The third {{representative}} {{match was}} {{played at the}} Oval. Australia won the toss, went into bat, and despite losing Bannerman early on for 4, made 551. Ideally, {{they would not have}} spent so much time batting, as it gave them less time to bowl England out twice to level the series. But the laws of cricket in did not permit declarations until 1889, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> piled on runs. Billy Murdoch scored Test cricket's first double century (211 in total), and Percy McDonnell and Henry Scott also made centuries. England's best bowler in the innings was Lyttelton with 4 for 19. Lyttelton was the wicket-keeper (Read and Grace kept wicket when Lyttelton bowled), with all 11 Englishmen getting a bowl, which was the first time this has happened in a Test match. England struggled to 181 for 8 in reply. At which point, Walter Read, who was furious at being sent in as low as number 10, thrashed 117 off 155 balls in 113 minutes as England recovered to 346. The follow-on was enforced as a matter of routine, but England only got to 85 for 2 in the 26 overs of play that remained before the game ended as a draw. England had won the series 1–0.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur is stunned, but {{continues}} {{trying to}} force Merlin to kill Mary Margaret, pushing Merlin to the limit, but the distraction gives Hook time to free himself and come at Arthur. After a brief scuffle, Hook knocks the sword away from Arthur and keeps him from grabbing it. Arthur runs off and releases Zelena, who teleports both of them away. Emma thanks Hook and heals a cut on his neck from Excalibur. He says that now they have the sword, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> need to light the spark, and then {{they can get the}} darkness out of Emma. Back at Granny’s, Hook recounts the adventure to Henry, who is excited. David and Regina report back that Arthur has retreated far away and Emma is outside with the spark, trying to make it work. Regina comes out and she tells her that Rumplestiltskin's manifestation is playing with her, telling her she can’t light it because she’s not ready to give up the darkness, since she is still lured by it, even though she knows that it’s wrong. Regina grabs the dagger and commands Emma to tell her why she’s afraid to give up the darkness. Emma says that she can’t protect her family if she does. Regina says that’s not the truth, that it's only [...] "a wall," [...] and uses the dagger to continue probing her, trying to get her to admit the truth. Hook, David, and Mary Margaret come up, and Hook snatches the dagger from Regina, thinking that she's worsening the situation, while Emma storms off with the Dagger and the spark. Regina responds by telling them that she wasn’t being cruel; she was trying to help her find the truth, even it is painful.|$|E
