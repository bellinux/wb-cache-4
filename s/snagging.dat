5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe. In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe.

5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in <b>snagging</b> the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum.|$|E
30|$|<b>Snags</b> {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} pines (45 %) and Douglas-firs (41 %) (Table 1). <b>Snag</b> densities ranged from 0 <b>snags</b> ha− 1 to 713 <b>snags</b> ha− 1, averaging 35 ha− 1.

40|$|A 14 -year {{study of}} <b>snag</b> {{characteristics}} {{was established in}} 41 - to 44 -year old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands in southeastern USA. During the initial 5. 5 years, no stand manipulation or unusually high-mortality events occurred. Afterwards, three treatments were applied consisting of trees thinned and removed, trees felled and not removed, and artificial creation of <b>snags</b> produced by girdling and herbicide injection. The thinned treatments were designed to maintain the same live canopy density as the snag-created treatment, disregarding <b>snags</b> that remained standing. We monitored <b>snag</b> height, diameter, density, volume, and bark percentage; the number of cavities was monitored in natural <b>snags</b> only. During the first 5. 5 years, recruitment and loss rates were stable, resulting in a stable <b>snag</b> population. Large <b>snags</b> (≥ 25 cm diameter) were common, but subcanopy small <b>snags</b> (10 to < 25 cm diameter) dominated numerically. Large natural <b>snags</b> survived (90 % quantile) significantly longer (6. 0 – 9. 4 years) than smaller <b>snags</b> (4. 4 – 6. 9 years). Large artificial <b>snags</b> persisted the longest (11. 8 years). Cavities in natural <b>snags</b> developed within 3 years following tree death. The mean number of cavities per <b>snag</b> was five times greater in large versus small <b>snags</b> and large <b>snags</b> {{were more likely to}} have multiple cavities, emphasizing the importance of mature pine stands for cavity-dependent wildlife species...|$|R

In addition to the right-censoring, several <b>snags</b> had years in which they were not measured. If these <b>snags</b> were standing before the missed observation, but down at the next observation, the censoring was assumed to be non-informative and those <b>snags</b> were considered to be standing for the missing years. This is the standard protocol for such interval censoring (Kleinbaum and Klein 2010).|$|R

5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of <b>snagging</b> on the environment.|$|E
40|$|Standing {{dead trees}} (hereafter <b>snags)</b> are a {{valuable}} component of forest systems, comprising habitat for wildlife, nursery sites for forest regeneration, and as stores of biomass, nutrients, and carbon.

40|$|<b>Snags</b> (standing dead trees) provide {{important}} habitat for forest wildlife, {{as well as}} a source of coarse woody debris important in forest succession. Because of their importance, some land-management agencies have standards for <b>snag</b> retention on lands under their jurisdiction (e. g. U. S. Forest Service, British Columbia Ministry of Forestry). Despite these guidelines, however, little information is typically available on <b>snag</b> numbers or dynamics on these lands. As part of a long-term effort to monitor <b>snag</b> dynamics, <b>snag</b> populations were sampled on 114 1 -ha plots randomly located across six Ranger Districts on two National Forests in northern Arizona. Sixty plots were located in ponderosa pine forest, with the remainder in mixed-conifer forest. Small <b>snags</b> and <b>snags</b> in later decay classes numerically dominated <b>snag</b> populations. Because large <b>snags</b> are most useful to forest wildlife, this suggests a need to retain large trees as future <b>snags.</b> Only 6. 7 and 16. 7 % of plots in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest, respectively, met or exceeded current U. S. Forest Service standards for retention of large <b>snags</b> (de®ned as <b>snags</b> 46 cm in diameter at breast height and 9 m in height) in this geographic region. Even plots with no evidence of timber or fuelwood harvest seldom met targets for retention of large <b>snags,</b> however. Only 30 and 32 % of unlogged plots met or exceeded standards in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest, respectively. This suggests that current standards for <b>snag</b> retention may be unrealistic, and that those standards may need to be reconsidered. <b>Snag</b> guidelines should be based on an understanding of both, <b>snag</b> dynamics and the requirements of snag-dependent wildlife species. # 199...|$|R

5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid <b>snagging</b> on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid <b>snagging</b> the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

30|$|<b>Snags</b> and downed logs are {{essential}} to forest ecosystems, providing numerous ecosystem benefits, but also contributing to fuel loading (Dunn and Bailey 2015). This study provides post-fire <b>snag</b> persistence information for five conifer species to aid land managers in meeting snag-related forest objectives. <b>Snag</b> age and DBH were the strongest predictors of fire-killed <b>snag</b> persistence. For all species, smaller-diameter <b>snags</b> fell more quickly than larger <b>snags,</b> with white fir and sugar pine <b>snags</b> over 50  cm DBH and yellow pine over 90  cm DBH predicted to persist much longer than smaller <b>snags.</b> Incense-cedar <b>snags</b> were fairly stable, {{but they are not}} as widely used by wildlife as the other species studied (Thomas 1979; Morrison et al. 1987; Bagne et al. 2008) and therefore may not be the preferred tree species for <b>snag</b> retention for wildlife objectives in a post-fire management scenario. However, incense-cedar could be useful for other objectives such as carbon storage. White fir and sugar pine <b>snags</b> both persisted for an extended time on the landscape and are moderately used by wildlife (Thomas 1979; Morrison et al. 1987; Ganey and Vojta 2004; Bagne et al. 2008). Although yellow pine <b>snags</b> are widely used by wildlife, virtually all yellow pine fell within 10  years of dying. In addition, we found FFE-FVS greatly over-predicted yellow pine fire-killed <b>snag</b> persistence and recommend revising the equations in the software to reflect the consistently reported finding of fast fall rates in yellow pine. <b>Snags</b> and logs provide numerous ecosystem benefits (e.g., wildlife habitat, nutrient cycling, germination microsites), but also can potentially increase future fire severity. Our results can be used to inform post-fire <b>snag</b> management considerations.|$|R

Mean <b>snag</b> density was 28. 4 snags/ha and mean <b>snag</b> diameter (DBH) and height were 20. 3 cm and 9. 9 m, respectively. Highest <b>snag</b> densities occurred in hardwood stand types; pine plantations had lower (p 0. 05) <b>snag</b> density than all other types. Within a particular stand type, <b>snag</b> densities, recruitment rates, and loss rates generally were lowest in the oldest age classes.

Young pine plantations had the lowest recruitment rate (x 1. 79 snags/ha/year) and old pine plantations had the lowest loss rate (x 1. 59 snags/ha/year) of all the stand type–age class combinations. Although twenty species of <b>snags</b> were observed, five species/species groups, shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), red oaks (Quercus spp.), white oaks (Quercus spp.), loblolly pine (P. taeda), and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), occurred most frequently. <b>Snag</b> DBH and cavities/snag were not significantly correlated.

The density of dominant and codominant <b>snags</b> did not differ by aspect or slope categories, but the density of intermediate and suppressed <b>snags</b> was highest on steep south-facing slopes. <b>Snag</b> densities were lowest in stand initiation and open stem exclusion structural stages. More study {{is needed to determine}} if fire history data combined with aerial photo interpretation offer a potential method of estimating <b>snag</b> densities in subalpine forestsFlanagan et al "Snag recruitment in subalpine forests.

40|$|<b>Snags</b> are {{important}} components of wildlife habitat, providing nesting and feeding sites for over 75 species {{of animals in}} the southwestern United States. Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of <b>snags</b> to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating <b>snags.</b> Our objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed <b>snags</b> in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona and predict the probability of <b>snag</b> use by cavity nesters. We established six 1 -ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 [H 96] and Pumpkin fire of 2000 [P 00]) to determine ponderosa pine <b>snag</b> availability and use by wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison, six paired 1 -ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and measuring 15 characteristics for 668 <b>snags</b> (630 in burned and 38 in unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H 96 fire, and 1010 <b>snags</b> (996 in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the P 00 fire. We remeasured characteristics of all <b>snags</b> in 2003. Most burned <b>snags</b> were standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41 % had fallen. <b>Snags</b> in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and remeasured. After 7 years, <b>snags</b> in burned plots that were still standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3. 0 ha 1) and unburned (2. 2 ha 1) plots, even though burned areas producedmuch higher densities of <b>snags.</b> <b>Snags</b> (both burned and unburned) that {{were most likely to}} contain excavated cavities were large diameter with broken tops.
