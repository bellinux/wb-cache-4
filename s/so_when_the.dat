5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst, Gelderland, growing up on a family farm with his parents and {{assisting}} his grandfather with the potato harvest each year. There were no machines or tractors, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> time came to extract the potatoes, his family tied a rope around Overmars' waist, connected it to a cart and made him run while they pulled the crop out.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{originally}} planned {{to produce the}} film in 1931 and sent cinematographers Ernest B. Schoedsack and Rex Wimpy to India to film location shots such as a tiger hunt. However, much of the film stock deteriorated {{in the hot sun}} while on location, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> film was eventually made, much of the production took place in the hills surrounding Los Angeles, where Paiute Native Americans were used as extras.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Alfonsín {{refused to}} foster {{diplomatic}} relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use of nuclear power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common market. This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the ships}} sailed into port at Canton, they alarmed the Chinese {{residents}} and officials there by discharging cannon fire, {{what they believed}} was a friendly salute since the Chinese merchants had done <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese earlier arrived in Malacca. Chinese officials became even more cautious {{in dealing with the}} Portuguese, since the deposed King of Malacca had been a loyal tributary to the imperial Ming court. The Portuguese explained that in deposing the Malaccan king, they were helping the Chinese merchants there who were being oppressed under his rule. In the eyes of the Canton officials, this added further negative speculations about the Portuguese visitors, because private Chinese overseas trade was banned under the current hai jin laws that stated only the Chinese government could conduct foreign trade.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario Land was {{developed}} by Nintendo R and published by Nintendo in 1989 as a launch title for their Game Boy handheld console. Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi believed that fun games sold consoles, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> company created the Game Boy handheld console, he wanted a fun game that would feature Nintendo's mascot, Mario, and subsequently sell consoles. The job fell to Nintendo R, a development team led by Game Boy inventor Gunpei Yokoi. Yokoi had previously created the Game & Watch series and worked with his protégé, Shigeru Miyamoto, on the game that invented Mario, Donkey Kong. Super Mario Land was the fourth Super Mario title, the first portable Mario game, and {{the first in the}} series to be made without Miyamoto.|$|E

5|$|The Blackhawks, {{known as}} the Black Hawks from their {{inception}} until 1986, have won the Stanley Cup six times in their 83-year history. Charlie Gardiner, the team's goaltender for its first Stanley Cup win in 1934, became the first European-born captain—and still the only goaltender captain—to win the Stanley Cup. Johnny Gottselig became the second European-born captain to do <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> team won its second championship in 1938. Stan Mikita is the franchise leader in assists (926) and points (1467), and Bobby Hull is the leader in goals (604). Chris Chelios is the franchise leader in penalty minutes (1495). Goaltender Tony Esposito is the club's all-time leader in wins (873) and shutouts (74).|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the five}} spans {{of the current}} bridge are far wider than the {{nineteen}} spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge's location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the MV Delta jammed under the bridge, and its master Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms {{and needed to be}} rescued from the smashed wheelhouse. On 23 March 1950, the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005, when the James Prior, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the James Prior, was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008, when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle {{beyond the bounds of}} the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the {{division}} comprised the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade, both consisting of parachute infantry, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade, composed of glider infantry. However the 5th Parachute Brigade {{had been sent}} to] India ahead {{of the rest of}} {{the division}}. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength. In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6thAirlanding Brigade. In August1946, the 5thParachute Brigade returned from the Far East, and joined the division, but was disbanded soon afterwards. The next major manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rdParachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2ndParachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E

Wagram and the God-Emperor are supporting him in his quest to destroy the people of the world, who are misusing Remnants and destroying the balance of the world.|$|E

5|$|In 1525 Dudley married Guildford's {{daughter}} Jane, who {{was four}} years his junior and his former classmate. The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s, and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science. Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will. His only son having predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, asserted that his uncle had intended him to inherit. Dudley and his wife contested this claim. The parties went to court and Dudley, who had secured Thomas Cromwell's patronage, won the case. In 1532 he lent his cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, over ₤7,000 on {{the security of the}} baronial estate. Lord Dudley was unable to pay off any of his creditors, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> mortgage was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) is the Fury 161 {{preacher and}} {{chaplain}} to the prisoners. An inmate {{with a history}} of murder and rape, he turned to God while incarcerated. Dillon {{is one of the few}} prisoners to whom Ripley speaks after her arrival; he asks if she has faith, and says that his men have faith enough to accept anyone. He delivers an eloquent eulogy during Newt and Hicks' funeral which touches Ripley. When prisoners try to rape her, Dillon bashes them with a crowbar. Ripley asks Dillon to kill her and the gestating Alien inside her, and he promises to do <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Alien is dead. Shortly afterwards, Dillon organizes the remaining prisoners to lure the Alien into the foundry and drown it in molten lead. When the Alien attempts to follow Ripley out of the trap, Dillon baits it; when it attacks, Ripley submerges them both in the molten lead.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opposition}} in the fourth round were Italian side Roma. The first leg was held at Roma's home ground the Stadio Olimpico, where Liverpool had won the European Cup twice in 1977 and 1984. Incidentally, Roma were the team Liverpool beat to win the European Cup in 1984. Liverpool were once again successful at the Stadio Olimpico, as they won 2–0 courtesy of two Michael Owen second half goals. The second leg at Anfield was a close affair. Roma scored in the 70th minute to take the lead, they now needed to score another goal to take the match into extra-time. They looked like they {{had the opportunity to}} do <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> referee awarded a penalty {{towards the end of the}} match after he had adjudged that Markus Babbel had handled the ball. However, moments later, he reversed his decision and instead awarded Roma a corner-kick. Roma were unable to score the necessary goal following the incident and Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals courtesy of a 2–1 aggregate victory.|$|E
