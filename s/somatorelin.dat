50|$|Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), {{also known}} as {{somatocrinin}} or by several other names in its endogenous forms and as <b>somatorelin</b> (INN) in its pharmaceutical form, is a releasing hormone of growth hormone (GH). It is a 44-amino acid peptide hormone produced in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone secretagogues (GSHs) are a {{class of}} drugs which act as secretagogues (i.e., induce the secretion) of growth hormone (GH). They include {{agonists}} of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), such as ghrelin (lenomorelin), pralmorelin (GHRP-2), GHRP-6, examorelin (hexarelin), ipamorelin, and ibutamoren (MK-677), and agonists of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (<b>somatorelin),</b> CJC-1295, sermorelin, and tesamorelin. Many also induce the secretion of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), as well as of other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as prolactin and cortisol. The main clinical application of these agents is the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. They also see black market use, similarly to anabolic steroids, for bodybuilding purposes.|$|E
