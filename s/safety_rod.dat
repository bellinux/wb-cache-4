50|$|Magog {{is finally}} {{directed}} {{to go to}} the complex's nuclear reactor control room and pull the <b>safety</b> <b>rod</b> out of the atomic pile, starting a chain reaction that will build to a nuclear explosion, which in turn will destroy the entire facility. Sheppard arrives in time to push the <b>safety</b> <b>rod</b> back into the pile, stopping the chain reaction. He then attacks the robot with a flame thrower and disables it, but Gog soon follows its twin to the reactor room to finish the job. Sheppard's flame thrower runs out of fuel as the robot advances on him. Dr. Van Ness arrives with another flame thrower, but the control valve sticks, and Gog now turns on him. Sheppard desperately begins using the nozzle of his flame thrower as a bludgeon, trying to smash the robot's electronic tubes. The now-crippled robot begins spinning back and forth, its arms thrashing about wildly. At that point, Gog suddenly comes to a halt, its metal arms falling limply to its sides. American F-86 and F-94 jet fighters have found and destroyed the enemy plane, ending NOVAC's reign of destruction. Van Ness then realizes that Sheppard and Merritt have been exposed to an overdose of radiation from the reactor. Sheppard takes Merritt (who has fainted as a result of all the stress she has experienced) into his arms and they head for the complex hospital, where it is determined that their exposure, while causing their film badges to turn red, was not serious, and that they will both soon recover.|$|E

The nomenclature was used to indicate that this series consisted of High Temperature Reactor experiments performed in the PROTEUS assembly. During this period, seventeen critical configurations were assembled and various reactor physics experiments were conducted. These experiments included measurements of criticality, differential and integral control rod and <b>safety</b> <b>rod</b> worths, kinetics, reaction rates, water ingress effects, and small sample reactivity effects (Ref. 3).

Conventionally active techniques such as pulsed thermal imaging have been employed. This paper highlights the successful application of lock-in thermography for characterization of colmonoy coatings. The main advantage of lock in technique is that it is unaffected by emissivity variations and also defect depth can be estimated. A Silver- 420 system with pulsed and lock in thermography was used for the study. A sinusoidal signal was used and the frequency of modulation varied from 0. 05 Hz – 0. 5 Hz.

40|$|Earthquake safety {{engineering}} {{of nuclear power}} plant structures poses several challenges to the analyst and designer. These problems are characterized by highly transient and dynamic nature of earthquake induced excitations, random nature of details of support motions (in terms of duration, frequency content, amplitude modulation, multiple components, and spatial variability), nonlinear nature of structural behavior, geometrical complexity of the primary {{and a large number}} of secondary systems (such as, for example, piping, rotors, and machine panels), soil-structure interactions, demands on high level of safety expected of these structures, and general paucity of recorded data on strong ground motions appropriate for the given site. Probabilistic methods offer the most rational framework to base design decisions for this class of problems. The work reported in the present thesis belongs to this broad area of research. We focus attention on studying two classes of nuclear power plant components, namely, a pipework in the heat exchanger segment, and, control and <b>safety</b> <b>rod</b> drive mechanism (CSRDM) and investigate their performance by taking into account complicating features such as differential seismic support motions across multiple supports, nonlinearities at support locations, random nature of dynamic loads and uncertainties in system parameters. Response measures include peak responses, reliability against specified performance criterion, measures of uncertainties in response variables of interest. Chapter- 1 provides the functional details of nuclear power plant structures that includes reactor assembly and heat transport system assembly, CSRDM, heat transfer piping networks, and nonlinear supporting devices (such as rod, spring, guide supports, limiters, and snubbers). The discussion brings out the structural mechanics issues that need attention while analyzing seismic response of some of these components. Chapter- 2 provides a brief review of literature covering the following topics: Monte Carlo simulation based methods for static and dynamic reliability analysis problems, digital simulation of random variables and processes, treatment of non-Gaussianity in simulations, strategies for variance reduction, models for uncertainty in response using limited samples, data based extreme value analysis, studies on multi-supported piping networks under differential seismic inputs and seismic performance of CRDM structures. The study identifies specific issues related to numerical simulation of nonlinear dynamic response of multisupported pipeworks to differential seismic inputs, uncertainty propagation and reliability modeling in seismic response of pipeworks and CSRDM using Monte Carlo simulations with variance reduction, data based extreme value analysis, and uncertainty propagation using limited samples as topics requiring further research. The problems of numerical simulation of nonlinear multisupported piping systems subjected to differential seismic support motions and drop time characterization of CSRDM structure during a seismic event are considered in Chapter- 3. It is noted that commercially available professional finite element analysis (FEA) softwares do not offer a direct means to tackle this class of problems. On the other hand, FEA packages are best suited to produce acceptable FE models which take into account the geometrical complexities of the structures. Thus, the reasonable way to move forward would be to develop external interfaces that take advantage of FE modeling capabilities of professional packages {{and at the same time}} enable treatment of complexities associated with differential support motions, nonlinearities and axial rigid motions of subsystems as in CSRDM. The work reported in Chapter- 3 describes the efforts expended in achieving this objective. Here the given built-up structure is divided in to a set of linear substructures each of which are modeled using FE analysis procedures. The proposed scheme allows for these FE models to reside in professional FE analysis codes. An iterative time domain scheme for modeling the interaction forces between these substructures is discussed. The set of governing equations of motion are developed in terms of normal modes of substructures in their uncoupled states. A suite of benchmark problems are first employed to validate the procedure developed. Subsequently, the earthquake induced dynamic response of CSRDM structure and the pipeline running between IHX and secondary sodium pump in a typical fast breeder reactor is simulated. The algorithm for simulation of dynamic response of CSRDM and multi-supported pipelines under differential support motions developed in Chapter- 3 is employed in Chapter- 4 to investigate the questions concerning influence of uncertainties in specifying the loads and the system parameters on the system response. Specifically, the study focuses on quantifying uncertainty in system response characteristics based on limited number of Monte Carlo simulations of the response. For this purpose we draw upon an earlier work by Wilks which specifies the number of samples needed to estimate γ th percentile point of a random variable with β level of confidence. We explore in this Chapter, the application of this idea in the analysis of nonlinear, randomly parametered, dynamical systems under stochastic excitations. In Chapter- 5 we turn our attention to the modeling of aseismic reliability of the nonlinear pipework under differential support motions and the CSRDM structure. The performance functions considered for the piping structure are in terms of highest displacements and stresses over a specified time durations while for CSRDM, the performance function is in terms of scram time being less than a specified time duration. We tackle the first problem by using theory of data based extreme value analysis while the second problem is addressed using an adaptive importance sampling strategy. The contributions here pertain to the exploration of data based extreme values analysis as applied to an industrial scale structure and improvisation of algorithmic modifications in the development of adaptive importance sampling density functions. This improvisation consists of selection of sampling points as a judicious mix of points from both safe and unsafe regions. This is shown to reduce the strong correlations that otherwise would be present if samples are taken only from the unsafe region. These studies demonstrate how Monte Carlo simulations with limited samples can be utilized to draw useful conclusions on structural reliability.

A forward-facing heat pipe radiator assembly extends from the reactor head {{in the shape of}} a frustum of a cone on the opposite side of the power system from the payload. Important virtues of the concept are the absence of any single-point failures and the ability of the core to effectively transfer the TFE waste heat load laterally to other in-core heat transfer assemblies in the event of multiple failures in either in-core and radiator heat pipes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo fulfill {{safety of}} fast sodium {{reactors}} in a beyond design-basis accident (BDBA) like unprotected loss of flow accident (ULOF), the sodium void reactivity effect (SVRE) should {{be close to}} zero. Its value depends on the fuel burnup – the higher burnup the higher value of SVRE. We analyze limitation of the fuel burnup {{in the core of}} a large sodium reactor imposed by SVRE. The model of a large sodium-cooled reactor core is chosen for analysis. Two fuel types are considered – MOX and nitride uranium-plutonium. For both we follow the transition of the core from reactor startup to equilibrium reloading state, where the core passes consequently through different stages of fuel burnup. Calculations of maximal and average burnup together with corresponding value of SVRE have been done for a homogeneous model with the codes TRIGEX and MMKKENO. The latter employs transport approximation (the Monte Carlo method) and allows detailed heterogeneous representation of fuel assemblies and <b>safety</b> <b>rods.</b> The results obtained for the MOX fuel show that after the end of second core cycle (maximal burnup about 8 %) the refined value of SVRE exceeds two times its maximal acceptable value (0. 3 % Δk/k). For the nitride fuel this exceeds is found at the end of 3 rd fuel reshuffling (maximal burnup is about 8. 75 %); however it is considerably lower as compared to that found for MOX...|$|R
40|$|In Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) {{there are}} 3 Diverse <b>Safety</b> <b>Rods</b> (DSR) in {{addition}} to normal control rods {{to shut down the}} reactor. During a reactor SCRAM, electromagnet holding the DSR gets de-energized and DSR falls under gravity into the reactor core {{and at the end of}} the free fall, it is decelerated by a sodium dashpot and it is brought to rest. Development of a system for measuring free fall time and total travel time of DSR using acoustic technique is in progress. The free fall time is the time elapsed between the instant at which the electromagnet de-energizes and the instant at which dashpot action initiated. At the end of free fall DSR hit top end of the dashpot and will generate a shock signal. Similarly at the end of braking (deceleration) time another shock pulse is generated. By measuring the time delays between the step transition of electromagnet signal and the above shock signals, free fall and braking times can be estimated. The summation of free fall time and braking time will give the total drop time of DSR. Feasibility of using 7. 5 m long SS wave guide with high frequency accelerometer mounted on top of it, to measure the shock pulse produced was studied during the performance testing of DSR drive mechanism in a sodium test facility.
