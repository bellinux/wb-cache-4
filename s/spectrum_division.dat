The adaptive subcarrier allocation has a tradeoff between the channel capacity and the peak-toaverage power ratio (PAPR).

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{subcarrier}} multiplexing/optical <b>spectrum</b> code <b>division</b> multiplexing (SCM/OSCDM) {{system for the}} purpose of combining the advantages of both techniques. Optical <b>spectrum</b> code <b>division</b> multiple access (OSCDMA) is one of the multiplexing techniques that is becoming popular because of the flexibility in the allocation of channels, ability to operate asynchronously, enhanced privacy and increased capacity in bursty nature networks. On the other hand, subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) technique is able to enhance the channel data rate of OSCDMA systems. The system utilizes a new unified code construction named KS (Khazani-Syed) code based on the Double Weight (DW) and Modified Double Weight (MDW) codes. This paper also presents a new detection technique called Spectral Direct Decoding (SDD) detection technique for the OSCDM. SDD is effective in rejecting the unwanted signals that interfere with the wanted signals. This results in reduced receiver complexity and improved the performance of the hybrid system significantly.

40|$|International audienceTo {{improve the}} radio {{spectrum}} utilization, cognitive radio (CR) technology, which can dynamically use frequency bands detected as free, has been proposed. To provide this detection with sufficiently {{security for the}} licensed primary user (PU) and without a loss of CR capacity, spectrum sensing is a fundamental requirement in CR. Also, if this spectrum sensing is addressed for wide-band, a current idea is to distribute it among all CRs in the network by dividing the wideband sensing into several sub-bands sensing. However, this physical <b>spectrum</b> <b>division</b> can be too wide to detect narrow band PU. In this paper, we propose to analyse digitally these sub-bands by using a numerical fast Fourier transform (FFT). This analysisis then made, in each sub-sub-bands, by a double threshold energy detection method. For a targeted probability of PU detection, simulation results show the possibilities of the proposed system when a multi-optimization problem is addressed...|$|E

In the proposed scheme, the water-filling strategy is modified to clip more spectrum components with lower signal to noise power ratio, and transmit power allocated to the clipped spectrum components are evenly distributed to the non-clipped components thereby concentrates transmit power on spectrum with higher channel gain. Furthermore, the proposed spectrum shaping technique is applied to user multiplexing in the frequency domain with higher spectral efficiency. Computer simulation including extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis confirms that the proposed scheme is effective in enhancement of spectral efficiency with low power penalty. I...|$|E

40|$|Cooperation in {{wireless}} networks is {{an important}} means to improve the resource utilization efficiency. It finds an interesting application {{in the context of}} spectrum sharing, where multiple wireless users put their licensed frequency bands in common in order to achieve a better resource usage. Due to the complexity of the problem, mathematical analysis is typically focused on simple scenarios. However, we believe that, in order to obtain a concrete proof of concept of the sharing paradigm, it is mandatory to assess its performance in realistic situations, i. e., with a larger number of nodes and a wider range of applications. Therefore, the support of a proper simulation environment is fundamental for high-quality applied research. In this paper we present and evaluate an original extension of the well known ns- 3 network simulator which focuses on multiple operators of the most up-to-date cellular scenarios, i. e., the Long Term Evolution of UMTS employing OFDMA multiplexing. We describe the software architecture that enables the spectrum sharing and, in particular, allows operators to interact in order to agree on a <b>spectrum</b> <b>division.</b> A sample sharing policy is given as well, and a detailed simulation campaign is run to validate the proposed architecture, assess its efficiency, and evaluate the simulation time related to scenarios with an increasing number of nodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{utilization of}} the solar spectrum has been intensively addressed by solar researchers in the last decades. For instance, many efforts {{have been made to}} improve the efficiency of PV cells and to allow their operation at high temperatures and concentration ratios (CR). On the other hand, solar thermal collectors are generally mature technologies which can be selected according to the outlet temperature required. The study of hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors using beam splitting has gained particular interest since the photovoltaic cells can be thermally decoupled from the thermal receiver allowing operation at signficantly different temperatures; in addition, the PV receiver is illuminated only with the region of the solar spectrum that matches well with its spectral response curve. In this work, a general methodology for the determination of the optimal spectral splitting parameters in hybrid PV/T collectors is presented. The method is applied in the design of a novel PV/T collector which is also modeled in detail using the ray tracing software Zemax 12. The optimal wavelengths for the <b>spectrum</b> <b>division</b> in this collector correspond to 732 and 1067 nm, which represents the region of the spectrum that should be directed to the PV cells. Moreover, the method indicates that under this particular partition, 47 % more power can be delivered from the collector in relation to a concentrating PV stand-alone system under the same CR. The design of the beam splitting devices was addressed by using SiNx and SiO 2 as high and low refractive index materials respectively, in a multilayer thin ﬁlm ﬁlter proﬁle that was included in the ray tracing model. Finally, the ray tracing model suggests that the optical efﬁciency of the collector is approximately 65 % in real operational scenarios and that the concentrated light can be successfully split independently of the light angle of incidence...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional (2 -D) digital filters {{have been}} widely applied in {{different}} fields including image processing, recognition systems and tomography. In most cases, 2 -D filters are separable and their specifications are inherited from those of two one dimensional filters. However, separable filters are mainly used for rectangular <b>spectrum</b> <b>division,</b> while non-separable filters are suitable for division of other spectrum shapes such as diamonds, circles and ellipses. Nonseparable filter design problems are in general challenging, as there are {{a large number of}} parameters that need to be optimised. Typical methods of non-separable filter design have been covered in the prior literature, such as the window method, frequency transforms, and nonuniform discrete Fourier transforms. However, the difficulties of these methods lie in their inability to incorporate further constraints on the filters, such as flatness constraints. Recently, semi-definite programming (SDP) based filter design methods have been of great interest in the research because a large class of filter designs can be cast into SDP problems which can be efficiently solved by available SDP tools. This thesis focuses on several classes of 2 -D non-separable filters of different shapes. The advantage of the proposed method is that it meets the following criteria: it has low complexity and a reduced number of variables, and it offers precise in shapes and fast implementation. The objectives of the designs are to identify the filter coefficients such that the filter shapes satisfy the spectral frequency masks. These mask constraints are known as semi-infinite (SI) constraints and, the difficulties associated with them relate to how to efficiently handle them. The method presented in this thesis is to exploit the LMI characterisations of trigonometric polynomials to parameterise the SI constraints. First, a domain is described by the positivity of first- or second-order trigonometric polynomials. Using the Chebyshev recursion, the moment matrices are efficiently built. As a result, a generalisation of the trigonometric Markov-Lukacs theorem is introduced as a sufficient condition for the LMI characterisation of the SI constraints of 2 -D four-fold filters. Second, the convex duality of the equivalent SDP formulation of the reduced dimension is also exploited. Third, a new interpolation methodology using second-order trigonometric polynomials is introduced for the approximation of diamond, circle, and ellipse shapes. Finally, the designed filters offer fast digital implementation...|$|E
