40|$|As {{the pace}} of {{emergence}} and reemergence of infectious diseases quickens, the International Health Regulations, which have served as the legal and policy framework of epidemic control for 45 years, are being revised by the World Health Organization (WHO).

This review indicates that revision efforts should address 1) the limited scope of disease syndromes (and reporters of these syndromes) now in the regulations and 2) the mismatch between multisectoral factors causing disease emergence and the single agency (WHO) administering the regulations. The revised regulations should expand the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> and simultaneously broaden international agency coordination. The Division of Emerging and Other Communicabl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Reporting bias – the media’s {{tendency}} to systematically under-report or over-report {{certain types of}} events – is a persistent problem for participants and observers of armed conflict. We argue {{that the nature of}} reporting bias depends on how news organizations navigate the political context in which they are based. Where government pressure on the media is limited – in democratic regimes – the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> should reflect conventional media preferences toward novel, large-scale, dramatic developments that challenge the conventional wisdom and highlight the unsustainability of the status quo. Where political constraints on re-porting are more onerous – in non-democratic regimes – the scope of coverage will be driven by the conservative preferences of the state, emphasizing the legitimacy and inevitability of the prevailing order. We test these propositions using new data on protest and political violence during the 2011 Libyan uprising and daily news-paper coverage of the Arab Spring from 106 countries. We uncover evidence of a status-quo (i. e. pro-Qaddafi) media bias in non-democratic states, and a revisionist (i. e. pro-rebel) bias in democratic ones. Media coverage in non-democratic states under-reported protests and other non-violent collective action by regime oppo-nents, largely ignored government atrocities, and over-reported those caused by rebels. We find the opposite patterns in democratic states...|$|E
40|$|Australia has {{recently}} introduced {{what is known}} as country-by-country (CbC) reporting. CbC reporting will require certain multinationals to provide reports to the Australian Tax Office outlining their global financial activities.

40|$|In these {{circumstances}} {{it is perhaps}} not a surprise to find `environmental ’ matters recognised in financial accounting (e. g. through liabilities and risk); manage-ment accounting (e. g. through environmental manage-ment systems, win-win situations and capital investment methods); finance (in, for example, socially responsible investment) and audit (risk assessment and new forms of assurance, for example) {{as well as in}} the wider <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> and (as we shall see) newer emergent fields. As a recognised field of academic endeavour, en-vironmental accounting probably emerged somewhere around 1990 and has grown exponentially ever since. In 1995, I wrote (Gray, 1995) that the purposes of (social and) environmental accounting were: • the examination of the [social and environmen-tal] effects of current accounting practice and how they arise; • the investigation of how some of the adverse ef-fects of current practice might be ameliorated; and • the study of other possible ways of providing ac-counts of organisational activity. This was intended as an agenda for engagement with accounting and as a basis for the obvious need for change in accounting, accountability and organisational activ-ity. It is sobering to note that if one were to categorise academic research of the last 25 years I suspect that a relatively small amount of it would fall into any of thes...|$|E
40|$|Corporate Environmental Reporting is an {{environmental}} management practice that is gaining momentum internationally, and in New Zealand. In this study, four leading New Zealand Corporate Environmental Reports were compared on content, and disclosure, {{and it was}} found that the level of reporting was low, with the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> content very narrow. In comparison with international reporting surveys, the New Zealand reports compared very unfavourably; in most instances, the level of reporting in the international reports was double compared to the New Zealand reports. However, the New Zealand reports were following international trends in reporting, in terms of a high qualitative content, and limited reporting in financial and sustainable development issues. A sample of stakeholders was also surveyed on the content areas of environmental reports, and the importance that they would give to each reporting area. From the analysis, {{it was found that}} there was a large gap between the performance of the reports sampled and the expectations of the stakeholders, with some stakeholder groups indicating higher information needs than others. Through face-to-face interviews, the process that the reporting companies followed to publish their environmental report was established. This process was then compared to the narrow range of content, and to the stakeholder expectation gap found in the preceding analysis. Overall, it was concluded that the strong and pervasive environmental management legislation in New Zealand was having a considerable influence on the content of the New Zealand reports. Because of this, the practice and content of environmental reporting in New Zealand have lacked definition. Overall, it was concluded that the level of reporting from the sample of New Zealand reports was poor, and that because of the low level of reporting there was a gap between report performance and stakeholder expectations. From these conclusions it is recommended that the Government should instigate a programme defining the role and content of Corporate Environmental Reporting in New Zealand. It was also recommended that environmental reporting becomes mandatory in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a content {{analysis}} of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports published by logistics service providers (LSPs), and to analyse factors influencing the level and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting.</b> In order to address this objective, the authors show to what extent various social and environmental categories are covered in the CSR reports. The authors also investigate whether any differences in the use of CSR indicators can be found with regard to the use of a formal reporting framework, the size of a company, location of its headquarter, and ownership structure. Design/methodology/approach – The study begins with a comprehensive literature review on the CSR policies and practices in relation to the field of logistics. A database of 350 international LSPs is compiled based on independent rankings of top logistics companies. Applying a content analysis approach, corporate web sites and CSR reports are examined in order to investigate how sustainability is reported and what CSR-related indicators are published. Statistical analysis is carried out to provide insight into whether any differences in the use of CSR indicators can be found with regard to four key factors identified in the literature review. Findings – Although aspects of sustainability are mentioned on corporate web sites of most LSPs in the database (53 per cent), only 13 per cent publish formal CSR reports. This research identifies a variety of indicators used by LSPs and shows that the use of a formal reporting framework and the size of a company are the two main factors influencing the levels of CSR reporting in the sector. Practical implications – This paper provides an insight into how transparently LSPs report on the sustainability of their performance. LSPs can compare their own CSR reporting approaches to the body of scientific literature and the findings presented in this paper, in order to adapt more general concepts and best practice evidence to their needs. Social implications – By focusing on best practice in reporting of the environmental and social performance, this research can potentially improve the long-term sustainability of the logistics sector. Originality/value – This is the first study providing a comprehensive review of the CSR reporting practice in the third party logistics sector. As such, this paper provides an important basis for CSR-related research in the field of logistics and supply chain management. Several areas for future research are also identified...|$|E
