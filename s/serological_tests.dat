2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{problems}} with serological testing: in highly endemic areas, not everyone who becomes infected will actually develop clinical disease or require treatment.

[...] Conversely, because <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> look for an immune response and not for the organism itself, the test does not become negative after the patient is cured, it cannot be used as a check for cure, or to check for re-infection or relapse.

40|$|Immunoglobulin A tissue {{transglutaminase}} is {{the single}} most efficient <b>serological</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of celiac disease.

Thus, interpretation of <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> requires consideration of the full clinical scenario. Antigliadin tests are no longer recommended for the diagnosis of classical celiac disease. However, our understanding of the pathogenesis and spectrum of gluten sensitivity has improved, and gluten-sensitive irritable bowel syndrome patients are increasingly being recognized.

2500|$|HLA Naming can {{be quite}} {{confusing}} at first. All alleles start with [...] "HLA", signifying {{they are part of}} the human MHC genes. The next portion (HLA-A or HLA-B) identifies which gene the allele is a modification of. The first two numbers (HLA-A*02) signifies what antigen type that particular allele is, which typically signifies the serological antigen present. In other words, HLAs with the same antigen type (HLA-A*02:101 and HLA-A*02:102) will not react with each other in <b>serological</b> <b>tests.</b> The next set of digits (HLA-A*02:101) indicates what protein the allele codes for, and these are numbered sequentially in the order they are discovered. Any HLA that has a different number here produces a different protein (AKA has a nucleotide change that replaces an amino acid with another). The third set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101:01) indicates an allele variant that has a different DNA sequence but produces the same protein as the normal gene. The final set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101:01:01) is used to designate a single or multiple nucleotide polymorphism in a non-coding region of the gene. The final aspect of HLA naming is a letter (HLA-A*02:101:01:01L). There are six letters, each with a different meaning.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} contain a measles {{outbreak}} in a German asylum-seekers' shelter, <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> of all residents was performed, followed by selective vaccination of those with negative test results/not tested.

Three hundred (70 %) residents participated in the <b>serological</b> <b>testing,</b> of which 39 (13 %) were seronegative.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPertussis {{is mainly}} {{considered}} as a disease of childhood. However, {{an increasing number of}} adults with infection due to Bordetella pertussis is reported in the literature. MethodsA retrospective cohort study of patients with a new origin-cough of more than 3 weeks duration who were evaluated by an internal medicine–infectious diseases group practice in Athens, Greece during the period 10 / 2005 – 12 / 2007 was performed; patients underwent <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> for B. pertussis infection. ResultsFive hundred and fifty-four adult patients underwent B. pertussis <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> from whom 441 had a single IgM/IgG measurement. The percentage of seropositivity in the IgM/IgG B. pertussis <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> was 71. 5 % in the population studied (397 / 554 patients; for patients who had IgM/IgG B. pertussis <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> in more than one occasions, only the result of the first IgM/IgG measurement was taken into account for this analysis). For the subset of patients with a single IgM/IgG measurement, the percentage of seropositivity against B. pertussis was 70. 7 % (312 / 441 patients). ConclusionsB. pertussis infection should be {{considered as a}} significant pathogenic infection in a significant proportion of adult patients presenting a new origin-cough of more than 3 weeks duration.
