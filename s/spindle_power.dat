The <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> and cutting force are maintained at desired levels despite the variations in the depth of cut and the workpiece properties. A first-order discrete model is used to represent {{the relationship between the}} process output (<b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> or cutting force) and the feedrate input. By open-loop experiments, the model is validated and the process parameters of the <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> and cutting force systems are identified. The process is found to have pure time delay and can be a non-minimum phase system. A Deadbeat (DB) Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithm is compared with modified MRAC, a typical scheme in existing adaptive control systems for non-minimum phase end milling processes. The design of the two controllers is described and simulations are presented. It is shown that the DB MRAC has less design complexity and superior control performance in simulation studies than the modified MRAC. Actual cutting tests of <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> and cutting force control in the end milling process using the DB MRAC algorithm are carried out for a variety of cutting conditions.

The successful experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DB MRAC scheme for <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> and cutting force control of the end milling process and the feasibility of <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> control in adaptive control of end milling processes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNowadays, digital {{manufacturing}} {{systems with}} real-time process {{monitoring and control}} are in high demand in industries for productivity and quality improvement. During machining, such a system is anticipated to excerpt reliable data within a short time-lapse, monitor tool wear progress, anticipate its wear and breakage, alert the machinist in real time to avoid unexpected failure, and help obtaining quality products. This is vital, especially, when drilling Ni-/Ti-based superalloys as catastrophic failure and premature breakage of tools occur in random manner due to aggressive welding and chipping of the rake and flank faces. <b>Spindle</b> <b>power</b> data are easy to collect from modern machine tools and can be made available for such real-time data processing. This work aims to evaluate and analyze <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> data for real-time tool wear/breakage monitoring during drilling of a Ni-based superalloy, Inconel 625. Experiments were performed by varying speed and feed.

As a counterpart, force data were also collected and processed to understand the reliability of the <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> data. The results show that the trends of these two different types of data are similar for any feed and speed combinations.

The key enabling drive technologies for spindle rotational speeds in the 100, 000 rpm range includes electric motors, both AC and DC powered, and air turbines. In particular for high speed micromachining, turbine spindles have advantages in terms of precision and cost.

The analysis indicates that at present the energy usage associated with turbine spindles is significantly higher than electric spindles.

The analysis and results will contribute towards an overall life cycle assessment of high speed turbo-spindle technology, and provide impetus to further explore energy optimization approaches and methods...|$|R

The <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> and the tool flank wear are monitored during cutting; the root mean square of the time domain power is found to be sensitive to tool wear. Sample root mean square power growth curves are generated and the probability of each curve being the true growth curve is updated using Bayes’ rule. The updated probabilities are used to determine the remaining useful tool life. Results show good agreement between the predicted tool life and the empirically-determined true remaining life. The proposed method takes into account the uncertainty in tool life and the growth of the root mean square power at the end of tool life and is, therefore, robust and reliable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{supervisory}} technique {{to monitor the}} material removal state and tool wear condition {{as well as the}} estimation method for overall power consumed in the machining from the effective <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> change. The effective power (VAcosφ) was the optimal motor related parameter to represent the motor load. The cutting condition can be related with the effective power change by using the averaged effective power for 0. 2 seconds. The mean effective power is in proportion to the material removal rate. In addition, the averaged effective power can monitor continuously the tool wear condition and tool breakage. There was a series of cutting conditions where the specific effective power becomes minimum in the grooving operation. Under the cutting conditions with the minimum specific effective power, the cutting would have been conducting at the least cutting resistance and less overall power consumed. These facts indicates that we can determine the cutting conditions, where the cutting resistance and overall power consumed are getting minimum at the same time, by measuring the effective <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> change during the operation...|$|E

40|$|K-complexes {{and sleep}} {{spindles}} often grouped together characterize {{the second stage}} of NREM sleep and interest has been raised on a possible interaction of their underlying mechanisms. The reported inhibition of spindles power for about 15 seconds following evoked K-complexes has implications on their role in arousal. Our objective was to assess this inhibition following spontaneous K-complexes. We used time-frequency analysis of spontaneous K-complexes selected from whole-night EEG recordings of normal subjects. Our results show that spindles are most often observed at the positive phase following the peak of a spontaneous KC (70 %). At latencies of 1 - 3 s following the peak of the K-complex, spindles almost disappear. Compared to long-term effects described for evoked KCs, sleep <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> is not affected by spontaneous KCs for latencies of 5 - 15 s. Observation of the recurrence rate of sporadic spindles suggests that the reduction of power at 1 - 3 s most likely reflects a refractory period of spindles lasting for 1 - 2 s, rather than an effect of KCs. These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying spontaneous KCs do not affect <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> {{as in the case of}} evoked KCs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported {{of the dressing}} of metal-bonded diamond saw blades with four different dressing methods – stirring the blade segments in rock slurries, surface grinding the blade segments with Al 2 O 3 wheels, dressing the blade segments with SiC wheels, and dressing the blades through sawing of refractory materials. The surfaces of dressed blade segments were examined by a scanning electron microscope. The protrusion of the diamond grits on the dressed segments was quantitatively assessed using a digital optical microscope. The vertical and horizontal force components and the <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> were measured in the refractory sawing. The grit protrusion generated by the stirring method {{was found to be}} the highest and most diamond grits remained their original crystal shapes. But it took a quite long period to let the diamond grits protrude from the bond matrix. The protrusion produced by the surface grinding ranked the lowest among the four methods. The height of grit protrusion for either SiC dressing or refractory sawing was found to be about 20 % of the diamond average size, which might be an optimal point with respect to the segment sawing performance. Force analysis indicated that the force per diamond grit in refractory sawing was much lower than the diamond compressive strength. The changes of <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> in the sawing of refractory materials can be used to in-process monitor the dressing process...|$|E

Previous reports argue that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain and enhance neural rhythms related to memory, but the evidence from non-invasive recordings has remained inconclusive. Here, we measure endogenous spindle and theta activity intracranially in humans during low-frequency tACS and find no stable entrainment of <b>spindle</b> <b>power</b> during non-REM sleep, nor of theta power during resting wakefulness. As positive controls, we find robust entrainment of spindle activity to endogenous slow-wave activity in 66 % of electrodes as well as entrainment to rhythmic noise-burst acoustic stimulation in 14 % of electrodes. We conclude that low-frequency tACS at common stimulation intensities neither acutely modulates spindle activity during sleep nor theta activity during waking rest, likely because of the attenuated electrical fields reaching the cortical surface...|$|E
