5|$|Universal {{wanted a}} sequel to Jaws early into {{the success of the}} {{original}} film. Producers Brown and Zanuck realized that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> produce the film if they did not, and preferred {{to be in charge of}} the project themselves.|$|E
5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E
5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to wonder whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E

25|$|Tutankhamun {{was buried}} in a tomb that was unusually small {{considering}} his status. His death may have occurred unexpectedly, before {{the completion of a}} grander royal tomb, so that his mummy {{was buried in}} a tomb intended for <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> This <b>would</b> preserve the observance of the customary 70 days between death and burial.|$|R
50|$|For The Big Break V: Hawaii, the {{challenge}} was returned to its call-out format, but with a twist: when a player broke <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> glass, they <b>would</b> keep shooting until they missed.|$|R
25|$|The earning to give {{strategy}} has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating {{large sums of money}} to charity. Benjamin Todd and William MacAskill have argued that the marginal impact of one's potentially unethical actions in such a lucrative career would be small since <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have done them regardless, while the impact of donations would be large.|$|E
25|$|After God and the archangels {{successfully}} battled the Darkness to submission at {{the beginning}} of creation, God sealed the latter inside a metaphysical cage, whose seal was handed over to Lucifer for safekeeping. However, the Darkness' influence was as such that Lucifer was corrupted by it, eventually becoming the first fallen angel after refusing to honor humans. Lucifer then offered the seal to Cain, which empowered a blade made from the jawbone of a donkey that he used to kill and send his brother, Abel, to Heaven. Whenceforth, the seal was known by the moniker of the Mark of Cain, while the blade was dubbed the First Blade. Wielders of the Mark are corrupted by the Darkness so they would have the lust for power and bloodbath. This power in turn activates the First Blade, otherwise useless when wielded by other people, to become an invincible weapon capable of killing everything, even angels and higher demons. If killed, wielders of the Mark are resurrected as demons, as shown by Dean in the finale of the ninth season. At the start of the series, Cain had thrown the First Blade {{to the bottom of the}} Marianas Trench, only to take it back and give it as well as the Mark to Dean as part of the latter's quest to kill Abaddon. However, this gives Dean the attendant problems of the Mark, which slowly corrupts him, as releasing the Mark requires an arduous ritual, and if not transferred to <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> release the Darkness from her cage.|$|E
500|$|Gore {{has said}} that his other reason for enlisting {{was that he did}} not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, {{recalled}} Gore saying that [...] "if he found a fancy way of not going, <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have to go in his place". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, [...] "that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do. In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that [...] "anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's like us all,' said Byrne whimsically. 'We're all penned {{out on a}} wet evening, but we think, if only {{we could}} get where <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> is, it <b>would</b> be deliciously cosy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I believe I {{might do}} that," [...] Ozma returned; [...] "but Woot is quite right; {{we are not}} {{justified}} in inflicting upon anyone--man or dog--the form of a green monkey. Also {{it is certain that}} in order to relieve the boy of the form he now wears, we must give it to <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> who <b>would</b> be forced to wear it always." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first was}} that if I shot Dingaan the Zulus would {{probably}} massacre Marie and the others--Marie, whose sweet face I should never see again. The second was that while there is life there is hope. Perhaps, after all, he had not sent for an executioner, but for <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> I <b>would</b> wait. A few minutes more of existence were worth the having.|$|R
500|$|Atchison {{started his}} {{screenplay}} in 1999, {{when he wrote}} a five-page treatment in about a month. In addition to the fact {{he was working on}} other projects, Atchison said he waited years before starting to write because he [...] "thought <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> do it first." [...] This did not happen, so he began to write by himself. Few changes were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to the final product. One change was that at first, Akeelah's mother had a smaller role and Akeelah's father was alive. Also, Larabee had been an older man (72 years old), and a few characters were cut. However, Atchison has summarized that [...] "the steps she goes through, the friends she's got, those were always the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Mitchell was {{conceived}} {{as the leader}} of SG-1 who brings the team back together. Following negative fan reactions to Carter's cancelled leadership within the team (she commanded SG-1 throughout season 8), Browder noted the production difficulties that came with Amanda Tapping's maternity leave, and claimed that new leaders are brought in routinely into units in military reality. Tapping admitted to also have been [...] "kind of put off" [...] upon learning that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> lead SG-1, and hoped that the producers would make SG-1 more of an ensemble team in season 10 by removing the patriarchal line of command. The writers decided after an animated discussion after the initial season 9 episodes that Mitchell and Carter should co-command the team, although they left Mitchell in the official leadership position.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Jackson's 1996 film The Frighteners, Universal Pictures was {{impressed}} with Jackson's dailies and early visual effects footage. The studio was adamant to work with Jackson on his next project and, in late 1995, offered him the chance to direct a remake of the 1954 film Creature from the Black Lagoon. He turned down the offer, but Universal became aware of Jackson's obsession with King Kong and subsequently offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct that remake. The studio did not have to worry of lawsuits concerning the film rights from RKO Pictures (the studio behind the 1933 film) because the King Kong character is held in the public domain. Jackson initially turned down the King Kong offer, but he [...] "quickly became disturbed by the fact that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> take it over," [...] Jackson continued, [...] "and make it into a terrible film; that haunted me and I eventually said yes to Universal." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{starts a}} search through the Clans {{to find out}} who is responsible. Strategically, this is essential; if the culprit were able to {{successfully}} finger <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> a war <b>would</b> instantly ensue that could leave the Ghost Bears vulnerable to attack.|$|R
5000|$|Cassandra - Cassandra is {{the evil}} Sea-witch dreaded by the mermaids. The Sea-King has {{forbidden}} {{any of his}} daughters {{to have anything to}} do with her. She has two manta-rays minions named Dreyzock and Jhunika. When Cassandra finds out that Lena has fallen in love with a human prince, she tricks her into trading her beautiful voice for human legs, warning her that if Prince Stephan were to marry <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> she <b>would</b> then turn into seafoam for all eternity.|$|R
50|$|Gaman is {{also used}} in psychoanalytic studies and to {{describe}} {{the attitudes of the}} Japanese. It is often taught to youth and largely used by older Japanese generations. Showing gaman is seen as a sign of maturity and strength. Keeping your private affairs, problems and complaints silent demonstrates strength and politeness as others have seemingly larger problems as well. If a person with gaman were to receive help from <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> they <b>would</b> be compliant; not asking for any additional help and voicing no concerns.|$|R
500|$|Even {{before their}} {{convention}} in late July, the Populists faced dissent in their ranks. [...] Former Populist governor of Colorado Davis H. Waite wrote to former congressman Ignatius Donnelly that the Democrats {{had returned to}} their roots and [...] "nominated a good & true man on the platform. [...] Of course I support him." [...] Populist Kansas Congressman Jerry Simpson wrote, [...] "I care not for party names. [...] It is the substance we are after, and we have it with William J. Bryan." [...] Many Populists saw the election of Bryan, whose positions on many issues were not far from theirs, as the quickest path to the reforms they sought; a majority of delegates to the convention in St. Louis favored him. [...] However, many delegates disliked Sewall because of his wealth and ownership of a large business, and believed that nominating <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> keep Populist issues alive in the campaign. [...] Although they nominated Bryan for president, they chose Georgia's Thomas E. Watson as vice-presidential candidate; some hoped Bryan would dump Sewall from his ticket. [...] Bryan did not; Senator Jones (as the new Democratic National Committee chairman, {{in charge of the}} campaign) stated, [...] "Mr. Sewall, will, of course, remain on the ticket, and Mr. Watson can do what he likes." ...|$|E
500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just {{looked at each other}} like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} that he chose Commodus simply {{in the absence of}} other candidates, or {{as a result of the}} fear of succession issues and the possibility of civil war. Michael Grant, in The Climax of Rome (1968), writes of Commodus: [...] "The youth turned out to be very erratic or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> almost certainly involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrous around future successions." ...|$|E
500|$|Eddie Van Halen {{has since}} {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} use of [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] as the band's debut single. He said, [...] "It kind of bummed me out that Ted [...] wanted our first single to be <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> tune. I <b>would</b> have maybe picked [...] "Jamie's Cryin, just because it was our own." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the lack}} of formal musical training, Jeanie taught herself to play the ukulele, then guitar, then piano and other instruments. She {{attributes}} the [...] "musical inconvenience" [...] {{of not being able}} to read notation as being key to her developing her songwriting skills, noting that if she couldn't easily play <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> music, she <b>would</b> create her own.|$|R

2500|$|The Sorting Hat {{originally}} {{belonged to}} Godric Gryffindor, {{one of the}} four founders of Hogwarts. The four founders used to hand-pick the students for their houses, but then realised <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have to do it after they died, so Gryffindor took off his hat, enchanted it, and let it choose. Since then, the Sorting Hat has always been used to choose which house the students are put in. Due to its age, it appears [...] "patched and frayed and extremely dirty." [...] Before Sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs occasionally warn of danger to come, as in Order of the Phoenix. The Sorting Hat's songs vary in length and content, but always include a brief description of each house.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Doctor Who Magazine, Steven Moffat revealed that the Eleventh Doctor had an entirely different costume until close {{to the start of}} filming. The original look had a swashbuckling feel which Doctor Who Magazine editor Tom Spilsbury described as [...] "a little like something Captain Jack Sparrow wears in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies". However, Matt Smith was unhappy with the costume as he felt it reflected how <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> dress the Doctor, rather than how the Doctor would dress himself. Smith also mentioned in a 2012 interview that his Doctor {{was going to have a}} [...] "very long black leather jacket, but it was too Matrix-style". The eventual costume, in particular the bow-tie, was influenced by Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor, after Matt Smith fell in love with the Troughton story The Tomb of the Cybermen.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{relocated}} to College Park, Maryland, to record its debut album from June to September 2005. Although {{they only had}} shells of songs when they arrived, {{the rest of the}} album shaped up fast through the marathon session. [...] "We didn't have a day off in the five-and-a-half weeks we were there, 12 or 14 hours a day," [...] Ross said in a 2005 interview. [...] "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, we were living in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," [...] recalled Ross. [...] "Everyone got on everybody's nerves. Someone would write a new part for a song and <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> say they didn't like it just because you ate their cereal that morning." ...|$|E
5000|$|Whizziwig {{centred on}} {{the adventures of}} a boy called Ben and his best friend Steve who befriended a small pink alien {{approximately}} {{the size of a}} rugby ball. Whizziwig had the ability to grant wishes to anyone who uttered the words [...] "I wish..", however wishes had to be made for <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> and <b>would</b> last a maximum of 24 hours. A recurring theme was Ben and Steve trying to deceive their friend into granting their intentional wishes only for the alien to become wise to the scheme.|$|R
50|$|Other ways of {{investigating}} {{the role of}} the mirror neuron system in empathy have been through pain and disgust. With regard to pain, when painful stimuli are applied to subjects' hands, neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex fired. However, when observing painful stimuli being applied to <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> hands, the same neurons fired. The anterior cingulate cortex was also activated when observing people who would be painfully stimulated at a later time. Therefore, brain areas responsible for responding to pain are activated while experiencing pain, observing <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> experience pain, and observing <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> who <b>would</b> experience pain at a later point. The insula, which is activated after a person experiences disgust, is also activated when observing faces expressing disgust, and the intensity of the interaction is directly proportional to the level of disgust on the observed face. Finally, the inability to experience emotions leads to impairment of the ability to recognize the same emotions in others. Patients with brain injuries preventing them from experiencing disgust could recognize disgust in the faces of others.|$|R
5|$|A new comedy duo called Supergirly {{were also}} {{introduced}} from January 2000 {{to fill the}} gap left by 'Ben, Gez and Rich' who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through a misunderstanding, by being tactless or by mistaking the guests as <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> The sketches <b>would</b> usually culminate with the guests storming off.|$|R
2500|$|Extended {{notice is}} usually given when a sitting prime {{minister}} does {{not plan to}} lead his/her party into another election. Leadership contests to determine the successor to a prime minister are usually held during {{the final days of}} the incumbent's term, and are traditionally a lengthy and competitive process. In almost all cases, the outgoing prime minister hands over power directly to their designated successor, without any interim prime minister. By contrast, during leadership contests for the official opposition party, the leader of the opposition has often (though not always) been occupied by an interim parliamentary leader. [...] The opposition party's deputy leader (assuming that post is occupied) is often chosen for this role unless (s)he plans to run in the leadership election, in which case <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> be chosen since it would be considered harmful to the election process if the interim leader was to be one of the candidates.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, {{the church}} {{announced}} that it would buy the campus outright from the city of Houston for $7.5 million, terminating the lease after 7 years. Marty Aaron, a real estate appraiser, said that while an [...] "untrained eye" [...] would [...] "wonder how Lakewood Church purchased the Compaq Center for $7.5 million, when this is not really an arms-length sale from the city to Lakewood Church." [...] Aaron explained that the church [...] "put a phenomenal amount of money into the facility after the lease was initially structured, and it's really not fair that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> get the benefit of that." [...] Aaron added that converting the property to a stadium-oriented facility [...] "would probably cost as much or more than it took {{to turn it into a}} church, and right now there are probably not very many organizations that would be willing to step forward and do that." [...] The Houston City Council was scheduled to vote on the matter on Wednesday March 24, 2010. City council delayed the vote. On March 30 of that year, Ronald Green, the city's chief financial officer, said that he approved of the sale of the building. On March 31, 2010 the Houston City Council voted 13–2 to sell the property to Lakewood.|$|E
2500|$|Carter first assumes {{command of}} SG-1 in SG-1s season 2 episode [...] "Spirits" [...] when Jack O'Neill {{is in the}} {{infirmary}} injured. Carter takes over command from O'Neill as SG-1 leader {{at the end of}} season 7. Hammond had instructed Carter to relieve O'Neill of duty had she deemed him too unstable while {{under the influence of the}} Repository of the Ancients. O'Neill subsequently [...] "quits" [...] to avoid making Carter feel guilty. When Amanda Tapping was on maternity leave at the beginning of season 9, Cameron Mitchell was introduced as the leader of SG-1 who would bring the team back together. Following negative fan reactions to Carter's cancelled leadership within the team, Ben Browder noted the production difficulties that came with Amanda Tapping's maternity leave, and pointed out that new leaders are brought in routinely into units of the military.

The writers eventually decided after an animated discussion during season 9 that Mitchell and Carter would co-command the team, although they left Mitchell in the official leadership position. Tapping considered the question of leadership in season 10 irrelevant; Mitchell cannot give orders to his team since he and Carter hold the same military rank, and Daniel and Teal'c are not members of the United States military.|$|E
2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{to write the}} character and develop the series initially, Goddard said, [...] "With Matt Murdock I just had such a personal connection to that character it was just like, 'I have to do this.' I don't want to ... be a guy that just takes the comics and then shoots them onscreen. I think it's our job to treat it as if it's our run. If I'm the writer of a comic book, you wouldn't just retell <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> story, you <b>would</b> just take that ball and move it forward." ...|$|R
50|$|In November 2004, Bennett {{appointed}} BDO Stoy Hayward to find strategic investors. She {{wanted to}} concentrate on design, handing over the daily management to <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> while investment <b>would</b> also enable L.K.Bennett to expand abroad quicker. Bennett sold a 70% stake in the business in 2007 to Phoenix Equity Partners and Sirius Equity, a retail and branded luxury goods investment company, in a deal believed to have netted her around £70m.

50|$|In 1120, the Council of Nablus forbade sexual {{relations}} between crusaders and their female Muslim slaves: {{if a man}} raped his own slave, he would be castrated, but if he raped <b>someone</b> <b>else's</b> slave, he <b>would</b> be castrated and exiled from the kingdom. But Benjamin Z. Kedar argued that the canons of the Council of Nablus were in force in the 12th century but {{had fallen out of}} use by the thirteenth.
