In our study the interactions of ED, PAF and lyso-PAF with sphingomyelin (SM) {{being one of the}} main lipid found in a high concentration in membrane microdomains, like lipid rafts, were investigated in mixed monolayers at the air/water interface. The traditional Langmuir methodology was complemented with modern physicochemical techniques: Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and Brewster angle microscopy. The investigated compounds, i. e. : platelet activating factor (PAF), (lyso-PAF) and edelfosine were selected because of their highly different physiological properties despite very similar chemical structure and evidenced membrane activity.

As these cells differ essentially in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and plasmalogen concentration in the membrane, we have carried out systematic investigations in artificial systems of various compositions. The results for model leukaemia cell membrane were compared with data acquired for systems imitating normal leucocytes.

The experiments confirmed also that the interactions of ether lipids with a model membrane of HL- 60 cells (in biological tests sensitive to ED) have opposite character when compared with K- 562, being resistant to ED. Moreover, the values of the parameters characterizing monolayers serving as membrane models (strength of interactions, monolayers fluidity and morphology) proved both sensitivity of these cells to ED and lack of their susceptibility towards PAF.

Inosilicates are chain silicates; <b>single-chain</b> silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates {{have two or three}} shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.|$|E

Two sets of nanoscaled, <b>single-chained</b> chitosan models were simulated: one to study the swelling dependence upon the degree of self-cross-linking and other to observe the response with respect to the degree of protonation. We verified that nanohydrogels keep their ability to absorb water and grow, regardless of their degree of cross-linking. Noteworthy, we found that the swelling behavior of nanoscaled chitosan is pH-dependent, and it is considerably more limited than that of larger scale hydrogels. Thus, our study suggests that properties of nanohydrogels are significantly different from those of larger hydrogels.

It was demonstrated that histidine-tagged scFvs could be equally efficiently coupled to an NTA-Ni 2 +-containing lipid bilayer from a purified sample as from an expression supernatant, thereby providing a coupling method that eliminates time-consuming protein prepurification steps. Irrespective of whether the coupling was made from the unpurified or purified antibody preparation, the template proved to be efficient for antigen (cholera toxin) detection, verified using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. In addition, via a secondary amplification step using lipid vesicles containing GM, (the natural membrane receptor for cholera toxin), the detection limit of cholera toxin was less than 750 pM. To further strengthen the coupling of scFvs to the lipid bilayer, scFvs containing two histidine tags, instead of just one tag, were also evaluated. The increased coupling strength provided via the bivalent anchoring significantly reduced scFv displacement in complex solutions containing large amounts of histidine-containing proteins, verified via cholera toxin detection in serum.

In this work, the formation and characterization of catanionic vesicles by newly synthesized lysine- and serine-derived surfactants have been investigated by means of phase behavior mapping and PFG-NMR diffusometry and cryo-TEM methods. The lysine-derived surfactants are double-chained anionic molecules bearing a pseudogemini configuration, whereas the serine-derived amphiphile is cationic and <b>single-chained.</b> Vesicles form in the cationic-rich side for narrow mixing ratios of the two amphiphiles.

Different mechanisms of the vesicle-to-micelle transition were found, depending on symmetry: the 2 C 12 /C 12 system entails limited micellar growth and intermediate phase separation, whereas the 2 C 8 /C 16 system shows a continuous transition involving large wormlike micelles.

The majority of S. aureus strains produces a toxin, a proteinaceous exotoxin whose hemolytic, dermonecrotic, and lethal properties have long been known (1 - 6). The toxin is secreted as a <b>single-chained,</b> nonglycosylated polypeptide with aMr of 3. 4 x 10 4 (7, 8).

The majority of pores formed at high toxin concentrations (20 ug/ml) is visible in the electron microscope as circularized rings with central pores of- 2 nm in diameter. The rings have been isolated, and molecular weight determinations indicate that they represent hexamers of the native toxin (7). We have proposed that transmembrane leakiness is due to embedment of these ring structures in the bilayer, with molecular flux occurring through the central channels (15, 19).

2500|$|Minerals are {{classified}} by variety, species, series and group, {{in order of}} increasing generality. The basic level of definition is that of mineral species, {{each of which is}} distinguished from the others by unique chemical and physical properties. For example, quartz is defined by its formula, SiO2, and a specific crystalline structure that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed polymorphs). When there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined. For example, the biotite series is represented by variable amounts of the endmembers phlogopite, siderophyllite, annite, and eastonite. In contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure.

Despite that the knowledge concerning fundamental physicochemical properties of lyso-lipids is very limited and in contrast to double-chained phospholipids there is an obvious deficiency of studies focused on correlation between their amphipathic character and film-forming properties with biological activities. In the present paper we have attempted to explain the main issues regarding the characteristics of lyso-PCs in monolayers at the air/aqueous interface. Our results show that all the investigated phospholipids differing in the length of hydrophobic chain: C 18 lyso-PC, C 22 lyso-PC and C 24 lyso-PC form stable Langmuir monolayers of a relatively low degree of con- densation. It was found that during compression the investigated monolayers significantly change their organization at the interface which is strongly connected with temperature of the subphase. The appli- cation of X-ray reflectivity confirmed that the bulky choline head-groups in molecules of lyso-PCs are strongly penetrated by water molecules, while the hydrophobic chains are significantly tilted from the surface normal.

To accurately determine the viability of algae as a production platform, not only does the titer of correctly folded proteins have to be competitive to existing platforms (insect, yeast, plants, and bacteria) but the ease of downstream processing must also be taken into consideration. Two proteins expressed in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii were studied, a malaria vaccine candidate (Plasmodium falciparum surface protein 25 (Pfs 25)) and a <b>single-chained</b> antibody fragment (?CD 22 scFv). The first part of this study (Chapter II) had two objectives: (i) increase the accumulation of Pfs 25 and (ii) characterize the Pfs 25 -aggregates. By suspending algal cells in fresh media after 5 days of growth, the accumulation of Pfs 25 increased 1. 7 -fold. The Pfs 25 -aggregates were separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and found to range in size from 25 kDa to > 600 kDa; even in the presence of reducing agents and detergent the higher molecular (MW) aggregates remained intact. Due to the wide variances of Pfs 25, evaluating the ease of downstream processing of algae with Pfs 25 would prove to be difficult. Previously, our lab used ?CD 22 scFv to compare three pretreatment methods (ammonium sulfate precipitation at pH 8. 0, isoelectric precipitation at pH 4. 5, and chitosan precipitation at pH 5. 0) on residual chlorophyll, DNA, host cell protein, and ?CD 22 scFv yield. However, the pretreatment methods were compared using anti-FLAG-affinity resin (a very specific yet highly expensive resin). Therefore, the second part of this study (Chapter III) used ?CD 22 scFv to (i) test the effect of pretreatment methods on ?CD 22 scFv adsorption to Capto Q and Phenyl Sepharose resins and (ii) develop a purification process resulting in > 98 % purity. Isoelectric precipitation at pH 4. 5 and anion exchange chromatography (AXC) combination was determined to be the best combination for initial recovery and concentration of ?CD 22 scFv. After isoelectric precipitation and AXC, anti-FLAG-affinity resin was the only resin scouted that showed a > 98 % ?CD 22 scFv purity and 77 % yield...|$|R
