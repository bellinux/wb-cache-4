500|$|Although local {{commanders in}} II Corps Tactical Zone tried {{their best to}} {{maintain}} secrecy, the unusual movement of transport aircraft in Pleiku on March 14 stirred up concern and suspicion amongst soldiers and civilians in the [...] area. On March 15 the concerns of civilians were further heightened when a convoy of transport vehicles belonging to the 6th and 23rd Ranger Battalions headed south from Kontum. On the afternoon of March 15, the withdrawal of South Vietnamese forces began to pick up momentum. The ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion opened the main road which stretched from Pleiku to Phu Tuc. Behind them were various infantry, armoured vehicle, and support units. During the early phases of the operation, Phu was confident that his plan would succeed for two reasons. Firstly, he believed most North Vietnamese units were busy stopping the counter-attack at Phuoc An waged by the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division {{and would not have}} the time to disrupt the withdrawal. Secondly, if the North Vietnamese 968th Infantry Division near Pleiku was deployed to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> it would have to overcome the formidable ARVN 25th Ranger Battalion which was tasked with stopping any North Vietnamese attacks.|$|E

50|$|After {{the guns}} {{of the two}} {{warships}} smashed Spanish positions ashore, the boats moved in {{to carry out the}} operation.

They soon grapneled a second cable and {{were in the process of}} cutting it, too, when the Spaniards opened a slow fire that soon grew to volley proportions, from rifles, automatic weapons and one-pounders. After a Spanish bullet felled the coxswain of Anderson's boat, Anderson took the helm and began steering the boat seaward, directing his men to keep down between the thwarts. The Spanish fire, however wounded three more men and holed the boat in many places. After the action, Anderson had nothing but praise for his sailors and marines, commending their intelligent and cheerful work in the exhausting labor of picking up and cutting the heavy cables, working even under heavy fire until ordered to <b>stop.</b> <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> proved successful in another aspect. The ships gunfire decimated a large Spanish force sent to the area to contest the operation.|$|E

The launch of the new installation for condensed nitric acid with capacity of 100 tons per day allowed to <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> of the existing used installation as well as caused significant reduction in nitrogen oxide emission and significant limitation of energy consumption in the production of condensed nitric acid. In the 90’s of the previous century the production of ammonia in plants was becoming less and less effective and no one doubted in the necessity of modernisation of the installation for ammonia synthesis from the pre-war period. It was dictated not only by the economic reasons, but also ecological. The design works connected with {{the construction of}} the new installation {{on the basis of the}} equipment purchased from the ammonia installation in Hungary was started in 1997. The commissioning of the installation in 2000 allowed for switching off the ammonia synthesis units operating since 1929.|$|E
