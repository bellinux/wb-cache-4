40|$|The inter-facial {{adhesion}} {{between the}} epoxy-based <b>soldermask</b> and underfill resin is successfully improved {{by means of}} ultraviolet light/ozone (UV/O- 3) treatment. There is an optimized treatment condition that can impart the highest interfacial bond quality. The underlying mechanisms are evaluated based on several techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurement and nanoindentation of the UV/O- 3 treated <b>soldermask</b> surface. Functionally similar changes in chemical element, wettability, and elastic modulus are identified of the substrate with respect to treatment time, which are also correlated to the improvement of interfacial bond strength. In particular, there is a linear relationship between the weighted dipole moment (obtained from the XPS analysis) and the surface polarity (calculated from the contact angle measurements) of the treated surface, confirming that the same conclusion can be drawn front the two different techniques. The UV/O- 3 treatment is proven to be efficient in retaining the interfacial bond quality even after hygrothermal ageing...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{underfill}} {{in enhancing}} {{the reliability of}} flip chip packages is of paramount importance, particularly for the low-cost packages made of organic printed circuit boards. Amongst many reliability issues in flip chip packages, delamination between the underfill and other package components is detrimental to the mechanical and functional performance of the package because delamination often leads to premature failure of the whole device. In the present study, the interfacial bond strengths of both conventional and no-flow underfill resins with die passivation, solder and polyimide <b>soldermask</b> are measured based on the button shear test; and the surface characteristics of these substrates are analysed using several analytical tools, including the atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurement. Plasma and UV/ozone treatments are applied before encapsulation to improve the under 1 package components interface bond. It is found that the interfacial bond strength of underfill with solder was the weakest, while it was highest with silicon nitride passivation layer amongst the above substrates studied. Both plasma and UV/ozone treatments improved the interfacial bond strength with polyimide <b>soldermask</b> along with a decrease in contact angle of the surface. Among the various thermodynamic parameters the spreading coefficient was shown to have close correlation with the underfill-solder interfacial bond strength. The significance of this finding is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{flip chip}} {{packaging}} {{has become one}} of the most popular electronics packaging technologies for all kinds of applications. For high end applications like central processing units (CPU), the flip chip packaging technology demonstrates its distinctive advantage of high efficiency to dissipate heat from the silicon chip. Flip chip packages have also received tremendous interests for low end applications such as watch modules and smart card due to their light weight and thin package profiles for low cost applications. Fiber reinforced organic substrates are commonly employed to lower the material costs. This raises concerns on mechanical and thermal mismatches between the silicon chip and the organic substrate. The consequence is that there are significant stress concentrations in the solder joints due to the difference in dimensional changes between the silicon chip and the organic substrate during thermal cycles. To reduce the relative displacements and to redistribute the stress over the entire package, an underfill resin is encapsulated along the gap between the chip and the substrate as a stress buffer. The introduction of an underfill in the package also raises other reliability issues, for example, weak interfacial adhesion between package components, process-induced residual stress as during assembly, proper selection of component materials etc. The objective of the present thesis is to gain some new insights into the above underfill-related reliability issues in flip chip packages. To measure the interfacial adhesion between the underfill and other package components, the button shear tests were performed and the corresponding failure behaviors were characterized. The correlations between the elements obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the thermodynamic characteristics determined from the contact angle measurement were established. The UV/Ozone treatment on the polymeric <b>soldermask</b> surface offered the possibility of further enhancement of the adhesion with the underfill material. The interfacial adhesion between the underfill and other components were also characterized. The interfacial adhesion of underfill with eutectic solder was far weaker than the other interfaces, indicating the necessity to treat the solder surface to improve the bond. Incomplete filling of the underfill, either due to flux residue, entrapped gas altered the mode of solder joint failure from hydrostatic fatigue cracking to plastic deformation. An optimized UV/Ozone treatment on polymeric <b>soldermask</b> surface enhanced the interfacial bond strength with underfill resin. The bi-material strip bending (BMSB) method has been successfully developed to in-situ monitor the evolution of the residual stresses in epoxy-based underfill resins during curing and thermal cycles. The residual stress in the silica filled conventional underfill was higher than that of the rubber modified no-flow underfill. The importance of the properties of underfill, such as modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), in governing its residual stress after cure were discussed. Isothermal contraction of epoxy is also noticed during thermal cycles at temperature below the glass transition temperature. The numerical model based on the time-temperature dependent underfill material is compared with that based on the linear elastic underfill material. The importance of material properties of package components, such as the moduli and CTEs of the underfill, solder and PCB, in reducing the stress concentrations is highlighted. The effect of process-induced defects in the underfill layers is also studied. Thermo-elastic modeling of underfill behavior underestimate the stress and strain levels in the solder joints, due to the underestimate of the relaxation of polymeric underfill. The rigidity of PCB substrate also influenced significantly the lifetime of solder interconnection.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{performance}} of Flip-Chip Chip-Scale Packages (FC-CSPs) with lead-free solder interconnects was undertaken. The parametric studies on the CSPs were performed considering a wide variation of geometric and material parameters. Two geometrical versions on organic interposer with different die sizes were investigated theoretically and experimentally by thermal cycling tests - 40 °C to 150 °C. In the FE-analyses, several additional parameters were examined including BT-interposer thickness, standoff, perimeter vs. full array, and solder-mask defined vs. non-solder-mask defined (NSMD) balls. Underfilling of the CSPs was an additional option. In the finite element analyses (FEA) both SnAg and SnAgCu solders were considered. For the latter a newly developed combined primary-secondary creep law was applied in the calculations. Both the inelastic strain (creep strain) and dissipated strain energy density represent suitable indicators to evaluate cyclic damage. It is demonstrated that for a thermal test cycle both measures result in similar critical cycle numbers. The calculations show that the creep strain always concentrates at the interfaces of the balls to the package. Maximum straining typically occurs at the inner ball row. Major effects on ball fatigue life are shown to be standoff height, ball geometry on both sides non solder mask defined (NSMD), and a stiff underfill. It is also shown that the CSP reliability using a soft underfill with high CTE or a similar "avarage soft underfill layer", composed of the <b>soldermask</b> layers and the underfill itself, can be worse than for a non-underfilled CSP. Testing results are compared to theoretical predictions. In many cases they agree reasonably well. Finally, differences between simulation and testing results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow large area processing with potential for low cost applications. Wafer level embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards CChip-in-Polymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. This paper describes the use of compression and transfer molding techniques for multi chip embedding in combination with large area and low cost redistribution technology from printed circuit board manufacturing as adapted for Chip-in-Polymer applications. The work presented {{is part of the}} German governmental funded project SmartSense. Embedding by transfer molding is a well known process for component embedding that is widely used for high reliable microelectronics encapsulation. However, due to material flow restrictions transfer molding does not allow large area encapsulation, but offers a cost effecti ve technology for embedding on a medium size scale as known e. g. from MAP Cmolded array packaging) molding Ctypically with sizes up to 60 × 60 mm 2). In contrast, compression molding is a relatively new technology that has been especially developed for large area embedding of single chips but also of multiple chips or heterogeneous systems on wafer scale, typically up to 8 " or even up to 12 ". Wiring of these embedded components is done using PCB manufacturing technologies, i. e. a resin coated copper CRCC) film is laminated over the embedded components - no matter which shape the embedded components areas are: a compression molded wafer, larger rectangular areas or smaller transfer molded systems CMAP). Typical process flow for RCC redistribution is lamination of RCC, via drilling to die pads by laser, galvanic Cu via filling, conductor line and pad formation by Cu etching, <b>soldermask</b> and solderable surface finish application - all of them standard PCB processes.

An increase in wiring density is required at the board level, often equating to higher costs and/or layer counts. In many cases, designers are looking to multilayer flexible circuits as {{the next level of}} interconnect {{for a wide range of}} packaging technologies from fine-pitch surface mount to chip-scale packages to direct-chip attach. Challenges associated with a flex-based solution include assembly compatibility, material costs and reliability. This paper reviews work by Teledyne Electronic Technologies (TET) to address these board level interconnect challenges for several custom applications. An approach employing flexible multilayer substrates which incorporate fine-line circuitry, small vias and flexible <b>soldermask</b> is examined. A test vehicle designed and built to accommodate micro-BGA packages is used to illustrate the density achieved and to provide a platform for demonstrating assembly and reliability attributes. This test vehicle is also being used to evaluate materials and process technologies applicable to high density SMT assemblies.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of electronic packages is {{strongly influenced by}} the thermomechanical stresses developed during the assembly processes. Understanding the mechanisms of relaxing the high stress concentrations through the selection of materials with appropriate properties, adhesive joint and bump geometry will aid in design improvements for enhanced {{reliability of}} electronic packages. Finite element analysis is conducted to evaluate the stress profiles in a flip chip assembly that contains defects and delaminations at various locations. The residual stresses evolved due to the various temperature excursions during assembly processes are taken into account. Parametric studies are made {{of the effects of}} elastic modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion of underfill resin on residual stress profiles, especially at potential failure sites amongst the various interfaces. It is revealed that the presence of flux residue at the bottom corners of solder bump does not impose a significant threat to the generation of stress concentrations, and thus the package reliability during the assembly processes and mechanical loading. On the contrary, the presence of delaminations along the solder-underfill interfaces caused more than twice the stress concentrations than those with perfect interface bonding and with flux residue at the bump corners. It is proposed that these stress concentrations can be reduced systematically by optimising the material properties, e. g. by increasing the elastic modulus of underfill resin while decreasing the modulus of solder towards those of the underfill and PCB substrate. The effects of CTEs of package materials are discussed. An experimental study is carried out to measure the interface adhesion between various package components in the flip chip package. Although the adhesive strength of the underfill was found stronger with the passivation surfaces than the <b>soldermask</b> surfaces, from the mechanical loading viewpoint delamination was still prone to occur near the die side. The surface energy measurements indicate that for similar solid surfaces an increase in dipole hydrogen bond resulted in stronger adhesion of the joints...|$|E
