40|$|Culpeo (Dusicyon culpaeus) and <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> (D. griseus) have {{comparable}} ranges, but {{the factors}} determining local and geographic distribution are unknown. I first review the best documented cases of sympatry in canids, {{and discuss the}} implications this analysis has on canid conservation. I then compare the behavioral ecology of grey and culpeo fox in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile and review hypothetical factors that determine their distribution when sympatric;The number of sympatric canids per area seems {{to be determined by}} a combination of biogeographical history, human intervention, and environmental diversity and productivity. Sympatric canid species either segregate in different habitats or utilize different food resources, but do not do both. Interactions among sympatric canid species may have important conservation and management implications because canid community structure often changes after a species 2 ̆ 7 range expansion, extirpation, or reintroduction;From 1986 through 1989, 44 grey and 19 culpeo fox were monitored using radio telemetry techniques.

Adult animals had clear circadian rhythms of core body temperature (Tb).

40|$|Abstract Background Interferon {{inducible}} transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have diverse roles, {{including the}} control of cell proliferation, promotion of homotypic cell adhesion, protection against viral infection, promotion of bone matrix maturation and mineralisation, and mediating germ cell development. Most IFITMs have been well characterised in human and mouse but little published data exists for other animals. This study characterised IFITMs in two distantly related marsupial species, the Australian tammar wallaby and the <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>grey</b> short-tailed opossum, and analysed the phylogeny of the IFITM family in vertebrates. Results Five IFITM paralogues were identified in both the tammar and opossum. As in eutherians, most marsupial IFITM genes exist within a cluster, contain two exons and encode proteins with two transmembrane domains. Only two IFITM genes, IFITM 5 and IFITM 10, have orthologues in both marsupials and eutherians. IFITM 5 arose in bony fish and IFITM 10 in tetrapods. The bone-specific expression of IFITM 5 appears to be restricted to therian mammals, suggesting that its specialised role in bone production is a recent adaptation specific to mammals. IFITM 10 is the most highly conserved IFITM, sharing at least 85 % amino acid identity between birds, reptiles and mammals and suggesting an important role for this presently uncharacterised protein. Conclusions Like eutherians, marsupials also have multiple IFITM genes that exist in a gene cluster. The differing expression patterns {{for many of the}} paralogues, together with poor sequence conservation between species, suggests that IFITM genes have acquired many different roles during vertebrate evolution. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{humans and}} mice, there are 11 genes derived from sushi-ichi related retrotransposons, {{some of which}} are known to play {{essential}} roles in placental development. Interestingly, this family of retrotran-sposons was thought to exist only in eutherian mammals, indicating their significant contributions to the eutherian evolution, but at least one, PEG 10, is conserved between marsupials and eutherians. Here we report a novel sushi-ichi retrotransposon-derived gene, SIRH 12, in the tammar wallaby, an Australian marsupial species of the kangaroo family. SIRH 12 encodes a protein highly homologous to the sushi-ichi retrotransposon Gag protein in the tammar wallaby, while SIRH 12 in the <b>South</b> <b>American</b> short-tailed <b>grey</b> opossum is a pseudogene degenerated by accumulation of multiple nonsense mutations. This suggests that SIRH 12 retrotransposition occurred only in the marsupial lineage but acquired and retained some as yet unidentified novel function, at least in the lineage of the tammar wallaby.

5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the <b>South</b> <b>American</b> canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The <b>South</b> <b>American</b> clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's <b>fox.</b> The <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|R

40|$|The Giemsa banding {{patterns}} of seven canid species, including the grey wolf (Canis lupus), the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), the <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), and the fennec (Fennecus zerda), are presented and compared. Relative to {{other members of}} Canidae, these species have high diploid complements (2 n greater than 64) consisting of largely acrocentric chromosomes. They show a considerable degree of chromosome homoeology, but relative to the grey wolf, each species is either missing chromosomes or has unique chromosomal additions and rearrangements. Differences in chromosome morphology among the seven species were used to reconstruct their phylogenetic history. The {{results suggest that the}} <b>South</b> <b>American</b> canids are closely related to each other and are derived from a wolf-like progenitor. The fennec and the bat-eared fox seem to be recent derivatives of a lineage that branched early from the wolf-like canids and which also includes the <b>grey</b> <b>fox...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} annual and {{seasonal}} food habits of sympatric <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> (Lycalopex griseus) and culpeo fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) in a protected area, in southeastern Argentine Patagonia, {{to test the}} hypothesis that both <b>foxes</b> partition prey. <b>Grey</b> <b>foxes</b> consumed a larger proportion of rodents than culpeos (66. 1 % versus 37. % of occurrences in feces, respectively), and culpeos consumed a larger proportion of the introduced European hare (Lepus europaeus) (32. 8 % versus 7. 1 %, respectively). Additionally, arthropods made up {{a significant portion of the}} diet of the <b>grey</b> <b>fox,</b> and occurred in the 95. 5 % of the analyzed feces. Despite the great differences in size of culpeo and <b>grey</b> <b>foxes,</b> the former being significantly larger, both species consumed the same type of prey, and no significant differences in the mean weight of vertebrate prey were detected in their diets. Culpeo and <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> diets differed during spring – summer with low values of mean diet overlap (31 %). But in autumn – winter, when prey diversity is lower in Patagonia, diet was more similar and diet overlap (73 %) increased. An exploratory analysis of habitat use by culpeo and <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> suggested that both species utilize habitat in a similar way. Our data agree with generalizations about competitive interactions between the large and the small canid in an assemblage. Although both foxes can potentially consume the same type of prey, through interference the larger culpeo would exclude the smaller <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> from habitats with high-quality prey, resulting in prey partitioning. The possibility that both foxes partition habitat at a finer scale in our study area should be explored. Peer reviewe...|$|R
