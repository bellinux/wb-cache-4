5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, {{the film has}} sometimes been seen as drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for the upper class. It stars Jeremy Irons and most college <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E
5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> standard fare for the gunmen {{of the big}} screen. In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill.|$|E
2500|$|The Warren Commission {{additionally}} {{concluded that}} three <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired {{and said that}} [...] "a substantial majority of the witnesses stated that the <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> not evenly spaced. Most witnesses recalled that {{the second and third}} <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> bunched together." ...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{locations}} {{in which the}} movie <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> Cedartown, Georgia, USA. Exterior home <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Troup County, Georgia, while additional scenes <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> in Decatur, Georgia. For the Greek Revival home, the interior <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> filmed at The Bailey-Tebault House located in Griffin, Georgia.|$|R
50|$|Round <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> undeniably inaccurate. This was because, {{despite their}} name, round <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> never {{perfectly}} spherical, {{nor did they}} fit their gun barrels exactly. Air acted on the irregular surface of the projectile. These irregularities invariably threw them off target to some degree. It is often also a matter of confusion as to why a 12pdr <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> so much more effective than a 6pdr <b>shot.</b> This <b>is</b> because {{the impact of a}} <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> not only related to its weight but also to its velocity, which, with a heavier projectile, was much greater {{at the end of the}} trajectory.|$|R
5|$|In a noisy print shop, a disgraced {{police detective}} named Hofmeister (Karl Meixner) escapes from {{pursuing}} criminals' attacks. Hofmeister telephones his former superior Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) and explains frantically {{that he has}} discovered a huge criminal conspiracy. Before he can disclose {{the identity of the}} responsible criminal, the lights go out, <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> fired, and Hofmeister becomes mad. Hofmeister vanishes only to be found later singing every time he feels watched, and he is institutionalized at Professor Baum's asylum.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate the {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E
5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse as the dog travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E
50|$|Case <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> {{used as a}} {{last resort}} when the enemy's foot {{soldiers}} were close to the gun. Case <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> effective up to 400 metres.|$|R
25|$|In carom games, an {{advanced}} player's aim on most <b>shots</b> <b>is</b> {{to leave the}} cue ball and the object balls in position so that the next <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> of a less difficult variety to make the requisite , and so that the next <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> in position to be manipulated in turn for yet another shot; ad infinitum.|$|R
50|$|If {{the penalty}} <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> successful, the puck is placed at center ice and play resumes as normal. If the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> unsuccessful, the puck is placed at {{either of the}} faceoff {{positions}} in the zone where the play occurred, and play resumes. The time necessary to complete the penalty <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> not taken off of the game clock.|$|R
5|$|Renoir used few close-ups {{or reverse}} shots {{and most of}} the <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> two shots. The hunt scene differs {{from the rest of the}} film; it uses rapid editing whereas most of the film uses long takes of {{dialogue}} or action. Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade Technicolor to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.|$|E
5|$|Two men are {{surveying}} {{an area of}} the Apalachicola National Forest in Leon County, Florida {{when they}} are attacked and killed by unseen assailants with glowing red eyes. Later that day, Michael Asekoff and his son, Louis, are hunting for possums with their dog, Bo, in the same stretch of woods. Upon discovering a surveyor's bloody jacket, the father orders his son to take the dog and run home. As the son and dog take off, two <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> heard.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{in a red}} dress moving across a screen of {{multiple}} changing colors and then moves to multiple shots of Elliott rapping in a white and red jersey and matching hat, Lyte in a blue dress, and a church choir group. Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. <b>Shots</b> <b>are</b> shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a party with a guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a room in a golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song then moves to a verse by Mc Lyte and we see her dancing {{in the middle of a}} semi-circle of men wearing orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E
50|$|In carom games, an {{advanced}} player's aim on most <b>shots</b> <b>is</b> {{to leave the}} cue ball and the object balls in position so that the next <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> of a less difficult variety to make the requisite , and so that the next <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> in position to be manipulated in turn for yet another shot; ad infinitum.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} train <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} Croydon, London, and London Waterloo station in Lambeth. Exterior <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> filmed in the Black Park Country Park adjacent to Pinewood Studios.|$|R
5000|$|Martini <b>Shot</b> <b>is</b> a Hollywood {{term that}} {{describes}} the final shot set-up of the day. According to Dave Knox, author of the film industry slang guide Strike the Baby and Kill the Blonde, the Martini <b>Shot</b> <b>was</b> so named because [...] "the next <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> out of a glass", referring to a post-wrap drink. Also {{referred to as the}} Window Shot.|$|R
5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. <b>Shots</b> <b>are</b> fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is excited}} about her {{vacation}} week, until she gets a text message from her assistant, Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), that the hotel she had planned to stay at was overbooked. Liz goes to see Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) who is giving out flu shots at the 30 Rock studios. She learns that the <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> given to select few employees. Her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), asks her {{to let him know}} about the most important individuals in her staff that should receive flu shots. Liz does not agree with Jack that he should ration out health care, which results in Liz not getting a shot. Jack considers giving the show's page, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), one of the remaining shots, as he is very ill with the flu, though Kenneth refuses. Later, Jack continuously asks Liz, but still refuses. This time, she displays her solidarity in front of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) crew who show her their appreciation. However, as she sees the crew getting sicker, as days go by, she panics and gets the shot.|$|E
25|$|Usually, most fielders {{are placed}} on the off side. This is because most bowlers tend to {{concentrate}} the line of their deliveries on or outside the off stump, so most <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> hit into the off side.|$|E
5000|$|Lead <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> {{also often}} used as ballast in various situations, {{especially}} where a dense, pourable weight is required. Generally, small <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> best for these applications, {{as it can be}} poured more like a liquid. Completely round <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> not required. When used as a pourable/mouldable weight, the <b>shot</b> may <b>be</b> left loose, or mixed with a bonding agent such as epoxy to contain and stabilize the pellets after they are poured. Some applications are: ...|$|R
5000|$|The trunk <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> a {{cinematic}} camera angle which captures {{film from}} inside {{the trunk of a}} car. Though the trunk <b>shot</b> can <b>be</b> produced by placing the camera inside the trunk, the considerable bulk of a conventional movie camera and camera operator makes this difficult. Therefore, the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> usually [...] "cheated" [...] by having the art department place a trunk door and some of the trunk frame close enough to the camera to make it appear to <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> from within a car. The trunk <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> a specialized type of low-angle shot.|$|R
5000|$|A useful {{method for}} remembering the {{diameter}} of numbered <b>shot</b> in inches <b>is</b> simply to subtract the shot size from 17. The resulting answer is {{the diameter of}} the shot in hundredths of an inch. For example, #2 shot gives 17-2 = 15, meaning that the diameter of #2 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 15/100 or 0.15". B <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> [...]170 inches, and sizes go up in [...]01 increments for BB and BBB sizes. In metric measurement, it is easy to remember that #5 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 3 mm; each number up or down represents a 0.25 mm change in diameter, so e.g. #7 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 2.5 mm.|$|R
25|$|<b>Shots</b> <b>are</b> {{exchanged}} between Republicans and Free State {{troops at}} the cemetery in Dundalk at the interment of the bodies of six Anti-Treaty fighters executed in January 1923. Several people are hit and one man dies of his wounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of the batsman for a particular delivery depends on the shot being attempted. Front-foot <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> played with the weight on the front foot (left foot for a right-hander) and are usually played when the ball is pitched up to the batsman, while back-foot <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> played putting the weight onto the back foot, usually to bowling that is pitched short. Shots may also be described as vertical bat shots, in which the bat is swung vertically at the ball (e.g. when playing a drive or leg glance), or horizontal or cross-bat shots, in which the bat is swung horizontally at the ball (e.g. when playing the pull or cut shot).|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Newbery {{created the}} Uzi, with a {{truncated}} blade and elongated handle {{for the new}} Twenty20 format of the game. This change allowed more wood {{to be placed in}} the middle, as more attacking <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> played in the shorter version of the game.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fisherman}} <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> sent to {{a hospital}} in Gunsan by helicopter. [...] According to the Coast Guard, {{this was the first time}} <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired for illegal fishing in the Yellow Sea.|$|R
5000|$|October 1-24, 1966: At 0500 a {{submarine}} was reported being sighted in Gullmarsfjorden and warning <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired by nearby forces. Other sightings followed by warning <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> repeated {{during the following}} days.|$|R
50|$|The movie launch {{function}} {{was held on}} 22 October 2007. Muhurat <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> clapped by Dasari Narayana Rao, camera was switched on by Mohan Babu and the first <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> directed by Rama Naidu.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} limited overs cricket, with its {{emphasis}} on rapid run-scoring, has led to increasing use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders. Unorthodox <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> typically—but not always— more high-risk than orthodox shots due to some aspects of good batting technique being abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Examples of risky shots {{include the}} reverse sweep and the paddle-scoop. These <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> used {{to achieve a}} {{boundary}} which {{would not be possible}} when playing a safer, more orthodox shot. Finally, the lower order consists of the bowlers of the team, who are not known for their batting prowess and so bat as low down the order as possible.|$|E
25|$|Booster <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} because lymphocyte production (antibodies) {{is not at}} a constant high rate of activity. This is because after {{the introduction of the}} vaccine when lymphocyte production is high, the production activity of the white blood cells will start to decline. The decline in activity of the T-helper cells means that there must be a booster to help keep the white blood cells active.|$|E
25|$|Mizuki: This <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> hit as a volley. Unlike {{a normal}} volley, the Mizuki <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> {{hit with the}} other side of the racket by turning the wrist which deceives the {{direction}} of the ball.|$|R
50|$|Round <b>shot</b> has <b>been</b> totally {{replaced}} by modern shells. Round <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> used in historical recreations and historical replica weapons.|$|R
50|$|The {{situations}} when {{a penalty}} <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> {{to be made}} is stated in Rule 14 of the Bandy Playing Rules published by the Federation of International Bandy. The execution of a penalty <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> regulated in Rule 15.|$|R
