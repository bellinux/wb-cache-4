During his stay in Italy, Lawrence completed the final version of Sons and Lovers that, when published in 1913, was acknowledged to be a vivid portrait of the realities of working class provincial life. Lawrence, though, had become <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the work that he allowed Edward Garnett to cut about a hundred pages from the text.|$|E
500|$|Tired {{of being}} both typecast and being {{passed over for}} lead Asian {{character}} roles in favor of non-Asian actresses, Wong left Hollywood in 1928 for Europe. Interviewed by Doris Mackie for Film Weekly in 1933, Wong complained about her Hollywood roles: [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the parts I had to play." [...] She commented: [...] "There seems little for me in Hollywood, because, rather than real Chinese, producers prefer Hungarians, Mexicans, American Indians for Chinese roles." ...|$|E

"Do I Disappoint You", the album's opener, [...] "sees [...] {{present a}} {{withering}} {{defense of his}} own human frailties, while one orchestral battalion after another mount their attacks and Martha Wainwright summons 'CHAOS!' and 'DESTRUCTION!' like a marauding Fury". [...] "Going to a Town", the album's lead single, was considered by Uncuts John Mulvey {{to be among the}} angriest lyrics Wainwright has written, an [...] "indictment of the country of his birth that hinges on the refrain, 'I'm <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> you America'". The political track, which Wainwright claimed he wrote in just five minutes {{on the eve of his}} departure for Berlin, confronts the Bush administration's perceived damage to the U.S. in the form of a love song. It was his discontent with America at the time that lead Wainwright to spend some time recording the album in Berlin. [...] "Tiergarten", named after a large park in Berlin of the same name, is a song about Wainwright's German boyfriend, Jörn Weisbrodt. While recording parts of Release the Stars in Berlin, the couple visited the park often.|$|E

500|$|To {{minimize}} her tax liability, Heyer {{formed a}} {{limited liability company}} called Heron Enterprises around 1950. Royalties from new titles would {{be paid to the}} company, which would then furnish Heyer's salary and pay directors' fees to her family. She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother. Within several years, however, a tax inspector found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company. The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes. To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, [...] "Books about the Brontës" [...] and [...] "How to be a Literary Writer", that were published in the magazine Punch. She once wrote to a friend, [...] "I'm getting <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> writing books {{for the benefit of the}} Treasury and I can't tell you how utterly I resent the squandering of my money on such fatuous things as Education and Making Life Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] {{was the first}} for {{director}} Samuel Bayer. Bayer stated he believed he was hired because his test-reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be [...] "punk" [...] and [...] "not corporate." [...] The video {{was based on the}} concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot. Inspiration was taken from Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film, Over the Edge, as well as the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. Filmed on a soundstage in Culver City, the video featured the band playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The music video features a brief appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene would cut to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push broom handle. The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band's gear. The demolition of the set captured in the video's conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. [...] "Once the kids came out dancing they just said ' you,' because they were <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> this [...] throughout the day," [...] Cobain said. Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video that resulted in the version finally aired. One of Cobain's major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of his own face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Bayer noted that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain did not care about vanity, rather that [...] "the video had something that was truly about what they were about." [...] The video had an estimated budget between $30,000 and $50,000.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Shakur and {{his family}} moved to Marin City, California, a {{suburban}} community located [...] north of San Francisco. He attended Tamalpais High School in nearby Mill Valley. Shakur contributed to the school's drama department by performing in several productions. In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, [...] "Conquering All Obstacles," [...] in which he said: [...] "our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of.</b> They are about what happens in the real world. Our goal is [...] have people relate to our raps, making it easier to see what really is happening out there. Even more important, what we may do to better our world." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{intention}} of counteracting the [...] "star" [...] cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former rhythm section, Bobby Whitlock as keyboardist and vocalist, Carl Radle as the bassist, and drummer Jim Gordon, with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention {{to show that he}} need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble. During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their album Music from Big Pink, saying, [...] "What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the virtuosity—or pseudo-virtuosity—thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected. The Band brought things back into perspective. The priority was the song." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{was typical}} of his era, James {{recorded}} various styles of music – blues, spirituals, cover versions and original compositions – frequently blurring the lines between genres and sources. For example, [...] "I'm So Glad" [...] was derived from a 1927 song, [...] "So Tired", by Art Sizemore and George A. Little, recorded in 1928 by Gene Austin and by Lonnie Johnson (Johnson's version was entitled [...] "I'm <b>So</b> <b>Tired</b> <b>of</b> Livin' All Alone"). James's biographer Stephen Calt, echoing the opinion of several music critics, considered the finished product totally original, [...] "one {{of the most extraordinary}} examples of fingerpicking found in guitar music". Several other recordings from the Grafton session, such as [...] "Hard Time Killing Floor Blues", [...] "Devil Got My Woman", [...] "Jesus Is a Mighty Good Leader", and [...] "22-20 Blues" [...] (the basis of Robert Johnson's better-known [...] "32-20 Blues" [...] and the inspiration for the name for the English group 22-20s), have been similarly influential. Very few original copies of James's Paramount 78-RPM records have survived.|$|E
2500|$|A {{story that}} haunted Burton {{up to his}} death (recounted {{in some of his}} obituaries) was that he came close to being {{discovered}} one night when he lifted his robe to urinate rather than squatting as an Arab would. It was said that he was seen by an Arab and, in order to avoid exposure, killed him. Burton denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to his being discovered as an impostor. Burton became <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> denying this accusation that he took to baiting his accusers, although he was said to enjoy the notoriety and even once laughingly claimed to have done it. A doctor once asked him: [...] "How do you feel when you have killed a man?", Burton retorted: [...] "Quite jolly, what about you?". When asked by a priest about the same incident Burton is said to have replied: [...] "Sir, I'm proud to say I have committed every sin in the Decalogue." [...] Stanley Lane-Poole, a Burton detractor, reported that Burton [...] "confessed rather shamefacedly that he had never killed anybody at any time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} {{volume of the}} book A Positively Final Appearance (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an {{autograph}} to a young fan {{who claimed to have}} watched Star Wars over a hundred times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film because [...] "this {{is going to be an}} ill effect on your life". The fan was stunned at first but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness is quoted as saying: [...] "'Well', I said, 'do you think you could promise never to see Star Wars again?' He burst into tears. His mother drew herself up to an immense height. 'What a dreadful thing to say to a child!' she barked, and dragged the poor kid away. Maybe she was right but I just hope the lad, now in his thirties, is not living in a fantasy world of second hand, childish banalities." [...] Guinness grew <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from Star Wars fans without reading it.|$|E
