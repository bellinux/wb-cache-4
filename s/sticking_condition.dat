30|$|The joints {{fabricated}} using STC and TAC pin profile, {{using both}} cooling medium, resulted in defects at the stir zone. The plain, featureless surface area offers lower friction over the plasticized material which promotes slipping condition. In addition, the featureless surface cannot direct the material flow intensively. Palanivel et al. {{reported that the}} plain taper surface results drop in frictional heat because of lower heat generation during sliding over <b>sticking</b> <b>condition</b> (Palanivel et al. 2012). Thus, an insufficient heat state is prevailing in the SZ while using the above two pin profiles.|$|E
30|$|In this investigation, the defect-free joints were {{achieved}} while using THC and TTC pin profiled tools in both {{air and water}} cooling medium. During each rotation of the tool, the threaded profile extrudes cylindrical sheets of material around the tool pin from AS to RS and from RS to AS. The peaks and valleys of threaded pin profile offer more friction over the plasticized material which promotes <b>sticking</b> <b>condition.</b> Thus, the extent of heat generation and plasticization is sufficient to attain the balance state of heat and material flow. In general, the defect is formed in the weld periphery, i.e. the transformed layers around the tool pin. So, the pin profile should capable of forming sufficient transforming layers. By creating enough transforming layers by plasticization and shearing of materials, the threaded pin profiles (THC and TTC) are capable of resulting sound joints.|$|E

The Polycrystalline BoroNitride- Tungsten Rhenium (PCBN-WRe) hybrid tool was modelled with the workpiece in a fully <b>sticking</b> <b>condition.</b> The viscosity of stainless steel was calculated from the flow stress equation taken from a previous study of hot working carried out {{in a range of}} temperatures between 800 oC- 1200 oC and strain rates 0. 001 s- 1 to 5 s- 1. The model predicted the temperature distribution in the Stirred Zone (SZ) for three welding cases including low, intermediate and high rotational speed/traverse speeds. The model also predicts that localised melting may occur if the tool rotational speed exceeds 400 RPM. Finally, the model suggested a larger probe (12 mm diameter at the shoulder base and 5. 8 mm length) with a stationary shoulder would prevent the localised melting and allow an increase in welding speeds without the associated introduction of stagnant zone related weld defects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{fundamental}} problem of elastic–plastic normally loaded contact between a deformable sphere and a rigid flat is analyzed under perfect slip and full <b>stick</b> <b>conditions</b> {{for a wide}} range of the sphere mechanical properties. The effect of these properties on failure inception is investigated by finding the critical interference and normal loading as well as the location of the first plastic yield or brittle failure. The analysis is based on the analytical Hertz solution under frictionless slip condition and on a numerical solution under <b>stick</b> <b>condition.</b> The failure inception is determined by using either the von Mises criterion of plastic yield or the maximum tensile stress criterion of brittle failure. For small values of the Poisson’s ratio the behavior in stick, when high tangential stresses prevail in the contact interface, is much different than in slip. For high values of the Poisson’s ratio the tangential stresses under <b>stick</b> <b>condition</b> are low and the behavior of the failure inception in stick and slip is similar...|$|R

These craft was fitted with stephull form in different location on longitudinal flat bottom (stepedhull planning craft) {{to determine the}} influences of sticking and porpoising motion performances. These motions are usually occured when the craft start to take-off from water surfaces. The test models with scale of 1 : 7 were comprised of 4 (four) stephull models and 1 (one) non-stephull model as a comparative study. The hydrodynamic tests were performed with craft speed of 16 – 32 knots (prototype values) in Towing Tank at UPT. Balai Pengkajian dan Penelitian Hidrodinamika (BPPH), BPPT, Surabaya. The resistance (drag) was measured by dynamo meter and the trim of model (draft changing at fore and aft of model due to model speed) was measured by trim meter. By knowing the value of model trim, the wetted surface area can be determined. Then, the lift forces were calculated based on these measured values.

The viscosity of steel plate was represented as a non- Newtonian fluid using a flow stress function. The PCBN-WRe hybrid tool was modelled in a fully <b>sticking</b> <b>condition</b> with the cooling system effectively represented as a negative heat flux. The model predicted the temperature distribution in the stirred zone (SZ) for six welding speeds including low, intermediate and high welding speeds. The results showed higher asymmetry in temperature for high welding speeds. Thermocouple data for the high welding speed sample showed good agreement with the CFD model result. The CFD model results were also validated and compared against previous work carried out on the same steel grade. The CFD model also predicted defects such as wormholes and voids which occurred mainly on the advancing side and are originated due to the local pressure distribution between the advancing and retreating sides. These defects {{were found to be}} mainly coming from the lack in material flow which resulted from a stagnant zone formation especially at high tra- verse speeds. Shear stress on the tool surface was found to in- crease with increasing tool traverse speed. To produce a “sound” weld, the model showed that the welding speed should remain between 100 and 350 mm/min. Moreover, to prevent local melt- ing, the maximum tool’s rotational speed should not exceed 550 RPM...|$|E

Actually, this force is present not just in powders, but in sand and gravel, too. However, in such coarse granular materials the weight and the inertia of the individual grains are {{much larger than the}} very weak Van der Waals forces, and therefore the tiny clinging between grains does not have a dominant effect on the bulk behavior of the material. Only when the grains are very small and lightweight does the Van der Waals force become predominant, causing the material to clump like a powder.

40|$|The Damen Twin Axe Fast Crew Supplier (FCS) 2610 is an {{offshore}} wind farm maintenance vessel that can safely and efficiently transfer mechanics between land and a wind farm. The thesis {{objective is to}} research the operational capability of the FCS by gaining insight into the push docking procedure of the transfer process. To keep the vessels bow steady and in position against the wind turbine tower during push docking, a fender {{is placed on the}} bow. Currently, it is not clear which phenomena play a role in making the fender stick or slip. This makes the fender a bottleneck in the relatively low operation profile, leaving room for improvement. In the push docking procedure condition, the FCS is pushed against the turbine tower using thrust generated by the drive train. The fender provides friction between the vessel and the tower. Disturbances by the environment, like waves, cause the bow to either slip or stick along the tower. An unexpected or long distance slip makes it unable for the mechanics to transfer from the FCS to the turbine tower. The objective of this research firstly is to gain insight in the interaction between the fender and FCS’s motion behaviour and its influences on the friction performance – the obstruction of the sliding motions between the fender and wind turbine. A second objective is to develop a prediction method to define safe transfer operations based on the fender-vessel friction performance in a yearly described sea – the operability. By use of calculations and simulations – in which boat, fender and environment are represented as real life components – two models are built that provides a description of the sea behaviour of the FCS and simulates the slick/slipping process of the fender against the wind turbine. In both models irregular head waves are described by a Jonswap spectrum. Model 1 merely represents the <b>stick</b> <b>condition</b> by using a frequency domain approach, in which the FCSs bow is ‘hinged’ against the turbine tower by springs in horizontal, (transversal) and vertical direction. Model 2 describes both <b>stick</b> and slip <b>condition,</b> describing the vessel motion interaction in the time domain. The fender is described by separate components, combining a ‘negative deflection’ based reaction force, a linear spring system and a (modified) coulomb friction block simulating the stick/slip phenomenon. Both models were validated in <b>stick</b> <b>condition</b> with results from towing tank tests. To define safe transfer possibilities, a condition check method judges the simulation conditions to be either safe or to be unsafe for transfers. With this the yearly ability to perform maintenance – operability – is determined. Based on the results of the sensitivity study, several influential design parameters can be identified. During <b>stick</b> <b>conditions,</b> in vertical direction a less stiff fender, higher static friction coefficient and increased thrust results in an increased operability. During <b>stick</b> and slip <b>conditions,</b> the thrust force has a major influence, higher thrust means an increasing operability. The dynamic friction coefficient is concluded to have less influence. The non-linear model causes the operability to be non-linear. In addition the operability is highly influenced by the simulation parameters (most important the friction slope) and the safety restrictions of the condition checker. These are both unknown but arbitrary chosen for this thesis. Therefore further investigation into these parameters is required to provide an accurate description of the yearly operability.

40|$|Friction surface {{cladding}} (FSC), {{a relatively}} new solid state surface modification technique, was developed to deposit thin metallic layers onto substrates to protect the substrates from chemical corrosion. The FSC process employs a specially designed rotating tool containing an opening as the supply channel of the clad material and a specific tool bottom to support the material flow. The objectives of the current thesis are {{to carry out a}} systematic analysis of the FSC process, to develop appropriate process models and to determine a FSC process window. The various series of experiments presented in this work show that defect free layers can be manufactured within a large range of process parameters. The heat input of the FSC process is estimated using a 3 D thermal model. A 2 D axisymmetric thermo-mechanical model indicates that the heat generation increases with the tool rotation rate and the clad layer width, whereas the clad layer thickness {{and the size of the}} tool opening have negligible influence. The normal force exerted on the substrate decreases for larger values of the clad layer thickness, the tool opening diameter and the tool rotation rate, but it increases with larger clad layer widths. These results confirm approximately the experimental trends observed and supply further understanding of the FSC process. A quantitative comparison of the experimental and model results shows that the thermo-mechanical model overestimates the estimated heat generation and it underestimates the measured normal force, mainly ascribed to the assumed full <b>sticking</b> <b>conditions</b> at the tool-clad layer interfaces. Better comparison was obtained if the <b>sticking</b> <b>conditions</b> vary from full sticking in a region close to the FSC tool opening to almost full slipping at the FSC tool edge. Additional experiments were performed to determine the FSC process window by adjusting the tool rotation rates in the cladding phase. It is found that continuous and defect free layers can be deposited with the substrate temperature between a lower and an upper bound of 317 ℃ and 407 ℃, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Sticking and caking {{of dairy}} powders during {{processing}} and storage {{is a serious}} problem in the dairy industry. The mechanisms for sticking and caking in dairy powders were identified. In high fat powders, fatty liquid bridges form between adjacent particles when the powder is exposed to temperatures where the milk fat is molten. If the powder is later exposed to temperatures where some of the milk fat can crystallise, then the bridges between the particles partially solidify, giving some strength to the powder. The mechanism was shown {{to be related to the}} amount of surface fat that solidifies during cooling, after the powder has been exposed to higher temperatures. Amorphous sugars were also shown to be responsible for the sticking and caking of dairy powders. Stickiness occurs when the glass transition temperature of the powder is exceeded. Above the glass transition temperature, the viscosity of the amorphous glass reduces allowing flow of amorphous material and the formation of bridges between adjacent particles. This mechanism was shown to be viscosity related and the rate of sticking was found to be dependent on the amount that the glass transition temperature is exceeded by, not the temperature and humidity conditions required to achieve this. This mechanism was shown to hold for amorphous glucose, galactose, sucrose, maltose and fructose. Previous work has shown this to be the case for amorphous lactose. A model was developed for predicting <b>sticking</b> <b>conditions</b> in dairy powders. This model required methods for predicting the isotherms and glass transition temperature profiles for multicomponent powders. It was found that the isotherm can be predicted from the weighted addition of the components isotherms.
