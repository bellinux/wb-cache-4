5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualifications.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons why the {{government}} may wish to increase the school leaving age, considering it has raised the age numerous times over the 19th and 20th centuries, the last time being in 2015. With past age raisings, the reasons given have been focused mainly on generating more skilled labour by providing additional time for students to gain additional <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualifications.</b> In recent years, {{it became apparent that}} most 16 to 18 year-olds have not been motivated to continue their education after completion of their GCSEs, thus increasing the overall unemployment rate given many are unable to find work. The British government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of 17 by 2013 and 18 by 2015, it could change this.|$|E

25|$|In Germany every {{federal state}} {{has its own}} civil {{protection}} laws thus they have different rank systems. Additionally {{there is a difference}} between a rank and an official position. This is founded on the military traditions of the fire departments. Every firefighter can hold a high rank without having an official position. A firefighter can be promoted by years of service, training <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualifications.</b> Official positions are partly elected or given by capabilities. These conditions allow that older ordinary firefighters have higher ranks than their leaders. But through this ranks are no authorities given (Brevet).|$|E

In {{the absence of the}} CDC, the Lassa ward was supported by Merlin, a medical relief agency based in the UK. According to Nicholas Mellor, co-founder of Merlin, [...] "Conteh worked with Merlin to get a new laboratory built that would enable collaboration with international research centres with an interest in haemorrhagic diseases. He also worked on training and Lassa fever awareness campaigns." [...] Conteh's Lassa fever program [...] "provided the blueprint for many experts". In 1996, Daniel Bausch at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine began working with Conteh and the CDC on research related to Lassa fever.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{exploratory}} study is to reveal employers’ views on problems related to workforce human capital (<b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualification).</b> Where do employers themselves view the core of difficulties with ensuring adequately skilled workforce? Do they assign them to technological and organizational changes (a functional concept of job-specific human capital obsolescence), or do they see these problems {{as a result of}} other circumstances, such as macro-structural conditions or institutional settings? To answer these questions selected employers in mechanical engineering and information technology sectors in the Czech Republic were interviewed. The results show that the employers see the problems: 1) on the side of workforce – insufficient abilities <b>and</b> <b>skills,</b> exaggerated demands <b>and</b> low motivation; 2) as inadequate capacities and capabilities of the organization itself; 3) at macro-level as institutional shortcomings in the initial educational system and social benefits system. The problems related to workforce <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualification</b> cannot be, thus, interpreted only in the functionalist view as job-specific human capital obsolescence, but the formulation of the problems is significantly affected by the institutional framework...|$|R
2500|$|OBE {{has been}} practiced in Malaysia since the 1950s; however, as of 2008, OBE is being {{implemented}} {{at all levels}} of education, especially tertiary education. This change {{is a result of the}} belief that the education system used prior to OBE inadequately prepared graduates for life outside of school. The Ministry of Higher Education has pushed for this change because of the number of unemployed graduates. Findings in 2006 state that nearly 70% of graduates from public universities were considered unemployed. A further study of those graduates found that they felt they lacked, job experience, communication <b>skills,</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualifications</b> relevant to the current job market. The Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) was created to oversee quality of education and to ensure outcomes were being reached. The MQA created a framework that includes eight levels of qualification within higher education, covering three sectors; skills, vocational and technical, and academic. Along with meeting the standards set by the MQA, universities set and monitor their own outcome expectations for students ...|$|E

Measures of these factors are specified in logistic regression models in which the likelihood the organisation invests in on-site (internal), off-site (external) and/or industry training is included as the dependent variable. Results from this analysis suggest that the industry in which a firm operates and use of casual and part-time staff are the most significant drivers of New Zealand employers’ willingness to invest in on-sight and industry training.
