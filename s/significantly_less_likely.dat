25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E

The effects have been extensively studied using multiple methodologies including before-and-after analysis and evaluating comparable neighborhoods with and without local designation status. [...] Recent factual analysis has been conducted by independent researchers {{in a number of}} states, including New Jersey, Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Colorado, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, and elsewhere. As stated by economist Donovan Rypkema, [...] "the results of these studies are remarkably consistent: property values in local historic districts appreciate significantly faster than the market as a whole {{in the vast majority of}} cases and appreciate at rates equivalent to the market in the worst case. Simply put – historic districts enhance property values." [...] In a 2011 study Connecticut Local Historic Districts and Property Values, it was found that [...] "property values in every local historic district saw average increases in value ranging from 4% to over 19% per year." [...] Similarly, in New York City between 1980 and 2000, local historic district properties on a price per square foot basis increased in value significantly more than non-designated properties. [...] Equally important, local historic district property values were found to resist market downturns better than historic non-designated properties. [...] A recent study investigating the data on single-family residential mortgage foreclosures and comparable non-designated neighborhoods found that designated properties were <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to experience foreclosure.

2500|$|Gender {{plays an}} {{important}} role in circular migration. In some countries such as Albania, women are <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be migrants, particularly a circular migrant.

That said, there has mostly been an increase in the involvement of women in circular migration, such as through the increase in the number of female international students and those being recruited into high-skill executive and professional jobs. In many areas, though, women remain at the lower end of the labor market. For example, in Indonesia has a large degree of labor market segmentation, as women tend to work in domestic labor, factory work, and the sex industry. Development in parts of the Middle East and Asia has created a demand for domestic workers, and institutions have been developed that recruit, train, send and place these workers. In countries like Indonesia, the number of women seeking to migrate as domestic workers is increasing exponentially despite cultural barriers and stories of exploitation, so the supply exists to meet the demand.|$|E

In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers. The researchers review results from other studies and argue that the motherhood role exists in tension with the cultural understandings of the [...] "ideal worker" [...] role and this leads evaluators to expect mothers to be less competent and less committed to their job. Fathers do not experience these types of workplace disadvantages as understandings of what it means to be a good father are not seen as incompatible with understandings of what it means to be a good worker.|$|E

40|$|IMPORTANCE: The {{potential}} {{association between}} age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) is uncertain and {{has implications for}} understanding disease pathogenesis, referral, and treatments. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether individuals {{admitted to the hospital}} with AMD were <b>significantly</b> more or <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to develop AD or dementia in the following years, as well as to assess whether people with AD or dementia were <b>significantly</b> more or <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be admitted to the hospital for AMD treatment in the years following diagnosis of dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An AMD cohort of 65, 894 people was constructed from English National Health Service, linked hospital episode statistics from January 1, 1999, through February 28, 2011, by identifying computerized record abstracts for all people with an admission or day case care for AMD. A dementia cohort (168, 092 people) and a reference cohort (> 7. 7 million people) were constructed in similar ways. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of AD or dementia following AMD and risk of AMD following AD or dementia. Rate ratios were calculated based on standardized rates of AD and dementia in the AMD cohort, as well as standardized rates of AMD in the AD and dementia cohort, relative to those in the reference cohort. RESULTS The risk of AD or dementia following AMD was not elevated. The rate ratio was 0. 86 (95 % CI, 0. 67 - 1. 08) for AD and 0. 91 (0. 79 - 1. 04) for dementia. The likelihood of being admitted for AMD following AD or dementia was very low: the rate ratio was 0. 04 (0. 01 - 0. 10) for people with AD and 0. 07 (0. 04 - 0. 11) for those with dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These neurodegenerative conditions may share environmental risk factors and histopathologic features. However, considering AD and other dementia after AMD, their coexistence at the individual level is no different from that expected by chance. Our data also suggest that patients in England with dementia may be substantially <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to receive AMD treatment. Further research is required to determine whether people with dementia receive appropriate investigation and treatment for AMD, as well as identify and address potential barriers...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} the efficacy of a computerised decision aid in patients with atrial fibrillation making decisions on whether to take warfarin or aspirin therapy. Design: two-armed open exploratory randomised controlled trial. Setting: two research clinics deriving participants from general practices in Northeast England. Participants: 109 patients with atrial fibrillation aged over 60. Interventions: computerised decision aid applied in shared decision-making clinic compared to evidence-based paper guidelines applied as direct advice. Main outcome measures: primary outcome measure was the decision conflict scale. Secondary outcome measures included anxiety, knowledge, decision-making preference, treatment decision, use of primary and secondary care services and health outcomes. Results: decision conflict was lower in the computerised decision aid group immediately after the clinic; mean difference ? 0. 18 (95 % CI ? 0. 34 to ? 0. 01). Participants in this group not already on warfarin were much <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to start warfarin {{than those in the}} guidelines arm (4 / 16, 25 % compared to the guidelines group 15 / 16, 93. 8 %, RR 0. 27, 95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 63).

Furthermore, participants in the computerised decision aid group were <b>significantly</b> much <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to start warfarin than those in the guidelines arm.

A comparison group, matched for time at risk but unmatched on other variables, was generated by identifying, for each subject, the next patient to be discharged who had not re-offended by 31 January 1993. Eight of the 40 who went on to be convicted of a serious offence left special hospital with no psychiatric follow-up and for a further five only informal arrangements were made.

Whilst its 'problematic' nature {{is a subject}} of debate, it reflects a pattern of sexual activity which puts teenagers at risk of HIV. Currently one in five pregnant teenagers is infected with the virus. This creates a new imperative to understand teenage pregnancy and the pattern of high risk sexual activity {{of which it is}} one consequence. This was an exploratory study undertaken to investigate factors associated with teenage pregnancy amongst sexually active adolescents in an urban and peri-urban context. The study used a matched case control design, with 191 cases and 353 school or neighbourhood, age-matched controls. Subjects were under 19 years and recruited from township areas of Cape Town. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-economic factors, contraceptive knowledge and use, and sexual behaviour. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between teenage pregnancy and the factors investigated. The results presented focus on relationship dynamics and their association with the risk of pregnancy. Both groups of teenagers had been dating for a mean of {{two and a half years}} and about half were still with their first sexual partner. The partners of the pregnant teenagers were <b>significantly</b> older, <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be in school and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to have other girlfriends. The pregnant teenagers were significantly more likely to have experienced forced sexual initiation and were beaten more often. They were much <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to have confronted their boyfriend when they discovered he had other girlfriends. Multiple modelling shows that both forced sexual initiation and unwillingness to confront an unfaithful partner are strongly associated with pregnancy and also related to each other. We argue that the associations are mediated through unequal power relations within the relationship which are reinforced by violence. We further discuss indicators of greater intimacy within relationships of the pregnant teenagers which may suggest that more of the pregnancies were wanted than was suggested. Both of these conclusions pose critical challenges for health promoters. Sexual health South Africa Teenage pregnancy Violence against women...|$|R

In this analysis we aim to identify key determinants of prescription contraceptive use. Design: Cross-sectional population survey. Data on sociodemographic indices, concerns about the OCP and perceived barriers to access were collected. Setting: Data set constructed from a representative population-based telephone survey of community dwelling adults in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) Participants: 1515 women aged between 18 and 45 ?years Main outcome measure: Self-reported user of the OCP or LARCs (intrauterine contraception, contraceptive injections or subdermal contraceptive implants) in the previous 12 ?months. Results: For {{at least some of}} the previous year, 35 % had used the OCP and 14 % had used LARCs, while 3 % had used two or more of these methods. OCP users were significantly younger, more likely to be unmarried and had higher income than non-users. Overall, 68 % agreed with the statement ‘that taking a break from long-term use of the contraceptive pill is a good idea’ and 37 % agreed with the statement that ‘the OCP has dangerous side effects’ and this was the strongest predictor variable of non-use of the OCP. Intrauterine contraception users were significantly older, more likely to be married and had lower income than non-users. Injections or subdermal contraceptive implant users were <b>significantly</b> younger, <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be married, had lower income and were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to agree that taking a break from long-term use of the pill is a good idea than non-users.

40|$|Family {{firms are}} an {{important}} part of the U. S. economy. Using a comprehensive sample of publicly traded family firms in the U. S. this dissertation looks into various aspects of their corporate structure. Specifically, this dissertation studies the industry distribution, capital structure choices, and performance and survival after Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 of family firms. The chapter on industry distribution presents evidence that family firms are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to exist in industries where the optimal firm size is larger and more likely to exist in industries with greater amenity potential. Moreover, they are more likely to exist in more mature industries, <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to exist in industries with more growth opportunities, and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to exist in industries with more volatile earnings. The evidence suggests that families choose to set up their companies in industries that require less wealth for control and in industries with less risk, which is consistent with families' higher risk aversion compared to atomistic shareholders. The chapter on capital structure choices presents evidence that family firms carry more debt on average than non-family firms. This is consistent with the agency argument that large shareholders are able to better monitor the company and reduce the agency costs of free cash flow; and therefore, increase the capacity for debt financing. There is also evidence that family firms borrow <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> of highest and lowest priority debt and significantly more of debt with intermediate priorities than non-family firms. This is consistent with higher risk aversion of families compared to atomistic shareholders. Furthermore, family firms carry <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> short-term debt and significantly more long-term debt. Moreover, they hold <b>significantly</b> <b>less</b> cash and short-term securities while they pay out significantly more of their earnings as dividends. The chapter on performance and survival presents evidence that family firms significantly outperformed non-family firms during the 2. 5 years before Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and this outperformance disappeared during the 1. 5 years after the Act. There is also evidence that family firms were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to delist from exchanges after the Act irrespective of whether the delisting was via acquisition or via other reasons...|$|R
