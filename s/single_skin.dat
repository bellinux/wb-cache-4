5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a <b>single</b> <b>skin.</b> Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
25|$|The last formal {{inspection}} in 1992 revealed little {{damage to}} the riveted steel hull; although a <b>single</b> <b>skin</b> hull no longer complies with current regulations, she has been granted an exemption {{on the grounds of}} historical importance. The higher quality of steel produced in 1899 no doubt also played a part - after placing the vessel in a dry dock at Monkey Bay in May 2009, marine engineer Pieter Volschenk concluded that more recently constructed ships looked in worse condition after only twenty years at sea. In January 2012, she was brought ashore for the continuing restoration work.|$|E

60|$|The skin of {{the silver}} fox--so called from a slight {{sprinkling}} of pure white hairs covering its otherwise jet-black body--is the most valuable fur obtained by the fur-traders, and fetches an enormous price in the British market, so much as thirty pounds sterling being frequently obtained for a <b>single</b> <b>skin.</b> The foxes vary in colour from jet black, {{which is the most}} valuable, to a light silvery hue, and are hailed as great prizes by the Indians and trappers when they are so fortunate as to catch them. They are not numerous, however, and being exceedingly wary and suspicious, are difficult to catch. It may be supposed, therefore, that our friend the accountant ran to secure his prize with some eagerness.|$|E

60|$|The most {{valuable}} of the furs {{mentioned in the}} above list {{is that of the}} black fox. This beautiful animal resembles in shape the common fox of England, but it is much larger, and jet-black, {{with the exception of one}} or two white hairs along the back-bone and a pure white tuft on the end of the tail. A <b>single</b> <b>skin</b> sometimes brings from twenty-five to thirty guineas in the British market; but, unfortunately, they are very scarce. The silver fox differs from the black fox only in the number of white hairs with which its fur is sprinkled; and the more numerous the white hairs, the less valuable does it become. The cross fox is a cross between the black or silver and the red fox. The red fox bears a much inferior fur to the other kinds; yet it is a good article of trade, as this species is very numerous. These four kinds of foxes are sometimes produced in the same litter, the mother being a red fox. The white fox is of less value than the red, and is also very numerous, particularly on the shores of Hudson Bay. The variety termed the blue fox is neither numerous nor valuable. It is of a dirty bluish-grey colour, and seldom makes its appearance at the Company's posts.|$|E
60|$|The cold daily increased, and Godfrey {{began to}} feel much the want of warmer clothing. However, on the eighth day the Ostjaks brought in two suits. They were the joint work of {{the women of the}} village. As the Ostjaks were greatly pleased at the {{quantity}} of food coming in daily, which ensured them a sufficiency of meat throughout the winter, in addition to their own stock of fish, the work was well done. For each a closely-fitting shirt had been made of the squirrel skins they had brought down with them, with the fur inside. The trousers were of red fox-skin, with the hair outside. The upper garment was a long capote of the same fur, reaching down to the ankles, and furnished with a hood covering the head and face, with the exception of an opening from the eyes down to the mouth. In addition to these, was given to each as a present a pair of Ostjak boots. These were large and loose. They were made of goat-skins, rendered perfectly supple by grease and rubbing, and with the hair inside. They came up to the thighs, and had a thick sole made of layers of elk-hide. There was also for each a pair of socks of squirrel's skin, with the hair inside, and a pair of fingerless gloves of double skin, the fur being both inside and out, except in the palm, which was of <b>single</b> <b>skin,</b> with the fur inside.|$|E
6000|$|Smoking Hides.--Mr. Catlin, {{speaking}} of the skins used by the N. American Indians, says that {{the greater part of}} them [...] "go through still another operation afterwards (besides dressing), which gives them a greater value, and renders them much more serviceable--that is, the process of smoking. For this, a small hole is dug in the ground, and a fire is built in it with rotten wood, which will produce a great quantity of smoke without much blaze, and several small poles of the proper length stuck in the ground around it, and drawn and fastened together at the top (making a cone), around which a skin is wrapped in form of a tent, and generally sewed together at the edges to secure the smoke within it: within this the skins to be smoked are placed, and in this condition the tent will stand a day or two, enclosing the heated smoke; and by some chemical process of other, which I do not understand, the skins thus acquire a quality which enables them, after being ever so many times wet, to dry soft and pliant as they were before, which secret I have never seen practised in my own country, and for the lack of which all our dressed skins, when once wet, are, I think, chiefly ruined." [...] A <b>single</b> <b>skin</b> may conveniently be smoked by sewing the edges together, so as to make a tube of it: the lower end is tied round an iron pot with rotten wood burning inside, the upper end is kept open with a hoop, and slung to a triangle, as shown in the figure.|$|E

50|$|The wing may be {{a single}} or double skin unit. A <b>single</b> <b>skin</b> wing uses the same {{material}} for structure and holding the air, while a double skin arrangement uses an airtight bladder in a structural casing of strong but porous textile. <b>Single</b> <b>skin</b> construction is simpler, and usually uses RF welding to make the seams. These bladders are usually lighter and dry out more quickly than double skin wings, but if the bladder is punctured, a new bladder is relatively easily fitted to a double skin wing, while repair of the <b>single</b> <b>skin</b> bladder may not be practicable, depending on material and construction details. <b>Single</b> <b>skin</b> wings are also easier to decontaminate, particularly if the outer surface is smooth.Single skin wings may use a bellows fold gusset to increase inflatable volume while retaining a relatively compact outline. This can reduce drag while swimming when the bladder is deflated.|$|E
